344507395	Bipolargnome	2013-02-13 11:50:37	I cant stand Paul Ryan- he is so disrespectful to the elderly, his clothing doesnt fit and he seems so sketchy #SOTU
344507395	Bipolargnome	2013-02-13 11:48:46	@unsuicide it'll prolly take a year to get a new shrink (on medicaid) but if I word it just right I think I can keep myself off the ward

344507395	Bipolargnome	2013-02-13 10:37:17	@unsuicide ive tried earlier and I still stay up til 2-3am. no tv or anything and still nothing til then. My body took a stand I guess
344507395	Bipolargnome	2013-02-13 10:36:36	@unsuicide i actually spoke to my pdoc (trust him unlike my shrink) and he wants me 2 get a sun lamp- been looking for one that is affordble
