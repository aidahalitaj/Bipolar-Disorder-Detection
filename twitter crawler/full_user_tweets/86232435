86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-19 06:38:34	@zestylime that's right up his alley. A bottle would be perfect!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-19 06:30:29	@zestylime on occasion, but only the main brew.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-19 01:35:54	@mmdahlia27 omg you're a champ, thank you! dm me and we'll sort the details!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-19 01:30:47	@mmdahlia27 ooo, that's one I've never seen out here!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-19 01:29:27	@mmdahlia27 problem is that you can't ship alcohol commercially to individuals to PA. You can ship gifts to friends though!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-19 01:28:11	@mmdahlia27 he likes most things, as long as they're good! He brews a lot of darker beers and hoppier stuff, but will also enjoy what I like
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-19 01:04:32	If you have something awesome (or named after a walrus) I'll pay for it and materials/shipping by whichever format you like!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-19 01:01:39	I've had some success driving out of state, but it's mostly just a lot of the same regional stuff and I can't keep driving 2 hours on hunts

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-18 01:39:04	@ohnikkers my exact reaction.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-15 13:26:55	@chidorme the best rec possible: I've had to purchase eight copies because people refused to return it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-15 13:25:19	@chidorme also I'm in for the next one that won't overlap with Very Big Academic Deals.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-15 13:24:07	@chidorme if you ever get around to Shades of Grey (NOT 50 thereof) I'm so in, it is my absolute favorite book.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-14 22:48:21	@ohnikkers @ljsgrace blaming, thanking, all the same right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-14 22:12:34	@quarantedeux the downside is because it was the invisible stuff, it doesn't look like I did much for all that work. Bah.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-14 22:11:35	@quarantedeux I just did a similar thing. I unfucked all my invisible corners and tried to get a handle on storage
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-14 13:00:52	@ljsgrace I have only @ohnikkers to blame for that one

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-12 10:59:43	I can kind of see my breath I guess it's time to crawl out from the blankets and turn the heat on at long last.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-12 10:58:20	@mizujada everyone seems to gloss over that giving nothing is so hideously unethical unless the standard of care is absolute shit

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-10 02:55:26	Probably the old guy shouldn't have asked us why going co-ed was such a huge deal. Rookie mistake, dude.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-10 02:54:01	The poor physicians, they couldn't figure out how their attempt to show off their pedigrees went so horribly wrong once we got started :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-10 02:52:18	At lunch: oldest physician starts asking everyone where they went to school. Only other woman went third, is a Mary Baldwin alumna

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-10 01:22:07	@ljsgrace That might be it! I think the first time I actually spoke to you you had judic letters for me and were wearing a green coat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-10 01:17:46	@ljsgrace @mizujada did you once have a winter coat that was that color? Maybe it's the bag I was thinking of.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-10 01:17:19	@ljsgrace @mizujada @Rachel_Bax I'm with you against the marsala. Eeesh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-10 01:05:57	@ljsgrace @mizujada also, for some reason, you were the first thing I thought of when I saw it last night. Apparently I associate it with u?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-10 01:05:24	@ljsgrace @mizujada yes, yes, yes. I'm with you on this one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-10 00:56:08	@ljsgrace @mizujada It's a little close to the most hideous bridesmaid dress I have, but I really like it!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-09 09:39:58	@Ben_Etc right? This way I get to support content creators! Problem is everyone seems to have moved away from taking donations
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-09 09:31:16	@HOBradshaw I should think that would be possible in DC of all places
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-09 09:30:44	Or they've joined Radiotopia, which thankfully does take donations
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-09 09:30:18	I was going to ask for donations to the podcasts I love for christmas, but everybody's gone off and joined for profit networks. Blargh!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-09 03:55:42	@GainesOnBrains cats are always funny! Defo just not paying attention
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-09 03:50:22	@GainesOnBrains that remains a mystery for the ages.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-09 03:48:05	@GainesOnBrains they'll just watch it later on media site! Seriously like half of them never even go to lectures at all

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-06 14:02:07	@sarking wow, I didn't know there were more hardcore CJ/Danny shippers than me, but clearly there are.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-06 13:28:07	@Ben_Etc @mmdahlia27 I'll have to hunt down the ad they ran in our market tonight. V feminine-phobic, went out of the way to avoid 'haircut'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-06 07:43:09	Today in fragile masculinity: @SportClips . Because getting a haircut is too feminine, you need a sport-laden MVP Experience.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-06 07:21:21	I'm glad everyone has caught on that I'm all about Hamilton but the next person to send me that stupid Rudolph thing is getting an earful

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-06 02:22:32	@chidorme @Ben_Etc also points to South Cackalacky. Worst is obvi all the redesigned confederate flags in the south.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-06 02:19:49	@chidorme @Ben_Etc DC isn't a state, but that's a top-notch flag.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-04 22:32:13	@zestylime personally I think this is more of an indictment of how awful the B1G divisions are to put all your best teams in one.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-02 12:50:20	Is it fundamentally wrong to send your cat to bed without dinner? Asking for a friend.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-01 05:54:42	@sarking @msbshoshani Oh. That's not a great balance. So basically you get season six?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-01 05:52:40	@msbshoshani @sarking A little, but the Charles box was one that was better than the one he came in, so I don't mind it as much.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-01 05:51:39	@msbshoshani @sarking So true. But stache BJ subdivides the Frank/Charles and Radar time points, so I don't use it as a which season marker
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-12-01 04:20:21	@ljsgrace @chidorme MB never seemed large enough to justify the conversion to university, but I might be missing a critical structural thing
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-30 23:50:31	@msbshoshani they're never gonna stop until you make em drop and burn em up and scatter their remains
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-30 22:01:57	@sarking I have that discussion every goddamn time I crack open my dvds. Every. Goddamn. Time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-30 22:00:33	@sarking I have a three-question process. Trapper or BJ? Frank or Charles? Radar y/n? If necessary, narrow by desire to see Freedman.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-26 12:11:31	@chidorme I'm explaining to my cat how awesome the extensive details in the Muppet costumes are
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-26 12:10:39	@chidorme it's the perfect balance of heartfelt songs and hella snark, with the absolute bare minimum fourth wall. Perfection.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-26 12:05:50	It might be this empty six pack but I'm pretty sure Muppet Christmas Carol is the perfect movie.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-23 06:32:40	@HOBradshaw @chidorme at some point my teach was convinced that I was reading the books right away and just forgot by the time we discussed

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-23 06:30:40	@chidorme (thank you for tipping off this chain of thought, my 10 year reunion is this weekend and I wholly forgot what a lit nerd I was)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-23 06:27:14	@chidorme I had one for three years, she'd give me her books and ask what I thought. There's no better gift for your most bookish student

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-23 06:15:31	@chidorme what a goddamn set of phenoms populated our english department. If I spawn, I want that for them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-23 06:13:55	@chidorme 95% sure there was a message (except for the other five AP books). And a surprising one for a catholic school!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-23 06:12:04	@chidorme In summers of HS we read in order- Anthem, 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New Word (and like five others). One hell of a trend.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-18 23:18:53	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 also a fan of that. Spread the sales and spread out the in store madness over more hours = safer times
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-18 23:16:29	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada I got hit in the head with a shopping cart once. Shit was crazy. I vastly preferred getting bonus pay to be there thur
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-18 23:14:56	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada the door-breaking frenzy we had at the toysaurus when we opened at 4 am always had me scared for my safety
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-18 23:13:46	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada as former retail, I'm 100% a fan. I never felt safer than the first time we opened at 6pm on Thursday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-18 09:29:20	@chidorme No worries! Godspeed into that not good night
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-18 09:24:21	@chidorme make sure to follow up multiple times, I (and several friends) have all been burnt with account balance fees after leaving them

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-18 06:09:52	@darthraydor ughhhhhhhhh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-16 21:52:30	Clearly the universe understands the kind of week I'm having to deliver me two in-depth Lin-terviews from my usual podcasts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-16 06:30:51	@chidorme @ljsgrace although lbr the extent of my facebooking today was celebrating my pnp baby's new job.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-16 06:26:06	@chidorme @ljsgrace Oh, most absolutely.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-16 06:24:22	@ljsgrace @chidorme Today is one of those days where I want to throttle some of my fellow white women, I stg.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-16 06:23:27	@ljsgrace @chidorme I saw they're adding Publix to the list but I'll bet there are people with no other food option. Will they get shit too?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-16 06:21:12	@ljsgrace @chidorme Or please listen when I explain to you my reasons why X will make my life harder.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-16 06:18:22	@ljsgrace God yes. THIS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-16 06:16:37	@ljsgrace I was telling someone how great macy's backstage is for plus size on a tight budget and got shit for it. Bah humbug!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-16 06:15:18	I can't drive 3 hours for replacements when my work pants die. It's already ridic hard to find plus size clothing. I'm not making it harder.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-16 06:10:04	Look, this grab your wallet thing is great and all but that list has all but one of the stores I can buy clothing in on it so

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-15 12:45:13	Signs it's tech week: I settled into bed with an ice pack on my ankle, a heating pad on my hip, reeking of tiger balm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-14 21:46:34	Today's @WTFpod is with Lin and it's exactly what I needed to get moving this morning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-14 20:17:40	@Ben_Etc save it and shell out for a contrabass clarinet. They're infinitely superior, if I do say so myself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-13 20:51:17	@ljsgrace I'm eyeballing a nasty woman hoodie myself

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-09 14:05:09	The lights must work. The show must go on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-09 14:04:45	In the past, I've leaned on theatre in times of distress. Today, I'm happy I have a show that goes into tech in three days.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-07 05:31:52	There's nothing like shouting "I was chosen for the constitutional convention" while dangling from the ceiling in a completely dark room.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-07 05:28:03	How to fix a Caitlin: give her an afternoon by herself in a theatre to work on the lights with @HamiltonMusical blasting in the background.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-03 11:24:39	@quarantedeux the situation is truly directly
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-03 11:21:18	@tui_talk I find that ratio so surprising
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-03 11:20:56	WHAAAAAT Oh Cubs kids, I feel for you.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-03 09:56:51	@maryrtaylor10 I'm such a sucker for Williamsburg but I'll take Jamestown in a heartbeat any day
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-03 09:52:32	@NatTweetsAtLast @ljsgrace my lungs would beg to differ, but absolutely. Nothing is worse than those little monsters.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-03 09:51:14	@maryrtaylor10 duuuuuuude so fascinating
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-03 09:50:50	@NatTweetsAtLast @ljsgrace tl;dr I did this to myself by going so overboard in an attempt to stop a truly literal massive infestation
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-03 09:49:30	@NatTweetsAtLast @ljsgrace also apply lightly, not in giant fucking handfuls all over the damn place
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-03 09:48:22	@ljsgrace @NatTweetsAtLast I mean, it served it's purpose of killing a great multitude of fleas.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-03 09:47:27	I told myself I was leaving the piles of it around to kill any emerging fleas but tbqh it's just bc it's a bitch to clean up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-03 09:46:02	Protip: if you get fleas, use borax instead of diatomaceous earth and save yourself the never-ending clouds of fine dust over *everything*

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-01 23:37:06	So thanks for that, old grad student. Idk why you left (I tried to leave bc boss took his divorce out on me, doesn't apply here) but whoop
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-01 23:35:55	Now we're stuck trying to sort out the work he was supposed to have been doing and adding it to what we already had planned to do.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-01 23:35:09	Other grad student in the lab has apparently up and quit and moved to another lab. No warning, no notification.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-11-01 23:34:30	@quarantedeux i can't hear out of one ear due to all the bacteria in it singing that phrase to 'everything is awesome'

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-24 12:46:24	@chidorme I had wanted to put it up bc I loved the cover art and it complements my fave 100 bullets that I still have up
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-24 12:44:38	@chidorme that was like the third issue I bought (i hustled to get caught up for 100) and I had zero qualms about letting it go
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-24 12:33:49	@chidorme @naptural_mae probably better than my move of dropping that issue directly into the campfire when I finished it.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 11:34:32	@pineapplecakes I'm so confused. What happened to my slightly better than mediocre handegg team
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 11:32:54	@pineapplecakes yo I'm about to have a heart attack from sheer shock and disbelief
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 11:29:56	@ljsgrace @melduckie all I want in life is the rest of the footage from the boy's road trip to valley forge
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 11:28:37	Holy. What. What just happened.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 11:28:02	WHY DID I GIVE UP MY TICKETS TO THIS GAME
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 11:18:09	@pineapplecakes yeah it's really cold out there maybe free drunk was a smart call
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 11:15:09	@pineapplecakes I stg if this game goes to overtime like it did last time @beaver I'm going to rage
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 11:13:57	@pineapplecakes I gave up my tickets to go to this wedding and I can't decide if that was a good idea or not
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 11:12:51	@melduckie @ljsgrace it's streaming on the pbs website. There's a lot of Hamilton history that could satisfy non-musical fans
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 10:56:49	Wedding drunk was *not* the way to wander into the end of the third quarter of the PSU-OSU game. Dear lord no.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 10:02:48	It's been eight hours and I drank all the drinks how is it still there? Will it ever come off?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-23 09:58:03	The real MVP of this wedding is the matte balm I pulled out the grocery discount bin that's still going strong after only one application pic.twitter.com/C0jJxfshNU
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-22 20:25:40	@madelineab @LizCanTweet if it's fresh, blot with cold salty water and a white cloth. For dried, I use enzymatic cleaners.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-22 14:57:07	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 @ljsgrace I'm celebrating Rocky Horror season. You say there's another holiday?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-22 13:15:48	@chidorme of course!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-22 13:13:38	@chidorme this is the best guide I found. I still use it for ideas and new stitches http://www. embroidery.rocksea.org/reference/pict ure-dictionary/ …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-22 13:12:15	@chidorme I grabbed some cheap thread, needles, a hoop, and started on Wal-Mart napkins with the internet as a guide
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-22 13:11:13	@chidorme I also purposely didn't take up cross stitch because that shit makes me homicidal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-22 13:09:20	@chidorme but then again, I basically just farted around doing this until I started embroidering penises https://www. instagram.com/p/1KNQBHGHjE/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-22 13:07:33	@chidorme I don't remember it being hard to learn at all, but it's been a while. And I learned to quilt young, so it was an easy shift

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-22 08:27:35	@ljsgrace @Ben_Etc yessss the poutine is spreading
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-22 08:25:55	Shout out to @Snapple and their hipster iced tea line for making one caffeine free/rooibos-based. Iced tea get inside me now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-21 11:09:28	Rocky Horror saved my life is such a cliche but it's also the most true thing ever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-21 11:01:53	Ya'll I cried actual tears when Tim Curry started singing tonight and then had to explain his stroke to the table.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-21 10:46:50	@ljsgrace *g* just wait until next week, I'm going full magenta and back to the same place!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-21 08:43:12	Why is the music lacking any kind of rock?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 23:20:37	W/e, it was worth the look on her face when a Ghanaian friend caught the elevator and started chatting about how awesome the set will be
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 23:15:27	Least how I feel when friends get riled up when someone makes a fat comment near me. Let me pick the battles I want to fight.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 23:14:06	I feel like this is the worst kind of ally. Jumping all over stupid unnecessary shit to prove yourself just makes things worse. That's at
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 23:10:09	Or that attempting to cover a majority of your head is something only religious non-white people do?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 23:08:22	Does she see more than two braids and automatically assume it has to be an 'ethnic' hairstyle?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 23:06:46	I went out of my way to keep the braids from being noticed (mainly bc they look terrible) but I can't shake the motivation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 23:02:49	I work in a fairly conservative dress environment (and a lab!) so I pinned the braids down and threw my largest headband over them to cover
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 23:01:22	For Magenta hair, that means 15-20 braids all over my head, going in the opposite direction of hair growth for added volume.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 22:59:57	About appropriation and how I was advancing colonial mentalities by stealing someone's culture. Context: I've got my hair in a set for RHPS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 22:58:29	A weird thing happened this morning and I'm not sure how to handle it. While I was walking in a fellow white lady started yelling at me...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 19:15:28	@Ben_Etc @mmdahlia27 well if I needed something to get me out of bed this morning, a desire for poutine will do it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 19:14:24	@sonacroi @darthraydor seconded
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 13:20:12	@Ben_Etc could totally get behind that as a pickup line. It's all the poutine actually. People should just hit on me with a plate of poutine
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 13:16:46	So looking forward to spending a few weeks with this old and trusty friend. pic.twitter.com/BasX8vBa2W

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 12:11:08	"Now I heard you speaking Latin this afternoon." Hugh Laurie calling Steven Colbert in his joke.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 12:01:52	@chidorme ayooooo team Amish country
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 11:59:38	@chidorme @ljsgrace I'll have to remember to snap a picture next time I'm at wally
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 11:52:26	@chidorme @ljsgrace it's a popular, well-stocked genre 'round these parts!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 11:50:25	Steven Colbert taunting Drumpf with his Emmys is everything I needed after that debate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 10:27:13	@darthraydor damn woman
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 09:20:44	Fuck team, that's the answer I've been waiting for on abortion my entire life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 08:56:52	I have apparently not turned on my tv since the last debate as it's still tuned to Bloomberg. Wow, grad school. You've changed me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 08:53:25	@ohnikkers I was babysitting the other day and he was on sesame street. Trying to explain my excite (and him) to the mom was v hard
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 08:48:45	@tui_talk bless you for this news I would have missed it otherwise
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 08:47:07	This time, my debate self care is the first stage of Magenta hair prep. Finger crossed it's enough. What's yours?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-20 01:16:04	@ljsgrace unless of course she is so self-assured that she just rolls on without any other humans in her own little world
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-19 22:37:21	It's very hard to present at a conference and be taken seriously while doing Magenta hair prep. Those braids aren't grownup friendly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-19 22:36:20	I'm always so happy when I finalize my halloween rocky horror schedule, even if I had to give up a weekend of it this year for research.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-19 10:46:47	@chidorme if sometimes faces and odd runes turned up in her images, it was a small price to pay for solid data and a tidy workspace
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-19 10:44:45	@chidorme she preferred to work then the microscopy room was full of noises and shadows bc w/e it was always left the room clean and sterile
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-19 10:16:03	@ljsgrace for some reason I thought you were working an awful shift and just weren't around. Well done brain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-19 10:14:48	@ljsgrace ohhh! That makes a lot of sense :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-19 10:09:31	@ljsgrace "you do not follow this person" thanks Twitter for letting me know I was on that jam. *sigh*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-19 09:54:01	@ljsgrace I've been wondering why I haven't heard from you in a while. Good to know the answer is accidentally unfollowed and not catastroph

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-06 12:52:42	@chidorme my reaction exactly. I'm so glad I was desperate for more so I read every scrap he wrote in the universe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-06 12:50:32	@chidorme Garth Nix's Old Kingdom Books

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-06 12:46:18	@chidorme I can't even. I've never seen anyone play that kind of long game with a narrative. I'm absolutely astonished.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 20:26:43	@brittania_ @darthraydor this this this. Mine was "be totally delusional or gain 150 lbs in six months" Obvi I didn't want delusions, so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 11:28:00	@tui_talk but it's hard not to hold the same stick to two new installments to long absent old friends released so close together.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 11:26:44	@tui_talk anyway, I'm trying not to directly compare the books bc they're doing two very different things in their universes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 11:15:29	@tui_talk Right? it only makes for a starker contrast of how clunkily she did it in the latest
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 11:14:20	I've never savored a long-anticipated book like this before. I'm only reading a few chapters of Goldenhand at a time bc it's such a pleasure
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 11:10:19	@tui_talk yes this! It's why the paragraph I hit struck me- native, narrative-related rep instead of as adornment of a minor character
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 11:04:47	@tui_talk *glares at tumblr*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 11:03:55	@tui_talk fuck this very brief but very realistic and in-character thing is perfection. Let me know when you're done and we shall salt away!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 11:01:41	@tui_talk THIS IS EVERYTHING I WANTED FROM MY FAVE WIZARDS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 11:01:03	@tui_talk I kept reading and it's Liarel having a frank consideration of herself, her lack of experience, and what she's seen in others.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 10:56:57	@tui_talk man, I'm still salty about gwp. Getting a fresh abhorsen book is just driving home everything I didn't like about it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 10:55:56	@tui_talk page 121 of Goldebhand: in which I rejoice that a ya author found a way to embrace non-heteronornativity without torturous preach
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-05 07:21:39	Someone hold me back from all these smug, superior birth control posts on facebook from my fellow papists.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-01 21:49:21	No nausea, no fucks given, just a desire for better technique for a new expt. Even did it right the first time! I FEEL LIKE SUCH A BADASS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-01 21:45:03	But this morning, I watched a few videos online, printed out an anatomy guide, and taught myself how to harvest spleen and thymus.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-10-01 21:43:30	I've come such a long way in doing surgeries, team. I used to get hella nauseous every time someone started to teach me to take tissue.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-20 01:33:28	@atmodrop I could see it if you're working from just MC, but that's a huge stretch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 16:00:20	@chidorme it turned out I misheard her, she wanted nothing to do with it, so I was stuck. No good deed goes unpunished, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 11:33:28	@chidorme that's usually me! I was trying to get it to the bride's sister (she has downs)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 11:28:43	@zestylime it's a wei of pick for that show, but I do like hearing it every week!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 11:19:44	@chidorme oh good I felt bad for all the other ladies that nonsense isn't happening any time soon
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 11:17:26	#latetweet but that catching the bouquet at a wedding thing is horseshit, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:59:33	@rgay strategically placed torches, stat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:57:27	@pineapplecakes ALL PART OF THE SERVICE also I want to watch it now too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:56:55	@pineapplecakes truth truth I love me some Tricia but those levels aren't even close tbqh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:54:15	@pineapplecakes also for tigh's incredible acting eye
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:52:34	@pineapplecakes somebody hand McD all the awards for that shit.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:47:25	Everyone else portrayed a great character. Tatmas portrayed seven great characters. Get it, girl.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:43:45	YESSSSSS TATMAS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:39:42	@zestylime it's the theme song of Mom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:38:45	God DAMN Allison Janney. God. Damn.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:36:58	@chidorme I'm glad they weren't just fetishizing the dead, found something that was relevant to the tv nature of the night
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:36:03	@chidorme someday my encyclopedic knowledge of his body of work was going to be useful
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:34:02	@chidorme it's a movie, but it was at least made for tv!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:32:56	@chidorme Something the Lord Made. An HBO thing with Mos Def.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:31:18	Yesssss Rickman's lone turn on tv.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:26:29	@brittania_ I'm so torn because I'm so happy they finally discovered genre shows
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:16:31	SHOUT OUT TO THE TECHIES YA'LL
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 10:10:05	No other show is that spectacular after seven seasons. I genuinely miss my sunday nights

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 09:55:48	@brittania_ also fuck Sherlock Luther deserved more
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 09:55:09	@brittania_ this is exactly how I took it YES please

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 08:10:49	@brittania_ magic!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-19 01:07:23	@ohnikkers they're all so meh right now, or they've been out for so long I'm tired of them
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-18 10:43:49	I went to an awkward, probably shouldn't have happened wedding but I got to see so many of my favorite people that I'm 100% down with this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-17 22:21:45	Advisor texted to tell me I'm doing a great job and I can't decide if he's had a stroke or had been abducted by aliens.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-17 22:09:50	@tui_talk I think @Ben_Etc had success with taco tinder?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-17 22:09:05	@NatTweetsAtLast this so accurately describes my life right now. Famingo give me the strength of CJ Cregg!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-17 10:18:56	We're all so grungy in all of our pictures, this will be the best change!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-16 23:40:21	@quarantedeux I'm about 5" too tall for mine, but it's an option, in a real pinch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-16 23:38:30	@quarantedeux my next car will be a station wagon so I can do this
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-16 10:31:56	Related: I want to go to sleep but Jason Aldean won't shut up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-16 10:12:39	Fleamageddon update: still in the tent. Kitten comes home tomorrow, gotta kill 'em all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-16 09:09:05	@pineapplecakes but I could be in the student section during a white out BLARRRRGH
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-16 09:08:40	@pineapplecakes they booked it a year and a half ago. Bride has plans for me to get scores to her during the ceremony.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-16 09:01:35	@pineapplecakes a dear friend is getting married DURING THE PSU-OSU GAME. DURING THE FUCKING GAME. I'M IN THE WEDDING ERRYTHANG IS TERRIBLE

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-16 05:30:51	@atmodrop I FORGOT ABOUT THE TAOBRERO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 22:11:49	So is @DisneyMoana pulling primarily from Hawaiian or Māori mythology? i don't want to judge media coverage unnecessarily.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 22:02:08	@quarantedeux omg me why am i so far away that sounds like heaven
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 19:13:59	@chidorme @LizCanTweet "i don't like girls who wear too much makeup" no, you don't want your illusion of perf femininity shattered by
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 06:00:09	@tui_talk @tuttleturtle42 Probably the same people who giggle when they book flights to Whakatane.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 02:15:06	Really? A whun fact? https:// twitter.com/AIRNZUSA/statu s/776121751264563200 …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 01:52:04	@chidorme @mizujada @KellymC4 THIS. Wait. I'm a massive BSG fan. I have no grounds to stand on here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 01:47:30	@WaltHickey They finally discovered Tatiana Maslany, so there's hope for the future BSGs of the tv world!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 01:42:11	@WaltHickey There seems a bias against acting noms for genre shows (GoT excpeted). Interesting to see where they make up for that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 00:44:47	@quarantedeux bahahaha excellent. that was like the one thing that kept me good as it got worse.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 00:32:08	@quarantedeux it made taking the shit better too, because instead of seething I'd kick into data collection mode where it isn't personal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 00:30:38	@quarantedeux I documented _everything_, wrote down word for word everything he said after an unrecorded brief chat, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 00:27:40	@quarantedeux I ended up needing to record my convoswith him to get anyone to believe the shit he throws and so I could have receipts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-15 00:26:32	@quarantedeux I feel this. I feel this so clearly. My advisor's been drinking from that well too. (although maybe not as deeply)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-14 12:05:19	Today in fleamageddon: I put the tent up in the backyard to hide in because I just. can't. with these motherfuckers tonight.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-14 12:03:51	@halfpress next time I give mine a good scrub I'm sharpieing that on the side.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-14 12:02:04	@quarantedeux there are worse stans to stan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-14 11:52:36	@chidorme memeing people: not always to make fun of them :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-14 11:51:45	I've only been to Indiana three times score one for sense of direction!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-14 11:50:28	@chidorme I want to save this as an image for when you eviscerate asshats with facts and awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-14 11:49:02	Today I drove from Bloomington to Indianapolis without a GPS or a map. I'm so proud of myself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-13 13:43:49	@samcaseys nope nonenow I get to rewatch the fam origin story
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-13 13:42:08	@samcaseys last week I maybe fucked up and kept going through the first four eps of the next season whoops
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-13 13:40:00	@samcaseys TWO CATHEDRALS THO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-13 12:12:42	@AuroraMoorealis based on the well-placed high end movie promo they showed, prolly not. boo.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-11 22:13:28	@ohnikkers I have been wondering this exact thing. Maybe it's an extension of it goes down in the dm?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-11 22:02:22	@maryrtaylor10 next time though I'll make sure to hit you up :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-11 22:02:04	@maryrtaylor10 fingers crossed it's this good in Indiana too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-11 21:59:56	@maryrtaylor10 only briefly :( they had us hop off out on the tarmac and it's so nice outside!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-11 21:35:19	@tui_talk last year, I nominated things and then completely forgot to sign up. Gonna do the whole thing this year!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-11 21:12:44	Shit Chicago you're gorgeous this morning.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-11 10:02:59	@zestylime someone remind me to find the video of 4 year old me shouting "sit on Pitt!" And then dropping into my butt.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-11 10:02:17	@zestylime mcsorley had a good game at least. There's small consolations.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-11 09:59:30	@IAmLazarusJones mine too. It's a living nightmare.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-11 09:58:56	@zestylime *hides head under pile of shame shit from Pitt*

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-11 05:21:06	@Ben_Etc do you have an inherent terror of falling victim to the weakness you ascribe to femininity?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-10 06:34:41	@mizujada Addictive creepy darkness. Damn, I'm typing too many things at once.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-10 06:33:05	@mizujada Ronald Damn Moore, curse his addictive universes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-10 05:45:06	@Ben_Etc take a video, hold it in the air, and you can sit under your own vine too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-10 05:19:30	@Ben_Etc imma send you a fig tree
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-10 05:16:37	@eroconnor wilderpeople is such the best. it's everything I miss about having access to heaps of nz indie films
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 21:23:42	@mizujada @quarantedeux Cantaloupe routinely makes me sick to my stomach and I accidentally ate some this morning so I'm with you guys rn
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 21:20:02	@HOBradshaw I just watched the Danish Girl. I'll have to hunt down passing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 21:18:36	@HOBradshaw @lanebryant before this, I'd've told you their boost plunge is the greatest thing I've ever found. Now, though. Ehh?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 08:53:35	@pineapplecakes that's not his wheelhouse it's a waste of a fine actor. Gimme alladat deadly latino godfather tho
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 08:45:35	@pineapplecakes oh FUCK no
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 08:44:31	@pineapplecakes i'm open to a guest baddie bc he is so delicious evil and well matched for Darth raydor but only as a guest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 07:21:38	@maryrtaylor10 I have thoughts about how much harder I made it for later things (re: unkown school) but I wouldn't have been as well prepped
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 07:17:34	@maryrtaylor10 right? samesauce. The battle is hard enough as it is, but with all that extra baggage on top? Oy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 05:52:25	@lanebryant Just one wouldn't bother me, but all four in a short time has me worried re: my 'this bra will change your life' recommendations
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 05:48:53	@lanebryant I got them during the semi-annual sale. I was able to exchange the first one that broke, but the other three went after 45 days.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 05:43:02	@darthraydor UM YES INDEED THAT IS SACRED TV HISTORY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 05:31:54	@darthraydor HOLY MOTHER OF GOD
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-09 05:31:06	LRT: I identify so much with that and also can't stop thinking about how much worse grad school in the sciences would've been during a draft
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-08 22:58:21	@tui_talk it's what you know though, eh? If you're far from home and blacking out from pain, a little change like that is a big deal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-08 22:52:55	@tui_talk I had the *hardest* time switching to non- applicator ones in welly. It triggered my only bout of homesickness, negl.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-07 11:51:07	Really twitter this a plea for your best underwire-corraling tips.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-07 11:42:02	I'm so disappointed and also in so much pain. Steel is very uncomfortable when it's all up in your armpits. pic.twitter.com/f4HHr5e4Sx
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-07 11:39:40	If I've hyped you on @lanebryant bras maybe reconsider? The underwire steel is popping out already on all four bras I bought this summer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-07 11:29:17	Picked up a new math puzzle book on a whim at the grocery store. Sat down with it four hours ago whoops where does the time go?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-07 10:42:50	@ironsherlock29 when they fight they make the other side panicky with their...total lack or purpose or direction.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-07 10:42:06	@LizCanTweet laptop people are coming to fix it Thursday. The last shoe is the most easily fixed!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-07 10:41:24	@mizujada howell? Upsell. It's something the best cashiers are really good at, and it's not easily automated.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-07 10:40:31	@mizujada I think it depends on the type of retail. Some forms live for the Howell, and that's something robots don't do well.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-07 05:27:20	@mizujada for some things, yes. But there's something about the human skill of a good concierge or retail manager.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-07 05:19:45	Car: still broken. Fleas: still infesting. Laptop screen: busted. FINALLY THE THIRD SHOE HAS DROPPED.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-07 05:16:56	@pineapplecakes as twatwaffle is an essential member of mine.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-06 11:53:03	@darthraydor @pineapplecakes there's zero shandy, lots of killer provenza, and some stellar work by peripherals (morales, Dr. Joe) worth it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-06 11:50:00	@atmodrop @pineapplecakes fuck why are there so many things to consider
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-06 11:47:49	@pineapplecakes @atmodrop anything to bump her up *and* keep her in the murder room plotting with andrea
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-06 11:45:45	@atmodrop @pineapplecakes that has a nice ring to it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-06 11:35:06	@atmodrop @pineapplecakes it worked for Brenda. She should've been a chief by now anyway tbqh

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-06 11:18:10	@atmodrop @pineapplecakes honestly I'd even just take Sharon going to her priest anything just to hear from her.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-06 11:16:01	@darthraydor @pineapplecakes turns out his ties weren't as repellent as we thought

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-05 00:01:29	Anyway, after our chat I'm on a mission to try extra hard to be the human my friends think I can be. Let's do this, today.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-04 23:54:18	An old friend called this morning and was absolutely astonished that I guessed who it was right away.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-04 21:57:09	@troublebun yes, just keep them dry!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-04 21:56:15	LRT: I would stop complaining about PA's alcohol system in a heartbeat if it were handled with half the ingenuity of NH's.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-04 09:53:07	@eroconnor I am instead curled up doing data analysis with an audiobook
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-04 09:52:35	@eroconnor I feel this very deeply
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-04 07:38:11	@roomerholmes if the mice are high, I had to get on their level. Yep that's it.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 21:03:12	@sarking I wouldn't call it victory yet, but I've maybe taken this battle in the war. He mad most of a week to infest the place, sigh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 19:24:54	@sarking eeeep! I'm finally at the 'only or two non-stop fleas per room' stage. Godspeed into that not-good night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 07:37:44	@mizujada I'm guessing it's scale. How serious is what you're treating vs what will you out up with to treat it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 07:37:00	@mizujada mine do almost nothing, but I'd even take bc side effects over ever having to take antipsychotics ever again they were horrific.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 07:30:55	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 @troublebun with supervision I think? I (attempt) to skip 3/4 of my periods as part of my bipolar treatment
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 07:19:53	@mmdahlia27 all my roommates had to change their BC schedules to sync with me or they'd have two periods. I'm a hormone machine
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 07:19:03	@mmdahlia27 @troublebun I was so regular I could even tell you the time of the day my next period would start.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 06:05:17	My feet feel odd and tingly, but the floor flea spray killed ALL THE FLEAS. Fuck it, a little neurotoxicity is worth the end of fleamageddon

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 05:28:50	@troublebun hormones are the. worst. Plus, BC made my periods *less* regular, which just is not okay.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 03:09:34	@mizujada I caught on eventually. That while you were a at thing really messes things up
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 02:55:34	@mizujada wait did something happen?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 02:55:10	@LikeEmmaWithaT is it a fiction thing? have you tried Limetown?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 00:36:29	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes this cuts to something I didn't realize I hold dear
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-02 00:34:09	@troublebun I take mine straight through and my body still ignores it. It's the *worst*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-01 20:01:22	@eroconnor @Sweetbriaredu I once had someone holla at me from a car window with standing at a corner in Georgetown. Neighbors is less creepy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-09-01 10:32:47	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux I turned on my tv and the Tao hotel scene started right after. Finally the universe is going my way

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-27 12:14:14	We're approaching a week of fleas and I stg there's no end in sight. I pulled so many off of derp face McGee tonight. Bah! Humbug!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-27 09:08:41	We still have an hour until we can go back in post-flea bomb. Somebody entertain me?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-27 09:07:32	@LizCanTweet @ljsgrace iPod, you've supposed to image death so much it feels just like a memory. This is where getting it wrong gets you

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-25 11:15:15	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux @sarking stick with the first snotnose brat that hits the wall. He deserves time to grow not kick into crisis
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-25 11:13:58	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux @sarking instead of finding his way into how to dad and finding the great kid he deserves bc of tragedy he'll
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-25 11:13:15	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux @sarking I caught this week's ep on a rerun and I think I've found what bothers me about julio's brat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-25 10:34:58	@labellementeuse @kinkshames man, an I thought snarry was the ship thT went on forever. There's twice as much spn!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-25 05:32:06	@labellementeuse you could always forward it to a new fannish email!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-25 02:23:21	@ljsgrace @melduckie honestly this is a bottle of chardonnay away from the most sbc alumnae tweet possible
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-25 02:21:20	@Rachel_Bax It's bad that my brain just went, 'shit, that's not bad', isn't it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-24 12:21:43	@darthraydor that's some next-level bloodbath right there
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-24 09:53:21	@ljsgrace no but really, it's an important decision!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-24 09:51:52	@tui_talk but my mom used to invite people to large gatherings but not to bring food by saying "just bring a plate"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-24 09:49:23	@tui_talk I needed to have it explained in explicit detail at first
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-24 04:21:52	@mizujada @chidorme I can dig that. Context is truly everything.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-24 04:12:57	@mizujada @chidorme I've been wondering this exact thing about GRRM characters lately.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-24 04:10:55	@ljsgrace so, basically, nothing related to sweet breezy ever changes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-23 12:06:27	@ljsgrace everything is terrible
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-23 10:17:17	@ljsgrace never let your cat get fleas while you're gone for a week and he can infest the place
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-23 09:46:56	Fleas, day three: time to burn this motherfucker to the ground
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-23 04:29:16	@quarantedeux @AuroraMoorealis @pineapplecakes me gusta.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-23 04:26:40	@AuroraMoorealis @quarantedeux @pineapplecakes I think we'll have the second one in spades and I, for one, am so here for it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-23 04:18:42	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes @AuroraMoorealis ayooooooooo. I'm a simple woman with simple needs.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-23 04:16:10	@quarantedeux @AuroraMoorealis @pineapplecakes I JUST WANTED OMINOUS TO HAPPEN TO RUSTY NOT TIME SPENT WITH THE WRONG COUPLE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-23 04:15:51	@quarantedeux @AuroraMoorealis @pineapplecakes Okay but last night I absolutely lost my damn mind at the end of the episode.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-23 04:15:08	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes @AuroraMoorealis Do I ever do anything else? Let's be honest, I'll happily take my bone and run with it :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-23 04:04:15	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes @AuroraMoorealis Wait why I have only hype for this ridiculous mission they're sending Tao on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 22:08:47	@quarantedeux finally all those years as #MajorCrimes resident fetish expert are paying off for Tao.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 22:08:08	@quarantedeux that you did, but I didn't know it would be this relevant!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 21:38:40	@quarantedeux I just saw the teaser for this week omg omg omg
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 13:05:25	@sarking fuuuuuuuuuuuck. He had all last week while I was gone to start a proper hellish infestation
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 13:01:16	24 hours and I'm sick of these motherfucking fleas in my morherfucking apartment. I may also have badness from inhaling too many chemicals.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 12:59:24	@ENbrian holla. That trip got better when everyone fucked off to the front and left us randos to our own devices at the back.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 12:50:58	@ENbrian that was my preferred brand of lunacy, just not my typical loons
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 12:50:07	@ENbrian I want to do it again but with people I want to hang with
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 12:49:18	@ENbrian again, same. I was happy when 1st sem people went home and I could do me again
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 12:46:07	@ENbrian that just counts as being frugal, right? Because same.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 12:43:43	@ENbrian recs?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 12:40:13	@ENbrian tl;dr shared interest >>>>>> proximity
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 12:39:36	@ENbrian internet friends are real and I'll defend them to the death
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 12:36:21	@tui_talk there is no truer fables tweet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 01:08:25	@AuroraMoorealis !!!!!!!!!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-22 01:06:16	Local friends! Have you ever removed fleas from a cat? Would you like to share your experience? Imma need some help with Steven.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-21 13:30:39	There's nothing like coming home at the end of a sixteen hour day to find you've got a flea fucking infestation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-21 06:32:13	@chidorme I routinely get sick right beige I have to sing, so I'm all about covering to get me through. Fisherman's friend is my /godsend/

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-02 07:19:52	@chidorme You're a damn legend. <3 I practically needed handholding through the first season of the X Files. I'm such a lost cause.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-02 07:17:05	@chidorme I'm well and truly fucked then. I won't be able to stay away but I won't get anything out of it. Blargh!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-02 07:14:45	@chidorme @KellymC4 I can appreciate that life. Overactive imagination + lives in an old church w/ dead people outside = low tolerance
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-02 07:13:45	@chidorme tl;dr please don't make me re-live that harrowing experience again, world. Once was enough.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-02 07:13:12	@chidorme Is it? I don't know much about the show (I only narrowly made it through 2/3 of season 2)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-02 07:12:37	@chidorme purely because I wanted to understand why everyone called the godawful steps from town the exorcist steps
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-02 07:11:57	@chidorme I watched the exorcist exactly once, in daylight, and I fast forwarded through everything that wasn't shot at gtown/in my church
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-02 07:03:42	I'm shit terrified just watching the promos. It's going to be a long season.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-02 07:01:52	Aw, man. My overactive imagination's going to have to /suffer/ through this season of AHS because I can't stay away from Roanoke stories.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-01 02:44:41	@chidorme @mizujada @mmdahlia27 @Rachel_Bax maybe also consumerism? Look at this shiny brand new book vs the $5 yard of used books?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-01 02:33:47	@chidorme the gendered switch does add an extra level. And his name fits so perfectly!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-01 02:25:26	@chidorme Bernie face is gendered too, I guess. But it's more specific than the stereotype of a birch?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-01 02:19:02	There's something inherently unsettling about using products and casual references to addiction to offer a line of credit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-01 02:15:01	I got a weird co-branded card offer in the mail yesterday from a major beauty store. It touted products inside and referred to MUAs.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-01 01:39:11	@chidorme what I should have led with: I'm all for pointing out dodgypants mcgee but can we at least point out the correct dodgypants
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-01 01:32:05	@chidorme but without the the huge need, nobody would bother with fancy delivery. the're chasing ease of use profits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-01 01:31:10	@chidorme it's a problem of shelf life. Things that expire quickly cost more because you have less time to sell it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-01 01:24:49	@chidorme it's also a bogus argument. They're essentially mad about the price of packaging. The exact same thing happened to insulin.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-08-01 01:17:57	@chidorme naloxone is a short-acting drug. It's not meant for multiple administrations, it's a stop-gap to get to a hospital for naltrexone

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-28 11:17:33	Although in all honesty, telling a Philly crowd not to boo is like telling gravity not to attract things.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-28 11:13:38	DON'T BOO, VOTE! President Obama is just dropping truth bombs all over this stage. #DemsInPhilly

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-27 07:07:47	@chidorme I'd rather them not pretend something like what the Obamas have. It'd feel false otherwise methings
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-27 07:05:11	@chidorme i've been convinced that's a business partnership more than anything else for years and years now. At least they aren't faking it?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-27 06:15:45	@NatTweetsAtLast "I'm not that kind of psychic!" (as I will be shouting about doctors for the rest of my life)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-25 04:41:47	@melduckie right? Somehow that whole 'you will have periods where you are unable to control your emotions and actions forever' was less bad
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-25 04:27:01	Mental illness is all fun and games until you realize you can't have Reese's anymore. Don't do it, kids.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-24 04:53:39	@quarantedeux WHAAAAAAA fuck yes!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-24 04:50:13	@quarantedeux if they still had outrageous fortune I'd pick it up for that and BSG
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-24 04:49:35	@quarantedeux but since Hulu made everything subscription-only I'm super down on them
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-24 04:47:14	@quarantedeux see also: BSG in this exact situation
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-24 04:46:43	@quarantedeux I mean, I do give fucks and I'm just over here like, 'meh' unless it's the legends of the hidden temple shit

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-23 23:27:23	@ElectricVandal fair point! But it can ease the way a little at gally!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-23 23:22:12	@ElectricVandal that...is indeed weird. But it is the 'murican association for science
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-23 23:19:30	@ElectricVandal not 100% sure if they're still allowed to do that. But again, that's after //years/ of non-use
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-23 23:18:58	@ElectricVandal after years of bo use, some will start taking a few dollars off the total value for account maintenance bullshit
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-23 23:17:29	@ElectricVandal yeah seven months is well before they start taking service fees off the total value. I don't think they're allowed to expire
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-23 21:35:24	@ElectricVandal they don't. Well, it depends on the state, but even still it's over several years

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-22 20:25:18	So many happy returns, @tui_talk ! Have a wonderful birthday! (or what remains of it bc time zones blow)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-22 10:32:13	Context: I was driving down there once and came into a hollow w/2 houses. One had a giant confederate flag (4'x6') the other a nazi flag
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-22 10:26:39	Also mad props to the show for finding the lone, solitary black dude down Delta.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-20 10:59:46	My night: free Paul McCartney show and fireworks from the comfort of my back yard with kitten and private bathroom and free booze.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-20 10:39:24	Side note: @AtlanticBrewing MDI Ginger is excellent with fresh cherries.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-20 10:36:20	If @PaulMcCartney is going to keep me up, I'm sitting on my patio with a beer and a bag of cherries to really enjoy it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-20 00:30:23	@NatTweetsAtLast also, I never forgot how to spell @ljsgrace 's last name :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-20 00:29:27	@NatTweetsAtLast @ljsgrace it worked for me!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-20 00:23:59	@NatTweetsAtLast @ljsgrace this is the *dream* no this really does matter example for orientation. I'm planning it for our new students.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-20 00:17:41	@NatTweetsAtLast @ljsgrace although I continue to not envy my successor, who had still more cases than I did. Poor girl.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-20 00:16:01	@NatTweetsAtLast @ljsgrace I got equal measures of both. But twas the year of joellen and more cases than the previous 4 combined, outlier?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-20 00:11:48	@NatTweetsAtLast @ljsgrace HOLLAAAA. I'm finding comfort in the snark that DG would drop after such a defense

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-19 12:00:53	I'M SO SORRY NEIGHBORS I'LL BE SCREAMING FOR THIS ENTIRE SEGMENT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-19 11:42:54	My ovaries are here for Colbert singing and dancing in glasses.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-19 11:40:39	My thirteen year old cat just nested in my bra and there's still room left over in there. How. Why. Fuck.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-17 22:59:12	@LizCanTweet I have very similar feelings about Shrek the Musical too. Although Shrek tends to have a lot of traditional choreography
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-17 22:22:28	Plus we've realized kids-focused musicals bring in more $ in high schools bc all the associated elementary kids come see it. Win win win.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-17 22:19:52	This rant brought to you by the revelation I had ten minutes into #tarzaningretna last night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-17 22:15:00	The music is Phil Collins so it's not that hard to sing. And you can use silks instead of flying! It's perfect. Why did I judge for so long?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-17 22:13:45	Smallest little seventh grader whose voice hasn't changed yet as bb Tarzan. Being gorillas forces the kids to act, learn choreo, plus
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-17 22:11:40	There are male non-singing leads, lots of featured characters, you can hide a million girls as gorillas, and there's a role for your
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-17 22:09:43	Okay, but hear me out: Tarzan is the perfect musical for a high school
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-07-15 12:07:07	My lab spent the afternoon explaining how Pence is the only way to guarantee Indiana goes hard blue. Guess better to pick locally hated?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-29 22:19:49	@quarantedeux Make sure that Buzz knows what he's asking for, etc. Provenza's not the type to horrify as a means of discouragement.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-29 22:18:46	@quarantedeux the only way i can rationalize it in my brainpans is that Buzz asked for it directly and Provenza was trying to ease him in
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-29 21:23:53	@quarantedeux it's very unlike Papa Bear Provenza to push anyone into this situation
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-29 21:22:05	@quarantedeux I've been wondering what bkg they all had. Maybe Sharon and Andy were more familiar with the case? Tao seemed to be up too

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-20 23:31:18	The trust debate at Sweet Briar was juicy but it pales in comparison to the hoopla that's building over at the Hershey Trust *makes popcorn*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-20 22:59:51	@mizujada @Rachel_Bax it's once she becomes trapped in the political system on her own that she finds a way to slay. Before that, ugh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-20 22:26:24	@mizujada @Rachel_Bax most of s1/book 1 she's still with fam, mostly everything is still chill and she's such a whiny snotnose
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-20 22:22:59	@Rachel_Bax @mizujada snivelling whiny bitches in a world of badass are not acceptable. So glad she grew to badass.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-20 22:20:54	@mizujada @Rachel_Bax she got a ton of hate for many seasons and imho it was deserved. The last two season's she's come into her own.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-17 08:28:09	Let no one tell you that a hustle is a bad idea bc honestly the hustle I'm on is the most motivating thing I've done in ages.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-17 08:20:42	@troublebun okay let's have an objective chat about study design because that's. well. it's a problem here.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-17 04:14:27	@austintichenor (and my brief moment of "wait, which podcast does this go along with?" gets deeper and more confusing)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-17 04:12:54	@austintichenor I was wrong! I thought it was a new ep this week, but they released a panel from a conference. But next week, probably!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-16 23:01:35	Ahahahaha I was so optimistic. Bless you, recent-past Caitlin. https:// twitter.com/funkasarusrex/ status/743251758122598400 …

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-10 08:01:05	@tui_talk it was worth busting out my best kiwi accent for the shock and horror on their faces.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-10 07:51:12	@tui_talk I can't decide if this is worse than someone thinking Lorde's accent was a severe speech impediment.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-10 07:50:37	@tui_talk Right? Not even a 'M-ahw-ee'.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-10 07:47:20	I'm so hype for Moana, but also not hype for fellow americans to talk about it. Just overheard a 'Moh-ANNA' and 'Mah-oo-ee'. Kill me now.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-09 11:49:26	@Ben_Etc also does this ginger cider hold a candle to regular angry orchard with a shot of goldschlager in it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-09 11:48:40	@Ben_Etc and there's the inspiration for my new tinder description. cheers for that!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-08 20:16:27	@petridishes time to stop making kvetch happen. It's not gonna happen.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 09:22:23	@mmdahlia27 meh, I know i'm at the far end of the bra size spectrum.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 09:21:35	@mmdahlia27 protip: look for the wall of only beige. That's your spot, because apparently big boobs can't have pretty patterns
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 09:19:58	@mmdahlia27 also make sure you check the FGH section, they aren't mixed in with the other bras.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 09:19:30	@mmdahlia27 yo you should come chill in our LB's then, everyone has a million FGH in 36/38. Never in 44 tho :(
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 09:12:46	@mmdahlia27 also worth a note: different bras run to different sizes. I wear a 46G in most of their bras, but an H in the boost bras
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 09:10:43	@mmdahlia27 ask them which is their regional store. That'll have a cacique store with it and +++ selection
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 09:09:58	lol in the future, when asked why it took me so long to graduate I will point to the 70 minutes I've spent waiting to get to my email.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 09:08:22	@mmdahlia27 they pull the size from online when it's sold out. What size? You're well off heading into a store if it's within the median
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 08:50:34	49 minutes: still no chrome
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 08:38:09	@roomerholmes oh dear Lord why did I open that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 08:31:43	*turns on computer* *33 minutes pass* *chrome still hasn't opened*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 04:26:39	@chidorme it's the stern edit the novels so dearly needed
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 04:20:41	@GainesOnBrains I have many similar feelings about high functioning BD.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-07 04:15:32	@ohnikkers personally, I love a reeses. But the cookie dough bites are lovely
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-06 21:28:31	@ohnikkers I don't usually but the hints of silver just suck me in
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-06 21:01:47	@ohnikkers oddly, I didn't have a blackfish problem. I was strangely invested in the gray popping up on Jamie's head
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-06 21:00:49	@ohnikkers I am so ready for mcshane as Mr Wednesday after that though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-06 20:31:38	@ohnikkers I was mocked for the teeny noise I made
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-06 10:47:51	@GainesOnBrains that's what mobile devices are for girl
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-05 09:54:21	@ljsgrace I was three people back for standing room tickets! If I didn't need to feed my cat I'd've stayed for tickets tomorrow.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-05 09:43:56	@darthraydor that makes me sad! You know I'm here if you ever have questions or want to burn a math book I've got many you'll have choices!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-05 09:42:40	Well, today was a fun exercise in batshit crazy but it has 100% reaffirmed my faith in the awesome humans you meet while waiting on lines.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-05 00:53:12	@maryrtaylor10 RIGHT I KNOW
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-05 00:51:31	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes those sleeves tho
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-05 00:48:08	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes I was already overstimuated by Hamilton this is just icing on the cake
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-05 00:47:09	@maryrtaylor10 yeah but you got to see it!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-05 00:46:51	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes ALL OF OUR INTERESTS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-05 00:27:18	One of my exes is a YUGE fan of @clppng so getting a snap with @DaveedDiggs at Hamilton is the ultimate poetic justice.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-05 00:19:35	GUYS GUYS GUYS @Richard Rodgers Theatre - Hamilton https://www. instagram.com/p/BGPTCaJGHok/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-04 23:56:34	Also Lin wished me luck on his way in the door right next to me, so that was awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-04 23:55:20	(Why not take a stab at a Hamilton layover on the way home too?)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-04 23:54:39	People are saying how jelly they are of someone's @Lin_Manuel selfie and I'm just over here jelly of his Bartlet for America shirt.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-04 21:07:35	@IAmLazarusJones this conjures several mental image and they're all hilarious
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-04 20:45:23	@darthraydor it's just decimal shifty eyes! Lmk if you're applying to anything similar, I'm happy to help!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-02 00:38:59	@mpgPhD same! Good luck with fun home! Can recommended.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-02 00:35:57	If nothing else, I got to watch the #Ham4Ham !
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-01 23:25:45	@mpgPhD SAMESAUCE. Did you decide on an alternative?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-01 22:48:12	@mpgPhD SECONDED! Thanks for making a team!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-01 22:18:28	@mpgPhD gingers4ham?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-01 22:05:12	@melduckie lbr though a decaf PhD was the worst possible plan I could have made. This life was not made to be lived w/o stims.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-01 22:02:42	Well, it was going to take me all day to get to this conference anyway, so why not plan for a lunchtime Hamilton stop in New York?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-01 21:58:08	@melduckie @troublebun yes, this. My broken brain is such that I'm always BWAA and tired makes me more UP, but I still drag under the mayhem
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-01 21:56:36	I anybody else planning to do the #Ham4Ham lotto as a singleton today and want to pair up?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-01 21:34:31	@melduckie @troublebun can recommend dunkin's decaf hot tea. I just get a cup of ice with it in the summer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-01 21:33:36	@melduckie @troublebun it blows for a while, but you get used to it. Although I eat more sugar than I should to substitute.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-06-01 20:55:44	@tui_talk I hatedit the first time, but the second time i couldn't get enough. See also: L&P

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-30 23:39:14	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes actually i've got lab meeting the next morning so I'll probably be hunched over powerpoint.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-30 21:04:48	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux we're bad at this team
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-30 11:31:39	@Ben_Etc I took another stab and it read out Oklahoma City, Newark, and Tallahassee. I've never been.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-30 09:03:10	@quarantedeux pssh practicalities
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-30 07:51:09	@quarantedeux clearly we're bad at overlapping
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-28 18:35:33	Okay Indiana that was fun!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-28 02:01:24	22 hours in Indiana. Let's see what havoc can be wreaked.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-27 19:41:26	@sarking hi where have you been all my fandom life with these comparisons

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-26 04:19:32	@IHStreet very true! But I'd like to see more examples be focused on human-related issues. GMOs, etc too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 23:57:03	@IHStreet my ideal would be a very basic science-heavy physiology course. teach bacteria, genetics, metab, cell cycle all w/ human disease
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 23:51:16	@IHStreet or that veers quickly from the peas and features the very few truly mendelian human things, like huntington's.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 23:49:28	@IHStreet yes, we should know about other animals/plants but why not make humns the model organism for mostly everything
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 23:47:14	@IHStreet for most kids, hs bio is their last exposure. why waste all that time on topics that won't prepare them for their dult health?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 22:44:05	@IHStreet *wanders back to cell culture hood, muttering under her breath*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 22:43:38	@IHStreet If all I do in life is convince some bio teachers to stop teaching punnet squares and teach some human health genetics I'm good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 22:42:50	@IHStreet yo this is my JAM. Mendel was a bro with a pea fetish, but what he found is basically the exception to the rule for human genetics

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 10:44:16	@ljsgrace it has that little thing he kept off the album for people who see the show in it!!!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 10:29:28	Can confirm: the #Hamiltome is worth it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 08:09:11	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes shit I didn't realize there were two videos SLAY BITCH SLAY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 08:03:15	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes those glimpses we got when she was about to shred Tao and Julio's semi-boo for the info were not enough.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 07:59:51	@quarantedeux bathrobes are chill when a dude is an invalid, but there is NO CHILL when your mom is getting boned next door.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 07:59:22	@quarantedeux still, context is important.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 07:56:53	@quarantedeux bc Rusty boo you've already had bathrobe Andy. Completely different context, buuuut.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 07:55:56	@quarantedeux agreed. It would seem unnecessary in the course of a standard ep. But is this post clots?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-25 05:05:55	@quarantedeux right? Maybe rain doesn't affect things, but if it's -5 out good luck even finding people to be violent against

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-23 05:29:15	@sarking oh hell yes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-23 05:14:00	@sarking no one else will quite understand the shriek I shrieked when I realized Lin and fucking Goldman share a stage on an ep of House
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-23 01:55:22	And what did I get in return? Positive comments about how President Trump could fix TSA. NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED CLEARLY FUCK THIS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-23 01:54:34	Guys I think I just taught my dad how to use the airline website to get flights online. I think he thought kayak was the only option.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-22 22:28:04	@ljsgrace @IHStreet I welcome our feline overlords

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-22 09:35:13	@ljsgrace but it's probably good for me to have some understanding of how the other side rolls
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-22 09:34:37	@ljsgrace I think it's mostly because i've been a sleep deprived zombie for a week and a half and my exhaustion has caught up
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-22 09:30:20	I, raging extrovert, apparently over-socialed my science at the mini-conference and have taken refuge on my couch to watch CSM soliloquize

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 15:42:30	@tui_talk (I'm not salty, just a little out of my mind with sleepiness. Don't mind making pennies when they'll hand me a degree at the end)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 15:41:38	@tui_talk *is still running experiments at 4AM to meet a poster dealine* I don't scratch half that but NOPE DOESN'T APPLY TO GRAD STUDENTS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 12:04:58	Update: (genuinely) accidentally locked myself out of lab on a bathroom run. Drew the doppelganger guard to let me back in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 11:43:15	Michael Paul...oh, you know who I mean.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 11:38:34	Just met a building security guard, he's a dead ringer for Paul Michael Chan. I may need to be stopped ya'll.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 11:04:48	@sarking maybe for the boom booms?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 11:00:29	@sarking Tricia Helfer, perfectly styled for the male gaze?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 10:40:55	@chidorme @mizujada but the higher level classes I took in later years were all equally distributed, BUT in biological sciences. Could be it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 10:40:04	@chidorme @mizujada it remains startling to me, maybe because they were just a week or so apart?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 10:38:29	@chidorme @mizujada both the intro to lab sci class and the rinky little physics class were three girls, 20 or so boys.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 10:37:31	@chidorme @mizujada one summer in hs I did both a major sleepaway g&t camp and a little local daily one, chose science classes for both

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 02:55:52	@Ben_Etc cartoon/comics types and hand animators, probably cheaper than a light box or w/e they are. Then export to Photoshop
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 02:49:16	@Ben_Etc animators and digital artists?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-19 02:22:00	@ljsgrace I haven't gone so far down the Hamilton hole that my first response isn't to start humming a Decemberists song.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-18 05:54:50	@ljsgrace I should maybe sort my priorities if girl scout cookies rank higher than sex as things Im willing to risk an allergic reaction for
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-18 05:49:57	@ljsgrace mildly. Makes my foot eczema bust out. Do I still eat Samoas? Obvi, they're worth the itchy feet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-18 05:48:18	@ljsgrace I picked the most ridiculous nut to be allergic to, clearly. Such usefulness!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-18 03:45:55	@ljsgrace @melduckie A roommate in college tried to convince me it was the border between MD and VA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-17 14:27:53	@tui_talk I misread that at first and was confused about the equestrian development of Auckland.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-13 23:53:24	@quarantedeux legit! Can confirm that at least seven of the places are fantastic. Damn them, bringing my thoughts into question!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-13 23:50:44	@quarantedeux it's a pity, because there's a lot of really good on that list too. Portland, cville, Santa Fe, etc.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-13 22:51:16	Mom teaches anatomy to seniors in high school. I'm so proud of her fights to keep teaching all the science in the reproductive unit.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-09 21:30:47	@ohheyitsal this has become the only thing I didn't care for. She could have been walking to meet him instead of chasing!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-09 21:26:04	@ohheyitsal I am happy they didn't try to squish in another COTW. And that they kicked Peter out of court so we didn't have to see him much
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-09 21:25:08	@ohheyitsal now that i've remembered that, I'be reversed my position and I LOVE it. Also CB's stone cold acting face is my life.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 06:05:02	@chidorme @emmameador Are they asking for the praxis? BC that, at least, is transferable if you leave the state.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 06:01:30	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada I like to think of them as flareups. Like, I was down for pictures and then a cold sore (or depression, w/e)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:55:53	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada Depression ebbs and flows, Mania, schizophrenia, anxiety, they do too (albeit to different extents)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:54:54	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada fuck I got distracted. Anyway, I encourage people to consider that no mental state is an all the time thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:52:30	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada and I would hate to see you suffer like I did bc I didn't understand what was going on and didn't know
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:50:06	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada because mania is, without exaggeration, a living hell that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:48:37	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada And if this is what you're feeling, let me be the first to encourage you to get help NOW and fight for it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:47:42	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada with very little ability to control- "But I liked doing..." "NO WE'RE DOING THIS NOW" "But..." "THING NOW"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:44:58	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada and almost never on a linear trajectory, but bouncing to whatever catches your eye and then bailing for new
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:42:11	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada And while, yes, it's 'Do do do', it's doing without thinking, making impulsive moves hurtling to some Thing
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:40:22	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada and it's a beast of thoughtlessness. Of negative zero consideration for others, yourself, repercussions etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:39:10	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada because while mood shifts are an aspect of many things, mania is a beast entirely of it's own.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:37:59	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada By which I don't mean how nice you are (because you are x1000!), but intent and purpose.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:36:47	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada I think the most important thing to consider are the symtpoms of just straight depression and thoughtfulness
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-05-04 05:34:51	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 @chidorme I've also felt that way, but it was long before my BD onset. I'm just bad at getting started even when manic

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-21 06:06:45	@Rachel_Bax @IHStreet They've looked at it in CB1 and CB2 knockout systems and it still has effect on epilepsy. It's nuts.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-21 06:05:58	@Rachel_Bax @IHStreet Here's the interesting part: CBD is having effects that have nothing to do with the cannabinoid system.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-19 09:12:09	@mmdahlia27 @Ben_Etc @melduckie I loved it until about 12 episodes ago. I just couldn't after that.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-19 04:18:36	@witzseeker @vulture I finally gave up like six eps into this season. I think maybe I'm happy I did that.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-18 12:46:32	@Ben_Etc there are dead people not 100 ft from my door. Between ghosts and a skunk, I'll take the skunk.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-18 12:37:56	And by building, I mean the skunk is the probable source of the weird dripping marks that keep turning up on my front door.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-18 11:33:16	My nose is giving me very strong reason to believe my building has been skunked yet again.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-16 11:17:26	@chidorme recently my life goal has become to make the dollars and commission whoever does nicki minaj's stage bras to make me a full range

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-16 10:58:25	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 I'll concede on bras bc they're a choice for some. But blood containment on insurance yes plz I never considered that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-16 10:22:20	@mmdahlia27 mine are the right size, but they get so worn hauling all this nonsense that they start to disintegrate after seven months or so
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-16 10:20:07	@mmdahlia27 oooh nope. my mom tried to sign me up for match for christmas and she got emails from them all year, heh heh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-16 10:18:04	@mmdahlia27 I didn't have the heart to explain the $40 line isn't for one bra, it's me splitting a new one across several months.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-16 10:17:11	It's been like two weeks and I'm still flabbergasted. I just. What?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-16 10:15:06	On a related note, recently an acquaintance straight-face suggested I stop buying (and wearing) bras as a way to save money in my budget
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-16 10:09:47	@mmdahlia27 right? At least play me, like, Lane Bryant video ads. You know I'm on that site cruisng sales all the damn time, ad trackers.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-16 09:40:43	@chidorme or 75k on Bill Nye. Actually yes. That's where my dollars would go.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-16 09:34:07	@chidorme honestly I'd save my dollars and drop the 400k on Gates or Spielberg.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-16 09:33:24	@chidorme I mean, that's what Leno's fee is, roughly. I'd much rather listen to a Clinton tbqh.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-14 09:50:32	@ljsgrace that is absolutely an announcement worthy of

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-14 09:28:53	@sarking but otherwise, I just want to vote without the nonsense
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-14 09:28:27	@sarking I'm in it for my dad having to deal with local dem candidates turning at their door to see me but no reps to see him.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-14 09:24:24	@sarking And I was so excited in 2008! Lo, those halcyon days.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-14 09:21:31	@Ben_Etc grad school, a summary: I am too poor for this awesome shit
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-14 09:20:18	@sarking two weeks out, shit's about to get real. Can it be the primary now?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-14 09:17:21	@NatTweetsAtLast @chidorme that poor cat is the real star
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-14 09:15:29	@Ben_Etc still not helping

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 19:40:43	@emmameador I found I couldn't do anything super detailed though. Crayons and large pictures for me!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 19:39:53	@emmameador it was enough to keep my mind engaged but low key enough not to make my head hurt. A good compromise
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 10:45:47	This week's episode for #TWWW is full of so many classic TWW moments. Surprising for such an early episode. pic.twitter.com/NnB1LJmuja
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 09:40:21	@tuttleturtle42 I just (accidentally) figured out how to do that on mobile. Turn off video autoplay in the data tab in settings.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 09:37:20	@emmameador I am like that,my concussion was hell. I did audiobooks and colored things in the dark.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 08:18:02	@ljsgrace this is everything I needed today
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 08:17:04	@ljsgrace probably. I figure twice in six months is enough, and good because this time i know what I like in a podcast, unlike last time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 08:13:11	@ljsgrace I'm also secretly hoping someone will clue me on to some amazing fiction podcasts I'm missing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 08:09:21	@ljsgrace I did! There were so many, but I have myself a three-episode minimum. If I didn't like it at 3eps, I moved on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 08:03:37	@ljsgrace ?? Are you recommending the app? I went through all the suggestions I got the first time I asked, kept the ones I liked.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 06:04:27	@Ben_Etc I cannot argue with that logic
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 06:04:11	@NatTweetsAtLast Same! That's a more recent discovery and love

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 05:58:29	@Ben_Etc I actually just got an email with a $100 coupon code for brand loyalists. If you want to do a new preorder I'll pass it on!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 05:55:10	@ljsgrace honestly I've just been sitting here watching it on repeat. Kittens!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 05:50:24	This time, I can provide current faves: 2 Dope Queens, TWWW, ask me another/wait wait, limetown/message, lighting nerds, reduced shakespeare
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 05:46:48	Dear Twitter, I'm out of weekly podcasts AND back episodes I can be bothered with. Recommendations please!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 05:44:48	@Ben_Etc I'm glad my rabid consumerism salivation was helpful!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 02:13:38	@Ben_Etc Last year on black friday they took 50% off everything at HTC. I might hold out and see if it happens again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 02:12:47	@Ben_Etc I've heard great things about the latest Moto whatever. I dabbled with the atrix years ago and loved it and motorola.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 02:10:40	@Ben_Etc I'm off contract, but still maintain my old phone insurance. Seems about once a year I drop $100 for a new handset. I'm down.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 02:00:52	@Ben_Etc oh good, you can tell me about all the bad things when you get one so I'll wait out the life of my current phone.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 01:58:24	@Ben_Etc also: this is not helping convince me I don't want it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 01:57:47	@Ben_Etc the death of my last phone reminded me of the importance of having a removable battery though. Samsung gets that one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 01:55:37	@Ben_Etc it's really nice. Would be nicer without the ATT bloatware. I'm super picky about menus, etc. Samsung drives me up the wall.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 01:54:34	@Ben_Etc my last was an M9, disaster camera. The Desire EYE is pretty excellent, esp at the midrange price. But dat 10 tho.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 01:24:50	@Ben_Etc first time in my life I've considered buying a brand new device for the shiny. I've become such HTC trash.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 01:08:11	Why, why didn't my phone hold out just a few months longer? Oh well, the Desire EYE is nice too. https:// twitter.com/TechCrunch/sta tus/719920538920071168 …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 00:15:49	@Ben_Etc Right! TMobile's expanded their network just enough to kill that lovely feature
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 00:10:22	@Ben_Etc @ljsgrace While I was trying to replace my phone recently (Im on an ATT byo phone plan) I found the mfgs run great promos sometimes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-13 00:08:09	@Ben_Etc consider this: when you're out of range of a T-Mobile tower right now, you're running on ATT network.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-12 10:37:47	@mmdahlia27 They did Theon, but not Asha and the crow's eye
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-12 09:58:31	@mmdahlia27 not entirely. They were teasing storylines they haven't done yet. Like the greyjoys!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-12 05:04:22	@eroconnor I was so terrified!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-12 03:05:41	@mmdahlia27 @ljsgrace unless it's more expensive. Then probably not.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-12 03:02:27	@mizujada @ljsgrace I...am amazed that I do, mainly because I spent zero time on the orange line.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-11 22:00:20	@Rachel_Bax @NatTweetsAtLast agreed, but I'd be lying if I said I hadn't stolen the bit when working with adults with dev disabilities
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-11 21:58:56	@Rachel_Bax @NatTweetsAtLast well, I think I know what I'm doing tonight.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-11 21:55:54	@Rachel_Bax @NatTweetsAtLast truth. Although that has never bothered me bc Jack Black riffing on the soundtracks is so delightful

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-09 02:27:25	@ljsgrace that's a lot of tubes to navigate!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-09 02:23:19	@ljsgrace Somehow, through a combination of these things, I will get my baby back. :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-09 02:22:40	@ljsgrace Hmmm. It has not appeared BUT I remembered that I put all my thumbed up songs into a spotify playlist so I can re-seed it!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-07 08:46:24	@chidorme similar cognates. The victims who're invisible bc they appear just like the aggressors.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-07 08:34:33	@chidorme truth. I guess I'm just super sensitive to the problems of male rape victims. The one time men have it worse than women.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-07 08:14:47	@chidorme @ljsgrace absolutely! But if a hate crime is one against a particular group the group can't include everybody.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-07 08:11:48	@chidorme @ljsgrace but what about male victims of rape? What is their recourse if rape is a hate crime against women?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-06 08:43:35	@pineapplecakes @sarking be still, my beating ovaries.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-06 08:42:30	@sarking @pineapplecakes next wednesday, 7pm. Or tomorrow morning at 1am. I had to search to find wgn and they l came up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-06 08:41:18	@sarking @pineapplecakes one movie is easier to stomach than a decade of lifetime movies?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-06 08:18:48	@pineapplecakes what where hnnnnng
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:42:51	@darthraydor I cannot get past apollo's face. It's like she can't decide if she'll need to stage an intervention or not.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:25:42	@darthraydor I can't argue with that temptation. Balling is just so satisfying
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:22:48	@darthraydor my mom got one and lost her damn mind. She forced the cat to play with it so she could ball it up again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:21:13	@darthraydor amazeballs!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:18:56	@darthraydor does it make amazeballs? heh heh I'll see myself out
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:17:03	@NatTweetsAtLast (also, I'm still snickering at the attic wife)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:15:17	@NatTweetsAtLast similar, yes, but nobody makes mad, mad, mad worlds like fforde
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:13:47	@NatTweetsAtLast Shades of Grey! And not prolific enough, it's five(ish) years waiting on the next one!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:11:14	@NatTweetsAtLast it works because his worlds are so complete and detailed. There's room to explore the layers later!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:09:11	@NatTweetsAtLast I'm glad it didn't stop me, he wrote my favorite book!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:08:20	@NatTweetsAtLast I hadn't read Jane Eyre the first time I read it and missed 90% of the jokes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 10:06:32	@NatTweetsAtLast clearly the next step is to read the Eyre Affair!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 08:23:04	@IHStreet zombie kitten demands brains
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 08:22:10	I can just feel past me's disappointment radiating across the 10-year gap.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 08:21:26	Teen Caitlin wanted a pair of hulking Docs SO BADLY to be edgy, while 20's Caitlin is trying to find the least doc-y Docs for the steel toes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 05:48:05	@chidorme i'm sure my double take switching from fb to twitter to near-identical pictures was hilarious from the outside.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-05 05:42:07	@chidorme you....are not many rows in front of Sara and Amanda. this has mad for some fun interneting
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-04 10:38:12	How to spend a sunday evening: dressed up as dudebro!Petrochio reading Shakespeare with some amazing people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 21:51:56	@tui_talk if I knew that I would be done by then, I would be so down.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 21:50:12	@darthraydor my cold heart just melted a little
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 10:48:50	@mmdahlia27 @NatTweetsAtLast I respectfully disagree and submit false eyelashes for that position of dishonor
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 08:14:15	@Ben_Etc @ljsgrace @njwestcoaster I find myself suddenly getting eggs for huevos tomorrow. Positive outcomes from twitter: this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 08:10:52	@Ben_Etc @ljsgrace @njwestcoaster that was me exactly that thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 08:01:30	@Ben_Etc @ljsgrace @njwestcoaster I did the exact same thing over juevos ranchero my first morning in Santa Fe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 07:55:00	@Ben_Etc @ljsgrace @njwestcoaster she makes her own. I LIVE for the yearly vaccum-packed packages more precious than gold.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 07:49:16	@Ben_Etc @ljsgrace @njwestcoaster I have something from my bestie (she lives in Santa Fe), I'll pass it on when I find it!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 07:45:07	@ljsgrace @Ben_Etc @njwestcoaster are we talking new mexican green chile?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 03:02:57	@ahgshea it took all of what little self-control I posess not to bail on the rest of my errands
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 02:56:21	@ahgshea I wish! I was lucky enough to catch it at the beer store!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 02:47:03	@pineapplecakes prolly not a smart idea in a beer store
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 02:45:50	@pineapplecakes I had serious thoughts about making friends with the kid watching it to finish watching it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 02:39:59	I am groot is the new [Citation needed] https:// twitter.com/talkhoops/stat us/716334065297674241 …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 02:38:40	The temptation to take this beer home and drink it and finish watching Save the Last Dance is STRONG
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 02:37:31	Please note: I'm watching it from behind the counter while I wait in line at the beer store. Adulting!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-03 02:36:18	The opening sequence of Save the Last dance is such a great example of show, don't say in movies.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-02 20:51:04	@sarking ...Baltar? I meant Gaeta w/r
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-02 17:23:28	@sarking CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING VALUABLE BALTAR
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-02 03:29:13	@samcaseys also a very strong love for Gaeta's lament. No love for him, but I will love his lament
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-02 03:25:39	@samcaseys The shape of things to come/passacaglia/allegro leitmotifs. Wander my friends et al. Laura Runs. The piano book make me Elegy.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-02 00:13:58	@Ben_Etc @mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada this is not a new concept for me, con confirm awesome
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-02 00:11:58	@Ben_Etc @chidorme @mizujada @mmdahlia27 no, but written stuff all the time. Fandom has corrupted me so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-01 23:58:59	@mizujada friends who I know are down. Or friends of friends in a fandom. Sometimes I find two, one for the sex and one for the fandom.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-01 23:57:13	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 @Ben_Etc @mizujada the apologies which frequently come ahead of my beta requests are prolific.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-01 23:55:32	@Ben_Etc @mmdahlia27 you didn't go to Sweet Briar. Poops were categorized and announced among my roommates and anyone else around.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-01 23:50:27	@Ben_Etc @NatTweetsAtLast truth. That's what ya get for tying to pop off in the office!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-01 23:47:34	@emmameador whoo! I'm also on that boat, making sure I keep my brain in check from alllll sides. I just want to be done, not crazy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-01 23:46:13	@NatTweetsAtLast @Ben_Etc plot twist: they've just discovered the part of youtube that caters to it and are so happy they can watch at work
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-01 21:29:30	@Ben_Etc A+ prank well pranked. Also one that vid is catering to somebody, somewhere in the demo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-01 21:20:22	@emmameador it is so very, very hard.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-04-01 21:19:44	@Ben_Etc I was like 'okay, that's funny sure' and then I read the video titles.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-31 22:42:58	@sarking I think I never wanted to think about it to avoid these looming Julio-man-cry-level sniffles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-31 06:48:55	@Ben_Etc @ljsgrace Ditto! Someday!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-31 06:36:34	@Ben_Etc @ljsgrace those nylon ones are great if you are space limited. But I'm holding out for one of these http://www. coolasamoose.com/gifts/coolgift s/hammockchairs/single.htm …

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-28 19:28:01	@sarking most accurate tag ever
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-28 13:32:44	@ljsgrace @chidorme that...is a lot of ant traps for a small human
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-28 13:31:39	@ljsgrace @chidorme Or multiple rabies shots! (these are the worst thing I can think of atm)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-28 13:30:02	@ljsgrace @chidorme but also: yes. This clock usually resets for me in lab. This is some lovely variety!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-27 10:33:03	@ljsgrace I think it might be mine too. If only the tune wasn't so catchy

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-25 05:25:48	@ljsgrace @NatTweetsAtLast I scrawled the words all over my textbook covers in 7th grade. I could probably still make it through the 1st act
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-25 04:44:44	@ljsgrace @NatTweetsAtLast I could probably still make it through the 1st act if I really tried. But it's nice to not be the only weirdo!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-25 04:43:47	@ljsgrace @NatTweetsAtLast 7th grade Caitlin scrawled the words all over her textbook covers, even though I didn't know what they all meant
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-25 04:19:04	@NatTweetsAtLast I'm taking so much pleasure watching everyone go through with Hamilton what I went through with RENT 15 years ago
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-24 22:32:44	@mizujada somewhere, there's a good way to smash up Turing and trolling

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-24 07:07:01	@NatTweetsAtLast @ljsgrace even worse: mine was stretch jersey. Deeply unflattering on a woman of size. Wore it for rugby princess day after
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-24 06:58:22	@chidorme @mizujada I just asked my cat what he'd be doing in 1963. He farted.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-24 06:54:27	@chidorme @mizujada this is the best game, no lies.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-23 11:01:03	@LizCanTweet hey, as long as you're in it for you, the patriarchy can eat shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-23 05:22:45	@brittania_ @quarantedeux sorry last night I realized I wouldn't choose to watch Castle as is if it was new. I worry for it as a model.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-23 05:04:41	@quarantedeux @brittania_ tbqh I thought the finale was a step in the right direction, before this shandy thing arose
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-23 04:44:45	@quarantedeux @brittania_ our complaint lately has been that we don't know anything about Sharon *from* her, it's all from outside sources

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-23 04:40:11	@brittania_ @quarantedeux much though I hate to suggest it, Bones might be the place to look.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-23 04:37:58	@brittania_ @quarantedeux cues are only acceptable as long as they are limited to S6, except the last 4 minutes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-23 04:35:36	@brittania_ @quarantedeux castle managed for a hot minute/season and then they shat alllllll over my damn show.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 11:46:39	@tui_talk the conceit is that Mela visits to see some amazing skyshow and the air currents fluoresce from metorite dust a la starry night
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 11:43:01	@tui_talk turns out Filif's A SOLID ROOT I'll just see myself out
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 11:40:25	@tui_talk related: I fully expect you to stop talking to me with the terrible pun for a title.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 11:39:38	@tui_talk so I kept working on my mela/filif bunny and I've somehow made it headcanon that van gogh went to Demisiv at some point
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 03:59:38	If nothing else, my reactions to this have confirmed why I should never go to cons.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 03:48:12	@brittania_ even if you're ejo it's hard to be that subtle in front of that many people
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 03:46:24	@brittania_ he whispered in her ear (prolly about these two) and then dropped one on her cheek real fast
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 03:44:32	Eddie tryna be subtle in front of a huge crowd

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 03:06:57	Wait who puts Eddie and Mary onstage without a moderator.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 01:09:02	@chidorme right? They never believe me! They're always so terrified!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 01:06:49	@chidorme all my scientist friends are so hopelessly confused when I start dragging them to shows :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 01:06:03	@chidorme also, I like any company that seeks out comedy of errors. It's done so infrequently!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 01:01:32	@chidorme Awesome! I'm in for chekov tonight in a converted church.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 00:56:30	@chidorme Chesapeake I haven't had the pleasure yet, though!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 00:55:37	@ljsgrace @mizujada I could not agree with this struggle more.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 00:53:50	@chidorme YES YES it's just a hair far for anything I'm not deeply committed to.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 00:51:25	@chidorme I like the $22/show three pack at STC, no lies.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-20 00:48:46	@chidorme Foldger's young patron pricing is garbage, though. Whatever, they keep drawing me in!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-19 21:13:14	@quarantedeux the south has some truly amazing names tucked into their families
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-19 21:11:57	@quarantedeux I went to college with too many southerners. There were ton of those names: Carlisle, Greer, Zelda, Dorcas

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-18 20:58:56	@quarantedeux I usually don't start to regret the end until I start the last season
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-18 20:58:20	@quarantedeux oh fun! S5 was baller, more to look forward to, aside from my very-early pacing fears
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-18 12:34:44	@quarantedeux I thought I'd never make it to the movie and now here I am and I'm depressed there's only four seasons left.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-18 10:16:44	well, mid-90's Hburg, anyway.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-18 10:11:02	otoh, if you're looking for somewhere decrepit and awful to kill Mulder, Harrisburg is a pretty excellent choice.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-18 04:46:46	Thank you, lab across the hall, for moving boxes from an empty desk so I could get shit done this afternoon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-18 03:51:56	Nothing like spending an afternoon scoring data in lab listening to PI and ex have a domestic with his office door open #never4getheadphones
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-18 00:45:44	@msbshoshani perfect job, imperfect climate. The struggle is so real.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-18 00:41:56	@zestylime I could suck on an inhaler all winter?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-18 00:41:24	@msbshoshani it's a hard one to consider! Bright side: museums have lots of busses that go straight there. Ugh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-18 00:30:12	Related: science museum jobs want theatre and teaching experience helloooo dream field.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 23:48:28	@IAmLazarusJones I think she's funny and gorgeous. But the way that's usually presented doesn't sit right with me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 23:47:30	@IAmLazarusJones the girls who turned up to stage crew just to make fun of it, yes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 23:45:25	Too busy hunting replicants https:// twitter.com/stevebragaw/st atus/710124187667537920 …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 23:40:57	@IAmLazarusJones yes, I'm not the only one to think that!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 11:06:56	Curled up with my kitten, raspberries, the Nanny, and the latest book of math and logic puzzles. Heaven, thy name is right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 10:32:28	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada half a block of cheese, a sausage, and some frozen cherries. #adulting
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 09:28:25	@quarantedeux damn them. But less work to maintain one. Plus captures things they might not consider
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 09:27:15	@quarantedeux better safe than sorry prolly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 09:26:49	@quarantedeux are blogs social media? Idk. Do they provide a list?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 09:26:10	@quarantedeux thing one, eep! Thing two, yeaaaah no
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 06:31:26	@GainesOnBrains parking is gonna be 100x more of a nightmare than usual, lbr.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 06:30:51	@GainesOnBrains where's your hotel?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 04:55:50	@GainesOnBrains it's not far from union station to the Hill!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 04:53:19	@GainesOnBrains MARC?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 03:36:26	@sarking I mean, they're not that dissimilar as long as you don't actually need to get anywhere
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 02:08:41	@msbshoshani plot twist: that's what the drones are really for.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-16 02:07:55	@ohnikkers SUCH A GOOD BOOK
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 23:39:12	@Rachel_Bax @mizujada doesn't work for subscription-limited content, but it does get around the 10 article limit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 23:38:09	@Rachel_Bax @mizujada right click , open link in incognito window
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 21:10:26	@mizujada it does indeed!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 19:15:05	@darthraydor *steps up, hands you a spoon*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 10:53:54	@quarantedeux so is TC streaming anywhere?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 09:29:06	@melduckie it does if I want pie!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 09:24:00	Fuck I forgot it was pi day I need to put on pants right now
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 07:54:31	@chidorme My mother takes immense pleasure in making my Hannity-loving dad talk to them. I vote to serve her happiness, lbr.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 07:53:16	@chidorme I think it's a desperate stab at retail politics in a tiny town. There are so few registered democrats out there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 07:50:45	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 *sheepishly dops off the four copies still in my high school bedroom*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 07:49:06	@chidorme Seems I'm the youngest dem supervoter by like 20 years. Poor Dad, he only gets visited by the other side *evil laughter*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 07:48:12	@chidorme God bless /extremely/ small towns, yo. The dems running for office always come to my house in mad desperation
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 02:10:45	@chidorme if prior experience holds, half the positions on my ballot will be the same person running in both parties.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 02:09:43	@chidorme ours is closed, too. Makes sense on both sides, I guess.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 02:02:11	@chidorme I've never understood open primaries for this exact reason. Wtf is the point? Just have a general election
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 02:01:24	@chidorme definitely. "Oh, she'll be fine,let's try and fix this problem over here"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 01:58:12	@ljsgrace that's it. That Sweet Breezy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-15 01:57:10	@chidorme @ljsgrace @Rachel_Bax maybe it hurts more in places where Bernie has a fair bit of support?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-14 22:54:06	@quarantedeux i knew one day we'd find the purpose!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-14 22:39:18	@quarantedeux isn't that what twitter is for though?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-14 12:46:24	Interventions should be staged to include channings tater tots plz and thx

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-14 11:43:14	@brittania_ @ohnikkers forever in love with his willingness to accept the premise and roll in any situation

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-14 01:34:45	@airfarewatchdog @stringseed plus, sometimes you get lucky and the only available seats are +legroom. Go the counter and it's a free upgrade
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-13 09:38:03	@msbshoshani I come from hearty stock :) Uma Hilda's probably the baddest bitch I know personally.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-13 09:33:36	@msbshoshani I can highly recommend getting a 98yo woman to explain this new word fuckery she learned from the internet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-13 09:32:38	@msbshoshani she's lost 20 years in her renewed passion to end this fuckery, it's wonderful to behold.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-13 09:30:46	@msbshoshani bright side: watching her fling her knitting needles at the old dude trump bros in her home
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-13 09:30:04	@msbshoshani my gr8 gma (escaped from E Germany post-war) swears this is how it started last time
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-13 09:23:37	I can't shake the feeling that the cat which runs from my door every time I come home is an unrequited love situation for my kitten.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-13 02:58:30	@melduckie @mizujada SAME
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-12 22:46:44	Although I'm open to arguments that that's an orgasm face, not a desperate sobbing one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-12 22:44:28	Mulder, sobbing into Scully's hand, making me cry. Damn these feelings.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-12 20:34:48	@quarantedeux duck.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-12 09:42:16	@quarantedeux but it's been a few years since I've spent any time up on the hill, and times they do change.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-12 09:33:41	@quarantedeux there's a lot of hella conservativism rolling around, but not a ton of impetus. Or, there didn't used to be.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-12 09:28:20	@quarantedeux and also, ideology. But for all the fuss at the top, LU populace is pretty apolitical.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-12 09:26:16	@quarantedeux liberty's nowheresville, there aren't half this many people in all of Lynchburg.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-12 08:17:51	@quarantedeux um....small potatoes

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-12 06:58:49	@chidorme @ljsgrace I'm a big fan of his take on corporate law. And amazed by his ability to mostly avoid hella hot button issues
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-12 06:52:34	@ljsgrace tbqh, none of the women on the speculation lists really thrilled me. This has two of my faves!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-11 12:03:42	@AJoos snoopy should last me until I can find muppets ones again. Because adulting means insisting on the bandaids you want, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-11 11:49:27	@mcdorky_ that was what I went for. The minions were mostly oddly shaped little dots.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-11 09:58:25	Grown ass adult can't decide. Should I get Peanuts or Minions bandaids, Twitter?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-11 05:22:08	@ljsgrace @melduckie ...like me, for example.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-11 05:21:52	@ljsgrace @melduckie this way you can catch the people who forgot about it on the 3rd and felt bad, so they chime in now!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-11 05:08:39	@NatTweetsAtLast @ljsgrace See, these are the wedding stories I /live/ for. Please tell said nudie pants was in the wedding.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-11 05:07:37	@darthraydor Oh no! I hope your brainpan isn't too zonked. Ain't nobody got time for concussions.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-10 07:28:30	@chidorme @mizujada I'm in, especially when there's a Posner Shakespeare on bc I am theatre design trash
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-09 21:13:01	Everything loosened a little and now it hurts everywhere and this is not what my goal was can I just not move for a few days?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-09 21:09:12	My back's knotted up so much I'm getting nerve pain in my arm so I grabbed a heating pad ( @LikeEmmaWithaT : my back, still nonsense) except
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-09 12:36:17	That shiny floss looked like so much fun, sparkling on the rack. It's a total bitch to stitch with.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-09 08:55:46	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes THISSS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-09 08:51:26	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes and yet, Buzz is still the blue balls in this situation.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-09 00:41:35	@melduckie Or even a Harper Hall-type thing, where you've got all new characters and all the Big Stuff happens far away.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-09 00:40:57	@melduckie I was thinking more the time jumps and major place shifts. Many ways to explore one awesome world.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-08 00:55:07	@GainesOnBrains Because hazing?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-07 11:23:47	@ohheyitsal perfect comparison going into the back six, tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-07 11:22:39	@tui_talk you can, but not if you want a functioning one
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-07 11:21:58	@ohheyitsal I'm over here all, "am I finally done grieving will?"the Alicia/will comparison didn't hurt like I expected

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-06 10:13:58	Imposter syndrome is ~100 people telling you you did an amazing job planning a career event and not entirely believing they're sincere.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-04 22:19:28	@petridishes those quotes read like terrible bizarre Trump/Cruz erotica that's marked explicit but is really only mature.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-04 10:25:28	@IHStreet me gusta! That's a great one!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-04 09:43:17	@ohnikkers so accurate though.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-04 08:36:40	@quarantedeux just business travel and extraneous things for now. Thankfully we're grant funded.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-04 08:34:37	@quarantedeux remember that chat we had about budgets? We just got the first word from main campus about cutbacks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-03-04 03:41:00	@tui_talk Nope, mine was heartbreaking too. But it also gave me hope! Lord, BSG has twisted my perception of hope.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-28 00:48:59	@quarantedeux @mizujada we know the truth is out there
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-28 00:47:04	@mizujada @quarantedeux I'm stoked I've found something that combines what I love from ships in 4-5 different fandoms all into one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-28 00:45:05	@mizujada @quarantedeux Typically, yes. In this case, there's still the canon(ish) Endgame, but this is a delightful diversion!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-28 00:34:09	@quarantedeux I'd forgotten how awesome side ships can be in the face of overwhelmingly strong canon pairs.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-28 00:29:59	@quarantedeux on a decidedly less highbrow note, I've discovered mulder/skinner and imma need a very long rope to climb up outta this hole

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-27 03:02:48	@ljsgrace True that. Especially while I try to sell it to, well, y'know.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-27 03:00:40	@ljsgrace although we could also set up in some fog with a pink sunset behind to mask the pink and pearls!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-27 02:48:02	@quarantedeux what's the budget holdup in IL?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-27 02:47:50	@quarantedeux heavens yes. there's a irony here, that education suffers while we try to get more money for it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-27 02:45:02	@quarantedeux *looks* apparently the heads of the state universities all started agitating this week. Looks like tertiary is next.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-27 02:43:02	@quarantedeux our problem seems to be nobody wants to spend as much on education as the governor does, so districts suffer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-27 02:40:52	@quarantedeux pa was in the same mess, but it was school districts taking out massive loans to keep the lights on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-27 02:39:11	@quarantedeux holy shitsnacks, that's. WOW.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-26 11:20:27	Second update: God complex helped even less by the ability to illuminate or punch into darkness with lights of this kind of precision.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-26 11:08:57	Guys, I think for once I might actually kind of know what I'm doing in a skilled situation. #suckitimposter
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-26 11:07:08	Update: God complex not helped by quickly figuring out moving lights and getting them correctly patched by myself on a new, complex board.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-23 22:39:50	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes this is probably true.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-23 22:38:55	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes because outside of tv world, that's what relationships are. They're the real interactions with others
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-23 22:38:24	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes yes this. I'm all for the cute romance, but I'm here for something real first, cute second.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-23 22:32:25	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes my optimistic ass still has hope for dat letter. Duff has his faults, but he never lets things like that drop
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-23 20:25:19	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes glaring example: why have Foodleface tell us about Andy's thoughts on the job offer? Why not Andy?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-23 10:06:27	@quarantedeux so here's what we're gonna do. We get you a job writing for TXF, then you hire me as a science consultant.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-23 07:02:33	@tui_talk For a bizarre pick, the book I nabbed on clearance at the bookstore: The Last Nude by Ellis Avery. Engaging prose and lesbians!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-20 22:55:13	@quarantedeux this entire endeavor was worth it to watch Dana Scully going "baa ram ewe" in a pig pen
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-20 22:45:21	Of course the freaky inbred caveman brothers are from rural Pennsylvania. OF COURSE. #TheXFiles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-20 22:24:52	@stevebragaw I wish I knew enough about scandal for a witty response! I am, however, always down for Toby vs. Anybody
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-20 13:09:38	@ljsgrace they aren't?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-20 13:02:39	@quarantedeux !!!! Holla at your awesome face!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-20 13:02:00	@ElectricVandal I got $600 when my plane hit a moose, but I was in a hella backwoods airport
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-20 07:04:13	@quarantedeux meep!!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-19 22:07:09	@labellementeuse shitsnacks, wrong exchange. Ignore me!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-19 22:05:14	@labellementeuse mela/sker xeno. What convinced me to sign up!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-19 22:01:16	@labellementeuse *makes a note*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-19 06:23:05	@petridishes there are some places I don't wanna feel any kind of bern
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 11:25:31	@NatTweetsAtLast "Definitely the old guy in both aim and carnage." "So we're not getting the security deposit back, then"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 11:15:34	@NatTweetsAtLast "my cat shat on the floor again " " how bad?" "Remember the DC sniper?"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 11:13:46	@NatTweetsAtLast this might be a good metric for many things- outfits pizza, blind dates, performance reviews
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 09:07:23	@stevebragaw I'm on Team Mellie, if we're going fictional there is no team but #fourmorebartlets
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 09:00:54	@stevebragaw clear evidence that a second Clinton presidency is a bad idea
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 08:57:44	Again, I repeat, nobody asked to know anything about Skinner's hookups with hookers. Nobody.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 08:53:30	Psssst @pineapplecakes relevant to your interests https:// twitter.com/MichaelAusiell o/status/700120179037048832 …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 08:51:47	How is it that the first member of the core X-Files cast to get a sex scene is Skinner? Who asked for this shit? Nobody, that's who. Nobody.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 07:09:46	@ElectricVandal Sure! I gotta head home and feed the boss anyway.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 07:07:34	@gilesdraws Ahahaha, I know why people actually hang out with me, no worries :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 07:06:26	@ElectricVandal Yes I do! I'm pretty much done here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 07:06:08	@gilesdraws do you just want to see my cat? Because that is also an option.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 07:04:56	@gilesdraws MAYBE YES MAYBE YES
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 07:03:55	@gilesdraws WHOO AND HOO!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 06:52:48	@GainesOnBrains I didn't know I had this gaping hole in my life
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 06:39:42	@ElectricVandal I'm sorry I missed you guys! Fingers crossed that everything works out for you!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 02:29:32	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 my kingdom for a happy medium cat where the fur matches all my clothes and all my furnishings.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 02:19:50	@gilesdraws clearly it missed you
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 02:19:36	@gilesdraws <3 <3 <3
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 01:15:00	@mizujada balancing equations will the the death of you without a constant reference, man.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 01:14:09	@mizujada and people wondered why I drew a periodic table on the wall of my batcave in thebasement of the library
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 00:48:52	As a human who's been watching too much of The X-Files, finding this at my desk without context is...disconcerting. pic.twitter.com/os8I1Q8KAi
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 00:46:20	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada but almost no emphasis on the costs of continuing treatment. Maybe a liability thing?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 00:40:46	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada There's also a heavy emphasis in training that survivial = treatment
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 00:21:04	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada This has been the biggest point of contention between myself and medical students in classes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-18 00:20:39	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada and at what cost? Sure, we can keep you alive, but what kind of life is it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 23:31:16	Hey TXF kids, serious question: is there a team creeper possession slime? Because that's easily the most terrifying thing so far.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 21:20:40	@quarantedeux upon review, i'm not wholly certain that isn't just a random jumble of words
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 13:30:52	@quarantedeux holy shit captain sketchballs mcchainsmoker was tooling around with Mulder sr in the 50s tell me he's team creeper slime
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 12:09:37	@gilesdraws Huzzah! Steven is excited already, though he may miss you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 12:03:53	@gilesdraws you! Tomorrow?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 12:00:42	@ljsgrace orphan black! Lots of room for discussion about how they (nearly accurately) handle the science.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 11:22:13	@ljsgrace @mizujada it's a 180° character change from my will-not-be-contained kitten
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 11:21:28	@ljsgrace @mizujada Steven has recently started to forcefully request a position under the blankets with me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 10:41:45	"Have sex with us so a cult member doesn't kidnap us and kill us." That's certainly one I haven't heard before, #TheXFiles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 10:32:52	"This is no place for an entomologist." Dana Scully! Such shade!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 04:10:52	@ohnikkers Fresh eyes mcgee over here wants to get to the part where they're fucking and is willing to skip eps that're well below par
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 04:03:32	@ohnikkers lmk what you think of that one. I skipped it on the advice of a bunch of TXF episode guides
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 04:02:26	@ohnikkers dude yes. I keep barely being able to recognize people when they turn up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 03:58:49	@ohnikkers oh shit sorry I didn't know that was spoils? But ugh so many good ones.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 03:56:53	@ohnikkers such fun. I about screamed when baby Jewell Saite turned up a few episodes ago.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 03:52:14	@Jeyradan See, now this is the kind of information that would have been useful in advance. How long are you here?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 03:51:45	@brittania_ @quarantedeux kids still only in season 3 for Vince Gilligan to run the damn show 2k16.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-17 03:49:42	@Jeyradan SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU SOON
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 12:06:00	Never 4get when my mom asked, "What's a Pitbull?" and followed up with, "Why is there a child molester on stage?"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 12:01:13	@pineapplecakes and a goal
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:58:49	@pineapplecakes confidence-dripping larger ladies who slay and slay I just ungph
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:54:25	@pineapplecakes my goddamn inspiration

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:49:00	@quarantedeux a measured, thoughtful study in staying directly parallel to realizing potential
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:47:22	@quarantedeux they even took the dnr talk to his surrogate spouse
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:46:26	@quarantedeux my fool ass will never learn, keeps going back to grad school thinking it'll be fine
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:44:09	@quarantedeux ugh true. damn you, always talking sense to my optimism.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:41:41	@pineapplecakes THE UNHOLY NOISE THAT JUST LEFT MY BODY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:40:48	@quarantedeux they've gotta. They've just gotta showthat. They did it all the time with Brenda!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:36:31	@AuroraMoorealis I was drooling at the rojection, because I'm lighting designer trash
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:35:53	I just have strong feelings about people appreciating the technical artistry in live performance production
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:34:43	I am 100% here for commercials about the awesome digital projection that just went down at the grammys
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:31:34	@quarantedeux second, you better believe Andy's gonna have feelings about that and I want to hear them all
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:30:55	@quarantedeux what the hell ridiculous job is that first
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:29:33	@quarantedeux wait what how did I miss this??
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 11:22:05	@quarantedeux I'm still out on why this MC story isn't just a two-parter. I'm missing the urgency in the overall narrative
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 10:12:38	Oh, right. We're back to MC Mondays, over at @drunkasarusrex
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 10:02:20	Gladly. https:// twitter.com/MichaelAusiell o/status/699413345485647872 …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 09:53:00	@pineapplecakes oh sweet lord no give us Hamilton stat
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 09:40:37	@quarantedeux if we're going to get Mulder that high, can I at least get my hands on him...for my experiments, yeah. For science.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 09:38:40	@quarantedeux wh...what. What the fuck
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 09:26:49	@AuroraMoorealis it's been a long time since a show has hit me in the real life like she just did.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 09:26:13	@AuroraMoorealis she reminds me of soooooo many people I know SO MUCH fucking scientists yo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 09:19:21	@AuroraMoorealis this would be more fun if we'd had an eyeball on the mayhem they're planning
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 09:17:20	@pineapplecakes no but really. Manic Caitlin is obsessed with Gaga. I still can't figure out why.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 09:15:57	@pineapplecakes finally, a positive thing explained by "I was coming down with bipolar". Knew I'd find one someday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 08:09:42	If you didn't cheer when the trash compactor dude ripped off Gaeta's arms, you should probably re-examine your priorities.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-16 01:39:59	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada I think the free sites do better with more people, while the paid ones do better in more rural areas
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 23:54:04	@samson_today that ship sailed when we were kids, I think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 23:53:32	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada But I have a feeling that online dating would go better in a larger metro area than out here in the wops
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 23:52:27	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada OKC did a really terrible job of recommending people to me, too. I bailed after six months of awful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 23:49:03	@NatTweetsAtLast On the bright side, when they make JK Rowling's detective books into movies, they'll be auto-recommended!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 23:46:21	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada Seconded. The sites you have to pay for definitely weed out a lot of the casual seekers
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 12:14:09	@quarantedeux you're a terrible influence
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:57:12	@quarantedeux ...sad? Awesome, more like.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:47:57	@quarantedeux I am so excited to get to more Vince Gilligan eps though, his first one with Jack Black was sad
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:45:35	@quarantedeux I have so far to go!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:42:03	@quarantedeux based on the quality of the insta-classic Rhys Darby ep, I'm stoked
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:40:59	@quarantedeux I did my research! (Grad student can't stop won't stop)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:39:20	@quarantedeux I only skipped ones that at least three lists insisted you should skip, so may e three eps? Like the vampire one
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:37:25	@quarantedeux but I'm rolling steady at like two-three eps a day. It's fun!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:35:50	@quarantedeux I maybe skipped a couple of eps on the strong advice of multiple what-to-skip lists.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:33:07	@quarantedeux I wanted to be mad at you for convincing me to do this but whoops season 3.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:32:12	@quarantedeux like the totally apathetic future teller who hates everything. I'd be apathetic too. It's perfect!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:27:48	@quarantedeux to be precise, that scared the ever-living shit out of me. That could totally happen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:26:55	@quarantedeux I liked it better when the government was covering up dodgy as fuck pharma experiments on prisoners. That worked.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 11:25:33	I'm so happy the back nine of #TheGoodWife are gonna be good as the last seven seasons. This kind of consistency is a rare find.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 10:49:10	@AuroraMoorealis @quarantedeux I totally got whiplash from sudden action!CSM
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 10:14:50	I never thought I'd see the day when Alicia Florrick made goo goo eyes at someone. #TheGoodWife
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 08:44:07	@quarantedeux also, smoking dude as escalated very quickly from mega chill to HARRYDIJAPUTURNAMEINTHEGOBLETOFIYAH no chill.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 08:42:12	@quarantedeux wait so if mulder's dad chose to give over Samantha how did he roll so chill when the clone chick turned up?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 08:39:23	@ohnikkers I just got to 3x05, personally.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 08:38:54	@ohnikkers ohhhhh! OH HELL NAW
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 08:38:24	@GainesOnBrains I left that department for another rotation before I adopted my cat. This is how much my friends talked about Steven.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 08:36:42	@GainesOnBrains one of my committee members once told me I could bring a sig other (That Steve guy) to a dept event.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 08:35:22	@GainesOnBrains I generally despise human names for pets, but he came with it from the shelter and people loved it before I changed it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 08:33:59	@ohnikkers the prison one ?!?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 08:29:04	@GainesOnBrains I'm juyst here like hey, this is my cat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 02:47:40	Dad and I could at least agree that if Justice Scalia died after quail hunting, we need to know about Dick Cheney's recent movements.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 02:41:08	Also I could have used a "Reagan put 3 men on the court no fuss, so why would putting 3 women be radical?" bat too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 02:33:31	Heard about Justice Scalia during dinner with my Hannitized Dad, wanted to beat things with a "Reagan put 3 justices on the court too" bat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-15 02:19:04	@labellementeuse sweet lords of kobol what have I done? This is why I can't have nice things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-14 12:45:10	@labellementeuse who am I kidding *heads off to learn about signing up details*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-14 12:44:36	@labellementeuse I feel like that's have to be non-penetrative. Good place for a nipple kink.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-14 12:42:50	@labellementeuse this could be such fun. I wonder how whales fuck...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-14 12:41:25	@labellementeuse I'll help you gather your own firewood.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-14 12:39:12	@labellementeuse I love you even more. time to put those legs to good use
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-14 12:38:30	@labellementeuse I love you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-13 21:01:41	@witzseeker baby! Awwww.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-13 20:59:34	@stevebragaw as a human headed for that, this scares this shit out of me. Doesn't ∆ my optimism for the corrective fx of strong community
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-13 20:43:22	@stevebragaw I'm oddly far less fatalistic than I would be, have hope the strong, awesome community will right things
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-13 20:40:31	@stevebragaw fair point.The sense of dejavu is unsettling, but I can see how many responses to all of this would be wholly different pre-SBC
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-13 20:32:23	@stevebragaw the archdiocese of bmore wouldn't let it close, but the rest of the similarities are very strong.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-13 20:24:26	@stevebragaw my ties to the Mount are nearly as strong as my SBC ties, so it's been interesting to watch this with post-SSB eyes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-12 11:21:13	@petridishes Bill or Hildawg, though?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-12 11:20:08	Mulder, I'm pretty sure aliens aren't abducting zoo animals. Come on now brah.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-12 04:55:26	I'm impressed that there is absolutely nothing new that isn't in the books or already established in those shots. Impressive leaking.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-12 04:53:47	I spy with my spying eye Greyjoys in the GoT promo shots and that brings me joy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-12 04:47:30	@quarantedeux eeep! Okay go team cautious optimism and all the good juju. Allladat good juju
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-12 03:28:19	@quarantedeux I had a great interview this morning for a stupid theatre gig, I'm passing that good juju on to you for your actual important
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-12 03:17:30	@ohheyitsal we've mostly only owned vdubs. They run forever, my last one died well past 300k miles. The diesels run even longer
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-12 01:18:07	@ohheyitsal Rabbit. Very similar yet infinitely better than the Golf. Unfortunately no longer available.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-12 01:13:18	@ohheyitsal I had to get my locks re-cored because something went wrong. That's it, so far. *knocks on wood*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-12 01:12:13	@ohheyitsal I love my VW. I've had it almost ten years and haven't had to replace anything that doesn't wear out naturally (tires, brakes)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-12 01:11:05	@ohheyitsal people make it sound like it's worse than it is. I know I pay more because I take it to the dealer, but that's my call.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-11 12:37:56	@AuroraMoorealis oh no. It gets more ridiculous?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-11 12:23:07	Really? Alien bounty hunters? Really, #TheXFiles ?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 12:10:39	Current aesthetic: Steven Colbert licking his lips in a nervous tick.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 11:54:44	If you need me, I'll be relishing the opportunity to watch Steven Colbert in real time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 11:42:48	Way to not let the MVP chill out with the trophy everybody.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 11:40:16	DAMN STRAIGHT LINEBACKER MVP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 11:25:44	Post-game quarterback speeches aren't even free from product placement what kind of a world do we live in
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 11:16:35	I like this trend of a bajillion movie promos and some responsible ads. Let's keep this going, world.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 11:08:55	@zestylime always a pleasure to watch a defense shine
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 11:05:49	Guess that trophy isn't coming back to the NFC this year

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 10:51:57	This is the super bowl this football season deserves.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 10:44:33	Welcome to a world in which we resort to toenail fungus to get Howie Mandel into the super bowl.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 10:38:27	@NIH_Bear I'd put Sondheim up in contention. May not win, but a strong player.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 10:36:35	Ya'll are supposed to release and roll out of the breakdown, ya'll come on now #waitnotrugby
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 10:33:07	@zestylime although tbqh they already do that with boat speakers in their truck beds so this is just the rich kid version I guess
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 10:30:26	@zestylime mine'll be florida georgia line with poorly attached off-center balls dangling off the back.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 10:24:09	I am very happy for Bey to come here but also alarmed bc the stadium capacity is more than twice the population of this town.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 10:20:59	@ohnikkers I just learned that the stadium capacity is 30.000. No wonder traffic is such a nightmare in this tiny town.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 10:16:41	@ohnikkers I was like, "Oh sweet, Pittsburgh! No, Philly! Fuck yeah, Baltimore, so many option....OMFGWATYAS"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 10:14:57	@ohnikkers YOU CAN SEE THE GODDAMN STADIUM FROM HERE

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:42:30	Honestly, left shark was more coherent than that was.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:40:21	Hey look at this footage of all these halftime shows with serious techinical specs. Wish this was one
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:37:38	@msbshoshani My thoughts too. He sounded way to breathy for be pre-recorded.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:32:59	I hate west coast super bowls, it's too light out and they don't even try for cool lighting effects.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:32:07	@msbshoshani thoughts on live vs. prerecorded sound for the halftime show?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:30:50	Noooooo you bastards in the stadium PUT YOUR CARDS BACK UP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:29:47	YASSSS FULL STADIUM EFFECT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:29:25	@zestylime i have a lot of feelings about that jumpsuit and the sparkkles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:24:26	This must be the "okay time for a few local commercials" break.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:20:25	My inner techie's all up in this jam, eagerly rubbing it's hands together.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:11:57	These teams are punting like desperate, tired, end-of-the-match beginner rugby players.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:06:19	There's some kind of cruel irony that a show which was perpetually delayed by football got cancelled during football. #TheGoodWife
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 09:03:24	Now that was a hell of a run. Hot dodging damn!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:59:08	@ohheyitsal me neither :( :(
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:57:50	I was going to tweet serious thoughts about widespread opioid analgesic use but now I'm stuck in TV sadness land.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:55:31	@ohheyitsal who's on the verge of tears i'm on the verge of tears fuck that sudden shit
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:54:53	WHY WOULD YOU DROP IT DURING THE SUPER BOWL
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:54:28	WHY WOULD YOU ONLY GIVE US NINE EPISODES WARNING
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:53:58	OH MY GOD NO TGW IT;S REALLY ENDING
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:52:31	That's right, keep showing dat Norwood return, product of WE ARE up in there
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:45:24	@darthraydor nope nope not okay
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:43:26	@darthraydor clearly none of us planned this well
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:42:19	@roomerholmes bases don't apply in this sport idk but glad somebody got it :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:40:52	Pretty sure the quarterback was up by that contact, but sure mr ref man
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:38:50	@darthraydor we're here to bring you the lulz
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:38:13	So we're calling second base "down by contact" now. Gotcha.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:34:55	@zestylime plot twist: that's the one thing we can all agree on
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:32:05	Handegg giving all the basketball fans out there something familiar to watch
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:16:42	The Key and Peele commentary is giving me life through all these commercials.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 08:04:33	@quarantedeux this I can't argue with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 07:54:18	@quarantedeux for what definitions of football is this request meant? start of play? quality play? shit gets interesting?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 07:45:47	@ohnikkers They're really very different games, though. Plus, I enjoy being able to pee and get a snack during the half.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 07:43:16	@ohnikkers I came to rugby late in life. Handegg I learned (literally) at my mother's knee. I do a lot of shouting about tackling, tho.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 07:41:12	@ohnikkers I like to think all my rugby skills came from early-life training at sample sales. Gotta keep your head up when you tackle!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 07:40:03	I'm not sure how I've never noticed how twiggy Peyton is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 07:37:52	Let this serve as your startling reminder that the Raiders were ever super bowl material
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 07:30:03	I'm seriously digging Gaga's Doctor Who cosplay.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 07:28:26	*flips a table in anger* Inclusion is nothing but hand service if you aren't going to box the sign interpreter into the picture
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 07:27:12	Wait what's the point of having a sign interpreter if you aren't going to show her?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 07:16:15	My inner Eagles fan is a connoisseur of booing, and that was a quality one for Brady.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-08 03:05:49	There's a ridiculous pleasure in watching my cat watch the kitten bowl. Rapt attention, team. Rapt.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 23:00:07	@quarantedeux the only ones who don't get it are the shitheads who're totally gonna die because the're so full of themselves
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 22:58:08	@quarantedeux It's nice to see so many men be like, "yeah, girl you're way more qualified" and not mansplain when she's learning new science
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 22:56:22	@quarantedeux One season in, I think what I like is how heavily they stress Scully's technical credentials from all sides
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 09:44:28	That's gotta be the highest compliment anybody could ever give my driving. They were so confused why I was so happy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 09:40:21	Today I drove some people to a thing and one girl was shocked to see that I drive a stick when we got there and I was literal *hearteyes*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 09:33:23	@tui_talk bamf bamf oh and also the hair looks good
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 04:46:58	@ohnikkers but i look at mom and all her siblings now they're old and I sigh sad sighs. Gonna have to marry a big family!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 04:45:38	@ohnikkers after three different cancers, we're all just happy to still have her negl. Plus after college mom swears she's happy for one :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 04:25:18	@ohnikkers all i've got going for me is one kiddo wasn't the plan. chemo kinda shot that one in the foot.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 04:24:06	@ohnikkers this. a hundred times this. getting old is going to suck. out. loud.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 03:58:04	@quarantedeux "After five hours I asked for All Along the Watchtower" man, I need to turn my BSG fan for this episode.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 03:45:09	@quarantedeux what took me so long for this
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 03:39:35	@quarantedeux DID SCULLY'S DAD JUST CALL HER STARBUCK I THINK HE DID HEADCANON: ACCEPTED
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 03:05:18	Not even scifi from the early 90's is safe from Mark Sheppard's ever-present face #TheXFiles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-07 00:45:42	@quarantedeux I want to believe there is more than one forest in Vancouver.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-06 12:35:46	@tui_talk Wait...which canes?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-06 12:33:44	Turns out it's super awkward to be the only one laughing at a Danny Kaye joke in a packed theater.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-06 12:32:06	There's a glorious extended Danny Kaye joke in Hail, Caesar! Of all the old Hollywood references, that one got me the most.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-06 05:40:20	@ljsgrace she was the research adviser I needed. Not the one I wanted, but the one I needed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-05 11:09:49	@tui_talk this every time this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-05 09:48:15	@tui_talk I love them so though, they're a recent discovery for me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-04 07:11:39	@tui_talk i started diagramming my thoughts to make them cohesive but then data got in the way #gradschoolproblems
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-04 06:57:10	@ljsgrace @melduckie @emmameador Nailed it: https://www. washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/ wp/2016/02/03/the-cdcs-incredibly-condescending-warning-to-young-women/ …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-04 05:57:02	@tui_talk ty ty I needed that perspective
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 10:29:15	God damn, Gillian Anderson. I say god damn.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 10:24:06	@tui_talk so this has all worked out with predictable hilarity
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 09:45:10	So, in related news, I've got a spare copy of Games Wizards Play. Anybody want it? I'm willing to trade!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 09:15:40	Hey @tui_talk remember that one time I thought my new YW book would come days late so I bought one and then came home to find it in my mail?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:38:27	@mizujada @ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 as you are, in theory, basically guaranteed to vote so you're worth the time to convince.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:37:30	@mizujada @ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 that info is definitely available and if you vote enough the candidates come to your house in primary season
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:29:21	@tui_talk jesus, I keep forgetting about this. imma get myself in trouble one day. I respect the forums and that space buuuuuut
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:26:40	@tui_talk the way the Twi-child were included, *those* were indeed the cameo we were looking for.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:25:39	@tui_talk I liked them for the reality of being at a thing like the invitational, but they were too big to serve that purpose cleanly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:24:03	@tui_talk but if you've going to spend all that time on somebody, either give me somebody I know or spend a little extra on some backstory
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:22:39	@tui_talk Clearly the new inclusions are going to be Matt and Lissa, but I have like zero knowledge of them outside of their sexualities.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:22:02	@tui_talk yet it felt like Ronan was discarded in favor of characters we don't know well at all in this book.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:19:56	@tui_talk but if i've just finished rereading all nine books and I can't identify the characters you're including, they aren't core enough.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:18:55	@tui_talk plus DD seems to stalk the hell out of it. Shit, maybe it's time to crack open my LJ again to get these feelings out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:18:09	@tui_talk and *thats* what makes it not work. I look forward to seeing Mehernaz in future adventures but bc we've had time with her
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:15:40	@tui_talk also re: characters I think the team worked even in WaW bc we got to know everybody really well. Not so with this batch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-03 02:13:27	@tui_talk well, if I ever wondered why we managed to stay friends, your near-identical inital reaction pretty much explains that one
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 23:52:04	@maryrtaylor10 we call 'em them same thing in amish country. And yet, we're the state with The Groundhog. Pittsburgh, man.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 23:37:34	@selenay @Antiqueight @dduane I'm sure somewhere there's room for a delicious conspiracy theory involving driving kindle sales w/great books
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 23:02:07	@tui_talk and who knows, maybe T&C are canon, but after Nita's reaction to Mark, I'd venture she isn't ready to see it yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 23:01:03	@tui_talk upon further reflection, I'm revising that opinion re: Lissa. It was nice to see shades of the explaining struggle in her.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 22:08:52	@tui_talk this about an asexual character so very badly. It was a little preachy with all the explaining. It's nbd why make a thing about it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 22:05:27	@tui_talk fuss in a way I found unrealistic. Kind of like ticking off the diverse characters list with no real outcome. (It pains me to say
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 22:02:33	@tui_talk also re: that scene what I loved about Lifeboats was the casual, no fuss attached nature of the use of hae. But this was a lot of

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 21:48:42	@ElectricVandal IT IS 600+ PAGES AND IT IS WONDERFUL #GWP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 21:44:59	@selenay @Antiqueight @dduane well, there are some small upsides at least? Amazon just kind of scoffed at me :(
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 21:43:42	@ElectricVandal YES YOU DO IT IS DELICIOUS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 21:42:14	@ohnikkers @brittania_ my inner theater tech just spent some time wondering why you'd name a class front of house BC I am theatre trash
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 21:37:57	@tui_talk right? Seriously it was king of heavy handed on that subject. Harry? Sure, but with Pluto? At a professional con?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 21:33:30	@tui_talk YASSSS that placement had me so excited for a hoooot second
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 21:29:08	@selenay @Antiqueight @dduane I ordered mine months ago and discovered it won't ship until today. So I canceled & went to the store instead!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 21:19:12	@tui_talk that was the very first thing my roommate asked me the first day in welly and I had absolutely no idea
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 16:54:04	@tui_talk I totally just did, but there will be such consequences tomorrow. Today. In three hours when my alarm goes off. Whatever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 16:52:12	I have many, many thoughts on #GamesWizardsPlay , but sweet artificer was that worth the wait. Thank you, @dduane !
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 16:46:27	Dear self, you are no longer 17 or 21. You cannot stay up all night to finish the newest #YoungWizards book anymore. No love, tomorrow me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 16:41:54	@tui_talk MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 14:45:01	@tui_talk have you had success with Amazon yet? I'm trying to convince myself that I really do need sleep
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 10:16:00	@tui_talk dude I'm jealous of me this kind of thing never happens! I'm lucky I had to make the long drive to get my hair cut and stopped by
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 10:14:13	@tui_talk yeah, she wasn't that committed to the idea either
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 10:13:17	@tui_talk the chick who rang me out kind of halfheartedly said, "oh, it's new? We should've waited until tomorrow"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 10:11:42	@tui_talk it is at least in shops through human error/laziness
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 07:50:23	@tui_talk today has certainly been a literary rollercoaster
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 07:49:59	@tui_talk ehh I had a lab thing pop up so I won't get to it till tomorrow. Drove a hour for...a wash, I guess.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 06:56:38	Even better: #GWP is huge! This is going to be *such* a treat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 06:54:19	Screw the last novella in my YW reread, I found Games Wizards Play at the local bookstore so after so many years IT IS TIME

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 05:36:16	@ljsgrace @eroconnor in PA if you've registered as an independent you can't vote in a primary. Dems in dem primary, and vice versa.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 05:10:52	@tui_talk dear amazon you said you would deliver on release date not ship on release date let's end all this fuckery kthxbi
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 04:47:59	@tui_talk W E L P looks like I have extra time to finish, my copy of GWP won't make it for several days. Thanks, Amazon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-02 02:04:20	@melduckie @ljsgrace they're certainly easier to keep bandaged!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-01 22:12:01	Nine books and two short stories down, one novella to go! (And a short story, if I can find it) One day to #GWP ! #theveryfastywreread
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-01 21:32:10	@tui_talk right! Makes sense.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-01 21:16:30	@tui_talk they've all expired :(
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-01 11:49:22	@tui_talk dear self: you've purchased this eBook three times because you keep losing it. Have you lost it again?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-01 11:29:36	@tui_talk kk gimme a few
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-01 11:26:35	@tui_talk are you doing an ebook download?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-01 11:25:55	@tui_talk d'you want it? It's a cute, quick thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-02-01 11:25:16	@tui_talk I can do Lifeboats tomorrow! And maybe tuesday morning before my amazon box arrives

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-27 02:04:34	@mizujada vertical transmission avoidance is 100% science win, yo. The rest gets worse for entirely social reasons, and that's harder to fix
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-27 02:00:41	@chidorme @mizujada @ljsgrace more people should be. If you thought the closed Ebola borders and quarantines were bad try an aerosolized bug
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-27 01:55:53	@mizujada @chidorme @ljsgrace honestly, I think it hinges on our ability to get HIV under control.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-27 01:50:10	@mizujada @chidorme @ljsgrace I mean, I'm not afraid of catching it. But there are places I really wanted to go that I've removed from list

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-26 11:41:37	@quarantedeux @AuroraMoorealis actually no, I'm turning on all the lights because the x-files are almost too scary for me

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 09:21:48	@chidorme I grew up in a house with a Joe Paterno statute in it. It's still prominently on display, actually.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 09:18:20	@chidorme I would pay actual, real money to watch this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 09:17:09	@chidorme yessss. Also me at Georgetown.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 09:16:35	@chidorme I can't tell if my parents are happier that I'm doing a PhD or that I finally went to Penn state
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 09:14:52	@chidorme I was that way at Georgetown. Now, though...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 09:12:07	@chidorme NAILED IT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 09:10:57	@chidorme this was the start of my season of wanting to kill everyone around me, because the purple kept getting worse as the season did
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 09:08:01	@chidorme I watched the ravens lose to some terrible team in a bar and someone yelled at me and told me I had to respect bc they won the SB
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 09:04:41	@chidorme where were you when they built houses all over all the farms
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 09:00:37	@chidorme we've ended up with all of bmore that didn't want to pay md state taxes so they moved up 83. Not a good mix.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:56:46	@chidorme I'm proud of eagles fans, we usually only throw bottles in our own stadium. And frequently at our own team.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:55:43	@chidorme indeed! Moving back at the start of the season after the super bowl did *not* help at all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:52:58	@chidorme very, very true. And you had Toronto come out of nowhere. There was no room for a residual miracle story.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:50:20	@chidorme I feel much the same way about many (not all!) fans of the football team of the city closest to my hometown.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:48:03	@quarantedeux happy X files day to youuuuu!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:46:49	@chidorme and they were *salty* about losing their Cinderella story last year!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:45:31	@chidorme with, of course, an exception for the cowboys. But they've got that bogus America's team narrative.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:44:04	@chidorme maybe that's it. As long as you're at least good, people will flock to the neutral and support you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:39:00	@chidorme your points make a good case for why the Colts saw such a surge when they were doing well
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:37:46	@chidorme I had to look it up to remind me and SWEET LORD THOSE COLORS no wonder they're so womp womp
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:32:02	@chidorme He loves day-glo neons and his Yankees cap. Wizards Holiday is by far my fave of the Young Wizards books, entirely because of him.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:29:59	@chidorme huh. I think you're right. Packers, cowboys, patriots. Or maybe logos- Alabama too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:26:50	@chidorme sidebar: i'mre reading a book where a pine tree-shaped alien takes a real liking to Yankees caps
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:25:31	@chidorme true! That always throws me. I wonder if the Yankees had, say, O's colors would it spread so far?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:22:52	@chidorme yet nothing like that happens to South Africa. I've always suspected that green and yellow combo turns people off.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:21:25	@chidorme they were 7000 miles from home yet they had home crowd advantage. That black jersey, man. Universal appeal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:19:44	@chidorme when they played in Chicago last year (?) more than half the stadium was in black, not in USA rugby colors.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:17:42	@chidorme that might explain the truly exceptional bias in that selection. The ABs have dominated rugby in a way no team has in any sport
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:13:53	@chidorme or that they're teams which people choose to love, rather than inheriting from family or proximity
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:12:26	@chidorme the cowboys haven't been better than ehhh in a long, long time. Yet people all over still love them (boggles the mind)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:09:52	@chidorme there really isn't a ton of broad Steelers support, either. Unlike, say *shudder* the cowboys.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:08:59	@chidorme a good spot! And it's easy to wear team garb if one of the colors is black.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:03:58	@chidorme *sidetracked eagles jersey* yes, yes it is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:02:02	@chidorme but are they iconic because they're simple, or are they iconic because of the team?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 08:01:05	@chidorme yeah, chiefs are straight fire engine. The niners are the middle ground between them
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:55:34	@chidorme I don't mind either. The oranges are what tendencies to get me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:54:57	@chidorme those teams also happen to be excellent. I need a beloved team that's just good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:46:12	@chidorme all simple uniforms in inoffensive colors. Easy for everybody to love.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:45:30	@chidorme so I started thinking about other sports, too. The Yankees, all blacks, real madrid and man u
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:40:04	Now @chidorme 's got me thinking about uniform appearance and universal team appeal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:37:22	@chidorme as a Penn State fan, I have great appreciation for strong leadership in the defense
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:35:48	@chidorme strong argument for Ware
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:32:25	@chidorme very bland. Totally workable, but ehhh. Could explain part of their universal appeal though!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:30:14	@chidorme and the rags bring the jewel tones! Better than jets or packers green
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:27:43	@chidorme Fair point! I really like green (iggles iggles, natch). I would defame struggle as a bmore sports fan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:24:22	@chidorme I actually like that one. It's a refreshing pop in a league of brown-hued primary colors.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:22:49	@chidorme this. The Broncos colors are the same as our local high school. Same broad color distribution there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:21:40	@chidorme Washington's blood brown. And the dolphins blue! Eesh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 07:19:34	@chidorme I mean, that's one hell of a primary color.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 06:31:18	Snowed in, so I wandered down to see some snowllercoasters hersheypark https://www. instagram.com/p/BA79zpGGHi5/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 06:10:23	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 same. And I bet it's gonna be better than this game. I swapped over to figure skating. I HATE figure skating.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 06:03:10	@chidorme halfway through the chiefs-pats game I had such a beautiful vision of the future.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-25 05:59:45	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 I'm so proud of the NFC, rocking the new teams, breaking outta the persistent narrative

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-24 08:20:07	@GainesOnBrains the more you know: http://www. weather.gov/gsp/snow NWS has a specific setup for it over at HIA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-24 08:14:33	@GainesOnBrains Frederick is well north of 30" by now. So we're just #1 on this list?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-24 08:13:20	@chidorme @mizujada @melduckie looks like Hburg beat the all-time record a few hours ago at 28.6". Man, am I glad I shoveled all day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-24 08:08:17	@chidorme @mizujada @melduckie apparently we're at 28 inches? We were only supposed to get grazed, maybe 10 inches!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-24 07:51:51	I think I'm losing my #drunkstar momentum. Aside from the hour-long shoveling breaks, I keep getting Starbuck's-inner-pigeon eps. *sigh*

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-15 06:38:40	@quarantedeux I literally threw up after I hung up when the guy from NASA called to ask me to come in and interview.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-15 06:38:11	@quarantedeux !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-15 06:25:18	@ljsgrace mine is hella picky about how it needs to be set to sync properly. always has been *sigh*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-15 06:10:08	Hell, if nobody else wants it I'll take a stab at the Eagles head coaching job.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-15 06:04:13	@quarantedeux *crosses fingers, spits, sacrifices a virgin out an airlock*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-15 06:03:22	@quarantedeux @AuroraMoorealis omg why do we not have these things in amish country

86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-14 21:49:15	*digs up Alan Rickman audio book* This is happening today.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-14 21:48:38	This one hurts like a punch to the gut.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-13 11:20:09	And people *want* this job? https:// twitter.com/TIME/status/68 7108069235527680 …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-13 11:16:05	@pineapplecakes ayooooooo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-13 10:14:25	Today was kiss a ginger day and clearly no one is rising to their responsibilities. Everyone's so quick to kick you!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-13 10:12:25	Two books and one short story in; seven books, two short stories, and a novella to go! #veryfastywreread
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-13 02:30:41	@ohnikkers @ohheyitsal I'm a naked 2/basics 1 girl, although I'm hella pink. May need to investigate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-13 02:29:23	@tui_talk that...is an eclectic mix. And not all hockey cities!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 22:54:47	@ljsgrace eep! Hope everything is okay!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 22:53:26	@ohnikkers which one?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 22:51:33	"Go ahead! Panic! Do it now and avoid the June rush! Fear death by water!" #youngwizards #theveryfastywreread
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 22:18:11	@tui_talk whaaaaaaat. If you're internalizing one team, that is not the one to have.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 21:58:48	@msbshoshani this is only acceptable if it's a self-devitional
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 21:54:48	@ohnikkers get it lady! You'll slay, I'm sure.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 21:52:38	@msbshoshani ...wat
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 21:51:57	One book and one short story down, eight books, two short stories, and a novella to go!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 11:34:42	@tui_talk the comedy in the start of this book is the perfect antidote to my Fred sniffles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 11:33:10	@tui_talk "It's okay, there aren't any sharks here. And if there were, I bet I could talk them out of eating me!" Famous last words.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 11:12:16	@ljsgrace I'm really enjoying this continuing story
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:43:13	@tui_talk brb i just plot bunnied myself
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:42:32	@tui_talk they must have been close together because those wolf-demons came across super easily
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:39:35	@tui_talk #entropyandchill
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:39:11	@tui_talk excellent point. Nita and Kit just happened in on the human-obsessed one
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:38:05	@tui_talk but why the human reality? why not some other species? there are so many!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:37:19	@tui_talk is it just a shell for the observer or does it imply a (v chilling) closer human relationship with the LP?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:36:03	@tui_talk so here are my thoughts- if someone other than a human had ended up on the Other Manhattan, would it have still been Manhattan?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:34:42	Less than a month to read nine books, three short stories, and a novella before the new #youngwizards book comes out. Who wants to join in?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:27:52	@tui_talk SAME. I think I have enough audible credits to audiobook all but two with the ones I already have.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:24:59	@tui_talk Yeah! Maybe I'll finish my other audiobook tomorrow. Okay one month, nine books, three short stories, and a novella. LET'S DO THIS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:23:02	@tui_talk yeeeeah. Plus there was a lot of crazy going on in my brain. And I was finishing uni. Really there was a lot in the way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:21:44	@tui_talk well, I'm audiobooking. I busted through SYWTBAW in about a day, listening to it while I do experiments. I'll prolly finish DW tom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:19:59	@tui_talk I'm in panic re-read mode. I'm about to finish SYWTBAW, but I can wait to move on to DW if you want a re-read partner!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:18:53	@tui_talk Fact: I bought it AWoM the day it came out, broke down sobbing at the PM dedication and took almost a year to read it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:15:43	@tui_talk RIGHT??!!? I am on /high/ excite. It's been, what, five years?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:11:03	It's been fifteen years! I thought I'd had all the thoughts about these books!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 10:07:40	I was definitely not expecting all the new thoughts my #youngwizards re-read in preparation for #GWP is giving me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-12 06:46:36	@chidorme I sometimes get, "Have you accepted breakfast as your lord and savior?"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-11 12:09:00	@LizCanTweet @chidorme It was 100% my bank and not the card purveyor. It'll totes get sorted, I know it!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-11 12:07:06	@LizCanTweet @chidorme Every time I've booked tix through the @Amtrak app, my bank has iced all of my cards for fraudulent purchases
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-11 06:15:48	@MaggieEBPatrick @ljsgrace mine makes me feel trapped while encouraging me not to be. Hmmmm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-10 06:05:43	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux first stage of grief in the truly delusional
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-10 06:05:15	@quarantedeux I share the legit concern about the drop in original prog on TNT but if R&I is the only show you watch there are bigger probs
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-10 06:00:18	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes "it's coming back in february so it's totes going next" yeah okay sure you stick with that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-10 05:56:23	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux i just heard about the end of R&I and all those fans claiming MC will be next and I laugh my evil laugh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-10 05:30:34	Summertime #notmycat would fit happily in the box she just tried to nap in. But winter #notmycat has too much fur and doesn't fit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-08 09:53:21	@stevebragaw good to know there's a reason I can't find any to give career talks!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-08 02:59:28	@stevebragaw Things I wish I'd known I'd want to know back in government class: does congress/supreme court use science advisors for policy?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-06 08:34:43	@mmdahlia27 if he's nauseous, he defs has a concussion.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-06 08:33:21	@maryrtaylor10 welcome to the DANGER ZONE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-06 08:32:10	@maryrtaylor10 they've got it on tap across the street and it's very dangerous
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-06 08:31:25	@maryrtaylor10 soooooo delicious
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-06 08:23:01	@mizujada @quarantedeux and I have been known to use random number generator to pick BSG episodes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 13:15:01	@pineapplecakes I need a snowflake gif
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 13:12:23	@ljsgrace @Dgrace11 same size cat, plus a rug you can literally lose a hand in
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 13:09:43	@ljsgrace @Dgrace11 although fair warning that was summer, this is now: pic.twitter.com/X2A9yBWPAp
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 13:05:52	@ljsgrace @Dgrace11 I figured an adorable face can only contribute to the argument
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 13:04:55	@ljsgrace @Dgrace11 she has currently has > 2. I think she's got half my parent's neighborhood letting her in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 13:01:19	@ljsgrace @Dgrace11 oh, DEFINITELY #campaigncat pic.twitter.com/rpvoiznXbk
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 12:51:40	@darthraydor @ohnikkers gladly! don't wanna accidentally get any arbor mist in it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 12:45:47	@darthraydor @ohnikkers I would not be surprised if there's an export ban on that foulness outside of the us
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 12:44:07	@darthraydor @ohnikkers somehow they fit a pineapple, five pounds of sugar, and alcohol content into the bottle.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 12:01:19	@leiaxorgana thank god, there will be company.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 11:57:17	Two days ago the low was 46F. Tonight it's 12F. That escalated quickly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-05 11:52:37	@ljsgrace I think I missed this- what exactly is the #campaigncat mission?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-04 12:02:35	Guys, the bar fights are gonna be GLORIOUS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-04 11:58:42	Next year the Eagles play both the Ravens and the Steelers shit's gonna get real around here real fast and I'm all pic.twitter.com/w49IHogl8g
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-04 07:02:10	@pineapplecakes they're a good example of why we can't have nice things
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-04 06:55:51	@pineapplecakes gross
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-04 04:05:45	So many colors, so few set pieces. So much 60's. https://www. instagram.com/p/BAFtMyeGHhA/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-03 04:13:11	@pineapplecakes thx thx
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 23:37:15	Yes, mom, I know the last time you saw Penn State play Georgia we won the national championship. Yes I know the TaxSlayer bowl is depressing
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 23:02:18	@tui_talk and from two different accounts! I'm so happy the peacekeepers wars was already there for me to find.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 12:15:44	@darthraydor holy motherfrelling frell there are tears all over my face but that ending was so happy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 11:53:02	@amonarr8 @ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 I know how much I spent on bras today, and I assure you some homeless/abused/etc woman will be so grateful
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 11:50:22	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 @amonarr8 both are viable options! It's early enough to retool and still stay in the spirit of the resolution
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 10:08:25	@darthraydor I'm happy they've found Jools for the victory lap but I just want to punch Stark. He sucks without Zaahn around
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 10:01:59	@darthraydor YASSSS I have so much to look forward to!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 09:47:31	@darthraydor I can only imagine what a homicidal rage I'd've had if I'd watched it live.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 09:43:03	@mmdahlia27 send me the clips you want gifs of
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 09:40:15	@darthraydor I have discovered this. And a glorious miniseries it is, ten minutes in anyway.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 09:10:28	What is resolution?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 09:08:11	YOU DON'T END A SERIES FINALE WITH A 'TO BE CONTINUED' CARD WHAT THE HELL FARSCAPE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 09:07:12	WAT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 08:24:19	*cues up the last episode of farscape* *sighs heavily*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 05:12:23	@pineapplecakes thank god predator watch doesn't sponsor a bowl game
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 04:51:47	@pineapplecakes innit just tho
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 03:56:34	If nothing else, 2015 brought the theatre. McD with @sonacroi , my first prof lighting offers, many new shows, and Dat Perfect Tempest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 03:34:30	It does a broken brain good to hear someone with the same break speak frankly about the costs of hard-won sanity. Thank you, @carrieffisher
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 03:31:48	I'm thankful for all the Star Wars hoopla because it brought me @carrieffisher 's comments on the cost of sanity. I feel them very deeply.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 03:29:36	@quarantedeux oooh yes! anything to stop me from lazy-watching whatever shit TNT puts on after
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 03:25:27	@quarantedeux I'm very bad at keeping my mouth shut, but anytime you want to ramble for half an hour just holla
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 03:20:46	@quarantedeux thank you for expressing this because it was also a truth of my shitty year as well
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 03:19:50	@quarantedeux 2015 was the year I got to see this in person and that was a really cool thing
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-02 02:42:37	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes and they say the internet is tearing us apart
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-01 15:42:54	@tui_talk ME TOO ME TOO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-01 15:42:31	My finest hour RT [locked] highlights from 2015, @funkasarusrex meme w/ former president JJ of #SweetBriar on a wrecking ball made the list!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-01 15:38:52	@ljsgrace I wonder where Dean Green fell?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-01 15:38:24	@ljsgrace YEAHHHHH BUDDY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-01 13:59:21	Seriously they're chilling inside the Houlihan's it's the only goddamn thing in the center of town
86232435	funkasarusrex	2016-01-01 13:56:55	Thank you @CNN for the gift of heckling the presenters broadcasting from Hershey.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-31 11:52:39	@TheLBDofficial Can ya'll turn off the auto-closed caption on the complete playlist? They lag and turning 'em off each video is a drag.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-31 01:05:43	@ElectricVandal do you and @gilesdraws know of anyone who might volunteer?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-31 01:02:01	@ElectricVandal I mean, yes, but I'm so tired of them happening to me. It's absolutely absurd.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-31 01:00:06	@ElectricVandal I think I'm never taking Steven anywhere ever again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-31 00:02:32	@ljsgrace @mizujada @mmdahlia27 they usually don't do it until the adult/permanent teeth come in
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-31 00:01:34	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 @Lil_Pdubs many have fluoride in them http://www. nidcr.nih.gov/oralhealth/Top ics/ToothDecay/SealOutToothDecay.htm …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 23:57:33	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 @Lil_Pdubs no, she means something different. My dentist also recommend sealing to my parents. It's done well.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 20:36:24	@ENbrian especially in the parts of overwhelming whiteness and conformity where else need the most help
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 20:27:49	@darthraydor YAAAAAS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 10:17:15	I'm not sad we're losing Chip Kelly. I liked that he did something different, but brother has no business on player selection.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 10:15:11	@melduckie someday, I'll rent a place with a bathtub. Kitty is snoring on my boobs and I'm only three episodes from the end of farscape!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 10:06:55	@melduckie Have one for me? My antibiotics are anti-booze too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 09:59:27	@sonacroi I can't get him into his carrier unless he's hella sick. He has a harness and gets belted in like a dog when we drive.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 09:58:10	@msbshoshani thank you. All I want is a drink and instead I get antibiotics.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 09:55:59	We're all home, unharmed, still breathing, and the only imp thing I lost from my wallet was my old NASA pass. All's well that ends well.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 09:53:59	@sonacroi He'd half wiggled out of his harness enough to get loose and drag the whole thing with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 09:52:25	Have cold-induced asthma attack while laying on top of cat while face-first in the mud and pointy weeds.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 09:50:46	Cat runs into bramble area between off ramp and road (thank god not into traffic!). Make chase. Narrowly catch leash, tear leather coat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 09:48:51	Pull off, walk side of interstate w/flashlight. Find wallet. Dash into traffic. Collect wallet debris from guardrail. Open car, cat jumps
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 09:45:18	Walk back to gas station, beg for phone. Wait. Get gas. Go back to petsmart. Still no wallet. Remember weird road debris on interstate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 09:43:58	Run out of gas. Call AAA, phone dies while on hold. Pack up cat, walk to gas station. Realize no wallet. Walk back to car. Still no wallet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 09:42:44	Today in this-only-happens-to-Caitlin: my evening. Take cat to petsmart. Dogs chase cat, terrible time had by all. Get stuck in traffic.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 03:22:58	@quarantedeux yepppp. @Hallmark employees at more than one store.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 02:36:34	@ElectricVandal I can ship it before! Domestic straight to you at Gally might work best.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 02:35:05	But I'm still pissed I'm only missing one in the entire 20+ year set bc mom could only find the not-white ornament and wouldnt buy it for me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 02:33:27	If I cared, I'd've been careful when I picked it up. I like to let chance decide which one I get, not my own biases.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 02:29:51	Five people made damn sure to point out that I'd picked up the non-caucasian holiday Barbie ornament and redirected me to 'the one for you'.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 02:27:22	@ElectricVandal do you need it for gallifrey?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 01:08:02	@ElectricVandal yay! I also have your Four scarf!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 01:00:01	@ElectricVandal just leave a little room in your suitcase when you come! I've got so many spare copies!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 00:57:10	@ElectricVandal I can probably fix that, if you have any form of ereader capabilities (I use an app on my phone)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 00:50:01	@ElectricVandal although I can't shake the feeling that sywtbaw is a better place to start
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 00:49:37	@ElectricVandal @gilesdraws I'll read it with him! I haven't reread it in ages!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 00:17:21	Derpface McGee got a heated cat bed for krimmus and he's spent the morning moving between it and me testing for warmth and softness.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-30 00:10:15	@ElectricVandal YAAAAAAAY RHIOW AND SAASH AND ARHU AND URRUAH
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-29 23:49:09	So how exactly does one stay home and recuperate when diseased? I think I'm not supposed to be doing work? Maybe?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-29 20:54:32	@ljsgrace this guy, man idek.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-29 10:06:04	I didn't so much get a diagnosis as I got Oprah running around my organs yelling, "An infection for you, and you, INFECTIONS FOR ERRYBODY!"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-29 10:04:43	Doctor's verdict: I shouldn't go to work because I'll get the mice sick.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-29 09:04:53	@ElectricVandal next up: make that Ted Cruz hotline bling
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-29 05:40:40	@maryrtaylor10 and if I'm careful about where i speak groom i can pass as not conjested.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-29 05:38:43	@maryrtaylor10 not actively dripping out of my nose. Only needing to blow my nose every twenty minutes or so. Low enough to pretend
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-29 05:19:28	I contained my mucus to a socially acceptable level yesterday but my head still feels like it's about to pop :(
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-29 05:17:31	When they give you an upper respiratory sheet at the doctor's and you ticket yes on every box but three.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-28 19:08:37	@chidorme terrible. My car kept me from @LizCanTweet and other awesome humans BUT at least it wasn't cold and I wasn't stranded overnight!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-28 19:02:22	@brittania_ I knew there was somebody else in here in that bench of shame!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-26 03:20:51	Especially with a crowd who's been singing and playing together on and off for 15+ years. Such pretty music!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-26 03:13:33	a handful of other singers and instrumentalists we've known for years. Nothing -nothing- is better than impromptu 5 part harmony
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-26 03:11:20	I forgot how much I like singing at church. Mom and Istayed to sing a second mass bc there was no one on the schedule and accumulated
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-26 03:07:40	A blue, furry Charles Dickens who hangs out with a rat?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-26 03:04:35	The god of mucinex? The god of tissues? The catholic god? The god of fisherman's friend? Marcia Thom? Fifteen years of cantoring? Tea?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-26 03:01:16	I'm not sure which God to thank for getting my singing voice through two masses this morning without incident, but many thanks to it.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-22 10:24:59	This week's #majorcrimes is about a rejected grad student gone homicidal. This killer's motivation is all too easy to understand.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-20 15:31:11	@mmdahlia27 this is my exact opinion. It's delightful and weird, but not The Thing. But I first saw it at 25.,

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-20 12:49:26	@mmdahlia27 stop motion was around long before, but i think it was the first one to hit after the resurgence of animation in the 90's
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-20 12:44:58	@mmdahlia27 I still can't believe how old this movie is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-20 12:43:35	@mmdahlia27 ready when you are!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-20 12:42:22	@mmdahlia27 I should have that in me! It's been a long time since I've seen it.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-20 12:40:48	@mmdahlia27 Charlie Brown is on abc ondemand? There was this terrible looking movie with cats on Netflix I nearly watched earlier.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-20 12:35:45	@mmdahlia27 I'm also happy to share my hbo. Classic, comfort, or new? We could hate watch a terrible christmas movie?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-20 12:27:49	@mmdahlia27 I can't do Hulu. But the others work! Movie? Christmas special? Christmas episode of a tv show?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-20 12:26:02	@tui_talk probably.Although a few theatres are starting to have it, especially for high-impact releases
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-20 12:24:34	@mmdahlia27 I'll watch something along with you!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-17 08:59:13	@chidorme *punches grad school depression with the declaration of independence*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-17 08:50:16	MOTIVATION, I FOUND YOU EVEN THOUGH GRAD SCHOOL HAS STRIPPED YOU FROM ME AND CRUSHED IT TO A PULP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-17 08:48:57	And I'm just so fucking motivated to graduate right now you have no idea. So I'm staying late to get a few extra things done.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-17 08:48:22	Guys, I sat through a meeting tonight with people who do almost exactly what I want to do who're offering an internship in it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-17 08:47:20	@darthraydor @sonacroi the struggle is so very real.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-17 08:38:58	@darthraydor @sonacroi okay first, hnnnng, second, yes this. Thank god I'm plus size I know i can't have it y'know?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-17 08:35:49	@sonacroi @darthraydor and the plan for this bag when Lana gets a different, equally fabulous stylish/practical leather tote is...?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-17 08:27:16	@darthraydor @sonacroi I 100% support this plan 5 stars
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-17 08:25:05	@darthraydor @sonacroi exactly. Houses!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-17 08:22:13	@darthraydor @sonacroi is your current practical/stylish leather tote about to fall apart in a way which cannot possibly be repaired?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 11:12:06	@ohheyitsal THEIR COLLECTIVE ACTING FACES I had a moment of deep feelings in my empty bitter heart.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 11:04:34	@ljsgrace @melduckie the good wife and the Muppets. Would make this decision again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 10:40:32	@ohheyitsal ELIIIIII GOLD DROPPING SOLID GOLD BOMBS MY. GOD.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 02:34:03	@quarantedeux the best medium is the one which reaches people! But gdi you're gonna make me get on tumblr
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 02:30:48	@quarantedeux there's still one more ep for some form of outcome. Maybe?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 02:30:11	@quarantedeux yeah totes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 00:32:23	@quarantedeux yes! I wasn't expecting that turn, but it's been a nice one. ALL THE NUANCES OF SITUATIONS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 00:31:21	@quarantedeux and we spend some time with the rest of the team who we haven't seen all season.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 00:30:28	@quarantedeux from your keys to Duff's ears.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 00:29:30	@quarantedeux yeah but he was just outside all along. Rusty knows the ins, could be interesting and nuanced, not a vendetta.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 00:25:12	@quarantedeux or land him a job at the local paper and make him an antagonist trying to call them on their admittedly sometimes dodgy shit
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 00:23:59	@quarantedeux judge pubic hair would not stand for it. Send him to college and Fritz him for special appearances.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 00:16:34	@quarantedeux Well, that and while I love Rusty his feature to the exclusion of everyone else bugs. I want Buzz, Amy, Sanchez, Tao too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 00:15:03	@quarantedeux that's it. You've nailed my core concern with this show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-16 00:09:17	@quarantedeux yes this. Throw .e a bone, show me something! Implied development only works if you show some too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:54:48	@quarantedeux we've learned so much about everyone else, but bringing in an obnoxious ex hubby doesn't actually tell story
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:52:57	@quarantedeux I just want to hear her story from her. Too much is just implied, I feel like I barely know her character.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:50:37	@quarantedeux thankfully we met Closer! Sharon and know she's the boss of her own shit. Without that intro I'd be concerned
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:46:29	@quarantedeux you figure, everything we know about Sharon is in the context of someone-Rusty, twatwaffle, or Andy. Not just from her.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:43:31	@quarantedeux not that we see much of her. I get it, no Kyra, more ensemble. But that doesn't mean no Sharon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:42:35	@quarantedeux idk if I'd call it the main ship but it's the ship which involves what's ostensibly the main character.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:31:29	@quarantedeux *reads next week's summary* a NEW romance? YOU CAN'T EVEN HANDLE THE ONE YOU HAVE NOW
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:30:38	@quarantedeux indeed. Good to give them common ground.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:24:19	@quarantedeux compared to the last trial, this one seemed hella rushed and choppy too. I was hoping for a common cause :(
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:19:40	@quarantedeux I wonder if they moved eps around and had to quick chop for continuity
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:16:42	@quarantedeux T H I S. We went from nothing to hella domestic to BIG MISSED MOMENT to nothing and it all feels like it's out of order
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:14:54	@quarantedeux IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AT THE TIE FACTORY LOOK AT THE PASTEL BLOOD OF MY TIE ENEMIES
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:12:34	@quarantedeux truth. Although that slow burn doesn't require the suspension of disbelief that the rest of it does.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:05:11	@quarantedeux I DID NOT disjointed watching jamming up my vibes. Taylor cockblocking to get his ties back
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:03:12	@quarantedeux truth. It's like Duff can only write nuanced platonic relationships with depth
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 23:00:24	@quarantedeux the family coalesces! I'm forever about that found family narrative, it's so important.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 22:57:01	@quarantedeux related: I got home around 4AM, imma sit here in lab and have feels if I'm the first one here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 22:55:37	@quarantedeux wait. I am confused. And sobbing over that dad with the baby doll and Tao's empathy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 22:53:18	@quarantedeux there's a serious element of harsh reality to that moment, the lopsided nature of caring y'know ?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 22:51:44	@quarantedeux oh fuck my bitter ginger heart, these feelings are unacceptable Tao

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 00:55:39	@quarantedeux i'm dreaming of a pasty white in shorts Christmas
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 00:52:13	@ljsgrace @mizujada I... yeah, I'd give all my money to the dodgiest corp on the planet no questions asked for bras that do what i want
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-15 00:46:58	@ljsgrace @mizujada I get that small startups aren't going to accommodate a 46H, but I feel for my >DD sisters in smaller band sizes.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-14 07:14:18	@chidorme I got dragooned into providing muscle for a wine store stock up trip that turned into a stealth xmas gift trip for gpa's wife
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-14 07:12:08	@chidorme the far south end, Ft. Myers. My cousin came along, so it's been a fun adventure.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-14 07:06:36	@chidorme I did! I traveled to visit my grandpa, and Florida is lovely.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-14 05:49:34	@brittania_ this is a true work of fuckery
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-14 02:11:08	Okay, old people. I'm in. @Bokeelia Fishing Pier https://www. instagram.com/p/_PdfKmGHkl/

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-13 07:49:47	@maryrtaylor10 good girl
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-13 07:43:40	I'm starting to understand this whole Florida vibe, even with all the humidity. @Four Mile Cove… https://www. instagram.com/p/_Nev4fmHt8/

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-12 13:19:21	Well Florida, so far you're dark and making my lungs close up. I have moderate hopes for tomorrow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-11 13:06:55	@chidorme @ljsgrace I...really need to reevaluate my device naming priorities.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-11 13:02:16	Frantically trying to find passably matching, passably clean socks to visit the grandparents: the struggle could not be more real.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-10 05:37:47	@quarantedeux that's the way to make people pay attention to your protest
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:45:54	FUCK YEAH NFC EAST NOBODY HAS A WINNING RECORD COME AT US BRAH
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:45:00	@maryrtaylor10 they're going to come take back my eagles jersey
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:42:58	Okay, that was beautiful. Respect to Bailey, that sailed in like butter.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:41:00	Me, on my couch, rooting for the cowboys: a portrait of a woman in deep, soul-shattering crisis.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:38:05	@zestylime fair fair. I'm rooting HARD for Dallas rn and fuck I don't know what air is anymore is up down is life anything is football
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:35:49	@zestylime I cannot fathom Washington being way atop the division I just I cannot
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:35:03	@zestylime NOOOO KEEP THROWING THEM TO...well, nobody.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:32:03	@ljsgrace is this the real life? Holy Lord yeezus cowboys did you just do that?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:26:44	@ljsgrace on a less funny note, please do not ever hesitate to ask me this bc sometimes it's necessary
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:25:27	@ljsgrace the cowboys are 3-8. There's no hope. But if Washington falls, it's a 5-7 three-way for first in the division.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:23:22	@ljsgrace redskins are atop the division. They're tied with minutes left in the game.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:21:18	I can't believe I'm about to tweet this, but COME ON COWBOYS GET IT GET IT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:19:18	@quarantedeux I think there's also some worry too. I want to keep you around long term don't go breaking yourself style y'know?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:16:49	@quarantedeux buuuut it opens the door for a romantic cohabit instead of a necessity one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 12:03:32	@quarantedeux @leiaxorgana it's so great up to the last like five minutes. Then it just gets trippy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 11:50:37	@ljsgrace that's the one thing which save me! Too many people in there this time of year! Nobody to teach me about candles!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 11:48:53	@ljsgrace I just like to go learn. And smell. And want.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 11:48:34	@ljsgrace they're 100+ hours of burn, much better than the double wick ones. There's an outlet nearby, it's a problem.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 11:46:07	@ljsgrace I'm hunting for a not-Christmas scent. When I do, my list will also be set :) Did you get all large jars? They're the best value
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 11:39:58	@ljsgrace once you find the right scent, those suckers are worth the indulgence 1000x over.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 11:35:22	@ljsgrace Dude I burn mine year-round. It's wonderful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 11:31:04	@ljsgrace which scent? Mine is mistletoe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 10:28:59	@LizCanTweet @sarahnathan7 I'm definitely spending all winter as The Bear. #sowarm pic.twitter.com/dssasyM7EP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 10:03:38	@quarantedeux next week might be a bit dodgy, depending on what time my flight takes off.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 10:03:06	@quarantedeux I TAKE IT ALL BACK
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 10:02:43	@quarantedeux wait this isn't the last one??!?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-08 10:00:57	Made it! Exactly in time for the last #MajorCrimes shenanigans of the year! Headed to @drunkasarusrex , as usual.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-06 06:52:44	@mmdahlia27 you could probably download a program to run them on your desktop! They must exist...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-06 06:51:37	@ljsgrace I have faith in the christmas cactus, but the some kind of evergreen is..well...crispy.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-06 06:50:19	@tui_talk I walked 20 miles overnight for charity once and ate it before we even started. People kept flipping out. *sigh*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-06 06:48:27	@ljsgrace dead plants @Kmart update: I bought two. No discounts, let's hope I can nurse these guys back!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-06 05:13:26	@brittania_ SOMEBODY HOLD ME I AM NOT READY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-06 05:03:48	It's going to be in the 80's in Fort Myers next weekend I AM SO HYPE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-06 05:01:26	@mmdahlia27 check the app store. It should list what the app is available for.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-06 00:40:01	@mizujada @chidorme @ljsgrace I regret that I didn't fully realize the awesome my first year. And that I stayed out guion way all the time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-06 00:35:26	@mizujada @ashleyva90 hey, I'm a menstrual lady with answers!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-05 23:39:35	@IHStreet Character in one of my fave books is Fillif, a sentient tree who does magic by flicking his branches
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-05 00:01:22	@GainesOnBrains it's also a very fun one, in very small pieces
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 23:55:25	@GainesOnBrains I ask myself that all the time. I blame my mission to find as much happy as humanly possible to balance the grad school blah
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 13:58:17	@mmdahlia27 then just wait until you see my growling, flailing bread impersonation! You'll be on the floor!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 12:12:28	@msbshoshani if you're going to stand in the corner of goodwill and growling, it's important to explain your motivation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 12:11:04	@chidorme she was crying from laughter by the time I was done. My pennance for being such a grumpy bastard the morning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 12:09:04	@msbshoshani I'd be lying if I said I didn't consider it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 12:08:25	@chidorme I mean, I think if i hadn't offered an explanation for why I was waving my arms in the air and growling she'd've called the cops
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 12:03:51	Tonight I convinced a teen to read Shakespeare while running around goodwill in all the fur coats pretending to be a bear.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:57:11	@brittania_ fear 'roids then it would probably cut back on having no chill and be less hella responsive.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:54:55	@brittania_ so it makes sense, if say your amygdala is getting too much dopamine and is going to town on the DANGER ZONE and you cut off the
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:50:07	@brittania_ your primary reward and reinforcement dopamine gets triggered too and reinforces whatever your brain just did wrong.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:49:10	@brittania_ positive symptoms of the disease like paranoia. So something goes wrong in one dopamine pathway (prolly mesolimbic) and then
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:45:34	@brittania_ but there's this theory about dopamine and schizophrenia that it drives all thought processes and might heighten and reinforce
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:41:50	@brittania_ but we have absolutely no idea why. Dopamine regulates so much- reward, movement, executive functions, arousal (sexual and non-)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:39:10	@brittania_ ie, they know giving amphetamines (hella increases dopamine) makes schizophrenia worse, and blocking dopamine makes it better
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:37:21	@brittania_ maybe? They know exactly how these drugs work (what they bind to and how) but they don't know /why/ they work.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:13:55	@brittania_ that...was a terrible explanation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:09:02	@brittania_ the Big Scary side effects come at really high doses I was put on. At lower doses, those are few and far between.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:07:23	@brittania_ antagonists, stopping dopamine. But since it activates the receptor a little bit, it causes far fewer terrible side effects.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:06:07	@brittania_ dopamine receptor, so it just hangs out and gets in the way of normal dopamine, doing essentially the same thing as the old
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:04:31	@brittania_ agonist. It binds to the receptor and activates it juuust a little, less than dopamine. And it has much higher affinity for the
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:02:20	@brittania_ antipsychotics all work by blocking a dopamine receptor. That's what gives them all the motor effects. But ability is a partial
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 11:00:07	@brittania_ my pharm prof developed it. Made for some hella awk lectures where I refused to budge that it was just as bad as other atypicals
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 10:58:13	@brittania_ gotta love a class of drugs where that isn't too bad, right? Oy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 10:56:09	@brittania_ I'm happy abilify works for you! It worked little for me but it gave me akathesia-i couldn't stop moving the entire. time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 10:42:35	@brittania_ I put on 140 lbs in six months working out a med plan to keep me stable but idgaf it's worth it for semi-stability
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 10:40:17	@brittania_ I have an amazing support network, access to decent care, and, most imp, I don't have it nearly as bad as I could.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 10:39:13	@brittania_ Not well. And there really isn't a way to handle it, I'm lucky- I found a med I can tolerate (just kidney tox, no odd movement)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 10:33:01	@brittania_ I never realize. Mine are 'I HAVENT SLEPT IN 2 MONTHS AND IM PERF YES COOL LET'S GO TO PRAGUE RN' where someone has to stop me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 10:25:17	@brittania_ dude yes. I've gone 'consider hospitalization options' level manic three times and each one started in sept/oct. Bastard brain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 08:16:09	And is appropriate for the fancy work Christmas do!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 08:14:34	And lo, the dress gods did come down to declare let there be a dress which gives the fat girl a booty, displays the girls, and is under $50
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-04 00:01:48	@sonacroi I've only done it for lighting so I don't know that I'd be any good. But it'd sure be fun to try!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 23:19:45	@maryrtaylor10 I used to feel that way before my lungs decided to not work in the cold. I'll take moderately chilly, though!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 23:17:44	@sonacroi occupational hazard? Say away, I have this weird obsession with color trends.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 23:16:41	@sonacroi sorry I just have a lot of very strong feelings about marsala. Feelings of wanting to watch it burn.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 23:15:15	@sonacroi is that pink already a wedding color? They're blah and inoffensive, at least they aren't awful bloody hue messes of awfulness.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 23:06:23	@sonacroi baby blue and pink. Or dusty rose and serenity or some shit It's meant to be gender fluid (?) but idgaf it's not marsala so yay!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 22:23:52	At least it's not fucking Marsala. Fuck that hideous color, man.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 22:12:55	@mizujada @melduckie and the NIH has been very sparing with their funds ever since. I think NIAAA has done the most, but all guns & alcohol
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 22:09:52	@melduckie @mizujada it's all about that $$, and academia barely moves without federal funding
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 21:41:53	@brittania_ is it something about this time of year? At least 2/3 of my BD support group is reporting in with serious life disruptions
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 21:40:28	@brittania_ I'm in a different brainpan boat, but the same storm. I feel you. I feel you hard.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 13:55:21	@ohnikkers @brittania_ thank you all for this very important information
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 13:51:53	This time on the ridiculous virtual Shakespeare read, we're doing The Winter's Tale. Expect… https://www. instagram.com/p/-0Y7_zGHuz/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-03 11:38:10	@GainesOnBrains this speaks to me on a deep, existential level.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-02 13:04:13	@chidorme had he recently gotten off a plane? Is he a Florida native? There must be some connection!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-02 07:51:02	@IHStreet nah, not worth it for the pun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-02 07:39:15	@IHStreet not getting baked while you bake then?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-02 00:54:19	@mizujada but even those we have trouble with. It's one thing to demonstrate new technology in cells, but cells aren't body systems
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-02 00:35:00	@mizujada sure, you could clone one, but would it even survive gestation? (current thought is probably not, we don't know enough yet)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-02 00:33:53	@mizujada gene editing is a different things and that we're much closer to, but we can't control all the off-target effects yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-02 00:31:03	@mizujada actually it is news. Big news. We're still having trouble replicating complex organisms with normal life spans.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-02 00:00:16	Tried to change a tire in the cold and rain, didn't have the special bolt changer, got soaked. BUT found my hubcap so things are looking up!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-01 11:45:35	I laugh my frigid laugh from underneath two pairs of socks, three blankets, a duvet, and a cat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-01 11:38:48	Guy I have no desire to hang with again just called me a frigid bitch. It's literally fridge temperature in here rn I laugh at the accuracy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-01 11:24:07	@atmodrop Buzz and Morales in the back just here for the booze
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-01 11:20:08	@atmodrop @leiaxorgana Lord, I'm still sitting here like
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-01 11:19:22	@leiaxorgana the patriarchy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-01 10:55:20	@ljsgrace @Kmart I'm not unconvinced not watering the plants isn't an elaborate plot to sell pots.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-01 10:47:18	@ljsgrace but really, that's where every single one of my plants has come from. Nearly dead, usually at @Kmart . Poor dears.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-01 10:45:11	@ljsgrace but do I have pots for six Christmas cacti? Be honest, self.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-01 09:59:49	@quarantedeux rewatching this makes me realize I didn't properly appreciate chambray!Tao last week.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-12-01 09:11:37	Imma need somebody to talk me out of rescuing the already near-dead Christmas plants at @Kmart
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-30 12:26:59	@tui_talk hnnnng
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-30 12:25:19	@tui_talk but DAT SUN though how rare of a find in that in te aro
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-30 12:24:22	@tui_talk I was also comparing to one of the less-nice uni hostels too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-30 12:23:33	@tui_talk maybe? The years are long and my brain's a bit fucked, but I thiiiink it's the one. Weren't many of that height in Te Aro
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-30 12:21:21	@tui_talk I only went in once, but afterward every time I walked by I'd sigh a little and try to forget the hostel conditions
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-30 12:19:37	@tui_talk If that's the building I think it is from the ad, I think one of the people i paddled with lived there. Building was faaaaab
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-30 11:31:12	@maryrtaylor10 I had dreams about the flowering clubs for aaaages
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-30 11:25:54	@maryrtaylor10 I prefer skyfall, but those credits are the only thing on the planet Daniel Craig's face doesn't make better.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-30 03:30:08	@mmdahlia27 my dude too! It was cute at first but these days it's so loud I have to turn up the tv.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-30 01:10:01	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada I made paper chains out of shopping ads and a wreath of newspaper that first year, iirc
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-30 01:07:30	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada I got a few things from the target dollar bins the first year, and now I shop after Christmas every year

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 02:56:47	@maryrtaylor10 we're making my dad peel sweet potatoes while we watch the Eagles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 01:58:30	@ljsgrace we've moved onto the butterball hotline episode. Death penalty is at least less of a hot button issue.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 01:56:01	@ljsgrace also highlights the 'we'll take you if you're southeast asian but not southwest asian'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 01:40:07	I threw on Shibboleth for the heartwarming West Wing family moments and forgot about the refugee subplot. Broke my own no politics rule.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 00:24:45	@msbshoshani ...and apparently hiring every sound engineer from Broadway to man them all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 00:23:48	@msbshoshani I'm arguing for multiple mics on the same frequency repeating every few floats, mom's for fifteen identical smaller setups
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 00:19:38	@msbshoshani I'm totally sitting here arguing with my mom about how you might actually accomplish that feat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 00:09:00	@msbshoshani and all the wired mics on the floats too! And probably area mics for the bands. And and ...oh. lord.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 00:06:33	@msbshoshani I'm a lighting person, myself. But everyone assumes you can do both, so I've developed an appreciation for it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 00:04:51	@msbshoshani I'm amazed, terrified, and a tiny bit turned on by a console of that size
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 00:04:03	@msbshoshani you'd have to get them back or have a separate lav mic for each performer, right? But is there time for mic swaps with costumes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-27 00:00:25	@msbshoshani I just tried to figure out how huge the mic bay would need to be for the whole parade and my brain broke a little
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 23:55:06	@msbshoshani plus the power required to sing in that kind of outdoor venue will wreck what needs to do four shows this weekend.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 23:51:12	@msbshoshani lip synch. It's so cold some years, no way in hell vocalists are allowed to sing outside
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 23:43:49	@ljsgrace @IHStreet academia: where free time is only valuable when you need to give it to someone else.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 23:27:20	So who is Andy Grammer and why is he everywhere? Is he the new Michael Booby?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 23:24:31	@msbshoshani @quarantedeux I respect that our liquor laws were made in opposition to the end of prohibition but surely we've moved past that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 23:23:13	@msbshoshani @quarantedeux I stood in line for almost half an hour last night to get my mom peach schnapps.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 22:54:32	@msbshoshani @quarantedeux god bless states which allow alcohol sales on holidays
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 22:39:19	@quarantedeux in his defense, it's good beer in there somewhere. It's just hard to find under all the other nonsense.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 22:34:05	@quarantedeux He's so proud of what he's made. I prolly shouldn't be so proud of not voming
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 22:33:10	@quarantedeux send help. Dad's making me taste test all his awful dark hoppy high ABV brews and it isn't even 10AM.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 20:52:17	@IHStreet I was told I should work more than everyone because I don't have anyone to go home to. I'm in full treatyoself mode now in spite.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 10:07:02	@sorkinese I forgot about that one yes much detour such long way

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 09:57:54	@melduckie yep! Of the Clark? Not that one, the one from Indiana!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 09:55:45	@sorkinese you will understand why I yell at this movie when she has to take dupont to get from the hill to the white house. COME ON SORKIN
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 09:53:15	@sorkinese that's right. There are no words in defense of those found family feelings around the holidays.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 09:46:30	@sorkinese No,
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 09:45:04	@melduckie indeed! It's like a first draft. You can see the start of CJ and Josh, definitely. And all the names of senators and governors...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 09:41:03	"You think there's a florist in there planning an assassination on the off chance I might be stopping by?"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 09:28:12	"He's the leader of the free world. Hes brilliant, hes handsome, hes an above average dancer. Is it possible our standards are a tad high?"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 09:06:19	@sorkinese MORE BEHEADINGS AT THE WHITE HOUSE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 09:02:43	@sorkinese Sydney Ellen Wade is my thinner, more successful spirit animal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 08:51:17	@sorkinese you stop it with those feelings.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 08:50:46	"What is this, vegas?" "No sir, this is the white house." Early Sorkin, you were so amazing. @sorkinese
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 08:42:46	I picked the game (Rail Baron), mom picked the movie (The American President), and dad made the tarts. Verily, this is how to holiday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 08:40:11	@ljsgrace @madelineab i'll learn with you! those look amazing!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 03:09:28	Apparently if you want to buy a car and haggle the time to do it is this week at a VW dealership.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 03:04:19	I took my car to the shop today and wandered through the cars a bit while I waited. Every. Single. VW salesperson came over to talk. HALP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-26 02:18:16	@maryrtaylor10 I feel that. I feel it hard.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 21:06:49	@maryrtaylor10 I've been hype for this ever since they first teased the hulkbuster suit
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 20:41:12	@maryrtaylor10 I have such high levels of anticipation now. This might be my fave avenger sstoryline too

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 11:53:15	@pineapplecakes I'm so torn bc I want Bindi and sharna both to win
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 11:23:19	@IHStreet @Rachel_Bax @ljsgrace I started it. I don't know if I'll finish, it's fairly depressing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 11:00:18	@pineapplecakes that might be one of my fave dances of all time on this show
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:56:57	@pineapplecakes literally the only thing interesting so far other than the pros.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:55:55	@pineapplecakes I was wondering when you'd show up I had so many feels about the downton abbey dance and alternate handholds
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:53:01	@pineapplecakes they probably had to sit next to Paula Deen while waiting to come on
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:51:47	@IHStreet @ljsgrace I've done a little of that, but there's SO MUCH. It's nice to have starting points!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:48:30	@IHStreet @ljsgrace hahaha definitely, thank you so much!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:46:10	@ljsgrace @IHStreet I'm so glad I asked twitter!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:41:28	@ljsgrace @IHStreet @Rachel_Bax I did that one! I nearly lost it when they discussed the biggest news story to ever rock my hometown.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:40:34	@IHStreet these descriptions though. SIGN ME UP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:39:00	@IHStreet @ljsgrace I am the anti-hardwick but I'll be sure to try out the rest of these!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:38:02	@IHStreet I like good or innovative storytelling, trivia funny people, most things, realy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:35:11	@ljsgrace @IHStreet yes! I found all the NPR ones right off the bat. The hard part is finding the other good ones :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:16:36	@ljsgrace I'll give myself one and manicure along!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:13:29	@ljsgrace whoop!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:13:17	Twitter, you're into some pretty cool shit. What podcasts would you rec for somebody just getting into them?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:10:13	@ljsgrace on which instrument?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 10:09:15	@ohnikkers dude worth it for the bros. Provenxa has Flynn's power of attorney.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 09:48:21	@ohnikkers I audibled it when I had a concussion. I had to slow it down to keep my brain from hurting, but the player speeds up too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 09:41:20	@ohnikkers I listened to Craig's autobiography for the accent and dude the stories from when they were in a band together
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 09:15:21	All this delicious taste to soothe a bad day away.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-25 09:14:49	I bought a teeny, tiny piece of Very Expensive blue cheese as a treat and let me tell you team it's the best decision I've made in a while.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 12:33:55	@quarantedeux I told you I'd be happy to take those happy feels to the corner!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 12:31:12	@quarantedeux STILL WONDERFUL
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 12:30:34	@quarantedeux I have become that fan who sits in the corner and loves things nobody else cares about and I have zero fucks to give
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 12:28:53	@quarantedeux and so good so good indeed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 12:27:40	@quarantedeux except for Tao/new technology. That ship was woefully abandoned.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 12:26:17	@quarantedeux this ep dropped food to pretty much everybody. esp proflynnza stans (romantic or platonic, everybody gets a ship!)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 12:23:43	@quarantedeux all I saw in that moment was a win for hobbes/raydor shippers
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 12:09:44	@quarantedeux Godspeed into that confusing night
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 12:05:40	@quarantedeux so that was a top-notch episode until the last two minutes but they're making me not want to rewatch. Eurgh!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 11:22:59	@leiaxorgana @brittania_ *heavy breathing*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 11:20:32	@leiaxorgana @brittania_ but it's the right ha...WAIT WHAT IS THAT ON THAT FINGER
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 11:18:07	@brittania_ OH YES PLEASE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 11:17:48	@brittania_ also i'm v v happy for you and your otps even the ones that don't involve rivahhhhh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 11:15:33	@brittania_ maybe? Not sure. A woman can dream, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 10:05:54	As usual, monday mc madness at @drunkasarusrex
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 10:02:14	@quarantedeux BLESS YOUR FUCKING NERD HAT HEART
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 10:00:56	@roomerholmes I feel for you. That sounds like a harsh reality
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 09:56:42	@roomerholmes Michigan snowarrhea?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 09:51:34	@zestylime @roomerholmes oh lord we haven't even entertained the idea of snow yet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-24 08:46:43	@zestylime tempt me not, Satan. It's only a 9 hour drive. That's totally doable, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-23 10:49:21	ELI YOU ADORABLE GOOFBALL #TheGoodWife
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-23 10:23:22	Diane Lockhart is gonna punch a bitch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-23 00:20:37	@ohnikkers I saw two last weekend by accident which were okay. Pretty standard.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 23:49:27	@ohnikkers watching it now makes me sad for the days when Moffat wrote breakout women who OWN
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 23:41:19	@ohnikkers I'd highly rec if you have a show gap. Old school Moffat, Nesbitt & origin of 'biting is like kissing but there's a winner' line
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 23:33:19	@ohnikkers you should've seen me when I watched Jekyll.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 23:31:30	@ohnikkers hnnng
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:54:47	@quarantedeux @zestylime praise be el nino
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:52:16	@zestylime @quarantedeux she had like 2% body fat too, so no insulation. Worst of all possible temperature situations.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:49:35	@zestylime @quarantedeux I got a roommate from Ecuador in jan once and she kept it above 85. I slept in my underwear next to an open window.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:45:09	@zestylime lawd yes. We're only rolling in the mid 40's so rn that kind of heat seems unacceptable
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:42:38	@quarantedeux @msbshoshani although lbr it's just faffing about over which poor dem will get crushed in the general.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:41:31	@quarantedeux @msbshoshani there are some suuuupes interesting state/local races I'm looking forward to so the late primary can suck it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:39:26	@quarantedeux @msbshoshani we're the end of April- is Indiana in May?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:31:25	@quarantedeux welcome to weather roulette let's find out which season you're playing for this week.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:27:43	@rebecca_mill four years at sweet breezy shouting 'virginia isn't the only commonwealth' seems to be an ongoing tradition
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:26:07	@quarantedeux I feel like this winter is terrible improv prompted by "well, that escalated quickly"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:24:55	@zestylime all it needs is lasers shooting outta the lion's eyes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:23:07	@zestylime I haven't turned my heat on yet fellow cold-blooded welcome
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:20:42	@quarantedeux @msbshoshani although an unhealthy obsession with the later seasons of TWW didn't hurt
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:19:05	@quarantedeux @msbshoshani as the resident american I was expected to explain the paper during brekkie in '08. I learned, now I'm hooked.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:16:57	@quarantedeux @msbshoshani it can turn as things go. So if you suddenly sweep super tuesday you can really change your position in the race
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:15:32	@msbshoshani @quarantedeux I forget what the magic delegate #is but once somebody hits it the convention is p much decided
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:14:30	@msbshoshani @quarantedeux sort of. You go into the convention with the delegates you get from the primaries. Some states split by vote %
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:11:28	@quarantedeux @msbshoshani our primary is hella late. It'll be well decided by the time PA rolls around
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:10:26	@quarantedeux that makes things easy! PA is a party-based primary. Hence, there are almost no registered independents.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 11:08:17	@quarantedeux I'm seriously considering switching parties for the primary to vote for anyone but him.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 10:57:19	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes @msbshoshani bc they aren't terrorists they have untreated mental illness ofc
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 10:54:01	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes involving some uniform with giant tassled epauletes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 10:14:34	@ohnikkers plus it put bellamy's face all over my feed so i can't really complain
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 10:13:40	@ohnikkers ehhhh it did a nice job topping off my round of scilencing following recent world events
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 09:58:33	@ohnikkers this is what comes of having many childhood friends from a deeply catholic community *massive sigh*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 09:57:01	@ohnikkers SO. FUCKING. OFFENDED.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 09:55:35	@ohnikkers so after all the angry scandal shit on fb the last couple of days I'm enjoying watching you taking the fandom on
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 09:47:36	@quarantedeux unf unf
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 03:24:49	So I'm maybe glad I wasn't feeling well this morning and handed off my ticket to the penn state game
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-22 02:53:30	@mizujada WHOOO! I just scrubbed down the litter box!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-21 12:29:59	@SnippetsofSarah but the lights look faaaaaaaabulous
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-21 12:18:01	@SnippetsofSarah when mom quits, I'll quit
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-21 09:34:14	We've reached a new level of theater creeping up here in the booth. https:// instagram.com/p/-VB6YyGHuc/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-21 09:29:59	@quarantedeux sweet sweet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-21 09:20:07	...the result is both astonishing and depressing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-21 09:19:36	Spending the second act of this show trying to figure out how many hours I've spent in my high school auditorium.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-21 08:26:45	@quarantedeux whatcha makin'?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-21 08:25:47	@quarantedeux hnnnnng
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-20 21:58:40	@quarantedeux @brittania_ if you're putting money on somebody's sexuality you deserve to be relieved of it tbqh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-20 21:58:03	@quarantedeux @brittania_ some bitches I hated did that to me once and I had a friend get in so we could rig it to win.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-20 04:48:52	@GainesOnBrains I've watched too much Rocky Horror to be comfortable with that outcome. Esp since Meatloaf tends to be served w/ gravy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-20 04:42:53	@IHStreet @ljsgrace don't tempt me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-20 04:09:01	@ljsgrace I AM CURRENTLY SO VERY HAPPY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-20 04:08:41	@ljsgrace I HAVE NOT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-18 22:26:49	@mizujada that was my stop! I miss that Whitman every day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-18 09:32:21	@quarantedeux I love it even though there was very little Tao.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-18 08:23:58	@quarantedeux these are actual tears.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-18 08:23:14	@quarantedeux oh, fUCK Julio. My fucking heart.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-18 08:22:03	@quarantedeux I mean, his shirt was half undone so there clearly isn't much to go
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-18 08:20:27	@quarantedeux I'd put money on that. Bless them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-18 08:17:27	@quarantedeux I haven't been this happy since castle and Beckett got hitched.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-18 08:12:22	@ljsgrace I am...negative zero help but I'm happy to try!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 05:39:26	@ElectricVandal yeah after the third one I stopped trying with her
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 05:37:27	@ElectricVandal I shouldn't be laughing this hard, but I am. I had a breeder bite the penis off three different males. She wasn't having it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 05:34:35	@ElectricVandal shaken, not stirred?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 05:31:50	@ElectricVandal that's hella impressive premeditation from a hamster
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 05:26:21	@ElectricVandal I read that as 'brother severed my hampster's spine with his teeth' nvm
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 05:25:37	@ElectricVandal wait. What?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 05:21:53	@ElectricVandal it's a update on a little dude in out colony. I think his brother hates him.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 04:06:17	Reeeeeeeeallllly glad that's not my day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 04:05:52	An email update on a "traumatic removal of the penis" is not what I expected to roll in this afternoon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 03:53:48	@quarantedeux nobody ever said there weren't perks to being a scientist. Chemicals!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 03:48:03	@quarantedeux I think I've got everything necessary for body disposal and a spare set of hands, if you have need
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 02:22:29	@quarantedeux I haven't even touched the stress tests yet! Forced sink-or-swim test? Restraint stress in a meeting? Social defeat in hiring?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 02:19:03	@quarantedeux I'm having way, way too much fun with this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 02:18:32	@quarantedeux "Good guides gone bad: withdrawal following repeated exposure to quality mentorship in an incompetence fixed ratio."
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 02:15:06	@quarantedeux can you imagine the paper? "Breakpoints in a progressive ratio schedule of bullshit and following depletion of motivation."
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 02:09:46	@ljsgrace hahahahaha yeah, I'm a little worried about the levels of spider goo I'm gonna find up in those windows.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 02:08:38	@quarantedeux *looks at animal behavioral studies* *looks back* yeeeesss. If only you could put humans on progressive ratios for things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 02:05:47	@quarantedeux so a lot of psychology of corporate structures then?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 00:51:05	@quarantedeux also, what does that entail because that sounds really cool
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 00:46:20	@quarantedeux on the plus side, it's easier now! Or at least, so I'm told.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 00:28:24	@ljsgrace the next question is, of course, how to tackle this bad boy: pic.twitter.com/NjmCUrWBTi
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 00:26:13	@ljsgrace I think the patio door kits might do perfectly. not tall enough, but will at least do the top halves!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-14 00:16:27	@ljsgrace I was hoping to find thermal curtains for the bottom half, but I desperately need that natural light in the morning bc brain
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-13 23:59:17	@ljsgrace I'm thinking about sealing the top halves and then bubble wrapping half the bottoms so the cat can still see out
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-13 23:57:35	@ljsgrace they're also cracked and very, very old. They're original stained glass from when they expanded the church in the 20's.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-13 21:02:47	When you want thermal curtains for warmth but you don't want to block the light. Any suggestions, enviro friends? 9ft windows are a bitch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-13 10:48:59	@ohnikkers @pawneegodess we have them all over around here
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-13 09:12:01	Yeah, that's not helping with my light plot furball. pic.twitter.com/MpjKRzbUIT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-13 08:08:06	@ljsgrace I can understand how you would want a break from them after all the hoopla of birth
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-13 00:12:39	After six months of him bitching about people not attending? A year? Never? His behavior is 100% the reason nobody came back.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-13 00:11:09	At what point can you tell your advisor clinicians don't want to come to his journal club because he was rude and mean at the first one

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-11 04:25:45	@quarantedeux mine would probably just chuckle at me, thankfully. But I'd rather not open that particular rabbit hole today.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-11 04:24:17	@quarantedeux Maybs. At least the mice will never judge me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-11 04:22:31	@quarantedeux it's a damn good thing I'm the only one in lab this avo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-11 04:20:47	@GainesOnBrains ten sips of liquid
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-11 04:20:26	That sound? That was my reward system firing all at once. pic.twitter.com/mBn5zN3WIB
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-11 04:16:56	@quarantedeux @brittania_ *pulls self off floor* R I G H T
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-11 04:16:15	@GainesOnBrains thank you for validating my hiccup method
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-11 04:10:48	@brittania_ I JUST. I CAN'T. @quarantedeux make sure you see this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-11 04:10:23	@brittania_ THE SOUND I JUST MADE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-11 02:53:47	@mizujada idk who she is. But you could always get one that looked like you if you didn't want the characters
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-11 02:50:59	@mizujada you always could!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-10 12:58:56	Happy birthday to my lovely friend and sometimes partner in mischief @hobradshaw ! I'd say I miss… https:// instagram.com/p/95El9mmHr6/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-10 10:28:29	@ljsgrace @SJ_SaysSo @melduckie I'll do it alongside my reddit one, I'll keep to dates!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-10 09:59:35	@ljsgrace @melduckie @SJ_SaysSo I'm doing Redditch but I could be so tempted
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-10 09:58:52	*collapses on the couch, panting like a motherfucker* I MADE IT. And now for the regular monday Major Crimes over at @drunkasarusrex
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-10 05:06:51	@ElectricVandal of course! Time zones may make scheduling a bit tricky, but we can work on it!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-10 04:48:41	@quarantedeux @leiaxorgana @pineapplecakes cannabis cannabis pain mouse butts curve shift post hoc cannabis brains mush proteins. Done!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-10 04:34:08	@quarantedeux @leiaxorgana @pineapplecakes *writes faster to be done in time*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-10 04:21:25	@ElectricVandal we do group shakespeare reads!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-10 01:11:28	We're doing The Winter's Tale for the next shakespeare gchat read. If you haven't chimed in before and want to, let me know!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-06 10:15:29	@sonacroi when it comes back to me, totes. Mostly I was singing to the socks, I think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-06 10:06:44	@sonacroi something like that :) I maaaaay have sung a little song about tatonka toes when I put my buffalo socks on this morning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-06 10:03:25	Okay Boston you'd better not be fucking cold this weekend.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-06 10:02:43	@sonacroi I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TWEET THIS TO YOU
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-06 03:38:52	@pineapplecakes I am not worthy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-06 02:12:12	LUTHER DATE LUTHER DATE YES PLEASE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-06 02:11:03	@pineapplecakes hoooooooooo DAYUM
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-06 02:10:07	LRT: Another of the exhausting list of reasons to fund my research.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-06 02:04:52	@mmdahlia27 I got to add dinner with @HOBradshaw to sweeten the pot for me. That's always worth the hassle!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-06 02:03:54	@mmdahlia27 @juliusseizure It's bad, right, that I opened the tweet and started internally shouting about the Heaphy track?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 21:37:41	@quarantedeux there's an unfortunately a local trend to them. But I agree completely!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 21:36:25	@ohnikkers the struggle is real.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 21:35:24	@quarantedeux I'd vote for more likely to be bad because you can mask shit beer with hella hops.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 21:34:08	@brittania_ okay so apparently I've already watched that more than once because youtube picked up right in the middle whoops
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 20:58:37	@brittania_ YAAAAAAS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 20:49:22	@mmdahlia27 indeed it is! I did it last week, nearly 300mi for a concert, wouldn't 100% recommend it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 07:57:36	@msbshoshani I'm so ready for the 2016 color, you have no idea.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 07:53:21	@msbshoshani so that marsala color would have an entirely different context under the PMS system then
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 07:51:40	@pineapplecakes all hail the wonderful truth cakes from heaven
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 02:41:47	@tui_talk oh perfect! I think they're leaving next week so we should be good. I just didn't know if the month limit applied.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 01:35:29	@tui_talk and the only SIM I can get delivered before the wedding is a 2 degrees SIM
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-05 01:34:36	@tui_talk you use 2 degrees, yes? How long does a top up value last before it expires? (i'm getting a honeymoon-related wedding present)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-04 20:31:21	@chidorme although tbqh it's be mostly 'and today #dogcat learned to high five!'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-04 20:30:08	@chidorme derpface mcgee doesn't, but lo, the tags I could hash with him.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-04 13:15:47	@ljsgrace @diDiKimm @IHStreet it makes #bsgmarathon possible even now that it isn't on any of the streaming options!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-04 13:12:30	@ljsgrace @diDiKimm @IHStreet and the browser option allows streaming of...non-official things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-04 13:10:27	@ljsgrace @diDiKimm @IHStreet I like it more than anything else bc you can easily set the stream to be primary feed while others are talking
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-04 12:33:30	@ljsgrace I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but next time you want some company for #badtv ... https:// rabb.it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-04 10:37:58	@sorkinese My day was the kind of day where you wake up hungover and have to wear fisherman's pants, so this is the best news I've had yet!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 21:27:31	@quarantedeux @leiaxorgana gotta wait for the ribs to heal, natch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 21:27:10	@quarantedeux @leiaxorgana I...yes. this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 21:26:35	@leiaxorgana what I don't remember is if she just got divorced or if she got an annulment from Jack
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 20:48:03	@leiaxorgana rusty mcfreshface foodleface: much earnest, very hope, such doe eyes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 20:45:58	@leiaxorgana rule one: we're all full of shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 20:45:02	@leiaxorgana gotta play that raydor 'I'm a devout Catholic' card somewhere
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 20:42:31	@quarantedeux @leiaxorgana aged like fine wines
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 11:29:19	@quarantedeux I'll aim to only miss either next week or the week after- why'd I schedule my seminar on a tuesday? Poor planning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 11:26:09	@quarantedeux I prolly won't make it next week though- I'm giving a dry run of my research seminar early Tuesday morning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 11:24:55	@atmodrop @pineapplecakes @leiaxorgana truth. Very few things could make me look forward to mondays.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 11:14:52	@pineapplecakes @atmodrop @leiaxorgana closer and chill ladies?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 11:08:04	@pineapplecakes @leiaxorgana @atmodrop we give great mid-episode recaps
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 11:05:39	@atmodrop @pineapplecakes that sounds like a terrible halloween costume
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 11:05:04	@leiaxorgana @atmodrop @pineapplecakes it's been so quality lately murder room got it's groove back
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 10:01:49	Monday night, grab some Major Crimes over at @drunkasarusrex
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 09:18:21	@sklanfer true, although iirc computer sleep is much deeper than phone sleep/involves more shut down
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 09:13:28	@sklanfer nobody ever turns off their phone?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 09:08:44	@ohheyitsal people used to play to the amount they wanted and then stopped and checked out. It's playing incentive
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 08:57:22	@ULTA_Beauty is there a facility to send my favorites list to other people? or a wishlist I can share?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 08:54:40	@quarantedeux did I ten drive home at ultra speed? Yes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-03 08:49:53	@quarantedeux picture: you are me, known dipshit. You get in your car and freak out because it says it's 8:45. Good lord, I'm a disaster.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-02 21:40:09	@quarantedeux should be. If lab gets in the way I'll let you know!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-02 21:38:14	@quarantedeux
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-02 11:42:25	@brittania_ you've put a spell on us obvi
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-02 10:43:12	@GainesOnBrains I wanted to fav this, but I can't support these jokes, I think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-02 09:50:59	@msbshoshani fact. Feline overlords all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-02 09:45:05	@msbshoshani same. pic.twitter.com/kZvAIIlQx1
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-02 08:59:40	@chidorme you?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-02 08:58:06	@chidorme distracted and sleepy, but I have kitty cuddles, so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-01 14:11:09	@tui_talk *g* I've mastered few things, and idec that she's one of them.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-01 02:32:25	@IAmLazarusJones haha yeah. And even if he hadn't shredded it, I wouldn't relish getting all that fur our of a black dress
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-01 02:29:34	@IAmLazarusJones I'm polishing off my magenta costume- my cat decided to nest in my old one and shredded part of it, so time for new!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-01 02:28:30	@IAmLazarusJones reset yes, but not a successful one yet unfortunately.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-01 02:23:06	@IAmLazarusJones I did, although once I pulled out the bobbin to look for pieces I can get my bobbin to thread through again
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-01 02:09:50	@IAmLazarusJones no resistance, everything moving smoothly, but bobbin thread won't pull through and if it does it won't catch needle thread
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-01 01:32:24	@LizCanTweet @IAmLazarusJones turn out I didn't have to return the machine today (mine is missing a critical screw), so less emergency now
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-11-01 01:29:25	@LizCanTweet @IAmLazarusJones Needle broke, replaced but now bobbin won't advance. Missing needle chunk inside? Needle, bobbin in right.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-31 11:44:06	Hey twitter...can anybody provide emergency sewing machine assistance? I think I killed it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-31 11:01:01	Okay fall, I'm in. https:// instagram.com/p/9fHJuqmHgj/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-31 01:48:46	@ohnikkers go team backup plans though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 23:26:20	@ohnikkers how long do you have to wait to see it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 23:15:11	@ohnikkers totes. Especially since the west end run is long af (and very likely to be extended)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 22:59:55	@ohnikkers I'm holding out hope for a transfer to Broadway
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 22:59:22	@ohnikkers !!!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 22:35:58	@brittania_ @ohnikkers I'll be in my bunk.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 11:14:16	Pennsylvania: where candidates for state supreme court campaign on Penn State football connections.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 11:11:36	@chidorme ah, well. At least it provides me a fun game of how many different ways can you describe APG in one segment
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 11:09:42	@chidorme I guess local news only got video from below, and man the balls on that thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 11:08:29	@chidorme and all it got was central pa on a foggyass rainy day
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 11:06:32	@chidorme seems they had to shoot it to put it out of its misery

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 10:47:06	@sonacroi get it together itunes jfc
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 10:44:20	@sonacroi fxnow. At least I think it is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 10:41:37	@sonacroi it's on the app?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 10:38:01	@ljsgrace @chidorme @mizujada @mmdahlia27 good luck! You may need it. But you should have a lovely time
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 09:40:57	@mizujada straya?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 08:59:40	@brittania_ I'm not fine nope nope nope
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 08:31:45	@mizujada there are only two packets left. I opened the box this morning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 08:18:08	I've had so much tea today my near-empty brand new box of lemon ginger tea is judging me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 08:14:26	@UtzSnacks got two bags of dipping tortillas-one flat, one with fluffy, flaky chips. Flaky chips prob a mistake, but were 10x more delicious
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 02:05:33	@mmdahlia27 @ljsgrace @chidorme sticky tape is always sticky, even when you're not around!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 01:40:10	@mmdahlia27 @ljsgrace @chidorme the pans of water went in the places I actually needed to use w/o tape
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 01:39:30	@mmdahlia27 @ljsgrace @chidorme the sticky tape is the best. I slapped it on couches and hard surfaces- even the TV frame.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 01:38:17	TIL: old, expired, legit sudafed is still 5000% better for mucus. There may be some extensive cognitive effects though. Im singing to my cat
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 01:26:01	@ljsgrace @chidorme although I think I have the rare dog-cat. Never pukes, walks on a leash, does tricks, sleeps through the night so ymmv
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 01:24:17	@ljsgrace @chidorme I found passive training worked best with double sided sticky tape and strategic shallow pans of water
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 01:23:24	@ljsgrace @chidorme double-check the plants though, some are human approved but not cats.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-30 01:21:43	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes spark plug hidden immunity idol?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-29 09:15:29	@chidorme although this does explain all the low-level air traffic around lunch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-29 09:07:44	@chidorme I *cannot* stop laughing about the blimp. OF COURSE it escaped from APG and OF COURSE it's 'somewhere over Pennsylvania'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-29 08:54:30	@sonacroi I use it all the time for archer. Actually, I primarily station apps for catchup since my ondemand is awful. Good luck!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-29 08:53:07	@sonacroi the channel app. Fios has a shit agreement with them for content, but others are much better.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-29 08:51:58	@sonacroi fx now, rather
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-29 08:51:48	@sonacroi have you checked f2x now?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-29 08:11:48	Okay heavy mucus disease. I won't watch the debate I'll just curl up with my kitten

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-27 10:48:40	Yes, self. It was a terrible idea to start Greek from the beginning again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-27 06:08:23	@ohnikkers complex, multilayered, hero can do no wrong both actual flaws it's wonderful
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-26 14:18:08	Almost six hours of driving was worth it to hit double digits in @ColdWarKids concerts. All my faves and that Cold Toes hnnnnnng
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-26 07:48:20	@pawneegodess I have such conflicted feels but I love it as a whole. Go team ensemble cast!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-25 01:14:13	I mean, aside from the ABs reigning supreme. But I'm not used to loving teams that win, so it's more of a novelty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-25 01:13:21	Nothing has been more fun to watch than the Pumas upward trajectory since they joined the Rugby Championship
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-25 01:05:52	Vamos Pumas!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-25 01:04:06	Announcers: everyone who isn't an Aussie fan is going to back Argentina. God so true.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-24 07:51:24	@sonacroi oooooo which one?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-24 07:48:56	@sonacroi *applauds* it took me most of the year to do that at ulta :) I bow down!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-24 07:31:04	@mizujada *rings doorbell, straightens tie* hi have you accepted battlestar galactica as your Lord and savior?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-23 11:02:36	Actually did one of those stupid contests and I'm only sharing bc hoooo fuck they NAILED IT and I'm a tad terrified http:// bit.ly/1S04AYS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-23 10:57:14	@eroconnor it's always worth it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 11:38:30	@msbshoshani and I was so sad that I might be missing out on hella awesome
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 11:27:16	@msbshoshani I'm getting the feeling that leaving Chicago Tuesday evening was possibly the perfect timing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 11:26:34	I just really need someone to tell me if my theories are full of shit
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 11:23:33	Is anybody else watching Quantico?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 10:06:47	Steven freezes mid-hand rub and snaps his head back all, 'THE FUCK PUSSY DO I SMELL ON YOU THO'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 10:01:46	Cat sitting three other cats leads to some interesting betrayal faces when I get home.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 09:15:15	@ohnikkers Cliff Curtis for the narrator tho he could totally have no fucking neck
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 09:12:06	@brittania_ @ohnikkers jfc I missed the original context I thought you were just talking to nikki not about Nicki I''ll see myself out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 09:09:26	@ohnikkers @brittania_ focus of objectification and the character who wears makeup and heels cis strait female you erase most of that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 09:08:23	@ohnikkers @brittania_ part of what makes rhps great is the celebration of everything that isn't cis and straight and by making the primary
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 09:07:11	@ohnikkers @brittania_ yes. I've only rarely encountered rhps genderbending with anything other than cis straight women and it's awful
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 08:55:28	@ohnikkers @brittania_ which is very different from putting a straight woman into the role. Which is what i don't care for.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 08:53:54	@brittania_ @ohnikkers but if I caught the original context can we have an all-nicki cast with Roman and Barbie and anyone else she wants
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 08:50:42	@brittania_ @ohnikkers and now I'm anti genderbending because neckbeards ruin everything.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 08:49:45	@brittania_ @ohnikkers I was in a several casts where the genderbending was done solely to get more boobs onstage to look at
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 08:48:40	@ohnikkers @brittania_ I know! And it's glorious! But different...fuck i've been in too many poorly genderbent shadowcasts to be objective.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 08:45:46	@ohnikkers I want Nicole whippy for magenta only always
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 08:43:27	@brittania_ @ohnikkers and suddenly Rocky is just another woman being objectified for her looks been there done that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 08:42:58	@brittania_ @ohnikkers nope nope it ruins the original fluidity. Frankenfurter isn't alarming if played by a woman.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 05:28:29	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes this my Indiana-based lab has told me. The new jersey of Indiana, I think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 04:48:14	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux to me spending time in Terra Haute sounds like apocalypse
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-22 04:46:34	@GainesOnBrains there's going home and then there's spending time and man do I feel you
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-20 10:02:08	@quarantedeux You saved me! You saved me with beer! Is there any better way to be saved?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-19 05:56:09	Life is long, but few things are ever so carefully tailored to my aesthetic.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-19 05:55:32	Y'know if I get a chance to see another production as varied and wonderful as @chicagoshakes Tempest again in my life I'll be fucking lucky.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-19 02:57:18	I certainly couldn't have done better with my @chicagoshakes #under35 seat! Ringside! pic.twitter.com/hQwndXeoYL
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 23:59:39	Come on, Scotland!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 22:52:25	@ohnikkers I'm so proud of my rugby league (every team to the quarters!) but I really just want to watch Aussie burn so
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 22:43:09	@ohnikkers DO THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE PROUD
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 22:42:18	@ohnikkers come on Scotland absolutely trash Aussie!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 22:39:53	If you need me, I'll be spending the day feeling superior to the people who still want to toss Argentina out of the Rugby Championship

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 08:53:45	Since I was weaned on public transit in DC, I think I'll never not find it weird when other cities are 100% auditory notifications
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 08:49:41	@ljsgrace I'd ask if they have an easily accessible acct first, although they can cash it at a bank too
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 08:48:47	@ljsgrace acceptable but not ideal
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 08:46:03	Am I that creeper swapping seats on CTA to watch the game over the shoulder of an OSU fan? Nooooope of course not.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 08:39:11	@pineapplecakes same same always same
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 08:15:42	Oh. Right. Time zones.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-18 08:13:35	Hey Chicago, nice to see you, you look fine BUT HOW BADLY ARE WE LOSING TO OSU
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-17 08:03:54	@brittania_ better than slots though!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-17 08:03:27	@brittania_ but their stuff is so cheap :( I get the occasional super find at LB but I'm pretty much gambling every time I go shopping
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-17 07:25:50	@brittania_ @ohnikkers such a mess. It's all either black, bedazzled, or from the Coleman line I stg the struggle is R E A L
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-17 07:16:18	@ohnikkers or only short people are fat heavens no one would be large in every direction! The thought!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-17 07:10:54	@ohnikkers it gets worse when you're shopping in plus- then everything is cut short for reasons passing understanding
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-17 04:19:34	@mizujada seven extra men every turn but you couldn't hold it could ya?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-16 10:52:41	@sonacroi what wonderful people
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-16 08:33:06	'll I'm so excited I can't spell Shakespeare

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-16 08:28:47	@quarantedeux make the bad man stop
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-16 08:24:00	@chidorme @HOBradshaw I'll keep them because they employ an old nerd camp friend to write comedy columns. But only for that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-15 09:29:42	@mmdahlia27 he's like 'but isn't pussy supposed to go here?'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-15 09:17:15	@HOBradshaw I actually kind of dislike the main character (i think i'm the only one) but dat supporting cast hnnnng
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-15 09:15:52	@HOBradshaw one out of two acceptable? *holds wine*

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-15 09:05:35	@HOBradshaw the good wife gets points for still being on point without a break in season seven
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-15 09:04:08	@HOBradshaw the good wife. Although that's a hella high bar.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-14 10:32:53	Politics aside, when was the last time you saw people having an intellectual discussion with disagreements and enjoying themselves.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-14 10:02:40	@mizujada @ljsgrace especially when your friend curse you through twitter!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-14 10:02:11	@ljsgrace Anderson Cooper can read me footnotes any day
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-14 09:59:42	This is how you have a primary in a party that doesn't eat their own young.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-14 09:47:40	We need the most rabid, Clinton-hating prosecutor for these emails. Am I wrong, or is this a job for the US House of Representatives?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 21:24:34	@quarantedeux Conveniently also appropriate for major murrca-themed events.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 11:48:16	If this is Steven Colbert-created fan fiction, sign that man up for an Ao3 account asap.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 10:34:27	@chidorme that's when I hit them with the jimmy!ball
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 10:24:05	@chidorme skills: photo manipulation, poor control of ms paint, extensive cracktastic tendencies
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 10:16:38	@chidorme I just got distracted considering the hilarity in a portfolio for a terrible photoshop position.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 10:08:15	@chidorme you could limit it to papers/mags/pubs of record? Makes it feasible
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 10:04:43	@chidorme now that I've tweeted it I think I'm not joking.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 10:01:47	@chidorme do you need original meme-tastic graphics?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 08:17:33	@sklanfer I never realized they were the same person! I wanted to be her someday and I'll extend that plan to being an octagenarian too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 08:09:51	This...is a view. pic.twitter.com/GwVGEUXdQM
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 08:08:11	@quarantedeux it's a great one
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 08:02:50	I have a surprising amount of feelings about this, team.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 08:02:20	All that backlight, sharp shadows, and colored front light is a great way to obscure identity while performing as yourself on national tv
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 07:59:08	For a singer who's jam was being wholly anonymous, his lighting designer does a hell of a job trying to keep it that way on tv
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 07:56:07	Maybe I'll quit science and just go learn from whoever does @theweeknd 's lighting design https:// youtu.be/EPestjXw2nw
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 07:41:25	Thank you, jeopardy, for teaching me that Oleanna Tyrell was once a bond girl.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-13 03:46:23	@ljsgrace I figured if it happened to both of my parents on their very different machines, it's a systemic problem.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 22:24:00	@IAmLazarusJones for the content? It'd be the bone people or the giver, whichever my hand landed on first.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 22:04:11	@IAmLazarusJones my time with it just ended but someday it will come back. But that's just for the physical.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 22:03:34	@IAmLazarusJones my gpa's oldest sister kept a long correspondence w/ Margaret Mitchell. It'd be her extensively personalized copy of gwtw
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 21:08:43	@IAmLazarusJones while not my first save, that would be on a second trip. Wonder is worth it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 21:06:49	@brittania_ sometimes that messes me up too
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 20:47:13	@tui_talk only on a rare occasion. But I wouldn't be surprised to encounter the statement.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 12:19:44	Guys, I underestimated the absolute treat of a bed that doesn't smell like dank old laundromat machines.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 12:08:17	Fresh non-laundromat sheets and a warm cat? Let those small pleasures keep on rollin'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 10:31:50	@pawneegodess done!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 07:10:59	But I'm an advocate for anything that ends awkward phone fumbling.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 07:10:18	Negl handing out business cards is a great way to next level your pickup game.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-12 07:03:18	The cowboys quarterback didn't get saced, he legit just fell over before the defense got there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-11 20:08:37	@mmdahlia27 as far as bargaining chips go, that's a quality one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-11 20:07:08	@tui_talk I feel this this also applies to my morning decaf tea. It's the ritual?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-11 20:06:08	@darthraydor *bows down*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-11 20:02:30	@pineapplecakes @brittania_ @ohnikkers I'm so proud.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-11 20:02:16	@pineapplecakes @brittania_ @ohnikkers seems my Mom didn't know about the CSI finale. First q: 'Did Catherine and Grissom get together?'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-11 11:32:10	@msbshoshani YES THIS nothing makes me angrier than a parent on their phone yelling at a kid on theirs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-11 11:23:56	@msbshoshani I feel like a lot if these are 'you will not do to me your parent what i did to mine'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-11 03:28:27	@ljsgrace truth. But it's hard to update a driver when you can't get network connection!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-11 03:27:17	Can this week of @KeeganMKey hanging out with @GoPSUsports not end though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-11 03:23:51	We are, etc etc
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-10 19:50:11	It's NYCC weekend, and yup there's the 'last year you laughed so hard at the Met that you slobbered on the walls' reminder. attn: @tui_talk
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-10 19:46:32	@ljsgrace I'd rec having the Windows 10 qirelss drivers already downloaded to install. People keep having big probs.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 04:15:14	@petridishes *paul ryan receives a surprise barbell delivery* *john boehner bursts from inside* YOU LIFT ME UUUUUUUUP FROM THIS JOB
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 04:03:22	@petridishes I mean, nobody said you ever had to finish those speaker jokes. Just leave 'em in pieces!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 02:32:22	@mmdahlia27 you should be able to set your photos to save there in your camera settings. Otherwise, just move the files!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 02:30:27	@mmdahlia27 heads up takes up more than 1gb of room on my phone and i never use it, but I paid for it, so there it sits!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 02:29:46	@mmdahlia27 the irreplaceable can be removed, and the rest re-downloaded!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 02:29:31	@mmdahlia27 I keep all my apps on the phone storage and photos/music/videos on the SD. that way, when the phone dies...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:52:03	@mizujada @chidorme Position: Speaker, House of Representatives. Must be currently elected. 15+ years of cat herding required.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:48:58	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 SAME. I went through ALL the phones just messing in their menus to find the one I liked the most.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:48:09	@mmdahlia27 I also really, passionately hate the color of my phone, but it was a free replacement (with upgrade!), so ymmv.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:42:07	@mizujada how is this a government? How are these leaders?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:41:29	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 mine's a 32GB, I've never had less than 1GB free and i have a LOT of utter crap on there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:38:52	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 Do smartphones even come with less than that anymore?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:34:46	@mmdahlia27 Re: space, as long as it has microSD capability you can expand to your heart's content!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:33:38	@mmdahlia27 Also I love the lock screen design, that it's much harder to accidentally dial 911 than it was on my motorola.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:32:55	@mmdahlia27 Cons: no removable battery, fewer peripherals and cases (compared to samsung), stock messaging app can't handle group messages
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:31:15	@mmdahlia27 I'm super, SUPER picky about menu layout and color, because it's very hard to customize those interfaces.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:29:35	@mmdahlia27 I love mine. I have the HTC android flagship phone. Upside: metal, great camera, front speakers, and a simple UI I really like
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-09 01:25:36	@sonacroi clearly it would be shopping time at that point!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-07 10:37:36	@ohnikkers @pineapplecakes you should see me flailing in midair trying to find the shifter at red lights. It's shameful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-07 10:36:01	@ohnikkers @pineapplecakes I give everyone whiplash every time I slow down, slamming on the brake like it's a clutch
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-07 10:35:32	@ohnikkers @pineapplecakes confession: I can't drive an automatic. I have no concept of a car without three pedals.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-10-07 10:32:49	@ohnikkers @pineapplecakes you were the one who was talking about clutch skills! ;)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-25 08:08:57	@quarantedeux yes this very true, very true. Or get used...2008 I think?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-25 07:27:27	@quarantedeux but then again I'm consumer trash and I don't like change so I'll replace my bunny someday with another one.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-24 06:19:35	@tuttleturtle42 we are both still in EST, aren't we?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-24 06:17:46	@tuttleturtle42 @tui_talk the cruelty of age is not being able to stay up to finish books like you did the rest of the series.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-24 05:55:05	@tui_talk so there's time for flailing about the super casual use of non-binary pronouns because I was flailing
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-24 05:53:34	@tuttleturtle42 @tui_talk I get the feeling that may have happened to all of us in our respective time zones.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-24 05:50:01	@tui_talk I was only going to read a little and then go to bed. So many mistakes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-24 05:48:04	@tui_talk clearly I am a terrible friend who has failed in her duties. Also, I live tweeted it a little bit so avoid that.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-22 10:22:26	@quarantedeux I'm far more intrigued by the stroh in the ad at the end
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-22 10:21:58	@quarantedeux I had to wait for a break in castle. It looks like it's just teasing one ep though

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-22 10:01:43	@pineapplecakes I mean, I watch while I'm waiting for castle to start
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-22 10:00:17	@pineapplecakes but they all just babbled nonsense at the dancers
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-22 09:58:36	@pineapplecakes what is this show that was the first time I've seen lots of actual ballroom dancing in a dance
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-22 09:40:26	@NathanFillion I've never been so happy for rain
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-22 09:33:48	@quarantedeux SO FUN! This trip will have a little bit of all of my favorite things!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-22 08:49:37	@quarantedeux so I got my months mixed up and for a hot second I thought MC was coming back while I'm in chi town. I was so excited, man.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-22 05:32:54	@M23projects Awesome, thanks!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 11:00:48	@melduckie 95% bullshit. I have a few pieces from there that justify them. And the bra I wear every day. If only it came in black!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:48:43	What a time to be alive.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:39:32	@sorkinese here, take these feelings you just gave me. Take them and feel their pain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:35:59	@brittania_ @darthraydor and where do I get my hands on it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:34:35	So take your #PlusIsEqual shit and shove it. You're not following your own new mantra.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:31:11	You do the exact same thing all the other bra manufacturers do, making plain, basic shit for anything over a D.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:27:43	Sure, you make sexy bras in three two band sizes larger than Victoria's secret. But large cups? They're all basic bras.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:26:03	Okay Lane Bryant, bullshit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:23:34	Okay fuck you GoT. I love you, but the Knick is absolutely stunning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:22:31	Wait, the Knick got nominated for something? Fuck yeah!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:20:14	OH HELL YES UZO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:20:00	There's basically no way for me to be mad about this winner. They're all stunners
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:13:22	@HOBradshaw @ColinHanks it made watching him as a big bad in dexter all the more freaky af
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:12:10	@pineapplecakes well at least Colbert took a couple of them
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:09:06	@ohnikkers not at all. But I've never found Kristen wigg funny.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 10:00:54	@ohnikkers thanks? Then phone. But I will never get bridesmaids.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 09:58:54	@ohnikkers I think so. Although I like more of her thanks bridesmaids

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 09:44:27	No but really I've never had an emotional reaction to an in memorial segment until it was about tv shows.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 09:41:08	This is the worst in memorial segment ever. What are all these feelings?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 09:01:51	@chidorme my new favorite thing is Keegan on whose line. He's my faves regular comic addition
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 08:00:05	Is this the real life?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-21 07:59:53	Wait. Why are the football guys interviewing celebrities on the Emmy red carpet. What. What is even happening?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-20 11:41:52	@ljsgrace much appreciated, as always. She's got like two weeks before her job wants her up there so at this point any help is huge help
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-20 11:04:54	Hey Seattle twitter, my bestie is moving to Seattle and is having a hard time finding a place from New Mexico. Any resources you'd rec?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-19 11:03:32	Blatant and constant bashing down of the fourth wall, and those sudden, forceful scene transitions. HNNNG those transitions hnnng
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-19 11:00:37	Okay, Once. Despite the plot you won me over by having all of my faves. Beautiful music, all the lighting changes, weird abstract dancing,
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-19 07:58:26	Well played, serendipity. Well played. pic.twitter.com/tFFxakMe4Z
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-19 07:56:15	Made a snap call to go see Once (touring in town), another snap to buy a ticket off someone, ended up in the front row. I love everything rn
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 13:55:41	Middle of the night good news from my bestie is the best news. But now somebody needs to stop me from impulse buying a plane ticket.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 10:23:22	@ljsgrace @chidorme @mizujada I was bullied extensively until I switched schools in Jr high and mildly after. Unis meant one less target
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 10:21:00	@madelineab I can't wait!!!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 10:20:08	@mizujada @ljsgrace @chidorme but we had at least...ten shirts, eight sweaters, skirts/pants, plenty of room for sartorial choices within
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 10:17:19	@mizujada @ljsgrace @chidorme I chose that life, and I didn't mind it. It took a lot of the anxiety out of high school.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 10:13:15	@ljsgrace @chidorme @mizujada I legit miss them, but I only had them in high school and there mere lots of options
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 10:08:26	But where is Alice?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 10:03:37	@chidorme @mizujada @ljsgrace I've never been as appreciative of uniforms as I am right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 08:45:30	@HOBradshaw Probably. Although last night I learned separation of powers isn't a thing, so there's that to look forward to.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 08:43:47	@HOBradshaw I don't remember, but I don't think so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 08:42:00	New life headcanon: all these people got engaged today because it's constitution day
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 08:37:39	@HOBradshaw but also it's a random-ass thursday in september. I can't figure out what brought this on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 08:35:14	@HOBradshaw Right? If I ever get home tonight, I'll be cuddling my kickass cat
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-18 08:33:36	So that's *counts* four people who've gotten engaged today. What the fuck brought this on?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 11:59:52	When the world seems awful, the pervasive positivity and support of ninjas warriors makes everything better.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 10:23:31	CNN's like shit shit cut off Ted Cruz before he commits to undermining separation of powers as president.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 10:20:18	Or maybe conservatives keep losing because nobody else wants what they do.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 10:17:54	Anybody else notice that the men are allowed to talk when they interrupt but the woman gets forcibly talked over?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 10:15:48	@chidorme God bless that talking pubic hair
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 10:12:20	Has Huckabee been here the entire time? I missed the first half.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 10:11:01	@petridishes wait, what? You mean all the godlike presidents weren't conservatives?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 10:09:01	A republican just invoked Kennedy while standing in the Reagan library. What a time to be alive.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 10:02:37	You shouldn't feel safe up there Trump, because they're all this close to punching you in the face.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 10:02:03	@ljsgrace this is so true. Fuck me, I think I'm having respect for everyone who's fucked off with trump
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 10:00:17	No but really what is this feeling. Is it...a shade of respect for Marco Rubio? This is so weird.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 09:55:15	You know it's bad when Marco Rubio is holding you to task.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-17 03:44:15	@ohheyitsal some people just want to watch the world burn
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-16 11:29:10	@ljsgrace I'm thinking about expanding my toolkit so I can be prepared, if necessary, to burn everything with fire.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-16 11:16:40	The season has begun. If you need me in the next few months, I'll be killing millionleggers with as much prejudice as humanly possible.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-16 09:38:37	@ljsgrace @mizujada I'm going to have to go with Toby on this one. Hubris, belief that the gods have conspired, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-16 09:24:50	@mizujada the vibe I got for Biden in the interview is he doesn't want to run/recognizes he doesn't have it in him right now
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-16 09:20:38	@mizujada either that or he's giving Biden a grand yet subtle 'no' platform
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-16 09:14:02	We're eating pumpkin goat cheese on triscuits and drinking chianti. I guess we're making basic middle age a thing.l
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-16 01:51:27	@ljsgrace there's always an upside to getting your money back sooner.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-16 01:48:27	@mmdahlia27 @ljsgrace my mom explained all of this to me when we remodeled in high school and it all made complete sense but I've forgotten
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-16 01:47:40	@ljsgrace they often require a larger down payment. Also, lower risk- you're not leveraging your money out as long.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-15 19:14:18	@chicagoshakes absolutely! I can't wait!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-15 10:46:48	Shoutout to @chicagoshakes for their Under35 program. I was dying for a ringside seat to the Tempest, and I got one I can afford!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-15 09:28:28	@drewhamm5 it's all just an elaborate ploy by chip Kelly to fuck with our angry, bottle-throwing, boo-loving heartstrings
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-15 09:22:47	I don't know what I just watched but it was glorious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-15 09:21:45	@drewhamm5 we didn't two quarters ago, but it's amazing what a halftime can do for realizing your own potential.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-10 02:32:34	@HOBradshaw truth. It's truly a wonderful book-I've bought more than ten copies because it never comes home from a lender.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-10 02:29:03	@HOBradshaw I would add it to empty slots in endcaps and displays. Reshelving hurts my soul a little.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-10 02:26:58	@HOBradshaw I was one of those people. I also convinced someone to buy it instead of the other. If you're that oblivious, you deserve it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-10 02:18:10	@HOBradshaw Shades of Grey (NOT 50 thereof) by Jasper Fforde. It's my favorite.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-08 10:35:23	@tuttleturtle42 so worth it. Branches at Christmas and GWP so soon, I feel so spoiled!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-08 10:34:30	@tuttleturtle42 1/3 in and no POV changes, so I think it'll be all Kit. A nice change!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-08 10:19:10	@zestylime my exact reaction
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-08 10:15:09	@zestylime the running gag was that I was getting better at deepthroating than any band camp could ever provide.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-08 10:13:44	@tuttleturtle42 sorry I'm just having a lot of feels. It's been so long since there's been something substantial and it's everything I love.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-08 10:02:19	@zestylime and such odoreaters. I legit wasn't allowed to bring mine inside. What'd you play? (we've said this before, haven't we?)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-03 06:03:09	I'm not saying drugs are too $$, I know what cost goes into drug development. I'm just hella happy I've been lucky enough to have support

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-02 02:35:54	@mizujada I saw that...somewhere. It's perfect for this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-02 02:35:21	@mizujada People who say 'save the rainforest' aren't saying 'fuck all other forests', just 'let's focus on this forest right now okay?'

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-01 07:47:07	@tui_talk i thought UK sizes were a cup bigger than US ones? I've been getting 44I's in UK sizes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-01 07:46:04	@tui_talk shitsnacks, forgot about that. US sizing, but hella generously cut.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-09-01 07:34:16	@tui_talk Slash should you desire returns, I'd be happy to do so to the Lane Bryant 'round the corner. Their plunges are lovely

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-27 01:24:41	@ljsgrace my thing is chronic pain. Ungodly massive public health burden, and the standard of care is opiates which barely work longterm
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-27 01:15:55	@ljsgrace @MaggieEBPatrick @mmdahlia27 ...sorry for the overflow. I just get kind of overexcited about pain. #phdlife
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-27 01:13:25	@ljsgrace @MaggieEBPatrick @mmdahlia27 I mean, most studied in a tiny field. It's not saying much in comparison to the rest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-27 01:12:28	@ljsgrace @MaggieEBPatrick @mmdahlia27 honestly, we know so little about pain. The brain parts that regulate it, sure, but sources? Nope.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-27 01:09:30	@ljsgrace @MaggieEBPatrick @mmdahlia27 Actually, menstrual pain is one of the best studied types- the source is known and its regular
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-27 01:08:44	@ljsgrace @MaggieEBPatrick @mmdahlia27 There's not enough research on deep somatic pain of any type bc it's so hard to pinpoint.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-27 00:41:58	@mmdahlia27 @ljsgrace @MaggieEBPatrick I used to black out from pain, but on occasion Nyquil or benadryl to put me out helped too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-27 00:39:10	@ljsgrace @MaggieEBPatrick @mmdahlia27 in retrospect, I'm amazed none of them killed me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-27 00:37:41	@MaggieEBPatrick @ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 for me, it's also a secondary mood stabilizer. I get manic when my hormones roll.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-26 21:52:59	@quarantedeux and then the second one (not that there will be for you bc awesomeness) doesn't hurt as much either
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-26 21:51:06	@quarantedeux advantage: by the time you get that far again, the first drop kick doesn't hurt as much any more.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 12:35:49	@sorkinese definitely. Even if only because I claim anyone who gets my tww references as an immediate friend.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 12:32:41	@sorkinese I'm still debate drunk enough to not even try to refute that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 12:27:03	@sorkinese I feel like we all just got graduated to independent skepticism. We've been trained by the best, now it's time to go forth.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 12:21:12	@sorkinese I feel like I just watched an irl "You think I'm not aware I'm living the first line of my obituary right now?"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 12:06:19	I held it together until this. RT @sorkinese : What's next?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 12:04:18	Just when I thought there was less of a time when unwanted tonsee Chris Hardwick's face
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 11:29:14	There is never enough celebration of quality and creativity in our world and this. Just this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 11:28:10	I'm not sobbing you're sobbing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 11:27:51	This was exactly the antidote to that clusterfuck earlier.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 11:26:46	EVERYTHING.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 11:21:34	COLBERT COLBERT COLBERT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 11:15:27	@ljsgrace that was my plan, but after that, I /need/ the antidote
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 11:11:09	I'm gonna lose my shit by the end of this correspondent roll call, I know it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 11:07:15	But will there be Colbert?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 11:05:58	YASSSS CARRELL
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 11:03:08	I'm glad Twitter is on the debate, because I bailed for the daily show
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 11:01:17	@chidorme I'd watch the shit outta that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:58:51	@chidorme FUCK. EVERYTHING.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:57:16	I WANT MY TRUMP GOD ANSWER

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:50:42	THIS FUCKING QUESTION THOUGH A++++++ TROLLING AT IT'S FINEST
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:43:08	Dear Orange brosephina: Lenin is not a role model.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:42:05	@chidorme for the kingdom, the power, and the glory are Reagan's now and forever amen
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:40:04	@samcaseys I think my phone knows my thoughts better than I do
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:37:02	@samcaseys autocorrect stands, still true.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:33:38	...I think it's time for me to stop.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:33:09	God bless random Paul and his pubic hair toupee
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:29:24	@ljsgrace I have this vision of Trump as the ultimate pokemon
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:24:49	@DianaKSimpson @chidorme @ljsgrace @lam2885 I love everyone in this non-existent internet bar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:13:03	@lam2885 @ljsgrace you are clearly much wiser than I
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:05:49	@ljsgrace @lam2885 I need to start titrating my consumption if I'm gonna make it to Jon Stewart
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 10:04:29	So @lam2885 asked who I'm drinking with. Twitter, you count, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:46:28	I have a very strong feeling that my check liver light will come on by the end of the #GOPdebate .
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:39:21	So how long until they trot out Jerry Springer?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:35:41	...did he just call the sitting government a cartel?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:33:23	@MaggieEBPatrick ohhhhhhh yep I follow you. We have similar problems in PA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:24:44	@MaggieEBPatrick damn. Brother's speaking to my passions. Drunk me is so sad about this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:23:48	Pre-terror color-coding Tom Ridge, you would have been a blessing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:22:34	He reminds me of Tom Ridge, and that's a good thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:21:47	Dude I'm actually feeling this dude from Ohio. Fuck me, who knew there would be a crazy antidote?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:15:51	@chidorme they're really going for the jugular right off the bat
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:15:03	What a world has this become RT @chidorme : Megan Kelly now calling Trump out on his misogyny. #GOPDebate
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:13:16	@ljsgrace boo. I figured at least the Glenn beck station would be airing it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:11:29	@ljsgrace try the local fox AM talk station?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 09:09:25	@ljsgrace is it on the radio at all?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 08:54:58	@chidorme it's right next to AlJazeera. Hysterical laughter ensued.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 08:50:46	@MaggieEBPatrick dear world: let me past you $5/month for the six channels I use, you'll make more money off me that way
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 08:49:39	@ohnikkers this makes up for all the stupid shit past me has done
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 08:48:21	@MaggieEBPatrick lost in the empty desert of whO NEEDS 400 CHANNELS GDI
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 08:47:36	Apparently, past me put parental controls on Fox News so I wouldn't accidentally watch it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 08:45:56	So who knows how to find the debate network on my tv. I'be never used it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-07 03:27:33	@brittania_ maybs a Khan or a coursera?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-06 22:14:53	@ljsgrace @mizujada but odd that they'd make things difficult for mountain time, too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-06 22:10:56	@mizujada I miss iced tea like concervatives miss reagan. I hear you. It's been five very long years
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-06 22:05:39	@mizujada I use caffeineinformer for everything to avoid it, but it works just as well if you want to caffeinate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-06 22:04:06	@mizujada for me, it's knowing what to stay the everliving fuck away from, but ymmv.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-06 21:59:34	@mizujada or, if you need high-caffeine trans to transition, dd's brewed teas and the bottled true leaf ones have mondo caffeine
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-06 21:55:08	@mizujada it's not shabby! You could also try a sbux decaf- theirs has much more caffeine than most.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-06 09:47:47	@ohheyitsal @ohnikkers HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGVVGGGG
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-05 11:46:54	@ljsgrace apparently. I wanted to see if I could do it once, but seems I've started the slow descent into sideshow freak I was meant to be
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-05 11:39:05	@ohnikkers he had me at posh spice
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-05 11:37:20	@ohnikkers so I'm in love
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-05 11:33:54	In related news, holy fuck cotton balls burn fast.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-08-05 02:43:10	So apparently we're here to adopt that cat from HuffPo

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-28 06:17:59	@tui_talk godspeed into that not-good night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-28 03:19:55	@chidorme @melduckie @mizujada that sounds like heaven, even for my extroverted ass.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-28 02:43:45	@HOBradshaw as always, you speak truth
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-28 02:17:27	@HOBradshaw at least you didn't put his head on something. I'm never living that one down.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-26 01:25:32	"Would you think differently if the family involved looked like yours?" Who knew child abuse training would also be privilege training?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-26 01:19:00	... However, if there is a question in your mind and the family involved happens to be a family of color, check yourself." MY GOD THIS IS A+

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-26 01:12:39	Holy shit, team. This child abuse training is checking everybody's privilege like nothing I've seen recently.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-26 00:35:34	The 'Additional Specific Recent Acts' section of this child abuse training is both concerning and curiosity-inducing. Meth labs?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-24 09:48:01	@ljsgrace @melduckie should have added that I spend half my time in her lab using her equipment
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-24 09:42:50	@melduckie so did we! I inherited them when i moved out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-24 09:24:11	PI's wife added me on fb. I don't do advisors and mentors on fb. Protocol, anybody?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-24 09:12:37	@eroconnor that's probably a better plan. Or new sheets? My duvet's never going to be white again, so it's an easy justification.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-22 10:33:16	@chidorme @LizCanTweet @mizujada the lack of nerdfiteria would only reduce my confusion when people assume I know it well. Nothing else.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-16 08:57:04	@chidorme oooh fun! What kind of teaching? Zombie awareness?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-16 08:46:40	@chidorme what madness are you up to? I didn't get to see nearly enough of many of the people I really wanted to at reunion
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-16 08:20:19	@chidorme But I feel like that's not what you meant, somewhow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-16 08:20:02	@chidorme I mean, I can sometimes see it when I'm somewhere with windows
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-16 08:17:53	@chidorme Also, on your connecting mission, HI! How are you?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-16 08:14:02	@chidorme I give too many fucks as a whole, but I can appreciate the lack of them in others
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-16 08:12:54	@chidorme ...now that I've seen the other replies, I'm so glad we called it the same thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-16 08:12:29	@chidorme i can dig that. I like this zero fucks were given style of presidency. It's like FDR came back from the dead!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-15 06:26:13	@darthraydor @sonacroi right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-15 04:07:25	I'm checking my schedule @darthraydor @sonacroi RT @airfarewatchdog #LAX to #BWI $255 round-trip nonstop @AlaskaAir http://www. airfarewatchdog.com/blog/24314432/ los-angeles-to-nonstop-on-alaska-airlines/#.VaVl2xUEPPM.twitter … …

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-14 07:28:05	@IHStreet I feel your pain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-14 07:26:30	@ohheyitsal this glorious thought will get me over my grumpies at having to pay tswift prices for Vance joy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-14 04:35:36	@msbshoshani and will there also be a Billy and the Boingers reunion tour too? Bloom County's NKOTBSB
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-14 04:33:30	@msbshoshani can you image what the scalp tonic would do from thoughts of Trump as president?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-14 04:22:44	Actually, this explains a lot about me as an adult.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-14 04:20:46	You can keep your Calvin and Hobbes, I'll take Oliver Wendell Jones and his piracy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-14 04:17:30	Bloom County was a formative part of my childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood on a different level each time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-14 04:16:31	ACK PHTBBT EXCITE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-14 04:14:03	I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT SHIT STEVE DALLAS HAS STARTED ON THE INTERNET.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:42:55	@pineapplecakes WOE IS ME WHO SHALL CONSUME ALL THE VEGGIES IF NOT I
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:40:08	@mmdahlia27 @LizCanTweet fuck, i can hear that music playing in my brain again
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:39:35	@pineapplecakes @brittania_ man, I really need to get back onto tumblr sometime.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:37:35	@pineapplecakes @brittania_ wait. that's legit a thing all over now? not just if you're weathering the bitch together?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:35:22	@pineapplecakes god only knows. although i'm reeeeeal glad i found you and @brittania_ before I realized those were Things on tumblr.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:34:41	@IHStreet headed anywhere fun?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:31:42	@pineapplecakes lbr we're all garbage in some ridiculous way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:31:11	@IHStreet I found some equally good rocking chair spots, but they were secluded. Noooooope.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:29:17	@IHStreet Not a ton, but at least a few people on watch so no one will fuck with you while you doze.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:28:45	@IHStreet lovely views and a nice size radiator/ventilation thing to prop your feet upon! Plus right by a crew entry point so there's people
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:26:38	@IHStreet There's a cluster of rocking chairs in terminal E which make a great place to pass out for some hours as I found t'other week.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:25:20	@IHStreet There are rocking chairs, at least!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 11:24:17	@IHStreet Sad day :( Hopefully it's an airport with well-appointed couches. Or nap pods!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:58:22	Fuck you and your shit-stained tighty-whities. Fuck your moral high ground. Fuck your need to shame us for choosing our own underwear.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:56:25	You had your old manties spread out all over the massive table. Why should I have to hide mine when yours are on display?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:54:25	What could possibly possess someone to approach two strangers and start to berate their laundry? It wasn't a thing until you made it one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:53:20	@ljsgrace I dont. Even. Fucking. Know. I just. Fuck. Fuck everything.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:51:56	I am sorry, though, Random Other Young Woman, for calling him out before you left. I should have let you bail before I escalated.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:50:58	I'm just trying to clean my shit and get back to lab before my incubation finishes. I don't have time for your laundry critique.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:49:29	I thought the unwritten rule of the laundromat is you carefully never look at the details of someone else's pile. Isn't that rule one?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:48:15	I guess profanity is expected in a young woman so dissolute as to wash her period panties in a laundromat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:47:25	It should go as no surprise that he didn't like it when I told him to fuck off and mind his own dirty laundry.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:46:27	What are we supposed to do, not wash our underwear? Not wear underwear? Get a husband and chain ourselves to the washing machine?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:45:15	Apparently we're not meant to show off our 'indecent underthings' in public, esp if we're unmarried. Seems it's a way to troll for sex.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 04:43:15	Today in things I thought were too ridiculous to actually happen: an old man lecturing young women about black underwear at a laundromat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-13 01:17:40	I let myself be convinced, so now this is happening... https://www. etsy.com/shop/stitchasa rusrex?ref=hdr …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-12 11:43:37	@quarantedeux also, soooooo fucking excited for you!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-12 11:42:15	@quarantedeux so you're gonna explain all the LA jokes I don't get on MC, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-12 10:55:40	I didn't make it home from work in time to make it in, but I can hear @EricHutchinson from my backyard and all is good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-11 20:47:21	@halfpress central PA doesn't have much, but it does summer evenings well
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-11 02:23:22	@ljsgrace T H I S
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-10 21:06:04	@tui_talk holla. If I didn't but so much from them/give them allopathic my info it might not be so creepy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-10 21:05:26	@tui_talk also with the eleven trillion coupons they send it's not too bad (which, if you want them you're welcome to some of my codes!)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-10 21:04:50	@tui_talk I think it's an attempt to get you to convert on something you looked at. "these are selling fast!"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-10 20:56:14	Today in creepy internet: clicked to see the trackpants @tui_talk mentioned days ago, just got an email from LB that they're selling out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-09 12:20:01	@IHStreet I'm making the same endeavor, but i'm lucky if my evenings are even an hour long.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-09 10:34:28	If you need be, I'll be on my couch with my cat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-09 10:28:51	My best friend and I just tried to figure out who's wedding we'll meet at next, only to realize we're the only two left unhitched.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-08 10:22:10	@petridishes it's an alarmingly accurate attempt at an appendix
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-08 09:43:15	May the cities in your wake burn like candles on your cake @papagena665 ! #becausetwitterwishesarebetter
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 19:34:06	@tui_talk because fuck LB they overcharge for low-quality clothes because they're the only game in town
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 19:32:02	@tui_talk okay so depending on what size you're getting at LB, some of them translate to xxl straight sizes at gap/old navy in athletic wear
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 10:16:10	@quarantedeux I keep forgetting she was on TC before bsg crashed me back into fandom and I met all ya'll
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 10:13:25	@quarantedeux also shitsnacks has it been five years already?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 10:13:09	@quarantedeux commitment pays off
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 10:12:15	@quarantedeux I'm so happy for you bb
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:53:55	. @pineapplecakes got me so worked up about B1G ballroom that i nearly forgot about MC. Switching to @drunkasarusrex as usual.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:42:37	@pineapplecakes PRAYER CIRLCE FOR A B1G DIVISION RESTRUCTURE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:39:07	@pineapplecakes The real shame is that it could never happen at a psu-osu B1G title game
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:37:28	@pineapplecakes i'll bring my mom's old nittany lion costume
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:35:37	@pineapplecakes SWEET LORDS OF KOBOL YES
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:32:31	@pineapplecakes imma learn to lead a samba roll now so someday when I meet you this will happen
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:30:56	@pineapplecakes I accepted that my bubble butt will never match that corgi's and I've found peace with life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:29:45	@pineapplecakes dude pick up some blues! It's great for learning balance/isolation/etc but you have a partner!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:26:54	@pineapplecakes it makes my own isolations feel so goddamn inferior.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:24:44	@pineapplecakes straight up no one believes me that I dance when we go out bc I have no concept of how to dance on my own
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:24:02	@pineapplecakes hell yes. Gimme alladat percussion with my dance
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:23:09	@pineapplecakes I didn't know what it was at the time but he was such a damn the lead I followed and hnnnnnnnnng
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:21:42	@pineapplecakes he could taken me right then and I would've had zero regrets in life
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:20:54	@pineapplecakes that's what I'm looking for atm. I need to bust outta partner dance!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:20:10	@pineapplecakes noooope. All my solo dance is confined to Charleston, cakewalk, and burlesque.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:19:43	@pineapplecakes omg those are the best. I had a lead drop one during a blues to hugo's version of 99 problems and I may have had an orgasm
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:18:40	@pineapplecakes YASSSSSS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:17:36	@pineapplecakes it's as close to blues as I can get in ballroom so I'll take it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:16:59	@pineapplecakes I might actually chach cha during the cha cha slide and I give zero fucks
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:16:32	@pineapplecakes right?!? I learned everything on the swing floor- cha cha, bachata, rumba, salsa, waltz, zydeco and on and on
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:14:30	@pineapplecakes HOLLA WOMAN swing/blues is my L I F E but tango is my real love.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:12:43	@pineapplecakes I've been doing ballroom for 10+ years. I need something new, y'know? I never learned to solo dance
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:10:52	@pineapplecakes literally anything. I'll even learn fucking tap. I just want to learn something new.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-07 08:09:19	My kingdom for an all-adult dance class. Ain't nobody got time to be surrounded by high schoolers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-05 10:17:50	And then mom blamed a fart on the fireworks. Welp...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-05 09:55:15	Mom just blamed my larger fitbit step count on cheating "because your boobs are so jiggly".
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-03 02:43:37	@darthraydor @sonacroi oh hell yes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-02 09:00:41	Who knew the pains of living in a tourist town were such good bar topics with locals?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-01 01:51:07	An airport celebration puppy to send us off to Bah Habah! https:// instagram.com/p/4j_PRUmHhH/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-01 00:45:02	I wasn't concerned about this podunk airline until the guy who ticketed me turned up loading bags onto the plane and is now boarding people
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-01 00:42:54	@mizujada @melduckie It was either DJill or Davies who mentioned using this as a How To Not when teaching stays
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-01 00:34:05	@melduckie @mizujada if you've taken a representative sample, that's pretty fucking stellar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-07-01 00:01:30	@mmdahlia27 right? I'll have to actually have a vacation!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 23:45:47	@mmdahlia27 and I find I no longer know how to function without a half-page list of things to do
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 23:45:18	@mmdahlia27 at the speed I'm going, I'll be done with all the data analysis I brought with me by the time i get there
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 23:43:49	@mmdahlia27 dude I feel you
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 23:38:09	@HOBradshaw I can't say that i remember that, but it sounds like me lbr
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 23:35:54	@HOBradshaw since forever in the summers. She made a big move this year and upgraded from tent to pop-up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 23:21:41	TIL: if you ask for local beer in Boston you're getting options of Sam Adams, that Sam Adams, or that Sam Adams.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 23:13:38	It's 11am and I'm hanging out with Jameson because fuck you, there are no rules to airport drinking.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 22:45:40	@eroconnor the regular line here is moving at the same speed. Glad i didn't go for it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 22:12:57	@DianaKSimpson @stevebragaw carrying a payload of tea and constitutions
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 20:25:41	Guys, my flight from Philly to Boston is number 1776.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 20:19:21	Also shout out to PHL and their always always delays.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 20:04:31	Way overslept and still made my flight with plenty of time. Shout out to the power of positive thinking!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 11:19:51	@quarantedeux shocking a dead dude though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 11:17:33	@LexxiBeckk you should've seen mine in the early days. It was rouuuugh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 11:16:10	@quarantedeux RETURN TO CLOSER FORM A+ would watch again oh wait
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 11:07:21	@quarantedeux proflynza holy hour
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 11:05:42	@quarantedeux proud papas stars in my eyes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 11:05:21	@quarantedeux and they argued about who would take him
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 07:24:09	@dduane @chidorme @melduckie @mizujada ...okay, so most of us aren't kids anymore (I joined 14 years ago!), but the point stands.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 07:17:40	@dduane @chidorme @melduckie @mizujada true! And a great example of how you're willing to interface with us crazy kids. I wish more would!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:36:18	@mizujada @melduckie @chidorme I haven't encountered that yet, but I mostly read in visual media fandoms, so it's a different take.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:24:26	@chidorme @melduckie @mizujada again, @dduane is a great example. Built her own online fan space in the early 00's and stuck with it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:22:32	@chidorme @melduckie @mizujada they are the people who mmost love and will pump your work. Why be any other way?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:21:45	@melduckie @chidorme @mizujada too many novel-length five, not enough plots in the universe
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:19:30	@chidorme @mizujada @melduckie at least I'm past where I read so much fic that reading a new hp book i thought things had already happened
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:16:11	@chidorme @melduckie @mizujada oh, HOLLA. I always hope people producing top-quality transformative works will get picked up to something
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:13:05	@chidorme @melduckie @mizujada I love when people dip their skills into new things
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:12:33	@mizujada @chidorme @melduckie oh god yes. "You made Harry do WHAT? You're telling which story? From a shoebox?" It was a revelation
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:07:07	@chidorme @melduckie @mizujada I'm much more discriminating these days. I want specific things explored, and I'll do it if I have to.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:05:06	@mizujada @melduckie @chidorme same. I dumped it fandom entirely in college, now I've come back to it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:04:12	@chidorme @mizujada @melduckie hell, it's the one fandom I never, ever think about or seek out anything over T in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:03:17	@chidorme @mizujada @melduckie in DD's defense, her primary universe is populated by preteens. I think the squick was strong.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 02:02:01	@mizujada @chidorme I'd offer, but I think @LizCanTweet can confirm that we all might not want that outcome
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 01:58:00	@chidorme @mizujada @melduckie Yep. @dduane is also super open about fic, both hers and in her own universe http:// dianeduane.com/outofambit/200 3/12/20/fanfic-etc/ …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 01:49:29	@mizujada @chidorme @melduckie and has been the one to pick a fight with fandom along the way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 01:47:00	@chidorme @mizujada @melduckie of ahe'd gone pro with her own shit, sure, but not by repurposing your fic.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 01:43:44	@chidorme @mizujada @melduckie she really tries hard to put us down, even though she came from here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 01:39:26	@chidorme @mizujada @melduckie plus the community concerned about repurcussions on our fair use claims.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-30 01:38:12	@chidorme @mizujada @melduckie I think her old fic fandom fans have bailed after how she has cast the community and downcut them
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-29 23:32:39	I'm feeling a weekend of maintenance at SBC. Anybody want to join me at the end of July?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-29 23:31:31	@quarantedeux @hubbit I did not know that. Hmmm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-29 08:25:11	Although I just realized that I packed something essential in there and there's no way I'm unleashing that until i get to Maine. Whoops!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-29 08:21:05	I'd like to thank all those years wasted playing tetris for my full-size sunscreen. pic.twitter.com/UrS7BHmtUk
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-29 08:16:27	@_amandadee I must look into all of these things in the future
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-29 08:12:24	I mean, daywalking fingers should at least get a liquid dispensation for sunscreen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-29 08:03:28	No but really how do people take their makeup with them and not check a bag.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-29 04:08:31	Did I make our post doc cry at her shower? Maybe. Was it worth the late night of stitching? Hell yes.… https:// instagram.com/p/4fFX79GHlk/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-28 09:50:10	@NIH_Bear So that's what that menacing presence in the dark was
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-28 09:45:59	Seen on fb: "well, it looks like somebody has finally seceeded from the skittles factory"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-28 03:12:30	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 When in doubt, blame the polar vortex.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-28 02:31:30	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 I think I found your weather, would you like me to return it? It's 68 and has been raining since yesterday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-28 02:27:23	@brittania_ I AM NOT PREPARED
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-28 02:27:01	@quarantedeux badass mode:achieved
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-28 02:25:36	Twitter, you might know- why are nightstands so expensive, compared to larger pieces of furniture?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 23:43:48	@ljsgrace @chidorme Satan wrap? Oddly accurate typo stands.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 23:42:45	@ljsgrace @chidorme "okay, we'll maybe get some colored Satan wrap? Or i heard his sister has a tiki bar?"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 19:35:16	@tui_talk I AM SICH EXCITE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 13:56:24	@LikeEmmaWithaT @Sweetbriaredu HOLLA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 13:55:21	@LikeEmmaWithaT @Sweetbriaredu ahhh! It's a greatest hits reel!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 13:54:01	@LikeEmmaWithaT @Sweetbriaredu I will always love this picture so, so much.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 13:49:28	I've found a way to use cylons in debunking bigoted claims about allowing people to marry pets now. My work here is done.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 07:28:24	@darthraydor
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 07:26:23	@darthraydor no but really can we do this the next time I see you
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 07:19:17	@darthraydor YASSSS pic.twitter.com/etnJu0JZX2
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 07:12:47	@darthraydor CAN I MAKE YOU A LOVE SOCK
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 07:11:35	@darthraydor i already have the Ring and the hoops and the huss ratty old black jacket. I'm almost there already!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 07:09:31	@darthraydor once I have that much cash, it's so on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 07:05:24	@darthraydor Just when I'd given up hope of a half-decent Cheryl West cosplay: http://www. torrid.com/product/stop-s taring-leopard-print-halter-romper/10273915.html#prefn1=size&prefv1=24&start=13 …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 02:37:45	@ljsgrace Also what level of fitness instruction and guidance you're looking for.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 02:37:13	@ljsgrace classes, etc. For me, the thing which always brought me in was the classes. Some offer comp childcare while you work out, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-27 02:36:29	@ljsgrace so, it depends on what you're looking for from the gym. They all have the same equipment, but the cheaper ones tend to have fewer
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-26 22:38:26	@melduckie @ljsgrace I have this urge to whip up some scalia puppets and act those out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-26 22:34:02	@hubbit I'll chip in for the ticket!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-26 22:02:58	It's 10:00am and three people have asked me if I have any chloroform. So it's that kind of a day, then.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-26 22:02:04	@dduane I thought I was unable to use a search correctly :) Thanks!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-25 17:41:18	@megmalon nothing explains my poor life decision to wear flip flops in the snow
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-25 17:38:38	@ElectricVandal OH MY GOD
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-25 17:37:08	@darthraydor be gone, satan
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-25 17:35:28	@labellementeuse sometimes I think the forced restart for updates is a good thing for my browser
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-25 10:35:29	@dduane So if I were looking to buy a TBM eBook, where would I have the most luck?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-25 10:04:54	@papagena665 nobody wants your palazzo offerings
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-25 09:40:19	@papagena665 get back, fashion satan
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-25 02:27:58	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes omg I need to head over and check this out
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-25 01:51:50	@stevebragaw I'm tempted to add to this only because I want to know what you'll want added next.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-24 08:30:37	@stevebragaw So, like this? pic.twitter.com/iUu6zaeaoA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-24 08:01:53	Goodbye. #SaveSweetBriar pic.twitter.com/CFIU4V4fFT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-24 03:19:12	@chidorme @mizujada and the ones most likely to wait to enter the fray
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 11:35:49	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes fingers crossed for empty fields and not people
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 11:29:45	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes what the hell does Indiana do to you people?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 11:28:44	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes except that the moved here to pennsyltuckey.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 11:28:11	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes that is exactly what my Indiana lab is saying rn
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 11:25:58	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux seconded. Don't go towards the lady worn the bike.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 11:25:11	@tui_talk gotta stick with the theme, to!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 11:24:46	@tui_talk it's not how I feel about them, it's how my colon feels about them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 09:50:48	@tui_talk yurt pie?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 09:01:41	Come join the Leemo MC party @drunkasarusrex
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 07:02:59	@quarantedeux I live within earshot of a major concert venue, so ymmv with things what aren't y'know, Right There.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 06:51:59	@quarantedeux I've taken to stalking it an hour before something I want to go to. Worked well so far!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 05:04:07	@chidorme @ljsgrace @mipatrick @melduckie I havent made it that far. Good to know!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 05:01:09	@chidorme @ljsgrace @mipatrick no severance for the faculty, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 03:00:37	No, I love getting sixteen hours notice that I have lab meeting. It's just the kind of thing I want.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 00:54:41	@quarantedeux didn't it get cancelled?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 00:45:34	@quarantedeux "it's called revenge pornography, captain!" "they're called cam girls, captian!"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 00:44:45	@quarantedeux idk that it's action!Tao. Something about hacking? But still. I have only small requests of my shows.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-23 00:37:48	@quarantedeux so apparently tonight's ep is both bsg reunion AND has a large Tao component. the gods have smiled upon me!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 23:54:50	@hubbit @quarantedeux Don't blow away, either of you!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 23:53:24	@hubbit @quarantedeux heh, probably. It's a fun game, massive winds down San Francisco-style hills.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 23:45:27	@hubbit @quarantedeux I used to live in a city with a higher average wind speed than Chicago. I feel you. No tornado risk there, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 23:37:10	@quarantedeux that's one way to spice up a Monday morning
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 23:33:24	@quarantedeux that sounds ominous
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 05:48:40	LRT: when I give up on my PhD, I'm starting over as an Onion intern.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 05:33:55	@BBCAMERICA sadly, FiOS on demand is two weeks behind on all BBCA shows.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 05:31:28	@ljsgrace @stevebragaw I don't care how mad you are, there's no reason to dig out people's personal shit. It eve gives me the heebies.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 05:27:48	@stevebragaw @Sweetbriaredu I like it! No one was interested in my highbrow memes, so I gave in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 02:22:51	@ljsgrace @stevebragaw the real kerfluffle was over images using people's personal photos from private events (their weddings, etc)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 02:21:19	@ljsgrace @stevebragaw I'm told students plastered it somewhere on campus? Duhno. They said it wasn't a serious threat
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 01:49:00	@ljsgrace @stevebragaw it wasn't the nine-page defamation threat teased, but there indeed was one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 00:25:55	@stevebragaw of course, he threatened all the wrong people. That made it all the better!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-22 00:22:54	@stevebragaw hey, somebody's got to cover morale! For me it was JJ threatening a suit for my wrecking ball photoshop.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-21 11:11:45	My kingdom for a shot from the weakest link where you can see yhe contestants faces
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-21 10:51:21	@chidorme @mizujada bottom of the front stoop is the 100-year high water mark. We got this :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-21 10:47:55	@chidorme @mizujada there were about three inches of water in the hollow on my way home, so not an impossible outcome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-21 10:47:08	@chidorme @mizujada we're just on flood alert, aside from the several weather. But we're always on flood alert w/lots of rain
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-21 06:55:28	Seems appropriate. pic.twitter.com/M53sL0Ez8E
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-21 06:51:33	Never doubt that a small group of women can change the world. We saved Sweet Briar!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-21 06:50:11	@chidorme moscato, but same.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-21 06:45:42	HOLLA HOLLA HOT DAMN #SaveSweetBriar
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-21 06:41:09	@chidorme @MarkHerringVA I saw it on fb and I wasn't sure if it was legit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-21 06:40:36	At least temporarily, anyway?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-21 06:39:56	Wait wait wait. Did we #savesweetbriar ?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-20 21:52:46	I never thought I'd be so happy to wake up to chainsaw-level kitty snores. He's home from rabies… https:// instagram.com/p/4J0A3GmHoi/

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-16 07:54:22	@tui_talk @tuttleturtle42 oh good. It looks awful in my embroidery. Accent direction: corrected.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-16 07:32:36	@tui_talk @tuttleturtle42 I found the apostrophe in DW, but can't find the accent. Argle blargle.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-16 07:29:20	@tui_talk @tuttleturtle42 quick phone-a-friend: is it dai' stiho, or dai' stihó?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-16 02:28:22	@ljsgrace this one's definitely a doozy. Might be the weirdest yet. Now if we were closer to 81, I might now laugh so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-16 02:24:11	@ljsgrace this one is the most ridiculous so far, and that's saying something. Now if we were any closer to 81...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-16 02:18:59	Of all the conspiracy theories, I think Sweet Briar turning into a new Disney Park is the most hilarious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-15 23:15:32	@quarantedeux ew. That's not fun at all. Loud annoying guy bingo, maybe?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-15 22:39:48	@quarantedeux IT'S CALLED SEXTING, CHIEF
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-15 22:32:33	@211Pine @ljsgrace @mizujada oh sweet zombie jesus- it's easier to control an introduced variable than one already existing, come on woman.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-15 22:30:53	@mmdahlia27 @ljsgrace It was ridiculous, they all hated me. Downside? I used to start to worry after a one-day delay in onset.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-15 22:24:59	@ljsgrace @mizujada @211Pine The most I've been able to put together is that no matter what is going on, that woman's hair is perfection.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-15 21:17:29	@quarantedeux @mizujada I kick into challenge accepted mode. Why yes I will catch all the drips, just place that here so I can save the day.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-15 20:17:08	@mmdahlia27 @ljsgrace wait, what? Quick link me? This is good news for me and my moderate hormone-driven mania.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-15 20:10:04	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 in the pillows? On the pill.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-15 20:09:32	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 every roommate I had in college was in the pillows and got pulled onto my then non-pilled cycle. those poor girls.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-15 20:07:54	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 I want so badly to go the IUD route, but they just don't emit enough hormones to control all my nonsense

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-13 09:08:53	@ljsgrace indeed. They wanted to alert my neighbors that dinner might be cooked in that location and to be very cautious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-13 08:39:27	@ljsgrace when this happens to me it's usually because my cousins decided to fuck with me. Hand to god.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-13 08:36:25	@DeborahFisher16 @neilhimself I can at least thank her for the easy list of my favorites to send to people. No more typing!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-13 05:25:22	@IHStreet On the bright side, it gives me a reason to sit and chill and let the hydrogen peroxide bubble it away.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-13 05:24:53	@IHStreet Dude, I so hear you. It messes up my everything.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-12 08:59:10	Concerts are 5000% better when you don't have to pay and can drink your own beer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-12 08:58:33	The real question is if I'll be able to stay awake long enough to hear @train play or if my bed will call me in from the porch.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-12 08:54:41	Got home just in time to sit on my back porch and listen to @TheFray take the stage. Bliss.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-11 22:25:17	@melduckie @mizujada @ljsgrace although whether they're directly invested or part of a fund/portfolio would be an interesting distinction
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-11 22:23:21	@melduckie @mizujada @ljsgrace too profit to bail, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-11 22:20:11	I mean, all it showed was the point where the bricks hit the tarmac and some feet. Send help.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-11 22:19:15	Do I have a #SaveSweetBriar problem? Probably.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-11 22:18:36	Did I just recognize the walkway in front of Benedict in a tiny sidebar licensed photo accompanying a generic college-themed article? Maybe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-11 22:09:50	@sonacroi WHOOOOOO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-11 22:07:04	@brittania_ I want to believe that you'll have a happy anniversary
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-11 21:11:54	LRT: if you haven't read Shades of Grey (NOT 50 thereof), you should. It's my favorite book, bar none.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-10 07:16:22	@GrrlScientist @IHStreet I read the tweet before I saw the picture and my only thought was, 'what did James Watson do this time?'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-10 05:28:13	@JetBlue I mean, they didn't, but the people on the line really tried to make sure they did.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-10 05:26:37	Shoutout to @JetBlue for providing some awesome customer service. I might have ended up with a bum outcome, but they really tried to fix it!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-09 08:30:17	@quarantedeux @sonacroi I'm so glad you have faith in me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-09 08:27:29	@quarantedeux @sonacroi I haven't seen any promos, so I don't know if I'm ready for this or not
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-09 08:17:32	I'm gonna get to see my mom inducted as a national park teacher ranger. I didn't think I was going to make it, I'm so excited!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-05 07:19:05	@IHStreet @ljsgrace same, same, same. I have two minutes to my time point, not enough time to make the run so I get to sit and wait.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-04 10:43:23	@ohnikkers @brittania_ I should never doubt you two. I should know this by now
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-04 07:12:55	@hubbit Oh, definitely! It's the until I get him again that worries me. But the tech taking an interest in my kickass kitty has helped.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-04 07:11:50	@ohnikkers @brittania_ The things I do because you people. I swear.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-04 07:11:25	@hubbit I haven't yet had him as long as he was in the shelter (2 vs. 3 years) so I worry he'll think I've abandoned him. But he seemed good
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-04 07:10:34	@hubbit Guy at the desk said he checks on him every time he goes back/snuck me back to see him, says he looks fine.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-04 07:08:20	@hubbit He gets paroled in two and a half weeks. No chance of time off for good behavior. He's in for killing a bat/rabies isolation.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-04 07:02:32	I went to see my guy in kitty lockup and, guys, the sound he made when he heard me call his name. My heart just broke.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-03 06:33:25	@melduckie @ljsgrace it seems like a better than decent chance to take the wind out of our reunion-inflated sails.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-03 06:24:12	@ljsgrace ...or maybe not. ProQuest is 22 hours behind, apparently.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-03 06:19:10	@ljsgrace I can once it updates into ProQuest. Might take a few hours, but I'll let you know!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-03 06:00:23	@dolidh I do miss automatic notifications on important emails, though. Nice to have something blatant to remind me to look at an email.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-03 05:59:25	@dolidh Probably would have helped if my inbox hadn't already been full of hard to follow nonsense. Now that I sorted that out, it's better!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-03 00:56:28	@ljsgrace awesome share! thanks!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-03 00:52:22	@quarantedeux fair. My default is to assume everything is a test, so I'm a bad judge. Fingers crossed and double crossed!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-03 00:46:42	@quarantedeux if what your boss dropped was totally different from the rest of your everything, I'd certainly want to parse out what's legit

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 22:27:16	@quarantedeux or perhaps they caught a whiff of your boss's crazy and want to see how full of shit she is?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 22:25:14	@quarantedeux they're harder on the better candidates? They give you what they think you can handle?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 05:29:38	@mmdahlia27 @ljsgrace Wha...how...that's just making it unnecessarily hard on yourself!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 05:26:53	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 oh lawd! That's gonna be rough.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 05:21:34	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 it's been a rough week for me and my first name. I can only imagine how super odd names handle it!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 05:20:07	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 oh! I had to get someone to wire me money for gas home- my card was locked after many tries with a misspelled name
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:59:49	@witzseeker awesome! It's oddly comforting that it's the smart at all times.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:57:21	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 holla. You could cover it up with some quality work, but oy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:53:36	@witzseeker you learn something new every day! Is it in there to approximate the -ahy- sound of the a?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:47:57	@witzseeker I figured. I almost asked a stupid question about tildes in Russian but I realized I was looking at it wrong.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:46:16	@mizujada @ljsgrace I get the K/C flip, but I've always wanted to punch the person who decided to add Lynn into the equation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:44:27	@witzseeker I was down until it started with a letter which resembles K.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:43:04	@ljsgrace @melduckie if you can convince the bird realtor to show them a more desirable location, maybe with better schools of worms...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:41:32	@ljsgrace i'm down for kaitlyn. Kaitlyn's headed down the path to Kathleen. What's aggravating is they're all considered legit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:38:54	@witzseeker if only! It's a rare, rare treat when somebody spells my name right, but I can't be mad b/c they're all legit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:38:03	@ljsgrace then you gotta put them in order, it's hard to keep that many spellings organized in your hear.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:37:14	@ljsgrace it's the oldest one! Caitlín was the old Irish version of the old French derivative of Catherine. The rest appeared in the 80's
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 04:30:58	Well this isn't going to help the Caitlin/Caitlyn/Catelyn/Kaitlin/Kaitlyn/Katelyn/Katelynn/Katelynne debaucle at all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-02 03:55:38	@ljsgrace has anyone consulted the bird realtor?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-01 11:12:02	@ljsgrace this way I at least don't feel bad about cackling as I survey my bounty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-01 11:06:01	@ljsgrace we couldn't find a food pantry that was open! Somebody got a cooler full of yogurt, but I think we all avoided the biscuits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-01 10:53:46	I came home with three breakfast bags full of cliff bars all in the name of not throwing food away. Yeah. Definitely. #SBC2015
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-01 10:38:31	@ljsgrace it isn't like candy, it really, actually is. Hmm. It was great to see you this weekend!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-01 10:36:10	Sweet Briar: actually like candy to your soul.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-01 02:36:07	@quarantedeux my body is ready
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-06-01 02:34:55	@quarantedeux oh hELL yes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-29 09:51:46	@quarantedeux yay for feeling awesome!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-28 22:31:24	@eroconnor this is also a good plan! There is a slight danger of tstorms on Sunday, but I don't think it is until later
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-28 21:39:37	@mizujada @chidorme that sounds like a deeply butchered garrison keillor impression
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-28 08:20:38	@hubbit So Say We Mother Frakkin' All
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-28 08:14:59	@ljsgrace It also forces me to pare down what I'm doing, because my bras are so massive I can fit my head in them. ymmv on that one, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-28 08:09:30	@ljsgrace I always start with underwear. Always easy!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-28 07:48:36	I'm feeling a boathouse floathouse on friday afternoon. Who's going to be around? Who wants to join?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-28 02:00:17	@IHStreet mine doesn't. Thinks we should all get out while we still can.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-27 05:53:01	In other news, I will start packing for reunion tonight. I will start packing for reunion tonight.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-27 05:52:28	Does anybody know how to find out if the Boathouse is booked on sunday? There aren't any 2010 events and I feel like there should be.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-26 05:37:19	@airfarewatchdog that's what I figured, but I wasn't sure if I'd missed it. *sigh* this is what comes of flying to the middle of nowhere!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-26 05:26:07	@airfarewatchdog have you heard of any decent JetBlue promos floating around recently? I'm trying to fly somewhere TINY (BHB)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-25 08:56:03	We turned on the tv for GoT and it's airing Spaceparents at Spaceprom. Y U do dis, universe?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-25 05:20:46	@darthraydor whoooo!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-25 04:06:24	I think what bugs me is the concept that memorialization has to be a somber, dismal affair.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-25 03:51:22	Fuck you, our godawful multi-flavor jello shots are our memorial because that boy had deeply questionable taste buds.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-25 03:45:40	But it's nearly five years since Jacob died in Iraq and we're celebrating the way he loved- getting shitfaced in the sun with awesome people
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-25 03:43:20	This year, for some reason, the preachy 'Remember who memorial day and not beer' posts are really getting to me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-25 00:40:02	I took such hope from what he was able to do. Hope that I can do what I've always wanted even though my brain has made other choices.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-25 00:32:56	Guys, I'm devastated. Nash was an inspiration to me, a sign that no matter how fucked my brain is doing great research isn't out of my reach
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-25 00:30:45	@ohnikkers :bows down:
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-24 09:25:43	@chidorme my favorite game is objectification of men to other men. They get so squirmy!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-24 06:01:41	@tui_talk he knows not what he does, which means it's a perfect opportunity to get educated!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-24 05:56:47	Don't act like you're offering me an opportunity I can't get on my own. I'm obliging you because I don't have better plans yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-24 05:55:06	Just disregard the part where I'm paying to see a movie again because you're too chickenshit to go see a movie by yourself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-24 05:49:06	Because let's be honest, no matter what the movie I'd be there anyway for the fluffalo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-24 05:47:41	And a detailed objectification of the one character you didn't think was manly enough for me to want to oogle just to make you uncomfortable
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-24 05:46:29	Because sin you're about to get a lecture on complex plots, foreshadowing, and worldbuilding.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-24 05:45:12	If you are a man and a friend and want to go see Avengers but ask me to come along so I can 'oogle' while you take in the plot, step back.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-24 03:08:14	@ohnikkers they're like 45% of the reason for Eurovision tho. Why miss it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-23 08:20:53	@ohnikkers oh god, I'm getting excommunicated now, I just know it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-23 08:20:30	@ohnikkers awesome parties end on your knees and so can mass!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-22 21:00:04	Let's be real: if there was ever a total, utter domination of sport, it's New Zealand and all forms of women's rugby.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-19 11:33:12	Seriously, it's like a ritual sacrifice up in here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-19 11:32:44	@pineapplecakes that's legit. and an awesome combo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-19 11:31:38	@pineapplecakes whatever it worked and I found a new show to watch I'll call it a win-win. New shows last longer than failed relationships
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-19 11:30:27	@pineapplecakes that I can't help you with I'be loved that for years.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-19 11:29:29	@pineapplecakes it took a second attempt. And not starting with the first season.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-19 11:28:50	@pineapplecakes at first, I was like, 'the is 100% my vibe' but then I watched the pilot and ehhh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-19 11:26:09	@pineapplecakes also I discovered Pam Poovey, light of my life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-19 11:25:52	@pineapplecakes I used to be the same way. This is what happens when you watch a show as part of an attempt to bone someone, maybs?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-19 11:24:05	Less important but equally confusing is why he felt the need to lay them out in perfect alignment in the middle of the kitchen.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-17 00:44:58	Wait. Fluffalo is in town speaking at a commencement? Hot damn!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-16 23:50:45	@ljsgrace I always joke I got a degree in chemistry and crafting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-16 23:49:20	There's something so very fitting about a stage full of women presiding over Sweet Briar's last graduation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-16 23:18:16	@HawesSpencer and in her defense, it's mostly on her science kids. She's always been fiercely protective and supportive of us.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-16 23:16:31	@HawesSpencer that it is! I was good until she started, but there's just something about hearing your advisor sniffle.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-16 22:59:34	@ljsgrace @cgutierrez101 it's a good thing the mice don't know or care what is going on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-16 22:59:02	@ljsgrace @cgutierrez101 mayor Tomlinson had me sniffling but djill's gonna make me sob.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-16 22:50:53	@ljsgrace @cgutierrez101 I've got YouTube playing in my ears while I do experiments
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-16 05:12:33	@ljsgrace and here I was thinking electronics couldn't tell you to f off
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-16 05:10:39	@ljsgrace @Dgrace11 I got the same as D, eccentric, etc. I wonder if they come in predefined sets?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-16 05:09:57	@ljsgrace @Dgrace11 I got the same as the first. Eccentric, etc. I wonder if they come in predefined sets?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-15 20:00:16	@tui_talk right? Living in a converted church has ruined me for life. If only Shipoke didn't flood twice a year.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-15 19:25:13	@tui_talk I never played with the dolls, just the furniture.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-15 19:19:44	@tui_talk aw maaaaaaan
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-15 01:54:12	@mizujada @ljsgrace it's about potential. The endpoint for most isn't monetization, it's selling to someone bigger who can figure it out
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-15 01:45:38	@mizujada @ljsgrace you don't need to, as long as you're attracting the people the investors will come. Look at instagram!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-14 11:53:52	@tui_talk boo the caps. Our local is their farm. Such sadness.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-14 11:52:39	@mistermauster we had weasels. Weasels that really liked baby food.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-14 02:51:53	@brittania_ I WISH I COULD QUIT YOU GRISSOM
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-14 01:08:25	@pineapplecakes @ohnikkers at least I'm consistent
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-14 01:06:44	@ohnikkers @pineapplecakes gdi I picked the worst time to reappear on the tweety box
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-14 01:04:44	@ohnikkers @pineapplecakes woah woah there are other people around think of the innocent bystanders before you unleash that nonsense
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-14 00:59:30	Is $40 really worth all the travel and not luxuriating in our remaining time on campus?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-14 00:58:44	It's just not all in one lump sum. And you get to come spend time in the place we're all fighting for!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-14 00:57:07	I don't understand the 'I'm doing alt-reunion because it's cheaper' logic. Add up the alt events plus hotel and food and it's nearly equal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-13 21:41:11	Dear news: seventy years between crashes is not recently dangerous. Stop it.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-10 10:51:37	@tui_talk gorgeous much tho
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-10 10:15:29	So sweet breezy types, who knows about this thing with a wrecking ball defamation suit?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-08 20:47:14	@brittania_ I am so happy but also I'll be over here sobbing into my Forever feels.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-08 20:22:18	@jasminemdjones ah, sorry. I am! I'll text you now!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-08 20:13:49	@jasminemdjones one day is better than no days!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-08 20:11:59	@jasminemdjones yaaaay reunion!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-06 11:17:46	It's not often that a season finale is good enough that I'll be genuinely sad when the show gets canceled. Boo.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-05 23:44:50	@jasminemdjones will do! Idk how early I can get down but I'll check!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-05 23:42:15	@jasminemdjones what are you up to on saturday avo? I'll be in bmore and I'd love to see you!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-05 03:23:43	@brittania_ ugh never meet your heroes, clearly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-04 11:08:43	Whatever the mid credits scene made me do it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-04 11:08:02	Did I just scream 'Holy shitsnacks' in a crowded movie theater while surrounded by children? Maybe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-04 07:00:39	@ohnikkers although the hardest I can remember laughing was the qi with tennant when when Bill Bailey pretended to be an osmond
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-04 06:59:37	@ohnikkers British tv has great taste in ridiculousness

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-01 10:58:16	@quarantedeux temporary disappearance or...?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-01 10:48:15	@quarantedeux boo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-01 10:47:48	@quarantedeux FUCK YEAH
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-01 09:27:33	@quarantedeux Is there any other way?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-05-01 09:19:25	@quarantedeux actually would use to give beer to the lovely old indian man who hits on me every morning when I grab my tea.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-30 05:18:14	Alright team Sweet Breezy. I hear something went down today. What's going on?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-29 07:08:30	LRT: That's a top tier orchestra kids. Get on that!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-29 07:06:21	@ljsgrace I registered before everything went down, so i legit have no idea what's been going on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-29 06:20:05	@ljsgrace @chidorme was it?mine was super cheap bc it's our fifth
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-29 05:49:21	@ljsgrace @chidorme there will be cheaper ways around it! most of the cost is in housing and some fac/staff are allowing tents on their lawn
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-28 20:07:27	@brittania_ @ohnikkers when a baddie got bulleted on OB last week I was like, "well, if he isn't fine he'll just regenerate!" BSG ruined me.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-23 07:58:07	@ohnikkers damn gurl
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-23 00:06:06	@ohnikkers so there goes that not-deserving argument.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-23 00:02:54	@ohnikkers coulson got his own damn tv show
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-22 23:01:08	@tui_talk sorry, Bes derivatives. If it was straight Bes symbolic transfer it'd be from egyptians.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-22 23:00:04	@tui_talk and it would be pretty damn funky if it wasn't just bes/high hats on hei tiki but also some language transfer somewhere.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-22 22:59:04	@tui_talk see now that would be straight fascinating. I've been reading about Patu-paiarehe/Pakapakeha and (very) early symbolism movement
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-22 13:05:35	@tui_talk I'm intrigued by these linguistics
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-22 11:41:00	@ljsgrace seriously though I'm taking ideas so if you know of anyone who has any...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-22 11:40:23	@ljsgrace and deeply outrageous!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-22 11:38:28	@ljsgrace I'm kind of loving the gilligan's one, but that one is much more nuanced. Subtle memes rarely go over well.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-21 09:14:27	I knew this was going to be a spiral the second my SBC advisor asked for a cylon-based photoshop.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-21 04:31:03	@ljsgrace backwards?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-19 22:01:41	@ljsgrace this is the first time I've been back since graduation. Why did I stay away so long?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-19 10:01:45	@ljsgrace anytime :D

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-17 10:19:52	@quarantedeux same thing applies to easterly views.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-17 04:23:32	@mmdahlia27 oh never mind. there are so many many people coming to campus this weekend!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-17 03:01:16	@mmdahlia27 Are you coming to spring fling?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-16 21:38:12	@hchatt10 you're welcome, friend!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-16 19:24:33	Of course I wake up under heavy mucus the day before I'm singing Beethoven. Of course.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-16 11:00:23	@eroconnor it loaded (finally!) Turns out I did! Glad I double-checked, though!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-16 09:38:59	Did I just remember that I'd filed my state and federal but not local taxes? Maybe. Can I get into the online system to check? lolnope.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-16 09:31:03	@chidorme Apparently I brought people joy on a rough day. I'll take that!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-16 09:24:19	Alright team SSB, what did I miss while I was hiding in horror from the things that I photoshopped.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-16 06:19:13	Oh great, the one time people see my wise-ass photoshop comment on something.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-16 01:16:11	@chidorme @ljsgrace I remember when that happened, but none of us thought it could be significant. Thought it might have been JEP

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-15 23:46:07	@chidorme @ljsgrace I got one with Tamburr and one with Dean Green, so I can't complain too much! Plus SO MANY with Davies.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-15 22:15:27	@ljsgrace so far, at least @MattTalhelm
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-15 22:14:06	@ljsgrace that's disingenuous at best.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-15 22:13:36	@ljsgrace so instead of taking 10M over the 12 mos, they're only counting it over the time of since the rest of the $ was soent
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-15 22:11:41	@ljsgrace I bet they're just taking the budget shortfall (10m) and compressing over a few months .

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-14 09:22:56	@rugbygoody Right? I keep thinking, 'wait, that already happened! At least, I think it did...'

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-13 09:51:40	It's weird, watching GoT and knowing what is going to happen for once.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-13 09:48:53	@eroconnor and little wall, little stannos wants you
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-13 09:29:45	@chidorme @ljsgrace @MaggieEBPatrick so are sequin-covered dresses, red hair ribbons, and braids. The icing doesn't reduce the cake quality
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-13 09:26:43	@chidorme @ljsgrace I mean, I was hardcore into all the pageantry. But I also took calc 3 for fun. Dgriff can stick his transversity.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-13 09:21:19	@chidorme @ljsgrace it depended on the crowd, obviously. But some can't see past the sequins.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-13 09:17:18	@chidorme @ljsgrace no women must be well behaved as is their decorative place in society but ofc not too decorative or you will distract
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-13 09:16:05	@chidorme @ljsgrace or tamburr made me analyze the odyssey as house with my team puppets. I had to really think hard that day!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-13 09:15:08	@chidorme @ljsgrace fact. Someone came in twinkle lights? Use them as the pchem demonstration. This actually happened.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-13 09:12:14	@chidorme @ljsgrace nobody said you couldn't find ways to include the tappy mayhem in your lesson.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-13 09:11:42	@chidorme @ljsgrace I feel like the best possible counter was Tamburr having me do analysis in class in character I was in costume for.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-07 04:20:16	@ljsgrace I tried that for a committee meeting but nobody puts things into their outlook here, apparently.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 15:42:34	tl;dr I love everyone in this wish stick.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 15:40:47	Even though I never doubted it, tonight was proof that camp family is the best family. So much love, so many amazing people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 03:19:17	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 In the end,I really took mathematical modeling and computational chemistry for fun. That says something scary about me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 03:16:03	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 I had my regret classes. These were absolute drowning- I really needed that background to grasp beyond the basics.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 03:13:29	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme Although the profs may have felt responsible because on both occasions they v v strongly encouraged me to take it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 03:12:29	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme While both of the classes I took without the prereqs (a CHEM and a COMP) I drowned. I passed because I tried.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 03:04:39	@chidorme @mizujada Otherwise, my degree would have been so, so, so much more fun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 03:04:04	@chidorme @mizujada It is, unfortunately, simply not enough to have been only trained in how to analyze and think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 03:02:57	@chidorme @mizujada absolutely. It's a combination of ability to think and required conceptual knowledge and technical skills.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 03:00:30	@mizujada @chidorme at least accessible. I can't think of a 300-science that didn't require substantial background to participate in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:59:43	@mizujada @chidorme it's unfortunately the nature of the game, differences in disciplines. A 300 lit or history course might be rough, but..
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:56:25	@chidorme @mizujada I worry about how that would affect the 75+ credit majors. Engineering was 86!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:54:34	@chidorme @mizujada I think it was targeted toward people with a desire to teach primary and early secondary, too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:53:02	@chidorme @mizujada only ed people were allowed to do it, I remember that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:47:14	@mizujada @chidorme there absolutely is. But a lot of the stuff people want to learn about isn't offered at SBC even for the guionites
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:41:24	@mizujada @chidorme that would be nice, but harder to do other way (sci in humanities) when you have three different labs in one semester.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:38:27	@mizujada @chidorme How so? My problem with the Johnnie curriculum is if you start with euclid you'll never catch up to modern sci in time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:35:00	@chidorme @ljsgrace That allows you to break apart a not popular program as people retire without shuttering whole departments.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:33:54	@mizujada @chidorme man, they finally offered it! Boo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:33:00	@chidorme @ljsgrace It doesn't need to be built from scratch. Careful hiring will give you someone to start with, then grow if demand
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:30:12	@chidorme @ljsgrace there was a math/comp sci/physics x3 major in '08 and it wasn't very hard bc so much overlap.I think they kept CB minor
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:28:02	@chidorme @ljsgrace oh, that IS weird.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:26:57	@chidorme @ljsgrace but comp sci degrees are mainly math and algorithms. Not coding unless highly specialized program.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:23:37	@chidorme @ljsgrace there is a point where there just isn't enough demand. The minor can be made from classes already offered.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:22:33	@chidorme @ljsgrace ehhh. I didn't know a single compsci only major. All were math doubles bc only needed a couple of extra classes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:20:14	@ljsgrace @chidorme I took a couple of those classes bc robeva thought I'd like them. Way out of my element, but at least 2 majors in '09
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:15:28	@ljsgrace @chidorme they still offered it! My year was last to have the option when only prof retired my Jr year
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:14:08	@chidorme @ljsgrace one of the tech guys offered open seminars in html, css, etc the entire time I was there. I was often only one there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:04:54	@ljsgrace @chidorme same thing for writing or an analysis of tech science in media. You can learn what you need off of prior big.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 02:03:47	@ljsgrace @chidorme but it doesn't need to be super basic, either. These are smart ladies. Bsns can learn cancer to talk biotech market
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:57:53	@ljsgrace @chidorme you just need to be creative in your assessment. Play to their strength- pair bsns and sci students to write corp analys
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:56:22	@ljsgrace @chidorme I think that stops people from trying. Not everybody is going to access all the material in those classes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:45:51	@tui_talk try a batch drop at an opshop or consignment ?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:43:16	@chidorme that's the problem with scientists everywhere- you're being diverse if you talk about nonac research. Not research is nonexistent
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:41:37	@chidorme :looks through files: sooooo some of them are already written, just not laid out as syllabi.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:40:48	@chidorme we did that, but they were all research and almost all academics.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:39:34	@chidorme I'd happily write the curriculum, I've taken or taught or both most of those things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:38:54	@chidorme but I'm a big stickler for exposing students to non-ac science careers bc we don't get nearly enough of it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:36:41	@chidorme or through labs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:36:24	@chidorme rotating honors sems with business or film or government for other perspectives on science.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:33:30	@chidorme I'd love to see a recurring scicomm class- to teach both scientific writing AND lay communication. I asked for that, too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:31:44	@chidorme you have no idea how hard I lobbied to have someone teach philosophy of science.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:27:53	@chidorme you know, they're in the course catalog. History of science, philosophy of science, etc. Just no one to teach them in EONS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:26:51	@chidorme but more human-based bio would be excellent. eg until my senior year anatomy was only available through dance.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:25:26	@chidorme I wanted a molecular biologist when they hired morrissey. He was a great call obviously!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:24:13	@chidorme honestly half of those are useless bullshit. I TA'ed the chem one and the way the book taught things actually made it harder.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:22:57	@chidorme good for the premed ladies and for the ones who like molecular bio but don't want the 50 chem credits.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:22:01	@chidorme but our bio dept is majority macrobiologists, so. Give Davies someone to help teach pathology, immunology, other micro classes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:20:07	@chidorme it would be very similar to what we have now. I'd most likely to see an additional program of molecular biology emphasis in bio
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:18:52	@chidorme you could drop classes but then not fill the prereqs for grad school. And you could shuffle labs but then not be able to do expts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:18:01	@chidorme there are changes I'd like to make and those which are practical, and unfortunately they may not mix.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:15:31	@chidorme oh god yes. And y'now, none of those 81 credits hasn't been useful at some point.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:14:52	@chidorme and multiple afternoon labs! Between the two it becomes hard to find the time for extra courses even when you can schedule them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-04 01:13:28	@chidorme the bridge isn't hard to build esp from guion but for that 81 credit major.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 21:51:24	@mizujada seriously though, send me any creation myths people rec you? I want to read ALL the stories.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 21:47:16	@mizujada for that, you're looking for the separation Ranginui and Papatuanuku
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 21:46:10	@mizujada I'd also highly rec the creation myth- I'm a sucker for those, and it's one of my faves.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 21:45:17	@mizujada matauranga maori has some good ones. http:// eng.mataurangamaori.tki.org.nz/Support-materi als/Te-Reo-Maori/Maori-Myths-Legends-and-Contemporary-Stories … or Vic Uni has an extensive translation http:// nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/t ei-Pom01Lege-t1-front-d3.html …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 21:29:47	@mizujada Kupe and the discovery of New Zealand, Tane and the baskets of wisdom, Maui and the fish.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 15:21:08	@roomerholmes good to know what my dad will be talking about this holiday weekend, thanks for the tip
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 15:14:40	@chidorme there are occasions I regret the science major, because it was so hard to get exposure to a lot of that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 11:12:42	@chidorme @LizCanTweet of course!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 09:10:26	Protip: today is not Tuesday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 09:10:11	Got home, sat down, and thought 'oh sweet, I'm home in time for AOS!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 08:09:30	@chidorme @mizujada f a c t .
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 08:08:44	@mizujada @chidorme ...now I just miss Dr. Tamburr.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 08:08:14	@mizujada @chidorme otoh, the paper I wrote was one of my finest- I got to argue with Tamburr about the Play becoming a char in modern versi
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 08:05:13	@mizujada @chidorme mine was Antigone. Pretend I didn't say that because that really ended well.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-03 08:04:24	@chidorme @mizujada I read this as being about @LizCanTweet and I feel like it's not horribly inaccurate
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-01 20:40:58	@mizujada the prank is to keep you waiting. What a great prank that would be, people do it to themselves!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-01 05:08:23	@ljsgrace ...except for that thing where they make me homesick for NZ and sob all the sobs. But good for everyone else!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-01 05:07:37	@ljsgrace can I make a Pandora station add variety suggestion? Gomez (the band) they're a perfect fit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-01 00:46:06	@chidorme @mizujada @emmameador a larger community also extends the reach of what you say, for better and worse.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-01 00:34:59	@chidorme @mizujada @emmameador or, at least, cis straight boys
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-04-01 00:24:27	@mizujada @chidorme @emmameador Me neither, although very little of my activity is creating content.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-31 23:52:07	@SnippetsofSarah In related news, I am clearly comprised entirely of shit :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-31 23:51:37	@SnippetsofSarah I am honored to be considered for the position of 'Bridal Brigade' and have submitted my relevant skills for consideration.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-31 06:56:51	*finds a way to make a cricket #SaveSweetBriar analogy* My work here is done.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-31 04:55:15	Placed my order for a replacement sweet Briar ring today! Fucking. Finally.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-31 04:09:39	@mizujada I loved what Dr Jill said on fb: it's not about them, it's about the mission.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-31 04:07:03	@mizujada @chidorme @ljsgrace although far more important is obvi the job I snagged with a community theatre doing lights.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-31 04:05:46	@mizujada @chidorme @ljsgrace my judic background nabbed me a spot teaching ethics seminars
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-31 01:56:29	@ljsgrace P R E A C H. There is no reason they couldn't have given a year's notice.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-31 01:55:27	@chidorme @mizujada @ljsgrace I figured that might have been the case
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-31 01:53:04	@mizujada @chidorme @ljsgrace I feel for the pre-professional ladies. You need those leadership positions to get into med school
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-31 01:06:45	@ljsgrace a novel would be lovely!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-30 07:51:23	@LizCanTweet idea: Shakespeare hangouts. Because reading plays on your own is boring.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-29 10:13:41	I've been up for seventeen hours. Do I have another many, many hours of cricket in me?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-29 09:55:32	Hey Welly friends! Anybody headed to cuba dupa today want to pick up a piece of art for me?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-28 06:35:00	@ljsgrace *blushes* I'm glad you're enjoying it, most I've shared it with don't care for it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-28 02:43:28	@ljsgrace I'll warn you, there's some really weird stuff in there (I built a HUGE section of it based on this song: http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=aQZbOq IPdVY … )
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-28 02:38:38	@ljsgrace *g* The station has personalities which cycle through. Skip a song or two and it will move to a new one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-28 02:10:30	@ljsgrace whoo! I love that song so, so, so much.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-28 02:03:45	@ljsgrace I've been curating that bad boy for almost six years. Mix of acoustic, dub, ambient, electroswing, and trip hop.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 22:40:14	@Timebinder Hey, now that's a funky find!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 11:31:28	@pineapplecakes thank god for made to custom measures, eh?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 11:22:50	@pineapplecakes their dresses usually always have measurement size charts? god, i wish those sites had existed when i needed a prom dress
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 11:18:22	@pineapplecakes like. if you're working with somewhere like david's bridal their dresses run to street sizes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 11:17:45	@pineapplecakes what's the mfg?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 11:14:58	@pineapplecakes shoot
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 11:13:38	Because god forbid you treat larger sizes with the same amount of detail you save for your straight sizes,
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 11:12:30	@pineapplecakes what kind of dresses
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 11:12:04	For the first time like, ever, the women's plus clothes in a line are basically identical to the straight sizes. No loss of the good styling
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 11:09:11	I'M JUST SO EXCITED FOR THIS, TEAM.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 11:01:16	Prepsters can judge but I don't care, I'll wear the shit out of the Target Lilly Pulitzer because it's finally Lilly in larger sizes!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-27 10:54:46	@chidorme @ljsgrace i wish the\is movement could get away from HOT pink. The stickers, banners, shirts? Eeesh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-26 06:03:54	@ljsgrace they all are! Poor startup labs are always down for free freezers!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-26 06:00:38	@ljsgrace I'll take them! Those bad boys are pricey!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-25 20:08:38	@tui_talk cappie's in some new, really twisted thing, I think. I really need to follow up in that

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-25 10:00:48	@brittania_ I couldn't tell you the last time I wanted a frakstache ride this badly.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-12 21:15:06	@mizujada I think it was $94M at the end of last fiscal year, but they had to pull $10M out to cover costs this year.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-12 21:13:18	@mamma_kye I already registered, but I was coming anyway. Can't wait to see ya'll!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-12 20:23:55	@mizujada @ljsgrace @chidorme eeeesh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-12 19:31:58	@ljsgrace @mizujada @chidorme I wondered if it was a reference to the occasional yet major nonac issues which have spiked recently

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-10 11:07:42	@brittania_ @ohnikkers well behaved women seldom make history just sayin'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-10 11:06:17	@brittania_ @ohnikkers idek what is going on but OF COURSE NIKKI YES
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-09 03:55:07	First Penn and Teller, now RuPaul on Sabrina. This show, man.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-06 04:52:48	@chidorme @UVA @HSC1776 @lynchburg JMU and W&L, too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-06 03:50:20	@chidorme @mizujada Lo, that was a good day. Also protip: never go sledding in a dress.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-06 03:48:22	LRT : my finest fancy dress hour. It was cooooold in that dress
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-06 03:47:27	@chidorme @mizujada remember how we all ran away when he threatened to cancel the snow day?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-06 02:56:53	#SaveSweetBriar bc nothing is more empowering to a young scientist than an environment where you will never be underrated for your gender.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-06 02:55:00	#SaveSweetBriar bc I received a top-notch chemistry education but also an excellent (and completely voluntary) technical theatre one too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-06 01:35:01	@chidorme @LizCanTweet You made me sniffle, and I'm not a sniffler.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-05 23:20:30	@chidorme absolutely amazing, but lbr from you this isn't surprising.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-05 06:52:03	The reunion website is back up! *frantically registers* #upupsweet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-05 06:38:34	@ljsgrace @melduckie man, I should have completed my cart when I filled it this morning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-05 05:46:34	@LizCanTweet @chidorme sbc transformed my sorry ass coochie snorcher and raised it up into a kind of heaven.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-05 05:39:44	@LizCanTweet @chidorme my mom a tells me in a loud, life threatening voice to stop scratching my alums
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 20:23:57	@ljsgrace @chidorme @mmdahlia27 T H I S.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 12:03:35	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 the reunion lady said it'll prolly all be back up in a few days
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 12:03:06	@ljsgrace @mmdahlia27 I think they axed the other sites to funnel bandwidth to the main site/transition info
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 11:54:10	If you need me, I'll be sobbing into these videos of SBC students singing in prothro.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 09:29:50	@darthraydor @caroline_77 good woman! The hersheys stuff is Shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 09:05:49	@darthraydor check the back. Who manufactured it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:34:45	@ljsgrace @chidorme lawd, me too. So many married pairs! Out in the awfulness which is academia!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:33:48	@chidorme I mostly worry about default on those bonds. If default happens a lot of other things get really, really iffy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:31:46	@chidorme Exactly. And if we were to allow the school to just peter out, that would never be sorted.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:29:08	@chidorme That's the biggest problem here. If that gets called back tomorrow, we have to pay it back. And now that the news is out...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:25:42	@chidorme The school still owes that money. We didn't grow to projections to a point which would allow us to recover from that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:24:16	@mizujada @chidorme She was asking about the building spree in 2000. Even I'm not 100% sure what she means.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:20:56	@mizujada @chidorme I recall everyone saying that with all the serious discipline issues we've been having over the last several years.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:14:44	We all saw what happened to Randy Mac in real time. Why would any of us want that for SBC?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:13:33	Man, I like this lady. Expressing grief but also asking relevant questions!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:10:37	@jasminemdjones I think if we didn't have the bonds the options might have been different. And he didn't do anything to take those out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:03:53	@chidorme I mean, it wasn't really a question lbr.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:02:38	Everyone on the #SweetBriar conference call rn: You don't even go here!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:02:13	@jasminemdjones good lord yes this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 07:01:44	@chidorme Also that part where we owe 25M and we can't run out our money without paying it back.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:59:01	@LizCanTweet @mizujada @ljsgrace @eroconnor Confidentiality agreements around the options they already tried.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:57:17	@mizujada @ljsgrace Already scheduled donations?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:56:30	@mizujada @ljsgrace This is true. But I want to hear some constructive questions- what will happen to alumnae association? Transcripts?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:54:47	@eroconnor We'd all be mad if they had sent snail mail too, because we would have heard from the internet before we got mail.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:53:38	@mizujada @ljsgrace I get people who joined late, but the first two women had to have been there all along to get those spots in the queue
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:50:44	@mizujada @ljsgrace The first-FIRST-lady out the gate asked what we'd been told not 30s before
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:30:54	@hubbit Thank you, my SBC alum heart needs a chuckle
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:29:06	@chidorme which, y'know, was already answered at the beginning of the call.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:28:26	We're better than this, Sweet Briar women.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:28:04	If this conference call is going to be people who didn't listen to the opening speech I'm giving up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:27:14	Dear team #SweetBriar : all the alumnae money in the world won't help if young women aren't interested in enrolling.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:26:03	@chidorme she's the VP of alumnae relations
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 06:25:10	@chidorme This logic makes absolute sense, though I hate to admit it. We can only offer so many things to a very small number of students
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 03:55:04	@madelineab you rock, thanks!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 03:39:44	@madelineab any idea on what's happening with reunion registration? I waited until I got paid this month to do it, but now I can't get in
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 03:37:12	Welp, now I'm sad I waited until this week to register for reunion.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-04 03:28:25	@ljsgrace @chidorme I thought I hadn't heard bc i'm a disconnected alum, but going by the parents on the fb page...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-03 13:35:39	One show in the bag, but three -count it, THREE- offers to do lighting design for future shows from people who came to see it. #awwwwwyuss

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-03-01 10:29:28	That awkward moment when the photographer stops you at intermission to ask how much autotune is. Oh, high school theatre.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-28 13:03:10	@mmdahlia27 I'm just still stunned. I think I managed to sound like a regular human when I responded?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-28 13:01:09	Who has red hair, two thumbs, and got a legit, professional lighting design job offer after the show tonight? THIS REX
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-27 12:26:29	@ohnikkers i'm glad you caught that, because i thought of you when I rebagled it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-27 11:29:49	@ohnikkers omg poor thing
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-25 21:01:48	@brittania_ clearly they aren't worthy

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-18 12:39:31	This year, I'm getting back to my usual lenten thing and my fellow scientists can suck their awkwardness.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-17 12:10:59	@sonacroi @brittania_ I love nyx, and they're cheap for starting out with (says the woman who is only barely starting out herself )
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-17 12:10:01	@brittania_ @sonacroi hell yes that's a good one
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-17 12:08:58	@sonacroi @brittania_ primer is the base coat, setting spray is the varnish. Right?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-05 10:36:38	@mizujada I'm not entire site it isn't an attempt to keep people from switching from tobacco
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-05 10:35:52	@mizujada why the ones that are Bing advertised are mcg by tobacco companies and deliver almost zero nicotine

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-02 11:48:13	@chidorme it was hard to make it through leading morning prayer straight faced that day, the man looked so scandalized
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-02 11:41:30	@chidorme (we got a young, attractive bishop whom they were very quick to toss up on the wall)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-02 11:40:45	@chidorme I straight asked the principal if they had done that for aesthetic reasons
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-02 11:40:12	@chidorme so my diocese got a new bishop right after jp2 kicked it, but only updated my hs lobby's bishop picture
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-02 11:35:36	@chidorme nah, the old pope has the Palpatine market cornered
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-02 11:28:56	@hubbit those bottles were the original twelfth man.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-02 09:40:16	My football brain is excited for the rest of the game, but my inner theatre nerd can't wait to get home and watch that again on a big screen
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-02-02 09:29:43	God bless Bob Costas' commitment to calling the middle of the game intermission.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-30 12:38:15	@IHStreet we'll see what they say in the response! Fingers crossed it's a possible thing!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-29 12:12:39	@chidorme not while I'm PhD-ing, no.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-29 12:11:08	@chidorme no, I am. It's just...far for regular travel.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-29 11:32:27	I was given info on the most. amazing. internship today. It's everything I want to do when I'm done, but it's heavily NYC-centered. Aaaugh!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-29 11:24:53	@hubbit_ebooks @hubbit It's good to have a raisin d'être
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-29 11:23:36	@tui_talk I giggled, but @darthraydor might agree with you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-28 23:55:28	@DoreenMcVeigh it looks so happy!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-28 23:55:06	@DoreenMcVeigh that is a fabulous organizer!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-28 23:48:37	@DoreenMcVeigh I stole a tabletop lecture podium.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-28 23:36:34	@quarantedeux @mizujada stipends are similar everywhere, but in a big city I'd qualify for food stamps. Here in the wops I can live okay.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-28 23:35:33	@quarantedeux @mizujada could the problem also be generalizing over wide geographic areas of different costs/stds of living?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-28 23:14:17	@smlindemann I have a similar reaction to all caffeinated beverages, but yes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-28 23:13:21	@mizujada @quarantedeux like you have more in common with the middle than your vision of what upper or lower is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-28 23:12:55	@mizujada @quarantedeux is it harder to tell when you're right on the edge at either end?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-28 22:56:15	@quarantedeux @mizujada through a combination of luck and very good planning. But it's hard to see that change over time
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-28 22:54:22	@quarantedeux @mizujada mine were to begin with, but they aren't anymore, and I think that's what they're missing
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-28 22:45:56	@quarantedeux @mizujada same, same
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-27 20:51:58	Thank you, snow delay gods, for the extra hour and a half to finish my presentation for lab meeting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-27 13:27:49	@darthraydor he is the cat of ultimate judgement faces.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-27 12:11:00	And people wonder why I refuse to work at home. #catsofinstagram http:// instagram.com/p/yV-97tmHvj/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-27 10:47:31	So apparently the prime specimen of manhood from Love Actually is in the new Will Smith movie. I think I might go see it now.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-27 08:54:29	@leiaxorgana I blame Josh Lyman. I'd say I feel ya, but I think I might have weirder old man crushes.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-27 07:20:38	@ljsgrace idk if I can afford travel and accommodations on top of it. We'll see!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-22 22:17:50	@hubbit although in this case, it's the ultimate of proximity- she was my randomly assigned roommate when I studied abroad.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-22 22:16:36	@hubbit that's the beauty of the internet- friends of common interest and beliefs rather than friends of proximity
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-22 22:11:01	@mizujada and I can't for the life of me remember why
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-22 22:10:41	tl;dr today I'm exceptionally thankful for the internet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-22 22:09:36	I met and lived with my best friend for a year seven years ago. I've seen her twice since then (the Pacific is large) yet we're still tight.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-22 22:06:13	@mizujada I never went but always so desperately wanted to
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-22 22:04:06	@mizujada I was so 100% about the March in high school and I can't for the life of me remember why
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-22 11:39:27	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux wait. Lee had a dick? I figured since he didn't have any balls that didn't exist either.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-22 10:51:29	Today I'm eating it because it's 10pm and I just got home and I didn't stop for fast food. Fuck it, that's a win. The difference matters.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-22 10:49:22	Normally, when I eat cup o noodles at home it's because I'm a human disaster who can't handle dishes. Or responsibility.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-15 02:45:39	@pineapplecakes 1 0 ten
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-15 02:45:25	I feel like a drunkstar in the near future is required in honor of ten years since '33' aired.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-15 02:44:30	@pineapplecakes shot to the heart and feels to blame
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-15 02:43:14	THIS RECAP OF 33 THOUGH http:// popwatch.ew.com/2015/01/14/bat tlestar-galactica-anniversary-decade-33-pilot/ …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-15 02:43:01	“Are you there?” asks Roslin. He is there. Even if you haven’t seen a single episode of what came after... you know he always will be.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-14 13:16:19	@ljsgrace I giggled! I wonder if oompa loompahs are susceptible to the poison, though?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-14 13:13:31	@pawneegodess Oh just wait. It's $25 per GRE score per school. I dropped $75/app on GRE and subject scores alone. The ETS is awful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-14 10:23:11	Happiness is brand-new ballroom shoes.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 13:17:31	We might have been saddled with Rutgers this year but we also got saddled with the national championship. I'll take that trade #B1G
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 13:15:19	#B1G bitches.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 13:04:34	Just scrolled through six channels of ESPN. They're all showing the exact same thing. Desperate much?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 12:59:03	@quarantedeux lbr I've just been hanging around waiting for tao to kick that door down again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 12:47:15	@quarantedeux here there are other characters an actual, fully fleshed out people. This show has more than just one major central relationsh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 12:46:05	@quarantedeux Most of the first half-dozen bines they threw the shippers were all in pursuit of Beckett's mom's killer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 12:44:39	@pineapplecakes ,*checks up on game* *hands heavy booze*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 12:41:14	@quarantedeux MC is miles ahead on that front. Sharon and Rusty, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 12:40:23	@quarantedeux Their much more going on here than a central will they/won't they/push them together for a second in the pains
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 12:32:50	@quarantedeux at least this big bag isn't also a way to advance the relationship of the main characters? I think that was a lot of it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 12:30:32	@quarantedeux they did eventually wrap that bad boy up. . after six seasons tho
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 12:25:53	@quarantedeux Bless provenza and his afternoon quickies
86232435	funkasarusrex	2015-01-13 12:25:18	@atmodrop This was what fucked castle for a while-they trotted out Beckett's mom's murder just for sweeps and finales such snooze

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-12-28 10:53:54	According to fox, there were more Penn state fans out for the bowl than Yankees fans for Jeter's last game.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-12-28 10:51:25	Straight up: I can't handle another PSU season with this many heart-stopping overtimes.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-12-28 08:36:02	@ohnikkers @brittania_ that helped, mostly. But I wanted to chuck these in my desk at work. No room for powder, too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-12-28 08:34:23	@brittania_ I ended up with this shimmering shit. Shoula stuck with the Revlon matte crayon tbqh.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-11-12 12:39:49	I don't want kids because someday they'll go to school and learn about Elf on the Shelf.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-11-11 09:28:35	At least a root canal would have sorted my problem. Instead, it's back to the excruciating tooth pain without any identifiable cause time!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-11-11 09:27:36	That awkward moment when you actively wish you'd ended up needing a root canal.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-16 06:27:14	@brittania_ I wish I could describe my own experiences as eloquently. :sigh:

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 07:31:11	@brittania_ @darthraydor it took me a minute to figure out there aren't any other caitlins around
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 05:21:39	@ljsgrace I tried so hard to get David's bridal to drop me a buy five, get the sixth free offer
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 05:16:17	@ljsgrace or to not know anything was happening until after it happened!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 05:15:43	@brittania_ @darthraydor that would totally happen to me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 05:15:12	@ljsgrace I mean, the wedding surplus is nearly entirely caused by marriage equality. *shakes fist*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 05:14:01	@ljsgrace there are only three of us (plus MOH), and one got replaced (by moh's bff) because one couldn't afford to drop ~2 grand on it

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 05:01:59	@darthraydor @brittania_ YOUR LOSS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 04:59:56	@ljsgrace I have been well-trained by the last four (soon to be five) weddings I've been in this year. I will stay quiet and support.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 04:58:57	@ljsgrace I mean, all the other bridesmaids are on the west coast. I'm the only one who's quasi-local, I would turn up to represent! But no.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 04:57:49	@ljsgrace the groom's mom didn't seem to care if we were at her shower though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 04:57:19	@ljsgrace she died six years ago. This has been an additional source of drama in the wedding.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 04:56:38	@ljsgrace yepppp worst. MOH. ever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 02:41:49	Listening to the new @ColdWarKids on @mbeKCRW makes a grey, gloomy afternoon infinitely better.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 02:29:41	@Ambiennn I'm in six goddamn weddings this year and all the drama is contained in one. W H Y.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 01:44:22	I don't want drama, I just want to be able to celebrate my oldest friend and the big step she's taking. Is it so much to ask?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 01:33:05	If I keep repeating it, I'll believe it, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 01:32:43	I will be a good friend and keep my mouth shut and support the bride. I will wait to smack down until after the wedding.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 01:30:59	Correction, only intive one of the bridesmaids to the shower and bachelorette party and ignore everyone else.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 01:29:40	And while I recognize the bride doesn't like crowds I will not point out that it's a terrible reason to not invite bridesmaids to the shower
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 01:28:26	I will not point out I'm dropping nearly a grand on this wedding.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-15 01:28:02	:breathes: I will be a wonderful bridesmaid and I will not flip at the MOH about her supreme bitchitude.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-14 23:09:10	@leiaxorgana @brittania_ At the very least I can blame her for Who and Bob's Burgers and winged eyeliner. That's a good start, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-14 22:40:46	@leiaxorgana @brittania_ can we just blame everything on Brit? This is a plan I can get behind.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-14 20:43:11	@leiaxorgana @brittania_ I don't even watch AOS and I want this

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-10 19:30:13	This is the quiet car, stop arguing loudly about the episode of MLP you're watching, neckbeards.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-10 17:46:15	And verily, they are neckbeards: seats declined the whole way, legs in the aisles, making all kinds of noise up in the quiet car.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-10 17:37:02	Early morning train to NYC (to see @tui_talk !), now with bonus neckbeards on their way to NYCC spotting.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-09 05:55:51	Looks like I'll get to see Boston on foot next summer, I just registered for #theovernight ! (18 miles for suicide prevention)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-09 01:05:43	I get it, last night's Daily Show was a mess, but all I really want to know is when they're rebooking Bill O'Reilly
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-08 19:21:22	@chidorme @LizCanTweet I used to have a video from star wars burlesque, but I can't find it.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-08 06:10:14	@tui_talk check the total charged to your card. If it isn't the total amount, you haven't tipped yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-08 06:05:27	@tui_talk in the future, save the tip till they bring your card back. Otherwise they put the cash and the rest on the card.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-08 05:58:24	@tui_talk did they run your card yet?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-08 03:15:19	@quarantedeux @brittania_ AMEN
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-08 02:25:42	@brittania_ I like knowing that there is always still more for me to discover. Then it never goes away!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-08 02:22:52	@brittania_ I can even forgive her for The Plan because Shindig is so shiny.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-08 02:18:40	@brittania_ idk why I always think she wrote for house, though.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-07 11:49:37	Forever is worth it just to have Ioan Gruffud back on a ship, if only temporarily.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-05 07:09:57	Protip: watching the argentinian rugby team is infinitely better with an argentinian shouting at the match.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-04 20:43:41	Motivation: achieved.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-10-04 20:43:29	Today's plan: get an aim finished by eleven, watch the rugby. Knock out the other by six, watch the other rugby.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-28 07:48:57	@nikkidarling @brittania_ it's not crazy ( @benchadjacent ), I just neglect it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-28 07:45:48	@brittania_ @nikkidarling I did that! Not terribly successfully thus far though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-28 07:29:34	@tui_talk B L E S S Y O U.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-28 07:27:41	@tui_talk it is. But it smells like l&p, so if that's the best I can do...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-28 07:27:13	@tui_talk no worries! I hear it can be found in California. Next time I'm out there, to.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-28 07:25:42	@tui_talk YES YES a friend from uni sent me SO MUCH.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-28 07:00:45	@tui_talk but liquids are heavy. Maybe just some fruit burst.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-28 07:00:11	@tui_talk I would do unholy things for a bit of L&P and a couple of fruit burst. UNHOLY THINGS.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-27 12:48:15	@tui_talk ehhh, keep me in the loop. It can be a last-minute train ticket decision.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-27 12:46:03	@tui_talk totes worth it when you'be already done the 7000 miles!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-27 12:45:21	@tui_talk it's not that much farther than Baltimore, albeit in a different direction. Plus, I haven't been to ny in an age
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-27 12:40:08	@tui_talk the plans never got set in stone, they're still tentative. I'll take a gander.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-21 22:36:37	@IHStreet it isn't always psychological, sometimes I'm just cosy and happy. And I need to remember it's okay and not freak myself out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-21 22:32:06	@IHStreet I've had years of remission from mainia, so these days I'm trying to remind myself that it is possible
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-21 22:29:19	@IHStreet but sometimes your.bed it warm and you are tired or stressed and your body needs a break. It happens to normal brains too, I think
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-21 22:27:03	@IHStreet I've had to start pointing out to myself that everything isn't always my fucked up brain. Sure, I'm bad at getting started...

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-08 08:51:31	@IHStreet @ljsgrace A decent one instead: Did you hear about what they found after the cheese factory explosion? Nothing but de Brie
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-08 08:42:23	@IHStreet @ljsgrace I think it might be the worst joke anyone has ever told me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-08 08:39:05	@IHStreet @ljsgrace They admitted 48 grad students this year, but when they rounded them up for orientation they had 50.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-08 08:28:28	@ljsgrace @IHStreet I'm a total sucker for jokes of the 'What's brown and sticky?' [A stick] variety.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-08 08:24:18	@IHStreet @ljsgrace 'And those?' The vicar turns, looks at the bottles, and exclaims 'My lord, he's done it again!'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-08 08:23:48	@IHStreet @ljsgrace of wine on the front seat. 'Have you been drinking, viacar?' 'No, just water, Officer' The cop points at the bottles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-08 08:22:51	@IHStreet @ljsgrace A policeman pulls over a car driving erratically. He steps to the window and sees a vicar driving and two empty bottles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-08 07:55:27	@IHStreet @ljsgrace you're correct, it's terrible. And that's why I love it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-08 07:49:33	@IHStreet @ljsgrace A carrot!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-08 07:49:16	@IHStreet @ljsgrace What's orange and sounds like a parrot?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-08 01:30:50	Whoo! @gilesdraws and @Jeyradan have loaded me up with so many wonderful comics! If ya'll have to go, at least I have things to read.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-07 21:44:44	@IHStreet My life, every. goddamn. morning.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 23:01:08	#holla4thanks for the amazing women I'm priveldged to call my friends. Sweet Briar was worth it for all ya'll.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 19:57:13	@tui_talk that does sound like a perfect night!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 09:48:06	Josh Charles was in a Muppet movie!?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 04:38:31	if anyone needs me, I'll be sniffling happy sniffles of happy while I sodomize my very stoned little dudes for temperatures.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 04:21:20	RT [locked] I laughed so hard at this and the comments that I feel obliged to link it. Thank you The Toast. http:// the-toast.net/2014/09/04/eig hteen-kinds-people-comment-recipe-blog/ …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 04:20:26	Guys, the nice things my committee said about my specific aims! Such nice things! Fuck yeah I finally did something right!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 04:19:21	@tui_talk thank you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 04:07:19	@chidorme the expectation that every will double major or minor and be a campus leader and be involved and and and... It'snot good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 04:05:16	@chidorme sure, we're all driven to be leaders at the Briar, but it's an unhealthy environment. It's not good to go that hard that long
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 04:03:56	@chidorme yet I was in the throes of full-blown mania and my entire department didn't see anything wrong and offered little support once
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 04:02:47	@chidorme it's the faculty things that throw me. I chose SBC because it was so small, if something went wrong someone would totes notice
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 03:58:40	@chidorme @mizujada @LizCanTweet @Rachel_Bax @papagena665 @LadySilver814 don't forget @melissaeramos @jasminemdjones
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 02:09:59	@chidorme @ljsgrace I'm left very anti-briar, and I'm bothered by the idealized realities people are talking about on fb
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-06 02:09:14	@chidorme @ljsgrace so here's my problem- I had such a deeply negative experience my senior year that it's colored my entire recollection
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-04 18:39:01	@tui_talk that seems to be a thing with skill shows, same thing happened to project runway
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-04 18:31:22	@tui_talk has the overall skill level just increasef, or...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-04 12:08:36	@pineapplecakes am I late? I left all my fucks in the interior of my crocodile alligator.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-04 12:08:08	@pineapplecakes I DRIVE A CHEVROLET MOVIE THEATER
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-04 12:07:18	@tui_talk @cz_nz @radiomum nice! I've also been known to rock the paperclip bobby pins.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-04 08:43:04	@ljsgrace I just. I look at the ridiculous expectations in my PhD program and I still have less going on than I did at the Briar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-04 07:58:13	@chidorme @mizujada @emmameador I remember affirming that knead not and never have been a male when I applied.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-04 07:56:55	@ljsgrace I miss the bubble, but I never, ever, ever want to be a student there ever again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-04 07:53:51	@tui_talk *follows*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-04 07:50:25	@tui_talk FREE HAND?!?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-03 11:07:54	@IHStreet Neutral is better than terrified and antisocial at least?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-03 10:29:12	@IHStreet that's my freakishly intelligent furball. How's yours doing? Has he settled in finally?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-03 10:19:43	@IHStreet still counts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-03 10:19:31	@IHStreet by sing, I'd do the 'you are my fire, the one desire, believe' in meows and he'd meow at the pause before the rest of the chorus
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-03 10:16:19	@IHStreet Mine is used to singing. I even used to have him singing backstreet boys with me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-03 10:10:56	@IHStreet My cat seems to nor approve of the sudden rush of activity.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 23:31:03	@chidorme Months, I tell you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 23:30:49	@chidorme Months, I've had this on repeat https:// 8tracks.com/verabeara/god- s-gonna-cut-you-down …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 23:26:54	@chidorme I want to go live inside that soundtrack though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 23:26:39	@chidorme still good, less terrifying than anticipated. I'm down with weird as fuck, just not terror.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 23:23:39	@chidorme true, but even still I wouldn't have remembered those scars as.a kid. Maybe it was the filter they shot with?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 20:09:37	@chidorme those are the scars? I was expecting something much more hideous.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 12:10:26	@chidorme this show is 100% my aesthetic. I think I should be concerned.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 12:09:38	@chidorme much true such fact.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 12:09:10	@chidorme it does because you expect it at every turn. Gdi just happen already!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 12:05:55	@chidorme I don't get it. The show is so unbelieveably predictable. But it sucks you in! It sucks you in so much.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 12:01:26	@chidorme I have this feeling it ends in an altercation with scar dude. That gets to be a daylight sight, defs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 12:00:17	@chidorme I live in an old church! Graveyard out the back and everything :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 11:51:54	@chidorme i'll finish it tomorrow while I mouse. In the daylight. With plenty of people around. Not in an old church.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 11:50:52	@chidorme because if you think it's scary then imma completely lose my shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 11:50:24	@chidorme oh good lord then I'm stopping now
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 11:46:47	@chidorme THE OMINOUS CREEPER MUSIC ISN'T HELPING
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 11:42:31	@chidorme many hugs. I need an attack kitty to keep the boogymonsters away
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 11:40:49	@chidorme I wasn't scared until there were animal masks. And maybe I covered my eyes when he was in the school looking at the stick teepees
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 11:39:16	@chidorme like, I want to stop because I'm shitscared, but I want resolution so I can turn the lights out and sleep
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 11:34:23	@chidorme why am I such a goddamn scaredy cat
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 11:34:04	@chidorme oh sweet zombie jesus there's voodoo and creepy masks involved I'm not sleeping tonight, clearly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 11:20:10	@chidorme this would be better if I had more than two episodes left
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 11:18:25	I was gonna go to sleep, but then I got True Detective.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 10:16:45	Matthew McConaughey looks alarmingly like Broccoli Cabbagepatch in True Detective.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 08:44:05	@nikkidarling we were networkes, but it was such a small network. The librarians uses to have me beta new books they wanted.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-09-02 08:42:37	Internet friends: one day you're objectifing actors, another say you're sharing all the child lit feels. Love. It.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-09 09:10:19	@tui_talk I mean, yes I had opportunities I wouldn't have had with >1 kids. But I think (not 100%) i'd've rather the sibs
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-09 09:05:14	@tui_talk shot will also be lonely when I am old and they are dead.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-09 08:58:41	@tui_talk the ideal number to me is more than one. Shit gets lonely when your parents don't do much with others/are only kid in neighborhood

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 19:41:58	Nothing gets you out of bed in the morning like a bunch of middle aged dudes on a ladder outside your window.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 19:26:07	@brittania_ ME TOO I KEPT THINKING THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE DAY LEFT IN THE WEEK
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 12:29:30	@tui_talk ASL and American english have the same relationship. When you don't have adverbs...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 12:18:40	@tui_talk And I need to convince myself to stop buying the $2 shit. It won't last, self. It's not worth it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 12:18:12	@tui_talk not at three grocery runs/week, sadly. (I can't plan ahead, so I don't even try. Small trips!)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 12:15:18	@tui_talk No, brain, you can't afford just one more bottle of OPI with your groceries. Stop it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 08:01:20	@tui_talk True that. You are also the only internet friend who is giving me terrible, horrible,habits (with or without nail polish).
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 07:55:07	@tui_talk I think you're the only one from the way back I kept in touch with. Can't decide if it would be more or less weird with more ppl.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 07:54:09	@tui_talk Right? I don't really know how to comprehend that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 07:49:41	@tui_talk So I just wandered into the YW forums. Can we discuss how it's been almost 12 years since I met you? Good lord I feel old.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 07:49:09	@tui_talk there are adult women who don't know that larger sizes can't shop at most stores, bless their skinny little hearts.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 03:31:53	@quarantedeux @brittania_ that said, can we discuss how many body parts I'd willingly cut off for an RDM-written Pern series?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-08 03:31:08	@quarantedeux @brittania_ and an unnescessary love quadrangle.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-05 23:48:00	@quarantedeux hasn't stopped people before. That's when you revert to the almost-significant vocab: implies, follows along with, trends, etc
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-05 23:42:53	@quarantedeux weird. is anything salvagable? Can you work with what you had before the protocol amendment?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-05 23:40:41	@quarantedeux *beats person about the head with research ethics* *beats again with common sense*

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-08-05 12:25:27	@AJoos headed to the lighthouse?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-31 08:51:02	@nikkidarling I mean, I'm preaching to incoming graduate students. But some of these somehow still apply even to PhD kids.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-29 12:02:35	@IHStreet Ain't nobody got time to spend six weeks writing a grant for something I'm never going to do.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-29 12:02:07	@IHStreet Thanks! I'm hoping my winsome ways will be enough to convince them to let me write my comprehensive exam on-topic.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-29 11:55:34	@IHStreet I was so set to hit it tonight and then I remembered my first committee meeting is tomorrow. Eeeeep!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-29 11:31:18	@quarantedeux December, it looks so sweet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-29 11:30:06	Wishing you could get your life together enough to reliably make it home monday nights to watch TV with your friends.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-28 10:25:56	@tui_talk jfc get your shit together wellington
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-28 10:07:21	@mmdahlia27 put vinegar compresses on it, draws the heat out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-28 09:56:39	@tui_talk STILL?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-28 09:49:58	@mmdahlia27 vinegar first!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-26 18:12:15	@pineapplecakes I say goddamn
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-25 20:48:06	@dduane I shall instead remind myself of all the goodies we'll get because of the elevated profile of the Penguins movie.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-25 20:46:53	@dduane Of course! But the Penguins panel never stood a chance. Star Trek could have held it's own and more, but not Penguins.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-25 19:51:19	@dduane hearing about Sherlock is nice but I really wanted Penguins. So ashamed of my other fandom, can you imagine non-Sherlock at a panel?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-25 11:57:21	Talk science to me, Elon Musk.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-25 11:40:41	@IHStreet And it's only halfway over! Bring on more awesome!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-25 11:40:03	The last time I declared obamacare dead I dropped balloons and twerked with the grim reaper
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-25 10:57:07	Got an awesome 'you're doing a great job' email from a committee member today. Just what I needed today!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-25 00:57:02	Sobbing in your car isn't the greatest way to start a Thursday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-25 00:57:01	Protip: listening to the #youngwizards WH audiobook on your way to work is a bad idea if you're near That Thing Roshaun Did With The Sun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-24 16:34:31	@nikkidarling WHY WOULD YOU EVER BE

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-22 10:52:08	@pineapplecakes i mean it's all about how stoned my mice were last week and how to keep them more stoned for longer
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-22 10:50:53	@pineapplecakes sweet lords of kobol i wish. anybody wanna finish my presentation for lab meeting?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-21 09:33:25	(Centralia is that coal town that was demolished because it's been on fire for fifty years)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-21 09:32:22	Guys, the amount of fandom graffiti in Centraila. Hoooooooooooo nelly.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-20 12:23:56	ONLY ASSHOLES WRITE ON DOORS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-19 21:41:33	@pineapplecakes okay but actually what the fuck is a fandom network.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-18 22:12:58	@brittania_ right? My god, I did so mugh all the photoshopping.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-17 09:29:37	@brittania_ @quarantedeux gimme all the cages, just hold these small watermelons up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-17 09:28:12	@quarantedeux @brittania_ in my world, well supported = ultimate comfort.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-17 09:27:38	@brittania_ omg glorious. Such support they haven't known since 2002.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-17 09:25:10	@brittania_ but it had half an inch of padding! On a GG cup! They never need to get any bigger EVER.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-17 09:24:03	@brittania_ so I tried on a strapless bra tonight that actually separated these bad boys.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-17 09:19:24	Last RT: I disagree with the hatred of the last three seasons of TWW. They have their moments, but nothing will ever compare to season two.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-17 07:52:33	I'm switching projects to making something that makes you stop being high so i can go home sooner.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-17 06:02:08	When did I become a functional human being?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-17 06:01:43	Where the fuck did this mysterious work ethic come from?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-17 06:01:24	Every day this week I've been the first one in and the last one out and I don't even have anything due. What the hell.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-15 08:13:27	@brittania_ @nikkidarling I don't understand the question, I can see only flawlessness from here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-15 05:09:44	*beats spotify over the head to make it work*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-15 05:09:28	Theoretically there are people who can listen to the new CWK on spotify. In my life this is purely theoretical.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-15 01:37:45	@mbeKCRW Did I just miss it? OF COURSE. Well, it was worth it for the introduction to all ya'll!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-14 21:17:54	I hope my lab likes @kcrw , because they're stuck with it until the new @ColdWarKids drops.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-14 10:39:06	Hold the phone, they're marketing nail polish-themed paint for your walls? What the what, OPI?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-14 10:18:31	@tui_talk I am so ashamed to answer in the affirmative to both.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-14 09:58:57	@tui_talk i mean, it looked like the opening is in b&w and then turns color as he gets his shit together. BUT STILL. EURGH WHY.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-13 23:53:05	@hubbit Mind if I ask where you found yours? I don't want to pick up a tracked torrent.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-13 21:59:24	@hubbit on no, not the new ep

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-11 07:52:03	@mmdahlia27 I spend most of my time in roughly that state.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-11 07:42:23	My life has gotten really weird over the last nine months.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-11 07:41:49	Surrounded by very stoned mice. Absolutely couldn't be happier because it's taken months to get them off their faces.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-11 07:36:23	@samson_today They should really make cards for that. CONGRATS THE PARASITE INSIDE YOUR UTERUS CAN LIVE WITHOUT YOU NOW

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-10 09:45:51	@SnippetsofSarah Heyyy, things are looking up! I was so worried about moving to the desert.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-06 06:15:14	@nikkidarling 'Is this one of Stark's?' 'I don't know, the guy never tells me anything' is what cinematic universes were made for.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-02 11:24:58	@IHStreet it does that from time to time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-02 11:18:13	@IHStreet Sad day! The second-to-last season is definitely the roughest. DS Zane could get fucked basically the minute he turned up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-02 11:10:05	@IHStreet I'm totally watching the Producers now. Eeeeeexcellent choice.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-02 10:32:09	@IHStreet look it's that song you love from the producers! look it's that wonderful bit from history of the world! hey lets send them a fox!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-02 10:28:39	@IHStreet I have ever done. So many wonderful distractions!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-02 10:28:21	@IHStreet I think I'm thinking of the 60 minutes interview he did for the Producers. I know that was the least productive internet serarch
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-02 10:13:27	@IHStreet he gave an interview once about how he got his love for musicals, let me see if I can find it...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-02 09:28:56	@IHStreet going off the musicals he wrote I'd have to agree
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-02 06:25:46	BAAAAAAAAAAH
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-07-01 07:43:24	@quarantedeux @hubbit i drove through one of those last summer. Be careful!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-29 18:01:32	So it turns out walking many miles for #theovernight is a really great way to get a shit ton of fitbit badges all at once.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-29 07:06:27	Oh god suicide in higher ed from the first speaker. Forecast: eighteen miles of a Rex Mess

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-29 03:46:47	@kiathekat hi!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-29 03:03:22	En route to Philly for #TheOvernight ! Make a last minute donation to help me to my fundraising goal, please? https:// theovernight.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuse action=donate.start&destination=P&eventID=510&participantID=11211 …

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-27 21:21:56	@quarantedeux shit just spreads and spreads. Requires extensive cultural changes to shift. (yay intersect of science and humanities)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-27 21:20:41	@quarantedeux there are large regions of Africa where funeral rights invoke extensive contact with body fluids. Between that and caretakers
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-27 21:19:00	@quarantedeux it'sbsurprising for sierra Leone, where they've done a lot of great work with Lassa Fever. But ebola entirely different beast
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-27 21:17:34	@quarantedeux problem is, this is a region that hasn't had Ebola before. The culture of containment doesn't exist here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-27 21:15:16	@quarantedeux but it's containable with education and bleach. It's not aerosolized, it degrades quickly outside the body.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-27 11:54:01	@mmdahlia27 personal taste! It's a deeply adorable korean drama
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-27 11:43:19	@brittania_ I mean, I'd watch that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-27 00:31:39	Whole lab cleared out to go to the bar and watch the game. Whoo!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-27 00:18:47	@melissaeramos omg you will be...oh fuck just as far as you are now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-26 23:32:29	@melissaeramos Who's asking?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-26 10:48:12	Took shower, dried off, laid in bed for half an hour, totally sipping wet again. Can somebody turn down the humidity?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-26 10:47:02	@quarantedeux idk what it's like at christmas, but unf.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-26 10:43:08	@quarantedeux the Nantahala river gorge. Technically it's in SC, but only barely. One of my fave places on earth.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-26 10:41:26	@quarantedeux omg go up the the Nantahala it's so worth it.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-25 04:12:22	@nikkidarling @brittania_ don't do anal kids keep that hole tight so the bugs can't get in.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-23 04:27:55	@IHStreet all of these things are very true.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-06-23 03:51:05	@IHStreet According to the CDC, 20% of deaths between 15 and 25 are caused by suicide. It's about on par, since that 15% is attempts.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-23 07:51:58	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 apparently only tea n00bs want decaf black tea because it loses its integrity. Or some similar nonsense.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-23 07:44:08	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 they don't. A @teavana person actually laughed at me once when I asked about it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-22 23:23:34	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 too much caffeine and it never comes in decaf. I'm stick with herbal teas. Nice, but not as good as a cup of assam.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-22 22:55:00	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 I miss tea. I'd give my left tit for a consistent supply of good quality decaf black tea.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-22 22:52:11	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada Note: decaf just means less than 20mg of caffiene
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-22 22:51:56	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada I don't understand how I used to be able to handle cups and cups of coffee. I can't even handle decaf anymore.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-15 06:52:47	@arysteia @tui_talk @bitsy best idea? Hunt up a local rugby team. We're always happy to educate!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-15 06:41:30	@arysteia @tui_talk @bitsy but don't watch it on nbc good god the commentary is terrible
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-15 06:40:56	@arysteia @tui_talk @bitsy watching on tv is likely a better idea than going live unless you've got someone to explain it

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-13 20:26:30	@mizujada and people wonder why we're so divided. There is no common ground because there's so much variety.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-13 20:26:00	@mizujada what fascinates me is of the 5 largest (land mass) countries, we're the only one with quasi-evenly distributed population.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-13 01:05:53	How to send Caitlin up the wall: do that, and take forever putting out publication dates for said books.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-05-13 01:04:55	How to get kids to read books: give them a stunning tv show to watch, end it far too soon and continue the story only in books.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-03-31 23:55:51	@quarantedeux thanks for the tip though, usually hypoxia is boring as shit. This is pretty cool though that article did simplify incorrectly
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-03-31 20:28:25	@quarantedeux So in a plus for corporate greed, if this makes it it'll get approved for everybody because diabeetus $$$

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-03-31 20:21:33	@quarantedeux Plus, hypoxia is mainly a cancer obsession. It'll pop up there in therapeutics before it gets to antiaging, approval is easier
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-03-31 20:20:36	@quarantedeux oh fuck it's a cell paper. I mean, it looks solid, but they only tested for one week in mice. It's a loooooong way from humans

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-03-03 12:15:56	So I missed most of this. Did Gravity win all the technical awards because ain't nobody else even close.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-03-03 12:02:35	@zestylime somebody ask her where she got it I wanna go shopping
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-03-03 12:01:15	@zestylime feeeeeeeeeeels mom used to watch this when she wanted an excuse to sob during chemo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-03-03 12:00:05	@zestylime she looks fierce as fuck but good god this song sounds like the early 90's
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-03-03 11:58:58	Lawdy me I want not prepared for these Bette feels.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-03-03 11:58:20	It's a sad day when Richard Griffiths is remembered only as an actor from harry potter
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-03-01 08:43:38	@quarantedeux this should be a true indicator of friendship
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-28 12:44:03	tl;dr people are dicks and fuck whoever decided group projects were a good idea in grad school
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-28 12:43:10	You can take your asshattery and choke on it because this 'the manic' just saved you. Bitches get your shit done too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-28 12:41:11	I've had to listen to this twatwaffle reduce people with bipolar to incompetent out of control idiots for weeks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-28 12:37:21	Ain't nobody got time for shit science. Nobody.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-28 12:32:32	Fuck I hate group projects.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-28 12:32:21	You know that isn't my fault? Your workload after I edited your section of the grant because it's shit science.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-28 11:31:57	@sonacroi let's play spot the Mutter specimen.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-27 20:21:35	@tui_talk but if your primary market is non-academics who aren't likely to have institutional journal access, then RG might be good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-27 20:10:53	@tui_talk the real advantage to RG is uncommon or very old publication access in an environment where you have lots of institutional access.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-27 20:08:57	@tui_talk does that get bundled with something massive, like Elsevier or Springer? Then probably not such a pressing issue.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-27 13:28:40	@sonacroi I'M HAVING FEELINGS IN ABSENTIA UGHHHH
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-27 13:08:52	@tui_talk But tbqh ResearchGate usually just makes me want to stab things. No I don't want to register to see an article I can get elsewhere
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-27 13:08:00	@tui_talk depends where you publish in the first place. Relatively common access? Ehh. Small, obscure journals? Totally.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-27 13:02:40	@sonacroi HE WAS SO YOUNG
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-24 12:08:49	@tui_talk circa, if you can catch them between shows.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-24 12:07:01	Good god, tech week. My body is broken.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-23 21:06:43	@chidorme @mizujada as a long-time red meat aficionado, can I say that sounds amazing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-23 08:03:29	@LizCanTweet to me he's much worse than Wickham, because Lydia knows what she's after and is equally complicit (if totally naive)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-23 03:53:54	@pineapplecakes women's cross country skiing goes in a big circle with pit stops. @darthraydor and I have decided it's nascar on ice.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-23 01:42:02	I'm getting the feeling it's gong to be another long, rough 'canes season.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-23 00:03:25	@darthraydor cool beans!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-22 23:59:36	@darthraydor my train just passed Bryn mawr, I should be in town soon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-22 23:58:19	@darthraydor so, two hours?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-22 23:31:35	En route to Philly to see @darthraydor and @sonacroi . Heck, even I'm jealous of me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-22 13:16:12	@tui_talk I got a fitbit, and it's got me getting every little extra I can fit into my day. It's the small steps for m, though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-21 04:31:33	@tui_talk okay except figure skating.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-21 04:31:00	@tui_talk shhh no one cares about women's sports outside of the olympics

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-16 22:29:14	@quarantedeux @roomerholmes how is there any other response? (chanting Bill in the background is acceptable)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-16 13:46:49	@nikkidarling not enough that the whole day was spent posting things, noooo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-16 13:44:30	In other news, I hate everything.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-16 13:44:09	Protip (from experience): If you're changing someone's birthday on fb, set it for the next day so they can't fix it until after it happens.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-02-16 13:22:47	@ElectricVandal I'm sad to report I couldn't get past my current Paul-balancing record. Tomorrow is another day!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:46:10	If someone's going to spread your contribution, wouldn't you rather it be someone with the background to do it right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:45:19	Research has the power to create so much good. People trained with those critical thinking skills can do twice as much good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:42:44	There is so much wrong with our community. We're classist (degrees), xenophobic (non-scientists), and we train our young in fear.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:40:30	But no. Because putting down the pipette and taking two steps away from the bench reduces you to the illiterate masses.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:38:52	I should think researchers applying for grants would want the oversight committees to be chock full of scientists for better reviews.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:37:43	We need people to do the harder job of translating our impenetrable jargon and interfacing with the world.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:36:27	We further the views that science is out of reach, out of touch, and a scary entity not to be trusted.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:35:18	If we insist on collapsing inward like a souffle we risk stemming the flow of new discoveries.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:33:51	Hint: we aren't.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:33:32	What good are we as scientists if we only do research for research's sake and don't translate it into the world?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:33:06	Today to get funding you have to prove your relevance. You need to be going somewhere.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:32:29	I can't even with the constant negativity towards anything away from the bench.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:30:56	Fuck your definition of 'real' science. Get off your high horse and realize the discipline variety. Try and do anything without stats.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:28:40	Fuck that noise. Also fuck the 'leaving academia but staying at the bench isn't real science' noise.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:27:56	So basically what I get from the community is it's only okay to leave the bench if you're moving up to a position of power.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:27:15	You know who leaves the bench and doesn't get any shit? College deans, research center CEOs, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:26:28	Oh I can't leave the bench I won't be a real scientist. Bullshit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 13:25:33	How does this shit get published in Nature (even as a side column). Such tripe, so unnecessary. Still a scientist http:// dx.doi.org/10.1038/nj7462 -369a …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 11:22:47	That awful moment every season where you realize the Redskins and Cowboys have multiple super bowls.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 11:19:21	@quarantedeux but my inbred desire to root for the nfc is losing out to his stupid face.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 11:17:14	Peyton get your face out of here it isn't helping.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 11:16:59	For the first time in I can't remember how long I don't really want to root for the NFC in the super bowl.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 11:09:29	@zestylime all i can see is the dark and terrifying ghost of TO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 11:05:33	Trololol they think they can bring a 12th man in a stadium that isn't basically enclosed. Trololololol.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 10:55:26	@pineapplecakes I'm having TO flashbacks, lawd help me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 10:54:33	Sherman your tits are decidedly uncalm, yo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 10:45:52	@zestylime sounds like some not-so-smooth jazz
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 10:28:22	Is this football or hot potato?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 10:27:36	@ljsgrace Penn State tops 110 decibels in a much larger, more open stadium. The Seahawks stadium is super closed in on the top.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 10:25:53	@ljsgrace They lost it to kansas city. Their stadium is half the size, so I could see how the closed design would lend to louder noise.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 10:15:24	@behrlie ...are you in central pennsylvania? That's pretty much par for the course up here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 10:14:51	It's so cute how the Seahawks fans think they're so loud. Honeybadgers need to come to a game at Beaver Stadium or the Big House.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 09:38:34	gdi jeopardy, don't email me unless you're telling me about how the exam turned out. I can't handle this kind of a tease.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 05:25:38	@quarantedeux @darthraydor it's no better than CSI was at it's peak. them procedurals starring excellent character actors, they stick around

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-20 05:09:32	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes I threw a beer bottle at a wall after the iggles lost to the saints. so now i speak iggles superfan.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 12:02:43	@nikkidarling can you see it? Idris Elba, Oscar Nominee.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 12:00:33	Whatever I stand by my observation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 11:59:38	The nice thing about an awards show on NBC is they don't shove actors from their hit shows at you. Oh wait. They don't have hit shows
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 11:53:23	@ohheyitsal holy shit i just did a fran fine laugh oh god what has my life become.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 03:40:51	@dks2008 now that's a thing to count down to!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 03:40:20	@nt_judoka I'm genuinely curious what your take on that will be once you're caught up. Let me know!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 03:35:22	@nt_judoka Are you caught up?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 02:50:17	Luther's look of worry when he corners the serial killer! Like he knows what kind of wild animal he trapped but not what it will do next.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 02:48:30	Welp, Aisha definitely brought home someone fit.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 02:23:44	Holy shit. Ge retweeted by BBC America and your notifications go insane.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 02:21:47	@madelineab so I just did a little digging, and I think that book is what they're planning to film into a movie of some sort. *fans self*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 02:18:55	Freaky irish bother is all about the cops on the dodge, but doesn't want a warrant? Come on Ripley, you're better than this!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 02:15:14	@madelineab That is absolutely the right reaction. Theoretically there's meant to be more than one, I can only hope.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 02:12:06	@madelineab Almost nobody knows about it. It's a bit of a prequel, kind of. Tight, fast, great read.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-13 02:10:19	@madelineab YES! I have succeeded! Did you know there's a novel too? So, so fantastic.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-07 10:30:57	Don't tell McD how safe the President is. She already knows.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-07 10:06:19	If I order all my bridesmaid dresses at once, do I get a bulk discount from David's Bridal? Buy a half dozen, get one free?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-07 09:39:09	@quarantedeux FIRE IN THE HOLE! More like fire in my ovaries. ...I mean what.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-06 08:01:49	There's enough ice outside what when you step on the five inches of snow we got the other day you don't sink into it. Whoop!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-05 23:13:29	(the PA farm show is the largest indoor at event in the US. Such food. Very noms. Much milkshake.)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-05 23:12:37	I have expandable pants and comfortable shoes. Do your worst, Farm Show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-05 08:23:26	Candidacy is submitted, time to relish the feeling of accomplishment and drink heavily.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-05 06:37:51	And on the third day, she obliterated DNA damage repair. Try and fix yourself now, ridiculous discipline of ridiculousness!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-04 22:16:38	@tui_talk fuck yeah wellington!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-04 05:43:27	In other news, candidacy day two: I've decided it's too hard to make physiology my bitch, so I'm going to stab it in the face instead.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-04 05:41:14	Thanks for the support everybody. Except for the complaint about how I'm a terrible feminist because I used 'making x my bitch"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-03 07:58:33	Candidacy day one: In which I proceed to make pharmacology my bitch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 13:24:06	In other news, I was not prepared for what the internet has become with the return of Sherlock.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 13:08:35	Tonight, I sleep. Tomorrow? The biggest exam of my life begins. But by the end of it I might just be a PhD candidate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 09:41:47	@quarantedeux @darthraydor oh god wait don't send it to me now send it to me on sunday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 09:40:51	@darthraydor @quarantedeux wait. what is this intriguing-sounding thing?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 09:14:42	@madelineab I was indeed. Such a good way to start the year.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 08:10:56	@quarantedeux i'm so glad i'm awol from the internet for the next three days.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 06:23:52	@nikkidarling Hi my name is Nveille 'I am dripped in awesomesauce wanna lick it off?' Longbottom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 06:22:41	@nikkidarling THAT WOULD BE THE BEST
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 05:59:21	@nikkidarling oh thank god before i got out of the fandom it was getting unbearable.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 05:49:28	@SnippetsofSarah they're gonna be sparkly. Absolute instant fabulousness.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 05:47:42	@nikkidarling but of course god forbid anyone point out flaws in hermione unless you want to be run out of fandom with pitchforks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 05:40:45	@nikkidarling i'd argue except rita seeker. no one deserves to imprisoned for a year.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 05:36:14	@nikkidarling not umbagel with lox?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 05:10:36	@nikkidarling FUCKING FLAWLESS COMPLETELY PERFECT FUCKS THE HEADMASTER THAN BECOMES HEADMASTER. i mean wat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 05:05:04	@nikkidarling remember that one time she stopped trelawney from getting thrown out despite her complete lack of professional respect for her
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 04:49:35	@nikkidarling Remember that every time she sassed the shit out of the greatest wizard alive
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 04:48:25	I'll be writing for three days straight, why wouldn't I want to have nice nails to look at?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 04:47:12	I'm not doing special nails for candidacy tomorrow, no nope no why do you ask.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 04:46:34	@nikkidarling FUCK YEAH FUCKING FLAWLESS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 04:40:08	@quarantedeux YASSSS come to the PA dutch side of the force
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-02 01:44:43	So who wants to come share my pork and sauerkraut today?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 14:21:24	Happy New Year! (according to @Rpatbarn I am a Blues...person) pic.twitter.com/MbzZrrjWHn
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 09:32:47	@dks2008 at least by now, anyways.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 09:32:35	@dks2008 I gotta figure (you might know better) that with all the lawyers in the water already that any hint of malpractice would have blown
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 09:29:53	@dks2008 Oh what an excellent and measured end to that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 09:11:44	@dks2008 Links if you remember where it was?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 09:11:30	@dks2008 I'd be cautious if it wasn't the court docs. Outside of those, physicians are HIPPA bound. Only the family can talk freely.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 07:26:39	@dks2008 Different in that Terri wasn't legally dead at the time. Hers could have been solved with a living will. Jahi? Nope.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 07:24:42	@dks2008 Similar in that parents are keeping a lost cause alive. Terri was 15 years in a PVS, that doesn't recover. Postmortem proved it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 06:26:57	@dks2008 The prob comes when brain stem still fxns. Heart may still beat (weakly) but person is gone for good. Best for organ donation
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 06:25:01	@dks2008 There is no treatment for death. Brain death is complete loss of all cortex neurons (all voluntary fxns). They don't come back.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 06:17:44	@dks2008 A coma is not aware or awake, a vegetative state is awake but not aware. Both are pot. reversible, as brain stem still functions.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 05:30:24	@IHStreet @ljsgrace @SJ_SaysSo (as a scientist) especially useful if they work in a less esoteric, more widely understood field.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 00:28:35	@AJoos Congratulations!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 00:28:06	@dks2008 most hospitals will keep a brain dead patient until the family can be present. After that, it's irresponsible to keep the dead.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 00:24:01	@dks2008 so they won't do what's necessary for transport to a facility where the parents can keep o2 in a dead body as long as they like
86232435	funkasarusrex	2014-01-01 00:22:56	@dks2008 afaik since she's brain (and therefore legally) dead, the hospital won't do any more procedures and won't keep a dead person either
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-31 14:22:04	I wonder if AMC realizes that eventually they're going to need to take Breaking Bad out of their current show promos.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-31 13:23:37	Today is the day where @LexxiBeckk hits a big teenage milestone and I suddenly understand what it means to feel very, very old. Happy happy!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-31 11:23:55	I ADDED BLUE CURACAO TO A DRINK AND NOW IT TASTES LIKE L&P. SWEET LAWDY THIS IS A GLORIOUS DAY.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-31 09:18:13	REPORT: Bill O'Brien in talks to fill the mustache-less void on Chip Kelly's face.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-31 09:08:13	BREAKING: Bill O'Brien has accepted an offer to play in the lingerie football league. Thousands cringe at the mental image.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-31 04:50:49	@tui_talk ..ichat? I have, more like.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-31 04:50:25	@tui_talk iChat a dress with a killer skirt (now deco on my wall) that I wore unzipped as a skirt with a dark top for an extra four sizes up
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-31 04:48:30	@tui_talk can you modify them at all? Add a ribbon lace up at the zip, or just an exyltended clasp at the top and wear a cardi?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-30 23:21:40	@zestylime and Bill O'Brien is rumored to be in talks for all of the jobs!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-30 22:58:43	But why does everyone want to poach our coach from happy valley? How can we be obsessive and cultish if coaches leave?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-30 12:49:04	Holy mother of we're going to the post season this is never going to set in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-30 12:25:54	FLY EAGLES FLY ON THE ROAD TO VICTORYYYYYYY

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-30 09:49:33	First points I'll take it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-30 09:48:53	@zestylime @roomerholmes my turdy birds gonna fuck it up
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-30 09:16:45	Fifteen minutes I'm so nervous.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-30 00:00:11	@SnippetsofSarah I'm headed back up today!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-29 13:58:23	@SnippetsofSarah wait what are you here?!?!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-29 02:51:55	@IHStreet i'm happy to provide translations or clarifications as necessary
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-29 02:50:16	@IHStreet oh then it is a glorious romp of comdey and drama. And it's all on netflix!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-29 02:48:27	@IHStreet it is indeed. A great place to visit, an even better place to stay a while.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-29 02:35:23	@IHStreet i'm loving the blue rose, but that got cancelled. For more comedy, there's Bro Town and Gormsby
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-29 02:30:14	@IHStreet my fave show of all time will forever be Outrageous Fortune. But if you're easily offended, maybs not.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-29 02:19:25	@IHStreet I studied there, and the cultural obsession hung around. Such fantastic media.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-29 02:11:08	@IHStreet if it was a drinking game I'd be the only one drunk.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-29 02:10:44	@IHStreet I mostly just shout from joy and start geeking about other things they've done.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-29 02:07:48	@IHStreet nah, like the mom who puts her kids on the horse at the beginning of TT. She's a bloody legend. (check out Outrageous Fortune)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-28 22:38:35	@behrlie hanging around while my dad watches fox news and parrots it back to us usually has that effect on mi madre
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-28 20:20:33	@nikkidarling I know, right? So awesome!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-28 20:14:37	@nikkidarling I actually have a couple that are ten years ish, all from the same forums.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-28 20:11:47	@nikkidarling fall of 2002, when I joined the young wizards forums on the author's site.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-28 20:09:21	@nikkidarling I've got one that's eleven years. ELEVEN.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-28 00:56:14	@nikkidarling and to invite your friends 'round to share on occasion

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 11:52:37	@IHStreet I mean, they've done a great job so far, I can't imagine why they would.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 11:45:57	@quarantedeux Battlestar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 11:42:28	@hubbit I don't know what they're talking about that was awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 11:40:07	@IHStreet I usually hate Moffat finales with a passion. Imho, he nailed it. Like being back to the pandorica days.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 11:39:18	@hubbit take the fucking fuck off or I will take this ship the fucking fuck down.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 11:19:26	@roomerholmes someone's been taking sass lessons from River
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 11:02:15	This is so well-paced, I didn't know Moffat had it in him for a finale.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 10:50:44	@roomerholmes ughhhhhhh commercials just get me there

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 10:23:11	@roomerholmes all about the fun, just like eleven really.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 09:59:53	I AM NOT READY.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 09:22:37	So how long until someone sets the eleventh doctor to beez in the trap.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 05:05:38	Goodbye internets, I'll see you after Doctor Who.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 02:14:59	I brought home the roku so we could stream all the christmas movies and what have we busted out? A pile of VHS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 01:25:38	@quarantedeux I think it goes on your shoe, but my aunt wears it as an anklet. http://www. amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00605 I0N8/ref=redir_mdp_mobile?pc_redir=1387992294 …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 01:20:40	@quarantedeux speaking of, have you seen the flashing ankle lights? I just wish you could use them as turning indicators.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-26 00:55:53	LIGHT THE LAMP, NOT THE RAT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 23:32:15	@irenejank it's the first we've done it, but I think it will stick around.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 21:43:14	Ain't it gorge? pic.twitter.com/Qu9rhFo7zA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 14:48:13	Guys my mom wrapped a bag of cat treats and put them under the tree my family is the greatest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 13:02:34	My family be cray. But I love it. And midnight is better than the 3AM we used to do presents.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 13:01:48	I love that even though we do presents at midnight, we still go through the charade of everyone going to bed first.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 12:59:09	@zestylime hee hee hee my work here is done.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 12:58:28	@zestylime my kingdom for the outtakes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 12:57:53	@zestylime exactly. What kind of other hilarity went down to make that man break character.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 12:56:55	@zestylime all I want in life is the alternate takes. If that's the best the could get from Bing...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 12:56:19	@zestylime no nope no you're talking to a woman who would do obscene things to the giant nose next to him.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 12:55:31	@zestylime get to shit together, guys.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 12:55:12	@zestylime it just ended. It's a rollercoaster of Danny Kay attraction feels and ugly sobbing at the general.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 12:53:16	What's that sobbing on christmas eve? Oh, just mom and I and White Christmas.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 11:42:47	@mizujada science people, unbelievable disease nerds. One of these titles is acceptable :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 11:32:41	@mizujada best time to hit an infection is before it's fully taken hold in your body.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 11:08:40	@mizujada yes, but it's the period before full symptoms where infection is weak and being curtailed by your immune system. Best time to nip
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 11:04:36	@mizujada there actually is. It's called a prodrome, mostly applied to flu because symptoms start so early, but applies to a lot of virals
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 04:10:31	@quarantedeux ffffffuuuuuuuuh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 04:05:43	(I'm so sorry, @gilesdraws . More things to open on Christmas?)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 04:04:56	Did I just wrap my cat's Christmas toys with leftover wrapping? No nope no *shifty eyes*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 03:10:07	SNOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 01:28:00	@hubbit at it's simplest, it's a way to restart play, usually after an accidental fuck up (like being offsides) http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=9AnEYJ SY7x8 …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 01:03:19	@hubbit that's odd, I didn't know you were the rugby type..
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 01:01:52	@gilesdraws Steven tried to, does that count? PS they're delicious! Such noms. Many variety.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-25 00:00:47	People keep leaving things at my door. I feel like I'm back in college, this is awesome!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-24 20:56:07	@hubbit you don't have to be out of bed to be on the twitter! Happy happy to you as well!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-24 13:23:42	It's been Christmas eve for half an hour get me the fuck out of here
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-24 11:39:23	Take me home tonight I just want to get out of lab help me see the chirstmas liiiiiiiights.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-24 11:29:18	Send help. It's 10:30pm, tomorrow is christmas eve, and I'm still. in. lab.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-24 09:52:49	@quarantedeux That may have been my fault. I'm sorry I'm not sorry.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-24 08:55:59	@quarantedeux That was where I first heard it and I was just like must have to apply to all the ships
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-24 07:43:39	@nt_judoka just like beating the giants would be no fun without sadfaced!eli
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-24 07:39:22	@pineapplecakes @hubbit @quarantedeux and you didn't know it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-24 07:38:18	@quarantedeux the soundtrack to shall we dance will kindly get inside me, stat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-24 06:08:50	Well that sucks. It's no fun if we don't get to beat Tony Romo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-24 00:03:36	@awfulannouncing who are they polling for most popular? A mutual hatred of the cowboys is my one common with all other fans.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 14:26:03	@nikkidarling i grumbled until i remembered that ain't no1curr who is on my follow forever, you all know each other anyway.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 14:22:00	@nikkidarling i almost gave up on you 'cos i couldn't figure out which handle to use. drinking makes this hard.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 14:12:41	so now i can say i've done a follow forever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:39:28	@IHStreet Iggles indeed! Anybody else and I'm fairly certain I would have been disowned.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:36:44	@chidorme It is very helpful in this situation that everybody hates the cowboys.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:32:47	@roomerholmes WHOOOOOP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:32:16	@IHStreet Everyone hates the cowboys! I'm hoping we can do it again next week against them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:29:14	@IHStreet We intercepted and took it 50+ for a touchdown. I shouted 'Get it right, get it right, get it tight' as he ran.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:28:17	@chidorme I am wholly not used to good things hapening to my turdy birds. This is wonderful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:27:36	@chidorme AFC is boring, it's decided. Of the NFCs, we're the more interesting story since #2 has the tiebreaker.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:18:18	@chidorme Oh that's right. Ya'll were the night game, weren't you?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:16:09	@zestylime not gonna stop my celebratin' no nope no
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:15:41	@zestylime Now it's just mean.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:08:50	Get it right, get it right get it tight.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 12:08:21	Thank you football gods, for granting me a game so glorious I shouted miss new booty at the tv.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 11:51:43	Ball falls off the tee "That's what kind of night it's been" Your sass is growing on me, NBC announcers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 10:54:36	Excuse me while I have the excites about getting the sunday night game two weeks running.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 10:43:45	Not only was it one time, we booed santa in 1968. Surely you have something more interesting to talk about, NBC.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 10:41:26	Yeah, we booed Santa. THAT WAS ONE TIME. It's not like we made out with a hot dog or anything.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 10:29:20	*plays Timber in the background behind Jay Cutler*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 09:46:58	Two scores in seven minutes I feel like I need to stop watching there's no way my turdy birds can sustain this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 09:43:34	Holy mother of god this is a football game.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 09:37:55	@jasminemdjones They've gotten all theirs since Baltimore got their first.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 09:24:45	I can't get past the cognitive dissonance of people at a december Iggles game in short sleeves.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-23 09:22:40	"As the Chicago Bears beat the Eagles on Sunday Night Football" Excuse you.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 23:20:42	@pineapplecakes @nikkidarling is that who I think that is?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 13:12:08	@IHStreet thankfully there was someone in my cohort with a similar profile, so I've had tons of help and support from her.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 13:08:17	@IHStreet I tried, but the community turned me away because mine is tempered with mania. Apparently we can even be assholes in support too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 13:02:23	@LexxiBeckk LIGHT THE LAMP NOT THE RAT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 12:11:05	A blue, furry Charles Dickens who hangs out with a rat?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 07:35:52	@sonacroi @darthraydor It's funny because it's unintentional. Bust do your worst/best!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 07:11:08	@quarantedeux to bermuda bahama come on pretty mama

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 04:23:21	@halfpress Absolutely. I'll bring mine along too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 04:22:50	@halfpress I'm pretty sure if we'd had CAH when we were at the Briar there would have been an 'Aaron Mahler's hilarious emails' card.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 04:17:40	@ENbrian if getting people hooked on the killing is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 04:02:40	@ENbrian same. So much emotional turmoil from them, and it's all your fault for convincing me to watch it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 03:30:07	@halfpress I am so, so very afraid.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 03:22:07	@ENbrian scratch that scratch that Netflix is doing six more eps
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 03:20:50	@ENbrian I'm sorry to break the bad news, but I'm 95% sure it's really dead this time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-22 03:19:00	@ENbrian flawless from end to end. That show will be truly missed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 20:52:40	@ENbrian And Holder and Bullet. I never expected the s3 levels of depth when we first met him. Holy mother of give them all the awards.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 13:40:28	@quarantedeux so I should start queuing the ridic things now then
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 12:52:19	If the only @CAH #holidaybullshit I'm going to get is day twelve, I'm glad it came three days early so I wasn't spoiled. Awesome gift!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 01:23:18	@papagena665 They're also limited by the contracts BBC already has. There's so much they can't air because PBS or HBO.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 01:22:34	@papagena665 Their daytime programming is terrible, but so is everyone else's. They do a great job pulling in small dramas in prime time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 01:20:07	@papagena665 you could make thhe same argument about the American kitchen nightmares they air ad nauseum
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 01:18:32	@papagena665 although they were airing tng long before that started. You can only fill the day with so much Gordon Ramsay and top gear.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 01:17:38	@papagena665 you have to start somewhere. Now they do orphan black (so phenom), air being human, bedlam, Atlantis.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 01:15:42	@papagena665 nah, BSG was mostly hey do you like Jamie Bamber? Go get that on law and order:UK.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 01:12:39	@papagena665 thou take your most valuable property and use it to spin off new related shows. BSG was the first attempt, and fed to L&O:UK
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 01:11:46	@papagena665 not really. They're packaging doctor who into a big supernatural event on saturday nights. It's brilliant marketing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-21 01:09:04	@papagena665 I think they're extending their sci-fi market. They reaired all of battlestar, then played it in syndication for ages.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-20 05:13:36	Who have I become?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-20 05:13:17	I've never been so happy to have qualified to take a three day terrible horrible exam before.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-20 05:12:44	Who has red hair, two thumbs, and is officially back in good academic standing after complete mental collapse last fall? THIS REX.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-20 03:36:11	@mizujada I'm surprised they included those, most top of the line are just the tower, You customize the monitior/keyboard/mouse.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-20 03:28:05	@mizujada Actual, physical, space to put drives, not storage space, though the two are not necessarily unrelated.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-20 03:27:28	@mizujada All in one's are a separate class, and rarely found among high end because you're severely limiting processor space
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-20 03:24:16	@mizujada Yep. And even low-end desktops, you buy the monitor separately or it comes as part of a bundle..
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-20 03:17:48	@mizujada ...it's a desktop computer? That's standard for the really high end windows machines. Mfg assumes you know better what monitor.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-20 03:14:40	@tui_talk can you get it through her profile?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-20 00:13:59	@quarantedeux funny this is also the case of the red line in dc. Causation or correlation?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 14:06:46	And by bright eyes, I totally mean total eclipse of the heart.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 14:05:49	If you're at home in your bed you missed my all-out heart on the floor rendition of Bright Eyes which was vastly underappreciated by my mice
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 13:31:28	Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii have been here for twenty hour holy gaius fml find me in lab.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 13:27:27	@IHStreet I wouldn't put it past him, he's a crafty little furball.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 10:14:17	Got a christmas card addressed to me and my cat. Heh. #achievementunlocked
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 10:07:36	@mizujada my techie boner could have been seen from space when i first saw it. unf.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 01:54:04	@mizujada (That little robot video is 9000% worth your time, regardless of interest in other works filmed by the robots)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 01:41:53	@mizujada Whole movie was choreographed to inches of precision to work with these filming robots. http://www. botndolly.com/box
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 01:40:20	@mizujada I don't mean pretty CG. I mean technically stunning and precise camera work. The opening shot is 17 mins, no cuts. Flawless.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 01:22:02	@mizujada If you're a fan of technical cinema you should. The story isn't great, but holy jesus the craftsmanship that went into the filming
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 01:04:53	Let it not be said there aren't major upsides to grad school. Like a $33.00 semester tuition bill.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 00:08:29	@sonacroi All of those are things which apply to PhDs with a new lab. Plus mostly that whole running your own business thing too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 00:07:45	@sonacroi I'm debating with someone that research science is more like other fields. You just completely proved my point.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-19 00:04:08	@sonacroi Someone gave you my textbook, didn't they.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 23:54:53	@sonacroi what types of things didn't know you needed or wanted when you were an amateur photographer which are totally essential now?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 01:07:13	@IHStreet @sciencegurlz0 you have no idea how happy they are when people turn up and want to learn.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 01:05:44	@IHStreet @sciencegurlz0 consult on fish movement for the next finding nemo!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 01:04:57	@IHStreet @sciencegurlz0 my best suggestion is to talk to your tech transfer/development office. They're invaluable bc they work both sides
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 01:03:00	@IHStreet @sciencegurlz0 see also retail design, market analysis, adverts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 01:01:12	@sciencegurlz0 @IHStreet No, but the analytical skills are. No1curr what you analyzed, just that you have the ability to objectively do it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:58:10	@IHStreet which ties neatly back into my mosanto does great science but is an evil business model point.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:55:28	@IHStreet there's a difference between being bought out and folding under the weight of bogus patent suits and having your ip salvaged.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:53:04	@IHStreet yeah. What's the endpoint- partner with pharma, mfg your own product as a revenue source for other things, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:50:42	@IHStreet it's the same with a drug. But large pharma will partner, large ag mostly just sues and then buys ip dirt cheap.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:49:59	@IHStreet their science is good, their business practices aren't. There's a reason there is almost no small ag tech industry.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:49:03	@IHStreet it's not a thing which really exists outside of vC's who have their own agenda. People get creative in every field but ours.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:47:07	@IHStreet there are just so many things. I speak business and science, I want to guide small biotechs to the best outcome possible.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:45:08	@IHStreet my pi said it best to our postdoc- 'but you know how to do the statistics. That's more valuable than any bench technique'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:43:49	@IHStreet oh god that's basically limited to Monsanto in large scale industry don't go towards the light.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:42:03	@IHStreet a friend with a neuroscience PhD got a ridic job doing analysis for a major wall street. Analytical training is the best asset.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:41:00	@IHStreet but the shift is an openness to working for pharma. Not anything else.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:39:59	@IHStreet @sciencegurlz0 I lucked out. My masters was half business, half science, and a lot of look at all these things you can go do!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:39:14	@IHStreet we have a fairly open to other options campus and there are still people who think you can't be a real PhD out of academia.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:38:05	@IHStreet But not entirely. Who would think to look for positions in developing education tools or science publishing if you never knew?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:34:49	@IHStreet I think a lot of it may be because they aren't exposed to all their options. Everybody thinks it's only academia or big pharma.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:33:13	@IHStreet whoooo hoo!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:32:56	@IHStreet everybody who came in gunning for academia is lost and confused now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:32:08	@IHStreet Fact. What keeps me sane is my business school mission after I finish. Knowing you're leaving the bench before you start is great
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:26:59	@IHStreet despair, check. Sense of being stuck, check. So not that much different from grad school.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:25:21	@IHStreet all the postdoc insight helpful for while I hold her red light in the mouse room at midnight and try to talk her through.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:23:08	@eroconnor my dad tried to argue bc longer/odd shape, but his xxxl shirts are the same length as my dress. Ugh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-18 00:17:00	@IHStreet that's exactly what I mean. I don't have the animal experience to be useful help, and the techs are ignoring her.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 23:43:55	@IHStreet @sciencegurlz0 This is the first sign I've seen of it in her. Prolly doesn't help she's getting zero support from the techs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 23:42:33	@IHStreet @sciencegurlz0 September, but he moved out here just before thanksgiving.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 23:31:34	Plan for 2014: appropriate all the holidays which feature evergreens in decoration. Problem for 2014: are there any other than Christmas?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 23:27:24	@IHStreet @sciencegurlz0 is this a common postdoc thing? This may help handling mine who suddenly wants to divorce her recent husband.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 23:17:44	@hubbit the secular holiday mayhaps? I'd celebrate any holiday marked by fresh pine. Mmmmm. Dat smell.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 13:13:29	Wait hold the phone Ruth Wilson is in this new mary poppins thing
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 12:57:13	In related news, it appears I've accumulated enough Gone With the Wind ornaments that I have multiple options for different scenes. Oh god.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 12:55:47	It definitely isn't christmas until atlanta starts burning on the tree.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 12:39:56	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes at least he still has his sweater
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 12:28:31	@quarantedeux oh yes yes indeed
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 12:17:33	@quarantedeux well that too. But a girl's gotta have her priorities.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 12:17:05	@tui_talk The first one is an awesome different angle, but would be better if it was as close as the last one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 12:14:31	@quarantedeux TAO MY BB GIVE ME ALL THE BACKSTORY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 11:41:49	@quarantedeux from duff's brain to provenza's mouth
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 11:37:44	@hubbit not till january. alas. and on a week where there's no blacklist! they just can't make my life easy. at least the jan looks awesome?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 11:36:30	@quarantedeux hoping for a hilarious flashback in a chuckles jokes ep
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 11:35:30	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux @roomerholmes i mean, if ya'll are going save me a spot in the road trip
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 10:59:33	@quarantedeux very handshake such awkward many crushes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 10:27:47	@quarantedeux I'd love to see Kyra's character Brenda come back? Do you even need to clarify what in the name of god.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 10:02:53	@quarantedeux frakkin toasters, still deadly
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-17 10:01:46	@quarantedeux these. two. assholes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 12:01:03	@mizujada they were never going to make it. normal people don't win survivor (australia excepted)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 11:54:16	@nikkidarling @ohheyitsal SO IT HAS BEEN SAID AND SO IT SHALL BE HENCEFORTH
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 11:50:51	@nikkidarling @ohheyitsal THERE WAS A SECOND PART PLEASE RESTRAIN YOUR TITS OF UNCALMNESS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 11:48:48	@ohheyitsal I voodoo worship harry potter.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 11:48:18	@ohheyitsal I don't like harry potter.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 11:32:25	This season of survivor would have be 1000% different if Rupert had stayed, lbr.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 11:22:18	RUPERT Forever my fave.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 11:03:36	@eroconnor They have also been picking a lot of locations without native small mammals too. It's been ages since a mainland show!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 11:02:54	@eroconnor That was the absolute best! Although after that incident with the boar...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 10:52:29	But seriously why does nobody want to know if the guys are vulnerable. Come on, survivor.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 10:49:28	@nikkidarling @ohheyitsal oh shit i forgot about that brb i'll be in my bunk
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 10:45:15	@nikkidarling @ohheyitsal thank god for this flawless show. plus it has alan cumming, what more could you possibly need in life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 10:43:57	@nikkidarling @ohheyitsal so sorry it's my basal reaction to him but AMIRITE WITH TEH SECKS TIMEZ
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 10:39:26	@ohheyitsal @nikkidarling the only drawback is trying to figure out how he doesn't poke her eye out with his nose.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 10:38:36	@eroconnor i like the hidden immunities, but they need to be much harder to find. make 'em dive for it or something.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 10:37:22	@eroconnor I miss having lots of longer challenges. Half the ep goes to redemption island now, and that ain't cool.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 10:36:37	@nikkidarling not quite, but it's the hottest possible with errybody still fully clothed homg. http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=FTABtY LwtBI …

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 06:52:38	Errybody losing all over. "Ah, the NFC East in December." Just kill me now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 05:38:05	The end of the football season makes such strange bedfellows.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 05:35:21	COME ON PACKERS RIDE THEM COWBOIYS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 05:25:18	@nt_judoka yeah imma need a major choke and fast. i don't think the cowboys are gonna lose to the packers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 05:23:56	@tui_talk oh sweet zombie jesus. I facepalm now while hoping I never did anything like that when I was younger.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-16 05:02:30	How are we down 19 to a team that's 3-9.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-14 09:48:47	@IHStreet now that's a doppelganger
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-14 08:59:56	@IHStreet gotta sneak dat brass in ahead of time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-14 08:58:06	@IHStreet at least the people sitting next to them
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-14 08:57:49	@IHStreet well that is definitely true.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-14 08:57:31	@pineapplecakes clearly I'm a masochist, I'm the wrong person to ask.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-14 08:43:50	@pineapplecakes wait there needs to be a why with bsg my whole life is a lie
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-14 08:43:00	@IHStreet it's based on Jim Henson's funeral, where muppeteers popped up in the congregation

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-13 13:02:59	@brittania_ such need very anticipation much want
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-13 01:36:54	@zestylime i have a raging, raging techie boner for those people. If you get a chance, you need to see this: http://www. botndolly.com/box
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-13 01:31:33	@zestylime http://www. botndolly.com/system those they did the camera filming on green screen and then added in the cg to all the shots, afaik
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-13 01:27:34	@zestylime not the special effects, the actual craft which went into the filming.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-13 01:27:04	@zestylime they filmed the whole thing with prez-programmed robot cameras. And that opening take my god my loins.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-13 01:23:46	@zestylime I was moved to emotion by the unholy amount to technical awesome in it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-12 12:26:32	@tui_talk i hold out hope that this entire country is a gigantic piece of alien performance art sometimes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-12 11:00:23	@mizujada Probably. I hear their non-padded basics are nice, but they don't last/ For that money....
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-12 10:57:15	@mizujada I test bras by vigorous jogging in place. At a D, there was no difference in jogging-induced movement with or without a bra.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-12 10:55:14	@mizujada half-inch, all-elastic straps with so much padding a D fits a C. They're not made for much bigger than a B at the most.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-12 10:48:17	I don't understand how anyone thinks those things can handle very boobs such size.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-12 10:45:14	Friends are all 'ehrmaghrd want victora's sekkrit very boobs such size' but their bras aren't much more than pasties with straps.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-11 13:02:20	@quarantedeux It can't be that bad. Say it ain't so. I saw someone write Dudley/Ripper noncon and didn't want to drop the disinfectant
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-12-11 12:57:35	@quarantedeux ...chlorine in the gene pool?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-28 02:21:32	@hubbit That's a baltimore and pittsburgh thing, seeping into the surrounding areas as they spread.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-28 02:20:35	@hubbit same with the parts of virginia which aren't NOVA. It's not uncommon 'round the parts of yankee territory which are actually alabama

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-27 22:57:15	@hubbit @quarantedeux oh sweet Jesus yes I've been mocked so mercilessly for that turn of phrase.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-20 00:41:55	@hubbit I can't wait for the Gettysburg anniversary to be over, it's been six months of nonstop it's time for this area to chill out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-20 00:40:32	@hubbit locally we're doing our part by retracting negative reviews of the speech.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:44:31	@tui_talk The other problem is that retail doesn't care about skill like everybody else. You get rewarded for time, not ability.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:43:52	@tui_talk Which if I wasn't so distractable would have led to the point that the reason this happened is b/c little popular union support
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:42:14	@tui_talk I was exaggerating to make a point about why the people I've known in my life don't support unions at all. I fail at 140 chars.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:41:29	@tui_talk than I do now. Because I'll be semi-unskilled labor in the field. At a wage which is sustainable by the market.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:40:30	@tui_talk I don't. I have no intention to do a postdoc. I intend to leave academoia and get into biotech mfg, where I won't make much more.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:35:36	@tui_talk When I say unskilled labor, I mean people with no reasonable expertise in the field they're starting in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:33:21	@tui_talk Nope. Most had the standard level of education for the day (high school). But no particular skill in trade.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:31:55	@tui_talk Except perhaps sleep deprivation. Or smoozing. Maybe beer consumption.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:31:30	@tui_talk But if you have a college degree in nothing specific and no experience or interests, then you're unskilled in all fields.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:30:39	@tui_talk unskilled is not uneducated. If you can fix a car, you're skilled. No degree required.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:30:08	@tui_talk My real problem here was I picked for my example the one part of the economy where after many years unions stopped being good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:28:26	@tui_talk And they did. And they didn't get it. And they were extremely sore losers about it, as far as I recall.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:27:08	@tui_talk But the baseline for unskilled is (while not distinct) at least a bit easier to define when looking at compensation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:26:25	@tui_talk No I don't. There's a reason industry exists. Concessions for skilled labor are harder to define, because skill is a sliding scale
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:24:53	@tui_talk Unfortunately I picked horrible examples and tapped the snark I was raised around. Its been a sore point around me since I was wee
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:21:58	@tui_talk And then without support unions are unable to do the job they were created for which harms workers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:20:21	@tui_talk But that sometimes they start requiring concessions for unskilled labor that that market cannot sustain and then people don't care
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:19:10	@tui_talk No, they're good for job protections against unreasonable things (way too low pay, working conditions (amazon) fear of job loss)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:14:11	@tui_talk which is deeply unfortunate for the people who desperately need them now, like big box retail workers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:13:33	@tui_talk no, it's still crumbling. Basically, tldr; heavy mfg ruined it for everybody and now no one has any fucks to give about unions
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:11:15	@tui_talk the manufacturing that stayed never unionized, paid less all along but (as far as i've been told) has never dropped their wages.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:09:27	@tui_talk when the town you grew up in crumbles into pieces, you get a little grumpy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:08:08	@tui_talk have dropped to a level (well above retail wages) of a decent wage which is also sustainable by the market.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:06:35	@tui_talk There was one segment of unions which stopped trying to keep wages from dropping and artificially pushed them up. Since then wages
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 10:04:05	@tui_talk I also know this. What I'm trying to get at is why there is no longer any kind of union support which could help out big box wrkrs
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:59:51	@tui_talk which at times is the only protection teachers have from deranged parents who sue to have their physically abusive kid in school.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:58:57	@tui_talk in our town they caused the jobs to leave, and now people are so anti unions they don't want teachers to have one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:55:43	@tui_talk no, but it is the reason why unions loss the cache they needed to produce effective change, which is the problem with wally world
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:53:10	@tui_talk where what happens in academia is exactly the same as what happens in industry, just not-for-profit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:52:25	@tui_talk in my life i have made far, far more money cleaning toilets than from doing science. my point comes from a science academia point,
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:51:06	@tui_talk working conditions and fair market wages. The problem was when unions moved beyond that (> fair market wages) and they lost cache
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:49:48	@tui_talk ugh 140 characters is not enough. I think unions are useful for job protection (omg teachers like woah) and ensuring decent
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:48:07	@tui_talk no, that skill should factor into it. skilled positions in every field should be well compensated, and unskilled not.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:46:32	@tui_talk for her job sweeping up fallen parts from the line when lines were down for maintenance. I love her dearly, but no. Just no.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:45:49	@tui_talk my neighbor who watched me as i grew used to draw me flow charts about why her union was needed because 55k/year wasn't enough...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:42:43	@tui_talk different parts of the economy have used unions very differently and the unions that overstepped themselves have ruined it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:41:43	@tui_talk that's what i mean by within reason.job protections hell yeah let's do it big box retail is the absolute shittiest thing ever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:40:14	@tui_talk in a postdoctoral position (with a phd) my salary will max out at 62 after many years. there's a problem there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:37:57	@tui_talk There's a good reason all the major manufacturing left town and it's called 65k/year starting unskilled factory labor salaries.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-19 09:36:54	@tui_talk well, within reason.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-14 10:28:34	@halfpress at least toys is engineered for black friday. We spend the whole year prepping. Best buy is the opposite, set for browsing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-14 10:27:36	@halfpress we were ready to kill they year they went to a not-midnight Thursday open, it meant we were too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-14 10:23:41	@halfpress tbqh the market is driven by wally world here. Theyve been locked in a battle with toys r us for years. Now it spreads.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-14 08:10:21	Apparently there isn't a Beaver Stadium porn. Universe, I'm so disappointed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-14 03:33:14	@tui_talk I also don't get most of the hoopla about patent awarding practices. Most of that was already agreed to in the ICH.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-14 03:17:04	@tui_talk biosimilars might, but they're a totally different can of therapeutics.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-14 03:16:39	@tui_talk the requirement that you produce new admet data is ridiculous. Generics in the US don't need to do that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-13 23:44:11	@pineapplecakes GUESS WHAT DAY. IT. IS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-13 23:42:23	@pineapplecakes WHY WOULD YOU BLOW A CAMEL IT'S HUMP DAY. A DAY FOR HUMPING DEM HUMPS.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-11 06:37:17	@tui_talk ...now i'm homesick for having only rain-related humidity. let it not be said there aren't upsides to welly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-11 06:33:21	@tui_talk dry in comparison to the rest of the year, that is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-11 06:32:44	@tui_talk ahahahaha it's like 10% less humid here and it is dry as fuck (ugh, winter)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-11 06:22:54	@tui_talk ...what.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-11 06:15:53	@zestylime @riddering personally I enjoyed the part where the iggles were evil and all the packers penalties were bullshit calls.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-11 05:26:05	fucking finally 0.500. it's been so very long since we've seen you.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-11 02:05:27	@quarantedeux bb come back. You can blame it all on meeeee
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-11 02:04:33	@quarantedeux tell me about it. All I want from life is castle on demand. But yay conspiracy theories?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-11 02:02:49	@quarantedeux only because Castle is the only abc show not available, and they air that ad infinitum
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-11 02:02:03	@quarantedeux I have this theory about tnt aggressively protecting syndication interests.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-11 00:42:51	@dks2008 as long as it gets there, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 23:49:32	@dks2008 can I recommend @TeamUfYH 's 20/10s? 20 minutes of packing, 10 minutes bourbon. Repeat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 12:59:17	Take me back to the days when all I had to worry about was learning all the dances from spice world.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 12:49:13	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada I will not snark Spice World. 'twould be sacrilege.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 12:39:19	@nikkidarling thanx much appreciated knew I could count on you
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 12:37:28	Cleansing my palette with a much better movie. Spice World is on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 12:09:32	These credits lie. Where is the lens flare department. Something must be shitting it out by the ton.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 12:07:00	So basically the plot of this movie is benadryl dimetapp yelling at thongs. Things. Whatever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 12:02:04	Great. Now I have a mental image of space!Lenin charging the enterprise with a sword shamed of baballoon cuntamoon
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:59:49	@nikkidarling I would rather sit through a Kant lecture.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:59:28	Better yet, destroy all stocks before space!russia decides a zombie plague is the way to go.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:58:26	extremely pale baddies are like smallpox: vaccinate against that shit before you freeze it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:57:31	wait that was it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:56:50	yes yes federation war z: all the annoying people cark it and Scotty gets his own film.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:54:58	surprise Kirk was only mostly dead not a zombie but maybe that's the next movie
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:50:50	I'm so glad the characters are headclutching as much as I am.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:44:18	But can I blame 50 shades of shitshow on this glass?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:43:34	So this piece of glass is what's to blame for my snarry obsession in high school right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:41:54	Pretty sure that's a very expensive and highly sophisticated piece of machinery you're stomping all over captain broseph
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:32:50	Scotty's in a glass case of emotion and also lens flares!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:29:41	Psychopath rolling up straight outta Khanton.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:28:02	@mizujada I'm just having a hard time containing my lens flare rage strokes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:27:28	Wait I see it Khan's gonna take the fancy pants ship and kill all the people right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:25:27	Errrbodys in danger and Spock's gonna sit there and play with himself?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:22:55	@mizujada *g*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:20:38	Bliiiiinded by the lens flare or possibly just the glare off the clapasnatch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:15:40	I can't even see what's happening right now it's just a giant screen of lens flare.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:06:10	Wait hang on is there any way this Khan get any more melodramatic?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:05:09	Anything Kirk can do Bendydong can Comonalong better.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 11:02:50	This movie is much more entertaining now that I have decided to spend it coming up with new names for Bluebaloop Crapplepoop.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 10:50:32	Blapadap Cripplestat punch bag fun time
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 10:39:33	Like epilepsy triggered by strobe lights, my range is triggered by unnecessary lens flare.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 10:36:47	For reference, I got out of lab late, got drunk, and am equal parts confused and angry at the floobious cranklespat star trek.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 10:34:14	no no don't go away I didn't hate you unlike every single other character in this shit
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 10:30:52	Oh fuck finally a reasonable character sup Scotty let's make some shit BSG jokes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 10:28:53	Oh hey there welcome to sci fi clearly necessary eye candy chick
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 10:27:53	Maybe it's the wine or maybe this movie doesn't make any sense
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 10:07:57	Bloodlyoodle crumpleblutts gonna save all the comatose kiddies?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 08:06:28	@mamma_kye It's the only way we hold things over night, especially if they come in an assorted case like the infinity discs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 08:05:55	@mamma_kye TRU protip: call tonight, ask if they have it, tell them you're coming from far away (like cville) with a shade of sob story
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 07:10:23	"For once, I would like to know where I am going" Can't say Moffat didn't nail Ten's obsessive need to save all the things, self included.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 06:42:27	@nikkidarling ugh fuck trailers right trailers gotta get on that shit

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 04:55:11	@ENbrian So lately I've been using mostly streamhunter.eu, but it varies by who's playing (Italy does a legit livestream) & what sites r up
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-10 03:13:01	Minnesota what are we doing with our lives.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-08 22:01:22	Poor, deluded medical students. They were so confused when I busted out with laughing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-08 22:00:44	I just passed some talking about @lordemusic "There is no way she sings her won stuff, she talks like she has a speech impediment"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-11-08 21:59:35	Medical students are actually the worst.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-24 11:21:01	@roomerholmes do what Jesus did and don't vote.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-24 10:22:03	Oh god television commercials extolling the virtues of genomic studies. Is there no place to go to avoid those apoplectic fits?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-24 09:22:22	So that's a no then, searching for on demand things on the fios website is actually even harder than through the tv. Great.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-23 12:39:59	@darthraydor ebony's forehead thing? personally I'd love to see the OF alien head bong on a pumpkin.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-23 11:57:38	@darthraydor triiiiiiiibe
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-23 09:34:51	@nikkidarling my fave part of fandom is the 'hey, i've been there' attitude toward depravity in all it's forms :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-23 08:48:14	@nikkidarling this whole unfortunate incident has me imagining top gear with shield's toys omg yes please
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-23 08:34:12	@nikkidarling um. I mean what no never participated in that fandom no nope
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-23 08:26:54	@nikkidarling I read that as Clarkson/May and I got very very confused.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-22 23:37:45	@dks2008 I happen to have a bottle in my bag, why haven't we perfected teleportation yet?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-22 23:30:27	@dks2008 you can get the liquid formulation otc, and I think it worlds better.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-22 12:33:55	@tui_talk my last one was an epic dud for the first six months, everything broke. Once replaced, all good for ages and ages till I fucked it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-22 12:32:06	@tui_talk all I've ever had, customer service is epic. They serviced mine in NZ out of country and warranty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-22 12:27:04	@tui_talk what dells do ya'll get? I love my xps, got it under 1k USD. Windows 8 can die but it's a slick little machine.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-21 10:26:24	Holy mother of terrifying faces. Remind me to never cross Christine Baranski.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-21 10:24:33	@ohheyitsal the sunglasses she's gonna cut a bitch

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-21 04:30:52	Good god we lost to the Cowboys. Pardon me while I drown myself from shame.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-21 03:58:36	@pineapplecakes I'm pretty much just repeating what you're tweeting tbqh. All the things i know about nascar...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-21 03:56:14	@pineapplecakes watching the race with the fam. So much danica hate I'm seething.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-20 02:05:13	@pineapplecakes give a man who doesn't know how to use jumper cables a jump.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-20 00:47:59	@pineapplecakes I'm more concerned than an adult can't change wiper blades.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-19 22:59:37	@DoreenMcVeigh but can I use it to make my experiments work better or threaten my mice into submission.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-19 22:25:51	@DoreenMcVeigh I WANT A SWORD OF SCIENCE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-19 20:25:58	@darthraydor wait what.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-19 20:15:03	@brittania_ I wonder if I'll ever feel like what I think that feels like again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-19 13:10:04	@roomerholmes the shame. SHAME.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-19 13:09:44	@darthraydor her paint colors were pretty primary, that should be good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-18 12:38:25	Good god that was exhausting @ohheyitsal . So glad I decided against video links too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-18 12:05:58	@ohheyitsal on it let's talk about two completely different interpretations of the same show ooooooo so fun
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-18 10:02:08	Easily the most frustrating thing about the Blacklist is my complete inability to spoil myself to get the backstory.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-17 12:29:10	@darthraydor oh bless her heart.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-17 12:25:57	@darthraydor ?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-17 12:24:43	@darthraydor I don't even want to look at it for fear of secondhand embarrassment.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-17 10:06:52	I'm spending the night elbow-deep in systemic pharmacologics, whatever that means. Somebody tell me if I don't need to study for my exam tom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-17 08:30:23	Sometimes my flash cards betray how much time I spend online. Oh, diabeetus. pic.twitter.com/Ox28Oq84jX
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-17 04:52:48	Is anybody going to the @ColdWarKids show in Philly on sat from the midstate and want to carpool? The trains are at the wrong times!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-17 04:49:35	@papagena665 heh. Heh heh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-17 04:48:37	@Ambiennn that's on par with katelynne.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-16 10:40:05	@tui_talk in much the same way one might call an attractive actor an asshole for their face and how perfect it is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-16 09:51:54	Asshole city. RT @Wellington_NZ It's particularly pleasant to stroll along the #Wellington waterfront. pic.twitter.com/r3WjGhUHo1
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-16 03:56:24	@papagena665 indeed superior survival skills.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 11:48:03	@nikkidarling I thought it was glorious but my relationship with that kind of southern storytelling is deeper than Bamber's dimples.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 11:45:14	@pineapplecakes apparently I watch NCIS and survivor now too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 11:44:27	@pineapplecakes I've just gotten into the habit of watching jeopardy every day and being too lazy to change the channel after.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 11:43:47	@nikkidarling DAT SOUNDTRACK THO. panty peeling motherfrakkers goddamn.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 11:42:28	@pineapplecakes negl it's so nice to know what the hell it is you're going on about for once.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 11:39:55	@pineapplecakes discreetly was a big step for him.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 11:33:06	@nikkidarling have you seen black snake moan dear god tell me someone else has.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 11:32:01	@ohheyitsal so he can have a long, illustrious career with the LAPD.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 11:30:45	@ohheyitsal oh shit you're on tuco belay that soldier.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 11:30:15	@ohheyitsal car bowling?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 09:34:10	@roomerholmes I got lucky with phenom doctors. I have campers who are medicated out of their minds for no reason.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 09:28:04	@roomerholmes I can't tell you how much I wish it wasn't the only option for me. Some chemical imbalances don't get fixed with diet etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 09:26:22	@roomerholmes mine actually showed great restraint in keeping me off my old meds until I was stable enough to slowly wean back on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 09:23:53	@roomerholmes I mean, I was a legitimate and immediate psychiatric need. My case is a downside of nonspecific psych meds.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-15 07:48:29	HEY HEY @PennStHershey ON JEOPARDY. Definitely got that one right.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 12:04:37	@roomerholmes @zestylime I hear you. I never had a side effect until they tried me on antipsychotics and now I have all the side effects.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 11:28:48	@darthraydor oh nah on the cammomile lawn. Borgias just got axed didn't it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 11:27:39	@zestylime Just not the DC Cherries, there's enough football porn already.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 11:27:18	@zestylime What about the DC Cherry Blossoms? Pinktober will totally make sense with them!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 11:13:03	@darthraydor it's like six eps. easy peasy. pillars of the earth?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 11:11:41	@zestylime oh oh oh the maraion berry's. stadium chant: bitch set me up! symbol: crack pipe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 11:00:11	@zestylime the washington rights. because you stand on the fucking right asshole tourists.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 10:58:40	@darthraydor i have a deep abiding love for on the cammomile lawn even though it's a bit silly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 10:48:05	omg the washington escalators how many points they score is how many metro escalators will be working that week.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 10:41:18	@zestylime metro escalators which never work.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 10:38:18	@zestylime bonus points for being supremely accurate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 08:32:32	For the curious, that's two minutes fourth-three seconds of balancing a cat on my boobs, not a Phillip Glass reference.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 08:29:41	Will someone who's seeing @gilesdraws and co tell them that Paul and I are at two minutes, fourty-three seconds. One week to improve!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-14 05:50:02	Yes some @ColdWarKids Miracle Mile playing during Fox football this afternoon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-13 22:06:37	I think I have a bruise shaped like the nittany lion head. I'm totally okay with this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-13 11:15:16	@zestylime already on it stole some celebratory booze from some frat boys.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-13 11:14:41	So basically what I'm getting is the one time all ya'll watch a peen state game I'm at it and can't troll along at home.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-13 11:09:45	@zestylime FOUR FUCKING OVERTIMES dear god

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-10 01:29:41	@ohheyitsal I have loved her since NZXF and I will love her forever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-10 01:25:31	@ohheyitsal Where have you been all this time woman?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 11:56:04	@tui_talk most certainly. Have you met us?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 11:55:46	@tui_talk gay romance? Levithan. After school special? Anderson. Straight? Dessen. Cancer? Greene. Come on guys you can try harder than that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 11:53:49	@tui_talk what does guessing half the authors say about you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 11:01:52	Or some shit like that.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 10:59:29	Fairly certain I'm just watching Scandal to see Will Bailey talk about the DCCC again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 10:51:26	So this Scandal thing is kind of interesting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 10:29:20	@befernee I'm just so tired of reading papers full of bad research done simple because they had the money for it when so much else suffers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 10:23:22	@befernee Breast cancer, otoh is the biggest clusterfuck of madness and trial and error therapies unless you're BRACA.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 10:22:08	@befernee There are other diseases where the tech is nearly there to make major and totally possible breakthroughs, but science can't get $
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 10:21:16	@befernee Most cancers are serious and heartbreaking. 3 of my mom's 4 were horrific. But let's spread the money around, yeah?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 09:43:47	@befernee @tui_talk Or another cause because breast cancer is so ridiculously funded people are doing shit research because they can get $

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 08:29:06	@LexxiBeckk you've got like a year to go, right? Maybe big black will die before then.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 08:27:10	@LexxiBeckk yes. You nailed that spelling.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 08:23:06	@LexxiBeckk yeah have you met your parents? And you want a car for a birthday before you'll be able to drive on your own?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 08:09:15	@LexxiBeckk that's what mine did with me. The old blue car sat around for ages until I was old enough to drive.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-09 07:41:22	@LexxiBeckk girl, you're getting the black one.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-07 19:57:52	@mizujada that's sort of how your nerves work. Neurotransmitter arrives at the end of the neuron (axon) and waits for the signal to go to
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-07 19:49:10	Vesicular transport is the driest, least sexy thing but it revolutionized our understanding of protein production and neural communication.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-07 19:46:57	I love so so much when they award Nobels for deeply essential but non-sexy things.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-07 05:48:14	@zestylime But it got funded 'cause there's always money for breast cancer and none for any other biomedical research.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-07 05:45:28	@zestylime I can't tell you how many breast cancer papers I've had to read where the only conclusion is the whole thing was a waste o' money

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-07 04:27:06	@roomerholmes wat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-07 04:19:20	My mother is trolling Giants fans on fb with science. I'm so proud.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-07 04:12:03	I'd like to propose a study of the effect of playing the Eagles on the tendency to boo your own team.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-07 04:02:00	@pineapplecakes but Eli just threw his second interception to the iggles in ten minutes. How could today be bad.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-04 09:24:54	@tui_talk aw. Maybe some day I can visit it again!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-04 07:42:31	@tui_talk Aw, the couch bed! Hi couch bed!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 17:57:43	Send help. Surrounded by perky residents in scribe. Not even 6am yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 09:07:49	So now that I have a department, I get to go to department seminars. At 6:00 in the morning! Why oh why did I join a clinical department?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 05:24:44	@tui_talk military fluff. but well-done military fluff.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 05:21:24	@tui_talk Oh goodness no. No no no. Tremendously adequate? Substantially okay?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 05:20:04	@tui_talk Be sad for the bookstores. Poor things need a way to sell things to the masses.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 05:19:24	@tui_talk Fair. He does it with a linear plot and characters with a little substance. Mind you, it's the same ones in every book.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 05:18:23	@tui_talk His work is a very distinctly american voice. I don't notice it so much, but I'm used to it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 05:17:27	@tui_talk Still miles and miles ahead of twilight tho.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 05:14:25	@tui_talk I'm thinking in comparison to a lot of the crap that gets published. He has coherent plots, characters with a little depth.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 04:53:53	@tui_talk yeah. A shit ton of something above adequate but not great.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 02:33:25	Nothing has restored my faith in humanity like the reaction of DC bars/food joints/local businesses to the shutdown.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 02:28:10	@tui_talk I mean, a couple great books and a shit ton of good ones is a sheer mass more than having a great book or two.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-03 02:26:18	@ohheyitsal Hey thanks for the appreciation!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-02 20:04:26	@mmdahlia27 it's more expensive for me too, but our student health insurance is the best deal I will ever get.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-02 20:03:43	@mmdahlia27 I feel like there might be. a fluke there, as it has to cost less than 9% of your income.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-02 11:27:56	@quarantedeux @darthraydor I continually thank my lucky stars that I found all ya'll when I got back into fandom and not them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-02 09:33:39	@darthraydor none of the new ones? a lot of the old ones are downright sketch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-02 08:07:58	@chidorme now all we need is a palm for exploits.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-02 07:52:35	@chidorme the two of us united for such high good can only be worthy of true epic.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-02 07:42:17	@mmdahlia27 how to take advantage of the pain-killer properties with other compounds that activated the receptor other than the illegal one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-02 07:36:11	@mmdahlia27 haha nah, we get the pure compound in lab. Way too strong.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-02 07:29:51	@mmdahlia27 haha oh yeah that I sorted when I went to grad school again. My home is a research home.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-10-02 07:20:53	@mmdahlia27 about THC? Sure.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-30 11:08:56	@chidorme I want to so badly it looks so awesome. Particularly the asylum season. Absolutely that season. Ugh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-30 10:57:26	@chidorme I got scared reading the AHS synopsis on wikipedia. It was almost too much.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-30 10:56:32	@tui_talk nope nope found the exception FIREFLY.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-30 10:55:13	@tui_talk I think the west wing might be an exception to that. It is indeed rare that a show improves in the last season.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-06 10:07:09	It can only end badly when Ripley gets that look like his head's about to explode. #Luther

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-05 10:18:12	Passive-aggressive neighbor has parked in the person in her spot. I can't stop laughing watching the errant parker try to get around.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-05 09:10:10	I'm so glad they're airing #Luther all in one week, so I'm not checking under the bed for weeks.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-05 07:05:40	All this about a female scientist LEGO minifig confuses me. Nobody just made one themselves? All my astronauts were chicks as a child.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-05 03:27:52	@ohheyitsal or we can pretend that they don't exist because they're kids and therefore don't count.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-05 03:23:06	@ohheyitsal this cast is reaching for battlestar levels of bangability
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-05 03:20:02	@ohheyitsal i was about to counter with my deep desire to bang eli but realized that applies to everyone but peter.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-05 03:17:36	@ohheyitsal the only downside is less diane this way which makes my heart weep.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-05 03:14:57	@ohheyitsal i'd give them all the business. all of it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-04 19:39:56	@tui_talk it's the buns. They contort the face.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 12:06:20	@zestylime @roomerholmes @pineapplecakes took me a while to get the brownies one tbqh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 11:59:44	@roomerholmes @zestylime @pineapplecakes ayyyyyyyy i thought those were doughnuts.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 11:58:56	@zestylime @roomerholmes @pineapplecakes serious question though, what is aaron rodgers supposed to be
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 11:56:36	@roomerholmes @zestylime @pineapplecakes fast forward to me shouting 'i wish i could quit you' erry time they turnover this season.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 08:44:16	@pineapplecakes ...wut.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 08:42:03	@darthraydor clearly the world doesn't want me to see pretty things. just lab things. all the days. and all the nights. ever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 08:40:53	@darthraydor no reception down here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 08:34:43	@darthraydor fact: it has taken all this time for my lab internet to load the first two manips. ughhhhhhh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 08:19:24	@pineapplecakes @darthraydor that would explain why i find so much quality shit there
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 08:16:59	@pineapplecakes @darthraydor *sigh* just when i think i've got a handle on this trolling thing
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 08:12:41	@pineapplecakes @darthraydor really? i found them on fanpop.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-03 08:11:37	@darthraydor @pineapplecakes see the fatal (heh) flaw in that argument is that you'd have to kill yourself.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-02 23:42:55	Two games at beaver stadium is a good way to spend a fall. Now to educate the others about the white out. And fight songs. Everything really
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-02 22:58:12	@witzseeker @darthraydor it's what i do, vomit rainbows everywhere bringing joy to the planet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-02 22:53:26	@witzseeker @darthraydor in an unrelated note, i feel like i'm messing up this b&w picture list
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-02 22:51:30	@witzseeker @darthraydor exhibit a: why we can't have nice things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-02 22:10:09	@darthraydor what did he do this time?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 07:30:41	Because when you lose 20 scholarships and can't play in a bowl you take the little wins you can get.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 07:29:57	And just for good measure, now seems a good time for a quick ROAR LIONS ROAR.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 05:33:47	And as usual, everybody's off watching the same game and I'm in the corner by myself with my nittany lions.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 05:13:17	@zestylime while the rest of us just beat each other to shreds natch
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 05:09:33	Bill O'Brien you so cheeky.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 05:00:08	@zestylime preach it. so when they realign we ignore the west and play for the championship with the east top two right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:57:21	@zestylime ooh fun!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:54:58	@zestylime it's not a quality football season if it's not osu-msu-psu-sometimes a badger.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:52:04	So the newspaper definitely had a PSU-UVA game picture on the front page labelled as PSU-Syracuse. Heh. Heh heh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:50:52	@zestylime oh this will be good to watch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:50:25	@zestylime right. brain fart. we play michigan this year. dude B1G needs to get their shit together and stop tryna make fetch happen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:49:13	@zestylime you with @roomerholmes for that one?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:47:51	@zestylime that's the only way for good football! I'm a fair sight sure i've got tickets for this year's game. should be the whiteout STOKED
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:46:38	@zestylime they're playing temple, yeah? that''s a fairly zero feels on all sides game, tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:44:07	@zestylime WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:43:39	@zestylime i went to catholic high school, we were the fighting irish. i feel like it's misplaced nostalgia loyalty
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:42:56	@zestylime looks like it. whatever my love is undying and unconditional.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:41:35	@zestylime eh normally i'd be all about that just not while there's a nittany lion onscreen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:40:23	So the vibe I'm getting so far is "we are penn state" is actually "we are not doing anything particularly spectacular"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-09-01 04:39:03	@zestylime fuck a domer (sorry @quarantedeux ) I'm here for my peeny lions.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-30 04:40:20	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes good call. Hydrocodone processes in the liver, I try not to fuck with that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-30 04:08:07	@roomerholmes Depends. Some of them are actually the deadly if you drink. Anitbiotics will just give you the epic shits though.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-28 10:17:55	@roomerholmes Preach it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-28 07:25:12	For a hilarious time, give a cat it's first introduction to a working printer.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-22 01:45:58	@mirrenoff @ohheyitsal season 8 was so beautiful it makes up for all the things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-22 00:04:07	@mirrenoff @ohheyitsal let us all just never speak of season seven. Ever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-21 07:57:03	@ohheyitsal eBay is probably a goldmine
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-21 07:52:51	@ohheyitsal used book stores/sales. And yard sales. Probably dc craigslist.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-20 12:10:47	Introducing my cat to my arch-nemesis the millipede is going to go a lot better if I stop screaming and tossing him every time they move.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-20 12:00:26	@quarantedeux we're circling on tickets for purdont at psu. student section ftw.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-20 11:29:44	@quarantedeux i'm nearing the halfway point of my west wing rewatch. why are shows allowed to be seven seasons long dear god.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-20 08:43:13	@nikkidarling can we have a later-in-the-week watching party? i'm so so far behind.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-14 01:39:08	@bmarty14 pretty good, trying to decide if the nap is worth it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-14 01:36:25	@bmarty14 hey how's it going over there?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-12 04:47:39	My girls are objectifying the male counselors and they are so uncomfortable. Turnaround's a bitch guys. #campsassy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-11 03:20:12	@LaJoyMeetsWorld @JoshMalina that awkward moment when you can't tell which show he's useless in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-08-10 12:20:11	Going to bed happy that tomorrow night you'll be in an uncomfortable cot in the woods definitely isn't normal. It's camp, nothing is normal.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-25 01:39:54	@ohheyitsal and what's in the epilogues isn't so much romance as it is two people trying to survive together.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-24 23:11:09	@quarantedeux is 9/8c too early? i totally forgot about zones of time.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-18 20:50:47	But actually how are we not doling out all the awards to Tatiana Maslany. Emmys Y U hate sci fi so much.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-18 07:27:20	@pineapplecakes yo gurl where you get your luther
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-18 03:44:26	@tui_talk I'm game with opening trade routes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-17 10:03:51	When I die and go wherever, I'm punching humidity in the face.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-17 09:39:00	@dks2008 they just started again!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-17 08:58:06	You're missing out on top quality new whose line right now. Top notch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-17 06:02:09	@atmodrop @roomerholmes @pineapplecakes sounds like an average day in lab if you sub poision for radioactivity.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-17 01:30:46	@zestylime ...if this was hp fandom, there'd be fic about him sucking his own dock in a millisecond.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-17 01:29:37	@zestylime that was 10000x better when I was having Tim curry/hexxus feels.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-17 01:04:43	'Why can't America's Social Security System Be As Simple As New Zealand's?' Because there are more than 70x as many people here, fuckwit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 22:45:19	@ohheyitsal haha a good one but a totally broke one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 22:44:02	@ohheyitsal I nearly gave my brand new cat heatstroke and had to go to Wal-Mart at 2am for AC.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 22:43:04	@zestylime ...wat. also the Hexxus on a banana is remarkably intriguing why brain why.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 22:39:28	@mmdahlia27 I have all this free air travel from my long ass layover, and too many tempting options to use it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 22:38:36	@chidorme most definitely.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 22:38:22	@SnippetsofSarah Steven!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 11:04:36	@mmdahlia27 WHAT I am coming to visit, obvs.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 08:35:44	@chidorme talkative kitty who takes my spit on the couch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 07:58:45	So I've got a new roommate. He's a bit of a bum. pic.twitter.com/X4gGCprThF
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 02:15:30	@hubbit It won't be the kind of three-headed opera singer Richard wants though, natch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 02:11:21	@hubbit We'll revel in the old games, maybe the new ones too, Have great new jokes like Richard Simmons....meow
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 02:09:00	@hubbit No longer stuck on youtube, it's back on our tv, there is no Drew but that's okay, we've got our favourite three!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-16 01:58:46	There is new Whose Line tomorrow why aren't you all more excited for this?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-15 20:46:41	@chidorme Ours is through the state university, that could indeed have something to do with it. Also the building happens to have a hospital
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-15 20:41:22	@chidorme Really? Ours is the best I'll ever have, I'm sure of it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-15 13:06:14	Are we sure #MovieTitlesThatDoubleAsPornTitles isn't a sponsored marketing campaign for Pacific Rim?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-15 12:06:57	Quick, name a Sorkin show that doesn't feature a Van Morrison song.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-15 11:38:47	bahahahahaha the taliban resented it #thenewsroom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-15 11:15:25	Thing one: @roomerholmes is seriously awesome. Thing two: NEWSROOM TIME.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-15 10:55:37	@roomerholmes I don't have it, sadly. My free HBO went away a few months ago and I never re-upped it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-15 10:53:17	@roomerholmes are you on it live or a dl?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-15 10:22:49	L&P AND WHITE CHOCOLATE L&P AND WHITE CHOCOLATE Good god it's everything I want out of life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-15 10:20:45	There really aren't words to describe how badly I want that L&P chocolate. Kiwi friends, who can make this happen?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-14 04:55:39	@ohheyitsal A+ wonderful little river.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-14 01:28:52	@brittania_ hold me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-13 21:55:28	"It's made in China!" OMG TAO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-13 21:41:24	@ohheyitsal 900% wonderful
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-13 21:29:41	@ohheyitsal 's my favourite favourite mashup.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-13 21:22:08	@ohheyitsal have you heard drake and diane?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-13 13:05:49	@ohheyitsal yes get on that the last season of tww is actual perfection.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-13 12:27:05	@ohheyitsal toooooomorroooooooowwwwwwwwwwww!! watch some other sorkin!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-12 20:14:03	Alas, 'canes. Next year! RT @AllBlacks : Crusaders 25 v Hurricanes 17 - Full Time #CRUvHUR #superrugbynz
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-12 03:58:52	@chidorme not if it's a social media position.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-11 12:04:22	@ohheyitsal Did you ever firefly? Because if you keep watching Mal actually returns. HE KEPT THE COSTUME.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-11 04:24:51	@ohheyitsal If you need the eps i have seasons 1-4 i think. I can find a way to get them to you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-11 04:24:16	@ohheyitsal No. It's actually not streaming anywhere which puzzles me to no end. It's on TNT basically all the time though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-11 04:22:58	@ohheyitsal YES COME TO THE CASTLE DARK SIDE IT IS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-10 11:51:56	Clearly the last thing I need to be doing in the middle of the night is watching Luther.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-10 11:37:09	@ljsgrace yeahhhhhhh! Imported from lancaster county!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-10 11:16:25	@nikkidarling @ohheyitsal I would be friends with you in different houses because that's what the cool kids do
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-10 11:13:15	@ohheyitsal @nikkidarling I'm a little bit psycho, I'd totally end up in g/s
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-10 11:11:32	Absurdly excited for my new brain doctor tomorrow. What are the things that are important in my life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-10 11:10:34	@nikkidarling this is why we're friends.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-10 11:08:49	@nikkidarling yasssss the house nobody ever wanted.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-10 03:34:54	@chidorme Reported is definitely an important caveat on that one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-10 03:30:23	@chidorme It's only a mass shooting if white people got shot, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 20:52:11	@LizCanTweet WHOOOOOOOOOI
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 10:47:32	In tonight's episode of Rex's Epic Trip Home, my car got towed from long term parking what did I do to displease the travel gods.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 09:32:54	Hey @AmtrakNEC the conductor in the quiet car on tonight's 655 Keystone is six kinds of fantastiic. Always a highlight of the late trains.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 09:09:24	@pineapplecakes if i had to guess, i'd say not on this train.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 09:03:25	@nikkidarling @pineapplecakes @quarantedeux are ya'll chatting a bit tonight? I'm stuck on a train, so no mc for me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 08:12:25	@nikkidarling holy fuck can things stop coming back on for five seconds so I can get caught up
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 07:42:08	Long wait in 30th street, we meet again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 07:12:25	@smlindemann Skurrious! Undying spirit, alertness, energy, progress.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 06:52:24	@smlindemann alpha gam! I'm one (albeit, an alum member)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 06:48:35	@ohheyitsal it'll be good if you haven't watched the first ep, but mind blowing if you have.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 04:17:25	@ohheyitsal faboo, Fabio. Whatever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 04:17:04	@ohheyitsal it is, but they wrote a book too and it's Fabio.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 04:15:23	@ohheyitsal Luther? Idris Elba?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 04:13:52	@ohheyitsal do you Luther? I don't care go run read that now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 04:13:17	I should have come up with a stuck in the airport by moose hashtag eleven hours ago.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 04:11:40	And an upgrade to first class what what.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 04:09:09	The best part about finally boarding a plane? No more CNN.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 03:51:19	@mmdahlia27 mine is 96% white and part of the alabama part of pa.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 02:06:46	@nikkidarling i do to and after today i have a magical flight monies to spend but november and uni ugh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 01:12:23	@mizujada the moose on the runway this morning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 01:10:28	Did I just do CNN's second-by-second flight rundown with them? Get me out of this airport please as soon as possible.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 00:37:26	@pineapplecakes why did i take so long to luther why holy shitballs
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 00:36:35	@nikkidarling @ohheyitsal long and hard and brown, just how i like them
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-09 00:34:50	@nikkidarling @ohheyitsal I DID THAT TOO https:// sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/2 06559_504065956121_819_n.jpg …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-08 22:19:52	OH HOLY FUCK SOMEONE HOLD ME I'M ONLY FIVE MINUTES IN WHAT IS GOING ON #LUTHER
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-08 22:13:33	Drowning out CNN with Luther is clearly the best possible option.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-08 21:11:42	Aw man. Old dude and I were doing so well until CNN switched over to Trayvon Martin.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-08 20:25:34	Consensus is that no matter what the plane escape tips CNN is about to give us are going to be completely useless.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-08 20:24:51	We're trying to decide if it would be better to be in a dry plane crash where you're paralyzed or an ocean one where you die instantly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-08 20:22:39	The old dude stuck here with me is trolling CNN so hard out I think I just made a new best friend.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-08 20:17:33	Currently taking bets on how long until I throw a sign at the tv to make the CNN shut up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-08 20:07:56	@dks2008 Moose on the runway. Not even lying.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-08 20:04:11	Spending my standby hours in the airport planning where I'll spend my free flight money like a boss. I'm thinking Europe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-08 17:12:36	@tui_talk AWESOME.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-08 17:11:35	4am drive onto the mainland: moose watch 2013.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-07 10:08:25	Opportunities not to be missed: drunken fresh mussel dinners with unrelated octagenarians.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-06 08:30:35	Check out this crusty beauty. pic.twitter.com/4BZHY9DZ1F
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-06 08:02:21	Oh my. The campground neighbors have hoisted a pinata. It's Thomas the tank engine. Gonna be that kind of night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-06 07:53:13	@AJoos haha maybe, though it's a four hour haul to Portland from the island. Have fun though! Portland's a great town.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-05 18:57:14	@AJoos I'm here till Monday. You guys are down in Portland, yeah?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-05 10:24:41	@pineapplecakes I mean what.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-05 10:24:33	@pineapplecakes GIVE US THE FIRST LADY IN LINGERIE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-05 10:03:45	Meanwhile, in Bass Harbor there are five lobster boats setting off impressive firework displays.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-05 09:39:05	People on both sides of southwest harbor are shooting off fireworks. Anything you can do I can do better.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-05 06:15:01	Maine is a weird place.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-05 06:14:48	In case you were wondering, we marched behind an evil driving a usps truck in the parade today.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-04 21:06:00	Elvis is directing traffic in Bar Harbor, guys. Elvis.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-04 21:00:55	There is nothing more fun than watching a parade assemble. Particularly when there are giant lobsters involved.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-04 04:50:30	@pineapplecakes no nope no I had to catch a plane ugh the waiting, it hurta
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-03 20:11:52	@pineapplecakes run nigga run nigga duck nigga duck nigga
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-03 20:10:18	LOOK WHAT I FOUND ON THE AIRPORT TRAIN. A WILD IDRIS APPEARS. pic.twitter.com/CT1psvar0k
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-03 19:59:16	Clearly the way to survive on a blisteringly hot train platform is to snag a spot next to the door to the sign control room.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-03 07:47:14	@petridishes We have so few tourist opportunities here in central PA, gotta milk it where we can. The amish aren't so keen on sandwitches.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-03 07:45:20	My favourite thing about the Keystone line will always be how the station announcements just give up after Philly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-03 07:35:13	@amtrakquietcar I've seen at least a hundred of those. Perhaps the triple rainbow of train travel?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-03 07:04:42	There is a train! A full day of phone tag and @AmtrakNEC totally came through.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-03 07:00:39	Glorious opportunities not to be missed: having an Amtrak quiet car all to yourself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-03 05:59:28	@darthraydor whaaaaaaat that's ridic cheap
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-03 05:12:39	There is new Luther in the world and I have a plane ride. Los liiiiiinks please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 19:01:47	@petridishes you should check them out in a low-growth cornfield. It's awesome to behold.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 12:06:06	@quarantedeux but i'm 95% sure those people would be horrified to know their advice only pertains to fat people tee hee hee.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 12:04:34	@quarantedeux unless you have mondo fits like me, that's totally the ticket. I double up on expensive ones, sadly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 12:03:07	@ohheyitsal and then there's Wilson in the corner, caring.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:47:28	@pineapplecakes god me too. A world without Alice is not a world I want to live in tbqh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:46:14	@pineapplecakes I thought there were hints of another series not so far away. I could have been projecting my hopes though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:44:11	@pineapplecakes wait what please no.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:43:17	@pineapplecakes SADISTS. Or possibly to save us from combustion of too much idris. I'm open to that death though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:41:40	@pineapplecakes I feel you. I needed more so much I bought the fucking book.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:40:03	@pineapplecakes ALICE MORGAN PROBABLY TOMORROW I CANNOT CONTAIN MY EXCITES.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:38:43	@pineapplecakes I have the sneaking suspicion I may have just made your day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:37:53	@pineapplecakes IN ENGLAND TOMORROW! THIS IS THE INTERNET WHAT'S A COUNTRY TO A PIRATE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:36:24	@pineapplecakes Luther is back tomorrow ducking finally.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:34:56	@pineapplecakes hey are we all collectively Luther-ing at some point tomorrow or is it flail-at-will.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:25:29	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux I mean, I was considering a change in profession.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:23:54	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux particularly when your only pair of pants no longer has a crotch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-07-02 10:00:45	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes True Life: the laundromat ate my clothes.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-28 12:04:02	@roomerholmes That part I got. It's the mechanics that have flabbergasted me. It's a free way to text across the pacific i'm all in.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-28 07:24:43	A coworker's son, upon hearing about the DOMA decision asked, "Gay people can't get married?" There is hope for the future, guys.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-27 10:08:20	I'm all done for the day, I'll watch this House episode that on, I said. What are all these dead Kutner feelings you're giving me, I said.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-27 00:20:38	That awkward moment when someone you love's blog is everything you hate in a fandom blog.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-26 06:00:35	@brittania_ I did that once, but it was a stand up paddle board after my kayak got washed out to sea by the river.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-26 00:51:19	My fantasty SCOTUS has crashed and burned into a shit show. It's only to be expected from a scientist, I guess.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-23 06:25:13	@pineapplecakes I've been drunk since four what do you expect from me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-23 06:23:13	@pineapplecakes they got the nascar on right in front of me in my biker bar. I know what the hell you're talking about for once!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-23 05:59:24	@1lexib NOPE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-23 05:59:09	@quarantedeux yeah, I had to watch it in the hardcore redskins bars. Other than that, though. Beauty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-23 05:57:13	@quarantedeux ex? dc, phone. Get it together.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-23 05:56:31	@quarantedeux thank god ex's a city that's made of transplants or I would have died so many times in my iggles jersey.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-23 05:53:18	@quarantedeux that's dangerous, man.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-22 22:09:02	In which @neilhimself was lovely, even as we confirmed the line was past 1000. #GaimanDC pic.twitter.com/BE5UFTQZ79

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-21 23:19:17	@steveplace Actually, the building that Forever 21 is in right above the metro stop would be ideal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-21 23:18:47	@steveplace Close enough to the other weird museums, but far enough from the mall to make it legit. And enough crazy homeless guys for atmo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-21 23:14:29	@steveplace On the block with the main public library, by Cuba Libre.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-21 22:30:29	@Politics_Prose Are the ticketed books for #neilhimself already signed, or do we have to brave the signing line for that tonight?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-21 11:28:01	Tomorrow morning when I want to die, remind me it's my program director's fault for buying me so much @TroegsBeer #nakedelf
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-21 10:59:42	I didn't just get wasted with the head of my program noooooooo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-21 01:19:25	@TeamUfYH Soonish! It has an ish! Hooray! Slightly more specific vagueness is awesome GO YOU AWESOME PERSON.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-20 11:11:33	@halfpress We've all been pick-your-own-price data plans, but I think we might be doing a shared now, I'm told it's cheaper for us all
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-20 11:10:56	@halfpress Ahhhh. Last time we re-upped the contract it was only 20, but for six lines that's reasonable.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-20 10:50:59	@halfpress Isn't it 20 for unlimited across all lines though?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-20 10:48:11	@LizCanTweet TWO DAYS TILL NONSENSE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-19 23:11:54	Did they find Jimmy Hoffa? Is that a thing that is happening?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-19 22:16:57	@mmdahlia27 I prefer the term 'active sleeper'. I think I act out my dreams when there's nobody else there to judge me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-19 22:10:56	If someone says 'I'll be in DC friday let me know if you want to hang?', is it bad to say 'I will be but please stay the fuck away from me?'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-19 22:09:48	@mmdahlia27 ...or is that flailing thing just me?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-19 22:09:36	@mmdahlia27 the real genius is that if you stick with the spanx, that nonsense isn't going anywhere while you flail around in you sleep.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-18 09:00:31	@quarantedeux oh good. I'm staying miles away from the chatzy and their emma hate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-18 08:52:28	So are we rocking the MC-thing this week?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-18 05:40:32	That panicked moment when you misread the P&P email and think you actually only bought one @neilhimself ticket.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-18 03:16:47	@papagena665 I'm so glad I'm not the only one with that attitude.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-18 01:55:54	@petersagal And just LOOK at the mess he has to clean up this time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-17 23:34:15	@Hersheypark Thanks! I only ask 'cos it wakes up the babies in the next apartment and they scream late into the night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-17 20:54:50	@tui_talk is it misogyny or just hatred of a purely evil character?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-16 04:33:18	@Hersheypark Is it mandatory that the Dry Gulch release whistle for minutes at park close? Can it be done in the station, farther from homes

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-15 12:39:30	I can't tell, but I'm pretty sure @mistermauster is taking live tweeting to a whole new level.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-15 04:10:37	@ohheyitsal I could possibly be persuaded, depending on my rugby schedule.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-15 03:35:17	@chrytonbaine I left it at camp one morning last summer and another counselor picked it up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-15 02:48:31	Reunited with my SBC ring and it feels so good.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-14 10:34:24	Reading today's SCOTUS opinion was hilarious. Someone needs to explain the quotes to me, a "wild type" human being.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-14 10:24:52	@ljsgrace should have taken that left turn at Alburquerque.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-12 10:58:54	@tui_talk I only wish I was watching my family right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-12 10:53:45	@ljsgrace I made it three hours out of the cast before I was back in a wrist brace again. I feel your pain.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-08 23:13:41	@darthraydor Oh no, just the latest episode.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-08 23:04:33	@witzseeker I had surgery monday. I haven't done anything all week what are my life choices.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-08 23:01:07	I think the real question is how did it take me all week to watch Orphan Black.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-04 21:58:31	Thank god for smartphones with internet so I can get my fix with one hand.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-04 08:05:19	The best possible surgery recovery is the new episode of the Killing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-04 04:32:15	Putting my bra on after surgery with only one hand might be my greatest accomplishment to date.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-03 20:11:58	@hubbit whoo hoo! happy anniversary!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-06-03 12:16:09	Goodnight, twitter. I can't livetweet my general anesthetic, but expect some one-handed loopy-ass post-surgery gems tomorrow.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-31 10:01:12	Did I just hit up a drive through liquor store operated by an ancient asian man in a wife beater and gold chains? Yes, yes I did.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-31 10:00:11	@CraigyFerg Indeed. If you're not willing to follow me around and read it to me at all times, it's the least you can do.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-29 04:40:32	@pineapplecakes always a sucker for an odd couple
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-29 04:38:58	@pineapplecakes It changes. Right now it's Allison, it's so fun to watch her in the breakdown.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-29 04:38:24	@pineapplecakes THOSE WERE FEELS OF WASTED POTENTIAL THE VERY WORST KIND THERE ARE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-29 04:36:52	@pineapplecakes I want to love her so badly but I just can't, not when the other clones are being so much more flawless
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-29 04:34:26	@pineapplecakes I did at first, but I dislike the way they've taken her- not Delphine, but shift from super analytical to blindly accepting
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-29 03:18:49	@nikkidarling same. I'm really surprised by how much I don't like Casima, because of science and all. I thought she'd be my fave.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-28 21:40:08	@nikkidarling Allison. I've got a special love for ridiculous type-a on the breakdown.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-28 12:16:50	Earlier, I wanted to marathon the Newsroom but couldn't. Now, I want to go to bed but there's a Newsroom marathon happening.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-28 09:58:52	@mmdahlia27 There's no amount of teaching you can do to keep your position at a university if you don't have any grants.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-28 09:58:14	@mmdahlia27 It's hard to get a job in any field in academia, but in science you live or die by grants, NIH mostly and that keeps getting cut

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-27 11:22:51	@roomerholmes God I love her. I wish I'd kept up with it, but I already watch three other shows at 9 on a sunday. Too much to keep up with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-27 11:12:32	@roomerholmes I got that vibe from the first couple of seasons. Madness.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-27 11:12:01	@roomerholmes But I also spent the evening having feelings about Michael Douglas in sequins so my judgement is clearly faulty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-27 11:10:28	@roomerholmes I feel bad, I'm just rooting for Mad Men to be over so my sweet love The Killing can come back again.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-27 09:09:48	I have never been more attracted to Michael Douglas than when he is Liberace. What does this say about me as a human being.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-27 08:40:38	@samson_today i'm just looking forward to being full time again this year.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-27 08:40:00	@samson_today What's great is that eventually there will definitely be a buttfuzz camp joke.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-27 07:56:13	@samson_today I love that moment when you can't quite tell if its a camp tweet or not
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-26 21:21:44	Why did no one tell me the Killing comes back next week?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-26 00:00:28	@mmdahlia27 Do indigenous technology transfer, build biotech industries where there aren't any, get into patent law. No bench, all business.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-17 21:41:25	Dear people who want their dances lit well: cues like 'continues moving around' is the least helpful direction ever.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-15 10:45:20	@brittania_ best typo or best typo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-15 10:40:54	@brittania_ I don't even begin to pretend to understand this fandom.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-15 10:20:37	Somewhere on the internet someone is complaining about spoilers from the Star Trek 2 ads airing during the first one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-15 10:14:55	@brittania_ they're already mad that sansa's a bitch on the show, so this is an additional perceived slight.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-15 05:53:17	@brittania_ The screen is so expensive and only useful in so few people that most don't even go for it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-15 05:52:43	@brittania_ It is, but BRCA mutations only turn up in ~1% of cases. Great for treatment guidance, but terrible for everybody else.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-15 04:25:11	@SnippetsofSarah they appear to be solely a York thing. There's nothing like it up here. Just a lot of bars with six pack setups.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-15 04:23:37	Sorry forgive me while I fall out of my fair laughing at the last RT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-15 04:11:39	@SnippetsofSarah I turned 21 in a different state and all I knew were six packs at the grocery. Then I came home and I rage against cases.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-15 03:42:23	Or let's hate that 90% of people (men and women) with breast cancer don't get a genetic tip-off to know it's coming to get preventative care
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-15 03:40:55	If we're hating on Angelina, let's hate that the preventative care she was able to get isn't affordable for most women.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-14 02:30:39	@quarantedeux i might just spend this avo's incubation time shopping a package of spaceparents: taste the feels.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-08 10:48:50	@ljsgrace There are so many barriers to that though. No one understands that all science is expensive, at every level. So worth it though!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-08 10:48:19	@ljsgrace Education, education, education. You have to get them by middle school or the battle's already lost.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-08 10:43:49	@ljsgrace Because as a society our science literacy is so abysmally low we fear it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-05-08 10:41:05	There is absolutely zero reason for any politician without an advanced degree in science to be making decisions about what gets funded.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-29 10:25:49	@smlindemann I wish I hadn't worn mine, they were so lovely but they got damaged in the process.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-29 10:25:07	@smlindemann You know what's funny about being an alum? You realize how batshit the outrage is. While I was there I'd've been flipping shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-29 08:31:03	Alas, I entered the movie too late for aviary Polonius jokes and the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Hakuna Matata theory of life.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-28 08:59:35	In case you were wondering, in silico is my new favourite pretentious science term.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-28 08:39:19	I'm a terrible scientist.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-28 08:39:03	I spend six hours writing about the toxic side effects of a drug and then get astonished that I get them after not drinking the whole time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-27 09:47:27	@eroconnor I've heard so. I want to see it badly, let me know how it is?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 21:59:19	@dks2008 Holy jesus. I'm amazed, but honestly entirely unsurprised. Which chrome seems to think isn't a word.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 10:43:35	@mizujada Go you! I only pounded out around 1,000 but it was agonizing. So go you!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 10:36:16	@SnippetsofSarah I like the way you think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 10:34:10	@nikkidarling you should get with @tui_talk her opinions on insurance ads are actually the most hilarious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 10:33:00	@SnippetsofSarah Things I would kill for: the reaction of some of these professors to getting mooned. Or flashed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 10:29:41	@dks2008 and I thought scientists were bad with their every journal a different citation policy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 10:13:56	tl;dr basically I am a terrible completely inattentive friend.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 10:13:32	Today's adventures in crazy brain: trying to figure out how to moon the offices across from the lab while a friend talks deep family things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 10:12:49	@dks2008 ...what. why.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 09:58:32	@ljsgrace @eroconnor what when?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 09:22:29	Dear primary brain problem: please stop making it so I can't treat any of my other problems. No love, me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 04:09:21	@SnippetsofSarah God, do I wish they had been.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 04:05:13	@SnippetsofSarah Oh you should see them in micro lab. Someone was labeling things as gram +/- when we hadn't done a gram stain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 02:56:34	@SnippetsofSarah all backwards, of course. A multitude of greek letters and beer crawl shirts. #dudebrosouttohere
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 02:55:04	@SnippetsofSarah Some PSU (of course). Looks like a Yankees, a Bama, Ravens, and a very brave OSU.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 02:47:33	Let's have a serious discussion about the long line of med students in beats headphones and ball caps next to me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 02:16:57	@brittania_ Only the main cast members though. What am I, a soup kitchen?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 02:16:20	@brittania_ @nikkidarling Except for that whole headache afterwards thing. That's zero fun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 01:43:19	@zestylime bastards. Benefits to living next to a time zone change?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-26 01:38:48	@smlindemann Go Kate! Pass on the good wishes, eh?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 22:13:09	@zestylime NEVER
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 19:56:38	Happy happy birthday @ljsgrace ! #becausetwitterwishesarebetter
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:57:16	@roomerholmes I'm so glad I mentioned it then
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:55:31	@roomerholmes I kind of want to keep that as a perfect explanation of what it's like to move to new zealand.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:54:36	@roomerholmes fucking hilarious considering, negl
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:53:44	@roomerholmes Hohepa and holy shit that's a fantastic bot right there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:52:03	@roomerholmes I clapped. I can't decide if I hate it because I read it for fun, or if I would hate it more if it had ever been assigned.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:51:19	@roomerholmes shit sorry european-descent new zealander.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:49:09	@roomerholmes He's the prototypical Pakeha, and it's absolutely flawless.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:47:56	@roomerholmes I can only wish everyone has that "Everything is universal we're all the fucking same" moment.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:47:29	@roomerholmes The greatest moment ever was when I was telling racist jokes at dinner in NZ and somebody told one of my best but for Maoris
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:46:03	@roomerholmes Speaking of, how was Gormsby?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:45:51	@roomerholmes Having been dumped in New Zealand with little prep, I can fully understand what you're coming at with that one
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:43:54	@roomerholmes I often want to use phrases I speak on the internet but I haven't the slightest idea how the fuck they're spelt.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:43:03	@roomerholmes Bahahahaha I bet. I grew up with mixed german and PA Dutch, not the best prep for college german at all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:42:12	@roomerholmes And by us, I clearly mean psychopaths on the interwebs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:41:38	@roomerholmes lol no worries there are so many of us it's just easier to be all 'that one over there'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:40:52	@roomerholmes 'THEY'RE WEARING SNEAKERS OMG WTF BBQ THEY CAN'T BE AMISH' No shit, sherlocks. Welcome to other anabaptists
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:39:57	@roomerholmes Funniest thing ever was watching the other grad students not from here going mad at mennonites in the hospital
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:38:59	@roomerholmes Yeah that's me. I never seem to catch the chocolate air. Just the annoying amusement park noises.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:38:20	@roomerholmes Yeah I never understood that because there are almost no actual anabaptists down there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:36:48	@roomerholmes Oh yeah totally not the Millersburg I'm thinking of then.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:35:23	@roomerholmes Millersburg PA? One of mine lives just downriver in Halifax!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:33:14	@roomerholmes Iiiinteresting. I guess we don't see the same effect in PA because it's such a huge state and the amish are just in central PA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:31:56	@roomerholmes I went to school down there, but now I live/am originally from just outside the heart of PA Dutch county
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 09:10:29	@tui_talk drink and be trendy?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 08:57:01	@roomerholmes Fun amish thing: I saw a buggy hit-and-run the other day where the horse and buggy were the runners.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 08:56:36	@roomerholmes Fact.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 08:52:54	@roomerholmes I had english teachers in hs that would rail against our pa-dutch inspired writing patterns and ending prepositions. RAIL.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 08:39:43	@roomerholmes I'm constantly trying to figure out where's it at.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 08:10:31	@halfpress Once you've flown a lot in the south pacific it tends to fall to about a 2.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 08:08:51	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 @chidorme Getting a degree online is same as getting one in class- some large schools have online as part of inschool
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 08:08:13	@mmdahlia27 There's an SBC alum from the year ahead of us doing one from PSU's world campus if you're interested I could point you her way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 08:07:27	@mmdahlia27 Some unis have gone online for the sake of going online. Others have really well-cultured programs for a better experience.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 08:06:40	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada Nope! It's a degree from wherever, only obvious if you pick an online-only institution.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 06:48:05	@dks2008 Also it's tres expensive to educate even a shit doctor. Local taxes already go to that behemoth, adding more won't help with cost.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 06:47:00	@dks2008 is not conducive to producing a lot of selfless, non-narcissistic professionals. Hell, they grade your teaching by your attire.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 06:45:51	@dks2008 You would have to change the entire culture to get more doctors in less-paying fields. The personality needed to get into/through
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 06:30:43	@dks2008 Namely: it expands coverage in the areas it's hardest to get doctors for. Everybody wants to be a surgeon nobody wants primary care
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 06:24:57	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada My thought was that some schools are better equipped with more robust online programs designed to be online.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 06:24:20	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada Employers only know who your degree is from, not how you did it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 06:23:37	@dks2008 Will it pay off when the economy improves? What does that say for other degrees like an MD?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 06:22:54	@dks2008 That's a legit expectation then. We were told coming out of my master's to accept nothing less than $50k, minimum.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 06:19:33	@dks2008 I don't see why anybody is surprised- to come out of college expecting to make $50k is kind of ridiculous in any economy tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 05:27:07	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @mizujada Depends entirely on who's offering it, tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 05:26:32	@roomerholmes jfc this fandom has truly lost their collective marbles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 05:23:09	@roomerholmes I figured out that much, but what's the context? No tweet at whom?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 05:21:15	@roomerholmes ??
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-25 05:10:09	@roomerholmes best description of the internet ever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-24 23:48:13	@MichaelAusiello Hahahaha we do it right in central PA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-24 09:41:44	@tui_talk 20 +/- 100 is far more accurate
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-24 08:50:26	Oh god. Finals week is a terrible time for futurama.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-24 08:45:52	@tui_talk questions to which i always lie
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-24 08:27:30	@robynmalcolm It is in the US! I'm adding it to all my friend's queues!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-24 07:45:09	@mizujada I find it's still pretty successful for me. Possibly because I use it the most, and all my father watches are old Godzilla movies
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-24 06:47:15	@madelineab and I am so, so glad you did. Because I would too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-24 05:17:07	I have a lovely little piece of design in my hands and all I want to do is take a hammer to it quick get me a linux boot flash drive.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-24 04:58:32	@mizujada I will burn everything windows loves and then partition and install ubuntu.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-24 04:52:46	It only took me twenty minutes to want to set fire to windows 8. I was expecting it to take at least half an hour.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-23 22:09:29	@madelineab fact. I think he may have been my first celebrity crush.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-23 10:14:49	Ioan Gruffudd what are you doing on all the shows this season.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-22 19:55:48	@fatfreddysdrop1 are you guys planning a stop in the states on your way back?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-22 03:12:15	You know you live next to an amusement park when you have to assure your auto insurance rep the screaming isn't from a horrible accident.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-22 02:14:42	@mizujada I'm looking at this one. http://www. amazon.com/SPT-SD-2201W-C ountertop-Dishwasher-White/product-reviews/B004MX8XO6/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-22 01:59:11	@mizujada exactly what it sounds like. For if you have no room or hookup for a normal dishwasher.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-22 00:40:48	Any productivity I might have had today has been completely annihilated by the arrival of the tracking number for my new computer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-21 23:30:38	Options: lots of effort into finding a new apartment this summer or buying a counter top dishwasher. Hmmmm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-20 12:03:44	@dks2008 So who do we get to shaft with the 18th?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-20 07:44:25	@dks2008 There's more to the constitution than guns and newspapers?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-20 04:48:12	@ljsgrace I just met someone who went to middle school with you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-20 00:27:52	@roomerholmes and when you're finished you should dig up outrageous fortune- similar humor, some of the actors are in it.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-19 10:09:16	Dear Inland Revenue: I do not need to get back on track of my student loan repayments because I'm NOT a New Zealander. Love, me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-19 09:23:55	Called Dell back to confirm my order and they can't find it anywhere FUUUUUUUUU

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-19 06:46:40	@darthraydor WHAT THE FUCK WHY DID I GO SEE THEIR TUMBLR
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-18 10:42:49	@roomerholmes imma see if I can rip the dvds and share with everybody.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-18 10:08:48	Oh my god kiwi friends why did you never tell me about Gormsby before this shit is amazing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-18 08:11:01	@chidorme @middlemuse @LizCanTweet @mizujada @mmdahlia27 Idea! Tagged person picks a category, last person to respond is it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 19:05:46	@tui_talk you're a legend.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 18:55:12	Four for you, New Zealand. You go, New Zealand. #marriageequality
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 18:51:59	@tui_talk now that's a speech I'd love to hear.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 07:16:22	@SnippetsofSarah Shit yeah. Translesion synthesis, you're going digital. This might lead to us finally turning into robots but whatever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 07:05:35	@SnippetsofSarah I tend to just assume no one has that because I never give it out/rarely use it. Clearly that is a silly assumption.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 07:05:03	@SnippetsofSarah although now I've got this mad new idea about how cool it would be if you could sync your DNA damage repair.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 07:04:15	@SnippetsofSarah long hair, don't care my life revolves around polymerases and you can't sync them
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 06:24:39	@SnippetsofSarah (mostly because my phone, it is le dead)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 06:23:20	@SnippetsofSarah It's a sad day in technology land when I have to ask where.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 06:19:20	@witzseeker you were awesome always?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 06:18:57	@madelineab Someone, somewhere had a recipie for it and it was legit. It may have been Rothamel. I'll ask around.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 06:17:15	@SnippetsofSarah That's what I figured, but she was so insistent that I had a momentary panic attack. Dress pics?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 04:50:40	@SnippetsofSarah and then I read it and felt better. (Also, cute piece!)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 04:50:12	@SnippetsofSarah before reading it I thought 'just last week I assured my mother she wasn't engaged oh god I fail as a friend'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 04:39:15	@LizCanTweet @mizujada @chidorme can we play twitter freeze tag? Or tv tag? Or something of the sort?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-17 00:40:44	@papagena665 @ljsgrace there are too many, and I cannot make a decision.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 11:12:34	Somebody remind me tomorrow when I'm freaking out that they're just doing a massive TMI simulation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 11:01:04	I'm kind of a huge fan of the way Castle got the two main leads together and then didn't make it the focus of the show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 10:12:53	@quarantedeux preach
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 09:20:47	WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME PSH IS IN CATCHING FIRE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 09:14:30	@roomerholmes it's a clusterfuck that just continues to generate bullshit and refuses to go away.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 09:02:11	@roomerholmes beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 08:58:35	@roomerholmes haha great minds
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 08:57:14	@roomerholmes yeah buddy. God, do I love our team's football cultures.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 08:56:29	@roomerholmes Nittany Lion statue, JoePa figurine, cowbell and pompoms from the 1982 national championship prominently over the tv.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 08:50:04	@roomerholmes only when you're playing penn state. Just making terrible puns.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 08:41:16	@roomerholmes ngl sorry but it would work even better if he had 0 BAMA jerseys
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 07:48:48	Top quality commentary here, people. Top quality.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 07:48:19	Basically, the bomber(s) are stupid because they didn't figure out that pretty much only fast people run the marathon
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 07:47:37	Loving the guy on ESPN who's throwing shade on whoever did this
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 07:36:44	@tui_talk Camp doesn't take up much space, but it has nothing to do with my field at all ever so bye bye from the resume. Fuck science.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 07:32:56	@tui_talk I wish I had room for my volunteer work, it makes me look so fucking fantastic.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 07:31:34	@tui_talk My referees get second-paged. Multiple schools of higher education+ a long-ass experimental skills section takes up lots o' space
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 07:26:44	@tui_talk Everybody here wants a resume, which is easier anyway so I just stick with that. It's HARD to get it to fit on one page.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 07:22:12	@tui_talk For people our age, the resume should be one page, maybe a little bit of two. The CV? Waaaaay longer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-16 00:34:43	Many happy returns on the quarter century, @sarahnathan7 ! #becausetwitterwishesarebetter
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-15 02:22:50	@quarantedeux holy shit, that's fast!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-15 02:22:33	It used to be doing my taxes was so easy. Being a fully paid PhD student has really fucked that up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-15 01:31:04	@brittania_ @darthraydor ugh what is this precious ginger kitty nonsense.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-14 22:30:47	@tui_talk you had me at Robyn Malcom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-14 11:05:16	@pineapplecakes what is this, state the obvious night on twitter?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-14 10:02:49	@mmdahlia27 Another confirmation in my ghostwriter theory
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-14 10:00:36	Okay, fine @OrphanBlack . You win, I'm hooked.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-14 08:57:01	@roomerholmes absolutely the best show to come out of a top gear presenter beyond y'know actual top gear
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-14 08:33:28	Twitter: the new way to find out there's an accident right in front of your house. Thanks @DerryTownshipPD
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-14 01:32:23	@samson_today it goes right past my place, I'll come out and cheer you on!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-14 01:29:14	@dks2008 whoop whoop!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-13 23:34:05	@dks2008 IMAX 3D WAS THERE EVEN A DECISION
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-12 13:22:50	Horrific picture of me, but it's my only snap of hanging out with the CWK so here you go. pic.twitter.com/CplkErjehz
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-12 13:20:24	In other news, that may have been the best concert I've ever been to.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-12 13:19:48	Life goals accomplished tonight: hugging Nathan Willett.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-12 08:32:30	Oh god this place is going to be full of snotty 17-year olds. Damn.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-11 11:04:18	Things that make me feel like I live in a @neilhimself story: strange noises from the graveyard out back keeping me from falling asleep
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-11 09:10:50	First thunderstorm of the season! Whoo!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-11 08:51:24	@RugbyGrlProbs Farah Palmer!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-10 09:32:14	@nikkidarling masturbation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-10 08:33:55	@tui_talk Oh babies, they're having a season like my football season was. Poor dears.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-10 08:28:01	@nikkidarling WHAAAAAAAAAAAATTTT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-10 08:26:20	@tui_talk It looks like it, they're playing the Penguins. #notthecanesiwanttowatch #buttheydontplayontuesdays #givingthemluckbyproxy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-10 08:09:14	@tui_talk Sitting in the bar across the street, watching the 'canes game and drinking of you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-10 01:50:59	"Extreme depths may cause drowning" Thank you for warning me about the water, MSDS sheet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-10 01:48:54	"Extreme cold can change composition from a liquid to a slick solid." Brb dying of laughter #unrepentantchemist
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-10 01:46:27	Nothing is more hilarious than an MSDS sheet for nuclease free water.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-10 00:46:03	@AWanderingLiz @mizujada @chidorme @LizCanTweet Awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-10 00:45:28	@mizujada @chidorme @AWanderingLiz @LizCanTweet Member presale was today. Regular sale is tomorrow.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-09 21:57:03	@chidorme @AWanderingLiz Clearly we need to rope in @LizCanTweet and make an outing of it!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-09 21:39:21	@chidorme Turns out I was just being impatient. Tah dah!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-09 21:28:33	YES. Neil Gaiman tickets procured. Mission: accomplished.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-09 21:06:12	@chidorme Are you a member? I'm refreshing like mad to see when the discount code rolls in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-09 09:38:25	This week's mission? Tickets to Neil Gaiman in DC in June.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-09 08:55:57	Splitting a quart of Rita's with a ridiculous old hippie man and listening to stories of the 60's. Warm weather, I love you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-09 03:28:30	@tui_talk I just love all ya'll's dedication to black, white, and fern in naming your national teams.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-09 01:58:43	@zestylime here, in the far reaches of the carpark we find the elusive Fords locked in their mating dance.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-09 01:55:57	@zestylime pun or easy wordplay?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-09 01:39:34	@zestylime truck sex
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-09 00:09:32	@papagena665 Bodes better for the first one if others are all over the place too?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-08 23:28:57	@eroconnor it is indeed! Interested?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-08 21:37:30	@tui_talk Ice Fernz?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-08 21:36:26	@tui_talk you can go into your router and learn what machines have been on it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-08 01:51:59	@eroconnor alas, I'm booked straight through! Some other time though, definitely!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-07 07:54:18	Holy motherfuck did I miss this city.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-07 07:42:40	A bit surprised by the relaxation that hit as we crossed into the District. DC I am in you!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-06 08:28:33	@tui_talk Let's not discuss the chills and homesick weepy feelings that song gives me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-06 07:49:15	Hey DC types! I've got a spare ticket for the Cold War Kids at 9:30 club on thursday. Anybody interested?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 09:19:46	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes Truth. He's just always awesome. I got to see him in Salesman and ugh my beating theatre ovaries.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 09:17:40	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes Pirate Radio. And Doubt.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 09:16:03	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes At least for recruitment this year we can offer a senior year bowl game possibility?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 09:11:44	Remember children, it's never too early to start trash talking football.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 09:11:00	@pineapplecakes all ya'll are eligible this year yeah?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 08:48:03	@pineapplecakes all part of the service, ma'am
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 08:46:58	@pineapplecakes HE WOULD. TOO MUCH WANKING OVER BRENDA.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 08:45:48	@pineapplecakes always hilarious. always.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 08:39:15	That's what you get for encouraging religious fanaticism in your son, crazypants. You 'gon get hanged as a whore.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 08:22:16	@tui_talk Also I do rather love that we're on separate continents comparing thoughts on a taco joint. God love the internet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 08:20:15	@tui_talk Absolutely.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 08:19:15	@tui_talk Fact. Those things are small.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 08:12:01	I'm just sitting here shouting 'Alienna would have killed your fake Earl of Shiring ass'. Ugh sequels are the worst. #worldwithoutend
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 07:50:14	Called it too soon all the people I hated survived the Black Death. Motherfucker.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 07:10:31	Aww yeah we've reached that point in the Follet story where all the bad things start happening to the massive cunts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 05:01:56	It's finally happened: my mother has become that person who emails out multiple cat video links in one afternoon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-05 01:19:34	@papagena665 all the albums I was waiting for came out this week. Something new to anticipate!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-04 10:10:09	Moving the scrum sled for the first time all winter and disturbing the family of mice underneath @RugbyGrlProbs
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-03 11:20:47	Forever laughing hysterically at all the people going mad for Gin Wigmore's 'new' album that came out two years ago in New Zealand.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-03 11:11:09	@LizCanTweet WAHOOOOOOOOOOO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-03 10:04:04	Capitalism has officially won: Amazon has a section to shop for credit cards.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-03 09:46:23	So far all I've got is that World Without End is the same as Pillars of the Earth only less interesting characters and worse plot.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-03 08:19:19	I was all cuddled up nice and warm with no intention of moving. And then Splash came on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-03 07:51:15	@mmdahlia27 NEVER
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-03 06:42:37	@MangoHealth That's awesome news!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-02 22:02:43	Why daytime, Anderson Cooper? Why?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-02 11:08:04	"Oh by the way, there's a sinkhole in the usual place" Conversations with my mother, people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-02 10:07:08	@roomerholmes I do indeed. I feel like a traitor because I don't like Hershey chocolate. Except Reese's.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-02 10:04:45	@roomerholmes Sort of. They closed the main factory down the block, but they're working on one on the outskirts of town.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-02 10:03:07	@roomerholmes And they're closin' all the factories dooooooown
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-02 10:02:30	@roomerholmes SOOOOOOOOOOOOO accurate. Yanno the head of the Clan is from two towns over from where I grew up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-02 10:01:50	@roomerholmes Why is that amusing? Harrisburg is a shit town I'd like to leave I'm 100% for the mocking of it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-02 09:57:29	@roomerholmes Occasionally I have pride for my state.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 20:44:05	Camped out with coffee watching the first few victims roll in. This is glorious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 10:44:51	In other news, my new favourite thing might be giving fake spoilers to people complaining about GoT spoilers on facebook.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 10:43:06	Oh, but for the days where Ted was defending Wayne against Wolf. Those were the good days. #outrageous
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 10:12:30	In case you were wondering, the new rule in my apartment is you kneel every time I fart.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 07:34:17	"Although the evidence is a sausage roll, a shoulder touch, and a butt pat, alleged." Love this show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 07:31:33	@roomerholmes can't think of a more perfect moniker for the upstart monarch
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 07:23:22	@roomerholmes Cheering for him to get dead since a couple of episodes into season 1 the little cunt.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 06:34:12	@zestylime And idk if that's a good shower thing or not.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 06:34:00	@zestylime Okay so she loves spiderman so I ordered a couple copies of the wedding issue to make a wedding picture frame for her.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 06:31:01	Fellow SBC women, I need your help!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 06:30:46	And here we run into the ultimate question: do you give the carefully crafted ridiculously personal gift for the shower or the wedding?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 06:10:24	@roomerholmes I love that one! Absolutely always looking for good Bollywood recs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 06:03:35	@roomerholmes True that. And rapidly becoming one of my very favourites.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 05:44:51	@zestylime @roomerholmes my fave was always the f word when he was toodling about with people in specials. And his kids.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 05:40:37	@zestylime both of those things are definitely on the gets caitlin hot and bothered list.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 05:22:30	@zestylime good god yes I think it's the competence that's so arousing tbqh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 05:17:59	@zestylime So exactly sums up how I feel about that man
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 05:16:21	@zestylime http:// media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llf65v2 UpU1qc5rkj.gif …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 04:57:42	Ways life has improved in the last year: last Easter I was on register for ten hours. This year brunch and an Outrageous marathon. Legend.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 04:13:51	@darthraydor help I'm watching an episode with Gary Savage and Sheree who do I hate more. I can't decide.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 01:57:23	@nikkidarling @darthraydor Cadbury's is manufactured by Hershey's here, and Hershey's milk choc is waxy and terrible.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 01:55:41	@nikkidarling @darthraydor not as good as the kiwi ones, which i'd imagine are very similar to the uk ones.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 01:49:41	@SnippetsofSarah worst. lent. ever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-04-01 01:49:33	@SnippetsofSarah Dude. This is a bad ex who tries to emotionally manipulate me every time I see him. He's ruined every major Lenten holy day
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-31 20:30:32	I was having a lovely morning until my ex plopped down next to me at mass. Jfc I need a new church.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-31 20:23:44	If you want to, have a happy and blessed Easter. If that's not your jive, have a great sunday y'all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-31 01:59:18	Completely unashamed by the number of times I've watched Best Exotic Marigold Hotel since I got HBO.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-31 01:31:02	This christmas special is such a waste of Bill Bailey in Dr Who.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-31 01:27:06	@brittania_ river pls. nine pls. donna pls. even eight he's not doing anything right now yes please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-31 00:59:20	@brittania_ I just keep thinking not the new who characters I wanted.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-31 00:06:24	You just don't fuck with a man who plunks down a dalek eyestalk in front of you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-31 00:04:28	@zestylime AND likely no Jack this just gets less and less appealing as time goes on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-30 22:02:57	@mizujada I know! It took me forever to reprogram the stupid thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-30 22:02:34	It seems I had the misfortune to tune into the Dr Who marathon at the string of S6 episodes I hate. Alas!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-30 21:59:40	"You're turning me into you!" I hate this episode except for this exact moment. ugh Rory.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-30 09:15:43	@mizujada my phone came programmed to spell it ya'll. Drives me nuts.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-30 06:09:21	How is this a headline on the local news.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-30 06:09:00	No. You are not doing tours of Amish Mafia shooting locations. No.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-29 10:06:40	@darthraydor in all honesty, you're probably better off that way
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-29 10:04:32	@darthraydor says the woman who wrote dudley/ripper back in the good old harry potter days.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-29 10:03:30	@darthraydor ewwwwwwwwwwwww
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-29 00:47:26	Because I really want a detailed recap of the Three Mile Island incident when I live in the fallout zone.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-27 21:10:52	@darthraydor It might come back? Outrageous did!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-27 10:17:25	@dks2008 I've given up on fb today. Yay support, but there's exactly nothing else going on on there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-27 08:53:09	And another vixen joins the twitter crew. Yay @DoreenMcVeigh !
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-27 07:53:01	NERD GLAZE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-27 07:24:16	@tui_talk I'm not 100% she's still there since the winter, but it's worth a shot!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-27 07:05:04	@tui_talk I have a friend who might still be working in the bra department there. See if Kaylee's in, she's a legend. No side eye guaranteed
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-27 06:23:51	That IS Ioan Gruffudd on #mondaymornings ! I wish he was hanging around for more episodes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-26 13:08:16	@darthraydor did we ever settle this nonsense about an american Outrageous?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-26 09:30:07	Typically my desire to not be manic outweighs my desire to take ibuprofen. Studying with tendinitis seems to be swinging that balance.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-26 01:57:33	@papagena665 geurilla wintering?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-25 22:56:55	The head of the lab I'm in has a picture of K-9 signed by the voice actor framed in his office. I can work with this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-25 20:17:20	Robyn Malcolm's in Top of the Lake? Now I really do have to watch it. Anybody have Sundance?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-25 08:19:14	@smlindemann My best friend's been looking at land on the border with Wyoming. Seems there's plenty of old gold land up for grabs cheap.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-25 03:46:06	Great tragedies of my life: no one around me will ever understand when I crack a ghost chips joke. http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=dIYvD9 DI1ZA …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-24 23:53:09	@roomerholmes negl watching you watch rugby is pretty hilarious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-24 23:46:37	@roomerholmes Accurate indeed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-24 23:41:57	@roomerholmes All I want from rugby is for my teams to play in a reasonable time zone. Curse my rugby affiliations!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-24 23:40:13	@roomerholmes Indeed they are. British regional rugby.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-24 23:35:19	@roomerholmes the kind that leaves bruises, yeah :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-24 23:27:56	Post-rugby days are so much worse when you're not allowed to take ibuprofen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-24 05:07:50	Rugby starting again is awesome, but I will never be warm again after seven hours in the cold.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-22 20:38:23	@brittania_ ty for being my source for all things fandom. I really need to pay more attention.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-22 12:06:42	@brittania_ what promos where and what is this Luther poster I'm so far from fandom atm what is all the goss.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-22 11:26:30	@ColdWarKids Mine broke a few years back, it's nice to see they still exist!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-22 11:24:31	It's a strange sensation, missing your internet friends.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-22 06:50:49	@mizujada I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-21 11:56:30	If I'm googling 'cellular anatomy of the retina', I guarantee you I'm not looking for a breakdown of the Apple retina display.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-21 11:22:03	Just shy of 11:30 and the first dozen cupcakes popped into the oven. I'm so tempted to pop on one of my tap club hats and go dance outside.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-21 08:33:40	You never notice how much scientists repeat themselves until you've read every paper and chapter they've published on a topic.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-21 07:55:28	@tui_talk That's particularly silly since JetStar charges you an extra fee to do anything BUT online banking.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-21 07:41:48	You can take the girl out of Sweet Briar, but you clearly can't take the Sweet Briar out of the girl.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-21 07:41:04	I'm having a very Sweet Briar day: class all day, SGA meeting, practice, meeting, library to work, home to funfetti. Nothing ever changes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-21 07:39:58	Best working motivation I've found yet is that it's said troubled prof's birthday tomorrow and I need to get this thing done to funfetti.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-21 07:25:36	Allow me to apologize in advance that my next 24 hours of tweeting are likely to be entirely about diabetic retinopathy. #unrepentantchemist
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-21 07:12:32	I'm so worried about the head of my program. He's been such a boon to me while I get my brain sorted out. I hate to see him in fake trouble.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-21 07:10:18	Nothing is more disgusting than making false accusations about sexual advances to get your way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-20 20:39:07	@hubbit I don't recall anyone ever claiming his accuracy outside of Pennsylvania. That's what ya'll get for appropriating our folk custom.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-20 11:33:49	@UglyAmericans It's been almost a year. Is it time to give up all hope?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-20 11:11:14	@roomerholmes I was so hoping he was saying cunts but couldn't lipread properly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-20 11:09:10	I don't understand our country's deep seeded belief that titties is a swear word on par with, say, cunt.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-20 11:03:44	@mizujada everybody's got to have their goals in life, hey
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-20 11:01:31	@mizujada @TheDailyShow A BASKET OF GRADUATE DEGREES!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-20 08:20:45	@mizujada They forgot to add "at circumnavigating the law" to the end of that statement.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-20 08:19:19	@nikkidarling bless you. I have 11 million massive assignments this week. Celebratory marathon this weekend!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-20 08:17:30	@nikkidarling THEY DON'T HAVE IT HERE IN MURRICA I HAD TO GO TO NEW ZEALAND TO GET HOOKED THE BASTARDS.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-20 06:46:00	I think ABC's going to get a better response by asking us to retweet if we won't be watching Splash.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-20 06:44:04	@mizujada Note to self: change story to hard-working Canadian.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-19 10:29:11	@dks2008 I don't know much about Grey's, but I do know that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-19 09:47:28	Ads for american top fear during british top gear. Hahahaha.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-19 02:14:54	@dks2008 compensation for donors, sure. Totally.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-19 02:14:15	@dks2008 Payments to get people on the registry is useless if you can't guarantee people will actually go through with donation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-19 01:10:12	awwww yeah the torso has returned! #LBD
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-18 23:18:02	@dks2008 @skirtsnhose Except for that part where you don't need a surgeon or anesthesia to give blood.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-18 23:15:40	@dks2008 Something which could be really ethically hairy when it comes to live-person organ donation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-18 23:15:07	@dks2008 Bone marrow donation carries with it serious risks, and it sets a precedent of compensation for biological material donation...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-17 11:58:17	@sonacroi why do you tell me this now?!! We already left! Fuuuuuuuuuck.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-08 08:16:32	@brittania_ w e l p I feel for the artists Graham's trolling on about.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-07 23:59:52	@papagena665 Personally, I'm glad they overdid it on this one by many yards so people realize how ridiculous it really is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-07 23:59:27	@papagena665 What, do you not FEAR SATURN'S WRATH?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-07 04:00:15	@brittania_ forever mad at Tigh- Gideon would be such a great name, but for the massacre thing
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-07 03:52:14	@brittania_ @darthraydor @sonacroi Don't forget @quarantedeux 's pup!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-07 03:37:28	@brittania_ @darthraydor I had fish I named Hotdog and Racetrack. They might be dead now but they totally still count.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-07 03:21:55	This is the single most beautiful thing I've seen in months. http:// twitpic.com/c968ek
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-07 00:44:48	PI says he wanted a snow day. Really he wants to hear about his grant. Watching him take out his anger on the weather channel? Priceless.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-07 00:33:28	@eroconnor Awesome!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 23:45:45	@quarantedeux Just rain so far but they way it feels I'm suppressing the urge to run around with a kettle bell yelling "storm's 'a comin'!"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 23:01:58	@quarantedeux I don't know that it ever started. It looks like it's almost here, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 22:56:41	@quarantedeux Our forecasted 10-14 inches is nuts. My grass must be really out of control that I can still see it through the snow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 12:35:55	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 @LizCanTweet But giant cosmic power Genie!Jafar though!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 12:30:15	@mmdahlia27 @LizCanTweet @mizujada I remain convinced that nobody beats a five-story fire breathing dragon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 12:14:51	@LizCanTweet @mizujada @mmdahlia27 I can't actually believe these things are coming out of my keyboard.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 12:14:02	@LizCanTweet @mizujada @mmdahlia27 ...is Hexxus a disney villain? If he won I would gladly be the prize.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 12:12:39	@LizCanTweet @mizujada @mmdahlia27 He's incredibly good at expectorating...Blood! Ten pints from Gaston!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 12:08:51	@mizujada @LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 Yeah, he and Gaston get axed together.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 12:07:22	@mizujada @LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 Although let's be honest. Just when a winner is crowned the guy who shot Bambi's mother turns up and wins
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 12:05:45	@mizujada @LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 Not saying Ursula wouldn't be a contender. But Jafar's a squiggly little bitch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 11:48:25	@LizCanTweet @mizujada @mmdahlia27 Genie!Jafar vs. Maleficent.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-06 11:38:51	@mmdahlia27 @LizCanTweet @mizujada Maleficent FTW. Gaston gets eaten first.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-03 08:57:56	And I'm not very proud of my pitiful tweet @ajmonster21
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-03 01:38:17	@dks2008 If asked for the most absurd thing to happen in the last four days, I would have to put serious thought into the decision.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-02 23:38:48	As of last night I have officially reached the ridiculousness quotient in my life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-02 23:22:43	How do I not remember Bill Murray was in Space Jam?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-02 11:54:13	Rocked up to the party to find my statistics professor in his boxers playing flip cup. What has my life become.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 11:51:29	@roomerholmes i believe you mean time to question your life decisions pm
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 11:50:27	The greatest stress relief I could have possibly asked for was a Shoebox reread, and it's all @jonesieVA 's fault in the best possible way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 11:45:03	@mizujada @LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 They have a far better understanding of danger than 95% of the strays the Doctor brings home.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 11:34:19	@mizujada @LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 that awkward moment when you're not sure if it's a lion king quote or a doctor who quote.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 11:15:48	@LizCanTweet @mizujada @mmdahlia27 He's a big pig! You can be a big pig too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 06:56:10	@mizujada @LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 Forever not publicly confirming that I know that entire scene by heart.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 06:54:08	@mizujada @LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat, eat my buddy Pumbaa here 'cos he's a treat!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 06:49:47	@LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 Timon and Pumba really carry that movie.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 06:46:43	@LizCanTweet @amuzzing @ljsgecko My kingdom for a major character in that with a species that begins with S.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 06:14:02	@LizCanTweet @amuzzing @ljsgecko 1/2 is glorious if you're into Stoppard on the savannah.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 02:58:37	@brittania_ Meh. I've got new Who to get me to the 50th. I have almost two years of disconsolate yearning to get me to new Luther.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 02:52:56	@brittania_ Facts about my life: if the BBC's making announcements about any shows that aren't the air date for Luther I have no interest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-03-01 02:51:55	@brittania_ forcing myself not to get excited because the announcement will only be blah then.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-28 13:33:35	@mizujada SOMEONE IS WEARING THE HONOR CODE MY LIFE IS MADE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-28 13:32:30	I think it's a sign that you're on too many meds when the sight of the bag with them all in it prompts a drug search of your entire car.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-28 13:31:44	It started as a DUI patrol stop to tell me to fix my headlight and ended in a (useless) drugs search. Talk about escalating quickly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-28 11:44:32	@hubbit close! I'm not a sound person, but I do the lights for a local high school's shows.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-27 12:36:52	@tui_talk ooooo? Do tell!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 23:06:14	@chidorme FACT.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 22:44:42	@chidorme I just want an orchestra and a cajun band to follow me around and play that at important moments of my life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 13:00:27	@pineapplecakes get me some of that clooney beard rash
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 12:59:59	So do they get to take Michelle home as their trophy?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 12:57:37	Props to Clooney for doing his level best to stay out of the shot.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 12:54:17	@jdjackson I think she is the Oscar.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 12:39:41	@roomerholmes get on that it's amazing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 12:34:04	@zestylime I'd hit that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 12:33:48	Whatever you say, Mr. President.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 12:31:24	I think I just coma'd from the white privilege in that commercial.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 12:28:52	Are they playing the...THAT'S THE GONE WITH THE WIND THEME.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 12:26:53	But why can't the Bathtub theme from Beasts of the Southern Wild win all the awards?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-25 02:35:11	Positively creaming myself right now. Moving lights! Movable subs! Glorious. http:// twitpic.com/c6jx49

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 11:33:12	YES. I've converted another to the LBD ways. I have done my part, can I get fanservice now?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 11:01:41	@mizujada @LizCanTweet My gods yes. Yes we do.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 09:42:10	How do you just show one mighty ducks movie. How do you not air a marathon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 09:36:28	I checked the tag and there are SO MANY PEOPLE watching this movie helllooooo new friends.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 09:34:44	Why am I so emotionally invested in this movie. Why. #mightyducks
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 09:33:52	SHOW ME THE FLYING V
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 09:19:50	@LizCanTweet @mizujada That was actually everything I wanted except for Lizzie and Darcy getting it on can that just happen now please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 09:19:00	@mizujada I don't even care they're amazing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 09:15:28	Oh. My. God. Send these to me anytime. Seriously, ANYTIME. http://www. ftd.com/29594/catalog/ product.epl?product_id=FCPL&external=1 …

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 09:00:18	@1lexib You sure that concussion isn't more severe?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 08:59:53	@mizujada @LizCanTweet But finally acknowledging the overshare! And mocking of Bing's never being in class.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 08:32:12	Gordon Bombay is such a royal cunt in the early days.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 08:28:42	Mighty Ducks definitely gets one thing right. Kids are total dicks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 08:13:38	This movie makes me feel very uncomfortably pedophilic. Damn you, young Joshua Jackson!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 08:02:08	You miss this shot, you're not just letting me down, you're letting the whole team down too Gordy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 06:41:37	@brittania_ you drop ubuntu onto one of those and I'd be set.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 06:34:00	@brittania_ Totally. Somebody make me a pc that looks like that and I will do them right there on the table.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 06:30:59	@brittania_ You CAN run a linux shell inside it and get proper desktop-ness, if you want though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 06:30:34	@brittania_ I KNOW. The $250 ones are totally a legit price for the portability of that OS. Not that one. Ugh but so, so pretty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 06:05:36	@brittania_ I wanted a chromebook but was unsure on the specs. Now I'm drooling. But not that os at that price.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 05:57:18	@darthraydor oh so glad I missed that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-22 03:27:46	Specifically regarding the likelihood of Darcy and Lizzie getting it on anytime soon and not your doctor med school things #LBD

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-21 12:25:18	@tui_talk I'm a bit sad hockey's not as prominent as other sports. It's PA vs. PA things are going to go down. Way downtown.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-21 12:23:39	@roomerholmes I'm so glad you told me! That's all I want. I've waited so long.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-21 06:30:12	@tui_talk File that under things everybody thinks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-21 06:25:50	@tui_talk Next thing you know you'll think the insurance adverts are normal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-21 06:21:46	@tui_talk I totally signed that petition though. Good thing I got the unlock code before I went to NZ last year.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-21 06:21:03	@tui_talk holy shit we've gotten you too? Sound the alarms!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-21 06:19:24	@tui_talk I get Young instead of Nealon a lot. A lot a lot. Never quite understood how.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-20 22:38:47	I keep getting excited when @TroegsBeer tweets events until I realize they're not right around the corner at the Tasting Room.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-20 11:42:54	Maybe I'll just keep reminding myself I really love surprises.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-20 11:42:27	The worst part about feeling it coming is not knowing which way it's going. Will I be manic or unable to leave bed? Only tomorrow will tell.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-20 10:36:47	@roomerholmes I agree with the proper shoes thing, though. HOW MANY undergrads think flats are acceptable for chem lab ugh why.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-20 10:35:57	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux Not all flats are flat like chucks. Most of mine have proper arches in them. Super comfy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-20 10:32:13	@quarantedeux @roomerholmes Also there's that whole impractical for running for the metro thing. Or the getting stuck in escalators thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-20 10:22:44	@brittania_ insert giant sad face here
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-20 06:45:21	@DarkNguyenDuck Now he tells me, after I've already made plans.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-20 02:52:52	@hubbit Which is unfortunate, as their products are far less edible.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-19 11:45:29	@mizujada I don't even know. Some commercial.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-19 11:44:22	If you're in the mood to have your heart ripped out, flip over to Castle and @NathanFillion will take care of that for you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-19 11:32:18	what. what. what is this founding fathers slow jamming the honda thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-19 10:53:35	Week three of the plague is just as unpleasant as the other weeks, in case you were wondering. I killed a tissue box in two days.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-19 01:46:37	Try instead, "It was nice in my pants." That's a much more accurate descriptor. #LBD
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-19 01:46:09	"It was nice" Come on, Lizzie. You can do better than that. #LBD
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-18 22:20:19	Water can stop coming through my ceiling anytime now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-18 21:53:33	Not only have we started week three of ridiculous illness, but there's water coming through my ceiling of indeterminate origin.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-18 12:16:29	@zestylime I'm getting that vibe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-18 12:09:55	@zestylime For instance, describing this character from GoT as a cunt. Because that's exactly what he is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-18 12:09:05	@zestylime Totally. Also allowing douchebag. etc. Just trying to avoid the standard ones unless they're the most apt word for the job.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-18 12:04:27	@zestylime Giving up swearing was a terrible decision.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-18 08:22:15	@1lexib I booed you first :P
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-18 08:12:20	@1lexib boo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 12:57:36	@eroconnor this has happened to him before. He's taken it to a whole new level this time and it's amazing to behold.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 12:50:35	Nope, even with a crown on Joffrey's still a cunt.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 12:29:07	@SnippetsofSarah You should come hang out in them next time you're home for a bit!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 12:11:23	@tui_talk I miss you, show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 12:02:23	@tui_talk I'm having serious hopeless Van in love feelings now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 12:01:01	@tui_talk @kathalcyon Ruined for American viewers by complete lack of cultural context.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 11:58:48	@tui_talk @kathalcyon PERFECT MOMENT OR PERFECT MOMENT.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 11:57:18	@tui_talk @kathalcyon When Van makes the Mongolian Fairy Bread for Bailey in OF I always have to explain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 11:55:14	@tui_talk I mean, you can get them to decorate cookies with but they're defs not a Thing. We're a sprinkles people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 11:36:38	@tui_talk we don't really do hundreds and thousands. Fairy bread's a non-existent thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 10:50:14	@quarantedeux I'm swinging manic, I'm always worst in a mixed state. Maybe all the colors? I'll just dump some shit on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 10:49:40	@quarantedeux That would be such a great suggestion if I was capable of black mood.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 10:42:56	@quarantedeux Maybe I'll paint my nails too. I wonder what's the color of raging bitch.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 10:36:34	@quarantedeux I'm trying to decide if I should apologize for being a royal bitch tomorrow now or wait till after.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 10:25:41	If that whole amazing-band thing doesn't work out for @patrickcarney he could strike big by opening a school for trolls. Masterful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 09:47:25	@sk8tegr8 they're all high schools and community colleges or dearly out of sync. I'm watching the best of the lot.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 09:46:26	I'm just going to stand here and question my life choices. And tissue piles. http:// twitpic.com/c4e73p

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 09:07:00	The light plot needs more beer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 09:05:55	At least I know what the set looks like. All is not a complete loss.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 09:04:14	I don't have a libretto, I only have a script. I only have a vague idea of how many lights I'm going to have.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 08:58:16	@sk8tegr8 Seussical. Research for my light plot, tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 08:50:33	Why is it so hard to get broadway bootlegs? Why are these people so obsessed with trades?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 08:46:18	@quarantedeux the design of where all the lights are going to go in a show. On occasion I stop being a scientist and do a little theatre :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 07:25:43	I've got beer, I've got pizza, I've got massive antibiotics. I'm getting drunk and designing a light plot.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 07:00:59	And on your left, gold-plated douchebag #GoT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 06:22:45	Anybody want to come over and help me put together a light plot tonight?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 06:10:08	WOAH. WOAH WOAH WOAH those are not good people to be standing over him when he wakes up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 06:08:49	Taking bets on one of the King's bastards being a Stark.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 05:50:17	Is this entire show an allegory for West Virginia or...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 05:47:08	"He said 'The seed is strong!'" As the grown-ass seed suckles on your tit. oooooookay.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 02:29:00	@mizujada Does it make me a bad genre fan if I'd rather rewatch the Newsroom?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 02:21:39	Also maybe the blonde chick with the name with too many vowels.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 02:20:52	So far the only thing I like about this show is the opening credits. They're amazing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 02:19:35	@mizujada Yep. I've got a few months of free HBO so I'm taking advantage.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 02:18:56	@roomerholmes Girl just got her own dire wolf killed by being a pansy. Not sorry.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 02:13:15	Okay, I'm beginning to understand why people hate Sansa. #GoT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 02:08:48	Omg this Lannister kid is such a seething cunt. #GoT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 01:43:31	"The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise." So I'm guessing he never learns about his mother then. #GoT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-17 00:49:09	So I guess this is the point where I get hooked on Game of Thrones.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 11:07:12	Why would you make me cry show now I'm a slobbering, mucusy mess from the black lagoon. #thenewsroom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 11:05:31	SO MANY RUDY FEELINGS RIGHT NOW OMG #thenewsroom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 11:02:37	I see where this speech is going, and I see where you stole it from the American President, Sorkin.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 10:13:04	@dks2008 I'm also one of those weird ones who passionately love sports night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 10:10:07	@dks2008 God, but I've missed writing like this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 09:54:06	"Congresswoman Bachmann, who herself has a difficult relationship with reality..." Sorkin where have you been all my life. WHERE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 09:18:48	Tonight's Newsroom liveshouting brought to you by my continued plague and ridiculous amounts of medication.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 09:15:39	FRITZ WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON THE NEWSROOM NOT IN LA.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 09:12:09	Send help this is a serious Newsroom situation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 08:07:53	@smlindemann No worries! They both make excellent beer and are conveniently right around the corner from my place. It's awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 07:12:05	@zestylime there is never enough #shirtlessLyle . Ever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 05:50:35	I have surprise free HBO for three months. Newsroom or GoT?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 05:37:57	I despise Papa John's but that's not going to stop me from taking advantage of the free pizza I earned before they turned into douche taxis.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 05:35:22	@smlindemann Troegs is hiring? Although Hershey<<<Williamsburg
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 05:26:12	@smlindemann That's a total bummer! Man, that sucks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 04:59:48	@SnippetsofSarah Definitely a keeper. Got his priorities straight.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 04:58:39	@smlindemann There's an alum from '11 who does that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 04:54:41	Officially not a fan of the word final next to anything LBD.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-16 01:07:49	Paper done, ASDFJKL: GIGI.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 23:11:02	Seriously though nothing is worse than yet another paper determining the role of p53 in angiogenesis. WE GET IT. IT'S IMPORTANT.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 23:09:47	Paper due at noon, Gigi at noon. Carrot, horse. Go.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 22:55:31	@qikipedia Once I'm free, I can watch it with dope
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 22:53:40	@qikipedia And then fled to Venice #QILimerick
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 22:31:01	@qikipedia It's heard was once said of the 'cropolis
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 11:57:41	@dks2008 we have no souls and therefore no ability to give fucks about these things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 11:54:43	@ggdarcy Ah, but is there love in your brother's air?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 11:09:41	NOOOOOOOOOO RT @AllBlacks Jane confirms surgery - out for Investec Super Rugby season http:// dlvr.it/2xxjZN
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 11:03:06	@LizCanTweet ...what do sick buddies do?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 11:02:55	@LizCanTweet Hooray sick buddies! I've been sick for two weeks so try not to catch mine.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 11:01:25	Hands up if you're going chocolate shopping tomorrow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 10:32:28	@dks2008 Bag 'o douche. Giant bag 'o douche.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 10:17:37	Why did no one tell me Directv carries the super rugby? I HAVE MADE A TERRIBLE LIFE DECISION.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 10:13:43	Okay, so Zero Hour's definitely on my show list. Mark Green! Cappie! Nazis! Rosicrucians! Clocks! I don't know what's going on but I like it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 10:11:51	@MichaelAusiello @TVLine I don't know what that was but I do know that I liked it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 09:14:53	@LizCanTweet Bronchitis, Sinus infection, GI bug. #imazombie #diseasedhugsback
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 09:02:53	Curling up with my super-sexy valentine, my bottle of antibiotics.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 08:25:53	@NathanFillion I've determined the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 08:12:10	@roomerholmes I FORGOT ABOUT THAT bless you for reminding me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 08:11:07	@pineapplecakes It's a Valentine's miracle!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 08:09:21	Casual reminder that Al Roker was backin' dat ass up in a cupid costume all over your tv this morning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 07:55:17	Roses are red, violets are blue, if you were a door, I would slam you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 07:10:05	Well if you've going to air the Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice I'm going to watch it to fill the LBD void.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 05:52:38	@SnippetsofSarah I blame the antibiotics. Don't tell Mrs. Eline.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 05:43:10	@smlindemann Trolling. That's what today's best suited for.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 05:42:45	@tui_talk I'm still sick as all get out what do you expect from me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 05:42:27	@tui_talk and cheeky!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 05:37:02	Roses are red, Ten's not hard to count to, if you were a fish I would stuff you and mount you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-15 00:34:22	@roomerholmes I think they'd make more sense after Thursday, but I just read them in whatever order he puts them out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 23:47:40	@roomerholmes which one are you on?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 23:43:14	@mmdahlia27 wait what ugh feelings.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:40:41	Time for Lyle vs. the Gypsies #kingdom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:28:43	@roomerholmes We have those too! Forever ashamed that I participated in the March for Life multiple times.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:25:43	@roomerholmes eucharistic minister. person who doles out communion. Or ashes. I did that once my finger was black for weeks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:24:49	@roomerholmes Call me jesus, because I am the walking dead.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:23:00	@roomerholmes Ewwwww inoculation. I'm ungodly sick atm and could feel the death glares as I walked towards the EM with the cup this morn.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:20:58	@roomerholmes That nonsense is ridiculous. Now we know who employed all the artists for centuries. 'merican churches don't bother with it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:19:42	@roomerholmes ME TOO. Personally I don't take wine because of science and disease reasons.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:18:49	@roomerholmes For instance, when I first moved to NZ everything was strange and awful and then I went to mass and the familiar was wonderful
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:17:49	@roomerholmes We all have our rituals we take comfort in. Mine just happens to be one millions of other people do.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:14:08	@roomerholmes This is both awesome and fascinating.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:13:46	@roomerholmes You'd be surprised how many Catholics don't either. Ain't got time for that nonsense these days.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:13:03	@roomerholmes It's pomp and circumstance but it's 2000 years of unbroken pomp and circumstance. How can you argue with tradition like that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:11:43	@roomerholmes Okay, so transubstantiation is totally a fifty-cent word. The ceremony is what's core to the church for me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:09:56	@roomerholmes I'm gonna have to look that up. I'm seriously curious. (Me: born, raised, schooled Catholic. Got ashed at 6:45 this morning)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:08:31	@roomerholmes It's hard to deviate when you were the first game in town, but if we're talking kiddie fiddling then I am right there with you
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 09:04:57	@roomerholmes So it's mostly the supremely old school that's objectionable?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 08:58:02	@roomerholmes Wow. That's a new one. So where to Episcopalians fall? Lutherans?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 08:57:13	@roomerholmes It's funny that the Catholics would be the ostentatious ones. We mostly keep it to ourselves. The baptists, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 08:48:40	@roomerholmes Why?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 08:45:34	Medical lecture about zombies? Awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 06:10:53	I am a vile, mucus-leaking corpse.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 06:00:50	Found myself next to an ex at mass this morning. Is it wrong of ne to hope he catches the plague I've got?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 03:57:17	I will never understand the logic of putting your email in your email signature. Isn't it obvious?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-14 00:53:38	Holy mother of god these antibiotics are HUGE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-13 22:35:40	It's only 9:30 and I've already had a terrible day. At least I have antibiotics to make me feel better.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-13 10:35:10	Clearly my biggest fault was using kimwipes as tissues today #scientistfail
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-13 10:21:04	I'm so sick I give no fucks about SOTU what is happening to me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-13 10:12:53	@tui_talk ta. it's pretty warm out, actually. It got up to like 5C today.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-13 10:12:03	@ENbrian I just had the flu, so it's been one big non-stop plague fest over here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-13 09:24:06	In other news, take me out back and shoot me please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-13 09:23:51	Bronchitis and a sinus infection and some form of GI bug did all the germs decide to infect me at once?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 12:02:29	@quarantedeux I don't like him bald, but I do like that he has feelings. Makes the harsh all the harsher.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 12:01:18	@quarantedeux I thought he was incapable of feels
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 11:13:03	@roomerholmes forever pissed at that. Forever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 11:05:20	Dead dudes giving douchebag doctors the finger, This show is awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 11:01:25	Uh oh Leemo's having a meltdown
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 11:00:55	@roomerholmes @zestylime the more ya'll talk kingdom the more I get the urges for a total rewatch
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 10:59:54	Does somebody die at the end of every episode of Dallas? Because that's totally my experience of it so far.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 10:58:26	Hey @quarantedeux you around and watching monday mornings?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 10:54:04	And again, the decision harkens. Do I watch the series I'm deeply invested in or the new show I really want to succeed?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 06:52:25	Currently accepting gits of dayquil, tissues, and spare immune systems.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 06:49:33	@darthraydor someday!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 06:31:32	@darthraydor bb come back to meeeeee
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 04:52:27	@papagena665 it was pretty patently obvious. I didn't think he'd be this short term, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 04:50:17	@papagena665 I called Benedict as a short-term pope when they elected him. You need an interim after a towering figure like JP.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 04:48:28	@papagena668 he's older now than JP was when he died. A comparison of those years is pretty adequate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 04:40:24	@papagena665 But JPII was too, well before he died.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 04:39:37	@papagena665 Going with Jerome was worth it for the double take the bishop did.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 04:37:55	@papagena665 what was yours?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 04:37:25	@papagena665 i'm hoping he's setting a precedent for Pope's in today's age where we live so much longer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 04:03:45	@brittania_ which is probably bad news anyway.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 04:02:57	@brittania_ they could be waiting for dvr numbers?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 02:31:50	Someday, @bearmccreary is going to stop giving me all the feelings. Today is not that day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 01:32:37	Hey tweeps, can anybody recommend a decent torrent site? I need Prism, and that shit's not going to be on torrentz.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 01:17:14	Watching @zestylime watch Kingdom is the most hilarious ever. Now you should go watch it too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 00:56:36	@SnippetsofSarah I can only deal with major news from one religion at a time, geez woman.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 00:10:48	So when do we just stop beating the dead horse which is my PSU football heart and leave it alone to heal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 00:07:48	HOLD UP There's a Paterno trending what important thing am I missing out on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-12 00:03:15	@zestylime I would happily volunteer to be Lyle's older woman thing. Sign me the fuck up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 12:39:50	@eroconnor Preach it, sister!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 12:01:03	@roomerholmes In the best possible way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 11:58:52	"I don't know when I've had more fun. Certainly not without the use of a water-soluble lubricant" Oh Stephen, you cheeky boy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 11:57:39	@MichaelTrucco TOO SOON.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 11:24:33	@BYT are they all his ex-wives too?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 11:06:55	Yeah...nah. I'm not that desperate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 11:06:37	I suppose I could go finally watch the Plan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 11:06:18	I already miss Battlestar again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 11:00:48	@atmodrop that last shot put me on the edge of tears BBS COME BACK TO ME
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:59:48	I don't even care about the shitty CGI right now because it's so beautifully Battlestar and it's happening again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:59:06	DAT NAMEPLATE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:58:37	So many feelings about this flight deck
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:55:23	@atmodrop gettin' practice for killin' babies
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:54:58	Sense of Six, I have missed you so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:54:39	do do do do do do do do do do
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:53:27	@atmodrop I do, I'm just not emotionally invested in him yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:53:08	Husker has excellent taste in women he just hasn't figured it out yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:52:13	Tbqh Coker's really the only character I'm invested in in this show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:48:08	@atmodrop At least it's giving me plenty of time to watch the BAFTAs
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:46:47	@atmodrop P R E A C H
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:45:16	I don't remember seeing that scar when you were in bed with Laura Husker.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:32:15	@atmodrop but she's also skeezy mc skeezy bitch
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:30:16	Don't go in there Husker the raptors are loose.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:26:44	All I want for Christmas is more #BloodandChrome so I can watch it with ya'll.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:25:21	@atmodrop I'm mad they're dragging this out with so many commercials, I want more of this so badly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:22:56	@atmodrop New soundtrack for the entire series.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:22:10	You can run, you can hide, but you can't escape Coker's knowledge about your libido.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:19:29	Woah. Gaius shot much?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:18:53	You don't sound like you're from Aerilon, Coker.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:16:36	@atmodrop boo yeah
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:15:16	I'll take first watch, you go get drunk, you go get laid.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:14:56	@atmodrop that line weirds me out so much
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 10:07:18	@atmodrop they're kind of hard to transport though. don't pack as neatly as the centurions
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:45:45	@atmodrop This is the Battlestar universe. All happiness must be quelched.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:37:08	Commander, one of these men is under the influence of my vagina. I would like to be able to manipulate him for the rest of this mission.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:34:58	Welcome one and all to the Battlestar that only had Mood Lighting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:33:04	yeah, that's a party that goes boom.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:29:01	I think maybe a better name for her is exposition!Cargo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:27:02	@atmodrop making my fiddly bits feel so fiddly
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:26:40	Hey #BSG fans (I know there are many of you), if you didn't know, Blood and Chrome is airing on SyFy right now in one piece. Get on that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:24:11	@atmodrop I know. This shit is weird.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:20:58	Switch the raptor to manual, it's time for me to show off my giant flaming manhood #bloodandchrome
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:18:51	@atmodrop sorry I'm late, chinese food took forever
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:17:09	Whoops, papadama's porn broke #bloodandchrome
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 09:09:30	I turned on my TV and there was a Martin. Excellent timing, self.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 07:03:11	@mizujada Dude. It's Fiji. What do we really expect.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 07:00:03	@nikkidarling I'm in love.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:56:48	95% sure the cheese heads thought they were going to a football game.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:55:52	WHY ARE THERE CHEESE HEADS AT THE RUGBY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:54:55	Hands up if you're amazed NBC isn't running subtitles for the South Africans.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:50:29	Trying so hard not to wince at how we're pronouncing Maori.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:48:53	Gretchen, stop trying to make rugby cam happen! It's not going to happen! #USA7s
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:45:25	Today in Sevens rugby: let's just not call penalties against the Springboks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:36:03	look at those AB passes god i've missed rugby of this quality.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:34:36	Warning: my team is losing. Beware of bitchiness ahead.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:33:27	In no way is this little ref cam revolutionizing televising of rugby.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:32:46	Wait one of these commentators has actually played rugby before?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:29:32	Is this the camera NBC forgot they had? Where's the play?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:24:43	Cheesy attempt to parachute in the game ball for the final match made hilarious by happening before the third place match is over.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:23:35	BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:20:50	I wonder how much practice time these guys had to put into being able to even remotely attempt the Fijian and Samoan player's names.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:16:44	"I know some coaches in the NFL that may want to give this kid a contract." NO. JUST NO. NO.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:16:10	Apparently, getting your head taped up is the new rugby accessory. Okay sure, commentators.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:13:18	OF COURSE IT WAS IN BROKEN ENGLISH THE PRIMARY LANGUAGE OF EVERYWHERE ISN'T ENGLISH JFC
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:12:19	Oh you are not going to fake translate Samoan from the huddle.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:10:29	Oh thank god they're airing the NZ-RSA match. I thought I was going to have to shank a network.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:07:40	Can we just talk about the unbelievable increase in quality between this and the last two matches they aired?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:05:56	Rugby on NBC: Where everybody's playing their archrival. Doesn't matter if they're actually rivals.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:03:19	...did he ask if the Fijian and Samoan teams were basically the same thing? Did that top quality sports journalism really happen?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 06:00:23	@AnnaFoerg The only solace I have is that it's nowhere near as bad as Bob Costas' commentary was for the world cup final.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:59:28	Hey NBC- Protip: Just because it's happening here right now doesn't mean that sevens rugby is an american thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:58:12	"If you liked the Harlem Globetrotters, you'll like the way Fiji play USA Sevens" What the actual fuck does that even mean.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:56:07	Oh god "primer for news fans" time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:54:35	@tui_talk *g* I'm high on flu medication. Not sure if this is quality or just insanity.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:50:35	And now we're going to spend the entire Canada-Scotland match talking about the American team.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:45:11	IT'S CALLED A TOUCH JUDGE GO AWAY COMMENTATORS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:43:34	What the hell kind of a stupid gimmick is this ref rugby cam
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:34:53	If all NBC is showing is America, Canada, and UK sides we're going to have a problem.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:30:44	Seriously where does NBC find these people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:30:18	The ref doesn't think the americans were playing offsides, they were blatantly playing offsides COME ON COMMENTATORS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:26:51	It says bad things about the size of the crowd at the Vegas sevens that you can hear individuals in the crowd clearly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:25:05	@nikkidarling @darthraydor goddamn mary why did you never do an audiobook.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:23:26	@darthraydor @nikkidarling contemplating stitching some audio together
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:16:18	@nikkidarling You only capslock because you'd like it too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:15:42	There's a very good reason I never watch american rugby. I can't watch this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:13:14	Clearly no one has bothered to teach the americans how to tackle. Dear god.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:12:20	@nikkidarling my pants find that idea intriguing and suddenly necessary
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:11:31	"The United States has gotten used to playing from behind" Indeed, because we suck.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:09:41	@nikkidarling actual commentary during the world cup. I had to be restrained.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:04:55	@nikkidarling thye just scored s try, which is just like a touchdown UGH GOD MAKE IT STOP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:04:24	@nikkidarling isn't that just a fact of life?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:04:05	If I hear a Costas I don't care how rugby deprived I am I'm out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 05:03:18	Alright, let's see if I can make it through american rugby commentary.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 04:05:03	I was supposed to be over the flu five days ago. How the hell am I still sick?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 02:04:04	So who's in for a #BloodandChrome party tonight? I'm expecting a resounding yes from ya'll.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 02:01:20	@darthraydor Bastards.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 01:59:13	@darthraydor unless the didn't put the second one up on Netflix
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 01:59:01	@darthraydor NO THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 01:04:29	So NBC's trying for an award for most sports shown in a day?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 00:58:21	@roomerholmes @zestylime Twenty20 is about the only exciting cricket there is
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 00:53:43	@roomerholmes Defs worth it. Sevens is what they're putting in the olympics next time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-11 00:51:08	@roomerholmes Sevens is much more a running game. Same size pitch, but only seven men, seven minute halves. Super fast!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 23:23:54	@darthraydor ugly americans!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 07:07:08	@roomerholmes not quite the all blacks. It's just the sevens.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 03:30:11	@roomerholmes makes me think of the episode of epic meal time they did with candy. Gay bacon strips!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 03:22:41	@tui_talk I can't remember the last time something gave me a ladyboner like Diane in that episode.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 02:37:46	Shit. That was an impressive kick
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 02:33:17	A try! Finally a try!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 02:28:12	These commentators are so judgmental of the french and I love it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:54:22	@roomerholmes this montage is not making things any less gay.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:36:54	@roomerholmes also you are who you tumbr savior
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:36:34	@roomerholmes you are who you follow
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:35:18	@roomerholmes Yep. They're clearly the odd man out in that competition, but it was fun to watch them beat/shame australia.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:31:06	@roomerholmes Super Rugby keeps adding teams, the Tri Nations just became Four.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:29:47	@roomerholmes Adding teams to your international competition is the new cool thing to do.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:27:17	@roomerholmes I mean, they're ranked way lower than the US. That's saying something.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:26:18	@roomerholmes @zestylime yep. Six nations started last week.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:25:51	@roomerholmes They play in the European Nations Cup. Tbqh though Germany's pretty shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:20:42	@roomerholmes glad somebody else is watching this though. I give no fucks about european rugby but I'll take what I can get.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:15:04	@roomerholmes it happens. you should see what goes down in women's rugby.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:06:25	@behrlie @dks2008 jealoussssss
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-10 01:06:16	My favourite part of the rugby on @BBCAMERICA is the lack of condescending commentators. No football comparisons, just rugby.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-09 23:01:52	The only redeeming factor of Mean Girls 2 is that the guy goes to Penn State at the end.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-09 22:45:41	@tui_talk are you on the sports one? fantastic episode.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-09 05:55:30	@chrytonbaine ratings without any regard for my feelings. what does this show do to me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-09 05:52:20	It's like every season Castle decides to drive the Firefly knife in farther by taunting us with a guest star reunion.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-09 00:56:01	So since they're done filming how long until I get Luther on my tv? Next week? Goooood.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-08 23:46:50	Definitely killing the next person who asks if I'm ready for Nemo. #nostormnames

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-08 07:27:43	@roomerholmes oh god it gave me zooey make it stop make it stop
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-08 07:15:41	@quarantedeux snow was not where I thought that tweet was going
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-08 03:09:17	@papagena665 although if we're talking cylons there's something to be said for getting laid one last time before the world ends.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-08 03:00:12	@brittania_ i've been waiting for a chance to use my Up cone of shame gif, and I've ruined it by not being at my computer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-08 02:59:03	@papagena665 at least we'll be able to definitively tell they're coming.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-08 02:56:44	@brittania_ Hugh Laurie wasn't enough incentive? I'm ashamed for you
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-08 02:55:41	@papagena665 did we learn nothing from Battlestar Galactica?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 20:07:39	Anybody know what the opposite of a fever is? I definitely have that. 95.2F is not a normal body temperature.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 12:33:58	@mmdahlia27 Plus, it's not even my normal bedtime yet! Almost, but not quite.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 12:33:30	@mmdahlia27 I know myself. I'll never get up until I absolutely have to. Finishing it in the morning is never a successful option.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 12:04:00	@mmdahlia27 ...even if I'm legitimately completely high on a variety of cold and flu medications right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 12:03:29	@mmdahlia27 NEVER. I spent several days out of the studying business with the flu, and I will ace this exam tomorrow morning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 11:38:38	@SnippetsofSarah Why oh why are you so far away. Why.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 11:38:14	I'm not sure I want to know what it says about me that my jokes require an understanding of muscle mechanics.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 11:34:15	A high doody ratio would lead to constipation, while a low one diarrhea.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 11:32:57	There's the duty ratio, which correlates muscle movement and the energy necessary to move it, and then there's my newly invented doody ratio
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 11:07:44	@SnippetsofSarah have I told you lately that I love you?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 11:06:45	I'd like to take a velocity measurement on your thick filament, big boy. #sciencepickuplines
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 10:28:25	I just wrote this flashcard and already I don't know what it means. http:// twitpic.com/c1hd1k
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 10:09:31	Welcome to tonight's episode of Rex studies while high as a kite on a cocktail of expired flu and cold medication.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 10:07:11	Myosin, the thick filament that makes up your muscle, is bipolar. So why doesn't it understand my life problems. It should.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 09:34:58	In that spirit, to every Ravens fan complaining about the sudden interest in Ray Lewis' trial just go do it for the puppies jfc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 09:28:29	Things I still have: a physiology exam in the morning. Other things I still have: the flu. Things I've run out of: fucks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 09:17:50	@brittania_ https:// twitter.com/idriselba/stat us/299131812427489280 … and https:// twitter.com/warrenisbrown/ status/299184067088355331 … THE SIGNS THEY ARE SO PRETTY. ALL SIGNS POINT TO AWESOME.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 08:49:51	Launching my campaign for the Eagles home opener to be the Eags playing themselves.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 08:48:56	Just a casual reminder that the last four teams to win the super bowl were the Eagles home openers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-07 03:37:37	@brittania_ have you seen the Luther pics today? UGHHHH
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-06 11:51:59	Are there any LBD videos that post on wednesday, or is that the day off?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-06 11:45:09	@pineapplecakes i don't even care what you're talking about i support this sentiment
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-06 10:39:10	@eroconnor I will join you in sick solidarity. Although I think I'd rather have a fever than a cough. Feel better!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-06 10:26:11	Somebody stop my fever brain from making a mad scientist wish list on the lab supplies section of amazon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-06 08:19:22	In other news, does anybody have a spare immune system laying around they can lend me to do flu battle?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-06 08:16:40	holy shit have sweetlife prices gone up since I went. And band selection down. While I love Phoenix, they don't compare to the Strokes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-06 04:56:13	@quarantedeux I have a 100 degree fever and I still flailed a little.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-06 04:18:01	@quarantedeux A Caprica CD! A CAPRICA CD!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-06 03:29:17	If I had any energy, I'd be beating this off with a chair. Please don't be flu.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 12:52:10	i'm a grad student. I don't have time for the flu.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 12:51:27	god, i hope this doesn't turn around tomorrow and go, "surprise! flu!"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 12:42:26	@neilhimself I'd do anything to see my greatest love that I left in my #NovTale #DecTale
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 12:16:29	@quarantedeux so, thoughts?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 12:16:12	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 I sometimes scoff at the people in my program fresh out of undergrad. It's a strange thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 12:09:13	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 SECONDED. I'm so blessed to be on a campus without any.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 12:07:42	@quarantedeux I think we get more MC in the summer?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 12:05:57	oh good god now i have a 10:00 problem.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:59:06	Turnaround's a bitch, Apollo. How do you feel about questioning the chamallah now? #mondaymornings
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:52:54	@quarantedeux i'm beginning to have concerns about myself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:51:35	@quarantedeux what is it with me and asian men being my favourites on tnt shows.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:49:10	@quarantedeux totally the Kara. She'd totally strike a superior asshole.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:48:21	@quarantedeux stg he is exactly the man who gave us the lecture on brain physiology.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:47:14	@quarantedeux he is so my favourite though. We found the PhD in the sea of MDs
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:34:57	@quarantedeux well, we've got a Buck. Not likely on the buttsex though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:34:19	I empathize so much with this crazy christian lady. Involuntary moment is the absolute worst.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:32:29	@quarantedeux i'm seeing lots of potential for apollo the hotshot surgeon and I like it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:28:18	we're not even halfway though the pilot and I'm already on the verge of tears what the hell is this show #mondaymornings
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:27:41	@quarantedeux wtf are these feels i'm already having
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:21:04	Asian Doctor is the most accurate depiction of a surgeon I have ever seen on tv.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:18:10	Hi, I'm doctor I'm to cool to carry my own things so I steal them from other people's pockets.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:16:18	Signs you now go to school on a medical campus: none of this shit is random tv medical jargon anymore.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:09:35	@quarantedeux frak yeah
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:07:12	@quarantedeux In my brain, I'm liking that there's a Buck character for Bambs to bounce off of just a little.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:06:11	@neilhimself I would burn the plane ticket that took me 7,000 miles away from my greatest love that November #NovTale
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 11:00:17	Ready to get some Bambs on, @quarantedeux ?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 10:45:22	@quarantedeux @zestylime @roomerholmes things Caitlin learned after coming to a sudden arboreal stop.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 10:00:53	@mmdahlia27 Always. Except when there's a new show you really want to love and you've got an @quarantedeux to live tweet it with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 09:55:57	"None of these things are good for my genitalia, which has run away." Oh, Hammond.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 07:11:14	@quarantedeux omg I so do BUT MY DEEP OBSESSION WITH CASTLE but new show and british!Bambs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-05 07:04:31	It's a sign of how well they've promoted Monday Mornings that I'm trying to decide whether to watch that or Castle live tonight.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-02 15:01:21	@darthraydor Those are the only kinds I've ever gotten. I even passed out and threw up while passed out once. Only help was oxy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-02 05:21:17	@chidorme I'm really just in a constant puddle of feels over here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-02 01:34:50	@SnippetsofSarah baby you can come over and peruse my abstract anytime.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-01 12:52:49	@mizujada late. And once you start this particular set of experiments, there's no stopping till you reach the overnight antibody incubation
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-01 12:50:45	@mizujada I'm characterizing the protein from the cells I've been treating. I got waylaid by a separate problem this avo so I got started

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-01 12:34:42	So who's mounting a rescue operation to liberate me from lab?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-01 12:10:00	@tui_talk truth. But I'd like to save them for when I have no reception bc scientists don't put windows in their massive concrete buildings.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-02-01 12:07:53	@pineapplecakes not over a plate of ksedg?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-31 13:10:45	Some days I think maybe I picked the wrong field of science.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-31 13:10:13	Did I mention we did approximately three lines of calculus in class Tuesday and it was the most beautiful thing I've seen in years.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-31 10:13:32	@roomerholmes Yep. Minge.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-31 10:12:43	@quarantedeux I think I need new panties.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-31 10:09:42	How did "If you can fit in my minge, you're welcome to try living in it" become an actual sentence I just uttered.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-31 08:58:45	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 tomorrow! CANNOT WAIT.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-31 07:35:43	@mmdahlia27 @mizujada @tui_talk There is an epic intersection of irl and internet happening right now and I like it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-31 07:33:49	@mmdahlia27 so that's how they're playing it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-31 06:13:29	@mmdahlia27 AND THE 911 TWEET TODAY AAAAAUGH.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 23:25:40	@zestylime because clearly we are both into top quality things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 23:25:04	@zestylime @roomerholmes both of these are fantastic things to be all about. We should sit down and compare obscure shows sometime
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 23:23:08	The absolute worst part of science is labeling tubes. Hands down.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 23:08:20	@zestylime yay you're watching kingdom!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 12:27:38	@mizujada @tui_talk I know, right? Drowning my sorrows in receptor theory to make it go away.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 12:16:47	@tui_talk why do I do this to myself
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 12:16:37	@tui_talk ugh going to go shower to get that mental image off me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 12:14:47	Oh god I just squicked myself with my own tweet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 12:14:32	@tui_talk Also (and have I mentioned) ew no mpreg. No way Sherlock ever carries the baby.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 12:09:27	@tui_talk Somebody recently mentioned it in Sherlock and my approximate reaction was OH HELL FUCK ASS BALLS NO NO NO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 12:08:00	@tui_talk ugh no. It was plausible in HP and it remains my only squick in that fandom of epic depravity
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 12:03:54	@tui_talk I WAS JUST HAVING A CHAT ABOUT MPREG. Mostly about it's horribleness and that it should stay the fuck out of any fandom I love.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:57:31	@tui_talk I don't know if I should be concerned that all my tweets you favourite are my ridiculous fake patriotism.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:52:50	@tui_talk EVEN OUR ANTHEM CRIES TEARS OF FREEDOM
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:51:19	@tui_talk Actually our anthem has a really cool story behind it (I grew up near where it was written, hello school trips), what about NZ's?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:50:21	@tui_talk You'll never take God from our 'murrican anthem!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:47:42	@tui_talk I'll admit, Oh say can you see definitely wins out as a first line over God of nations at thy feet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:44:51	@tui_talk I'll give you the terrible tune. Definitely.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:43:22	Tonight's Castle marathon is apparently brought to you by cameos by actors from all the other shows I love.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:42:47	@tui_talk I love the NZ anthem! What's embarrassing about it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:42:21	@tui_talk We shout them because they're the only ones we know.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:41:43	@tui_talk which line?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:16:49	@mizujada yessssss come to the dark side
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:13:24	@mizujada hate!sex is hot. Seriously though why were we not better friends at Sweet Briar. I am right there with you on your George/Thomas.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 11:01:31	@mizujada I'd ship that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 07:53:21	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 @middlemuse @ljsgecko Shades of Grey ( NOT 50 thereof)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 07:52:37	@LizCanTweet @chidorme @mmdahlia27 Best. Alibi.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 07:51:14	@chidorme I don't get asked anymore. I'm okay with this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 06:55:47	@mmdahlia27 I have never owned anything like it but I'm glad it does!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-30 03:02:52	A question mark for a next video preview? A QUESTION MARK? Oh good god what have the LBD done to me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 13:01:51	Who wants to read me a bedtime story which doesn't involve the terms 'fractional occupancy' or 'ligand-receptor complex'?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:58:18	@pineapplecakes HE CALLED A TRY A TOUCHDOWN jfc you had one job to remember what fucking sport you're commentating.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:55:43	@pineapplecakes I am so tired of his fucking face butchering what little rugby NBC airs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:54:32	When your pharmacology reading starts like this you know nothing ends well here. I mean 'gluttons for punishment'? Ack. http:// twitpic.com/bz5pdo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:24:00	I love you Jon Stewart but not enough to sit through Costas.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:23:17	@quarantedeux @roomerholmes If you do can I have your eyeballs I'm running out of cells for my experiments.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:22:46	One guess as to what I'm doing since it's in town this weekend.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:22:21	GUYS. DISCOVER THE DINOSAURS. http://www. discoverthedinosaurs.com /
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:21:56	@jasminemdjones You're welcome woman! Hope you're having a fabulous day!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:19:56	Happy happy birthday @jasminemdjones ! #becausetwitterwishesarebetter
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:19:14	@roomerholmes I will do anything to avoid reading about receptor theory and drug/ligand receptor interactions.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:15:08	@roomerholmes That's actually how John gets his sweet MI-5 connections for Sherlock. Through an old friend he took an epic road trip with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:13:22	@roomerholmes Spy drama. It's got an Armitrage in it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:10:11	@roomerholmes She's flawless you should see her in Spooks. Beatrice on the other hand can gtfo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:08:28	@roomerholmes who, Lyle? Yes. Sexy and dangerously awkward at all times.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:06:26	@roomerholmes and lbr if Hermione Norris is the worst part of your show you're doing it right.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:02:22	Somebody give me thoughts on this. Good for a semiformal full of ruggers? http://www. lanebryant.com/one-shoulder-c hevron-dress/p171589/index.pro?selectedColor=Amparo%20blue&selectedSize=None%20selected …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:01:37	@roomerholmes But I was secretly happy that I never had to deal with Beatrice ever again negl.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:01:05	@roomerholmes Add it to my list of depressingly ended british tv. Kingdom, Monroe. Thank god I can pull Luther off that list.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 12:00:09	@roomerholmes You should have seen me when the news came there wasn't any more I RAGED
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 11:59:12	@roomerholmes I KNOOOOOWWWWWEEEEE and Stephen Fry wouldn't share when it happened too
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 11:54:59	@zestylime Definitely. It's short, sweet, and to the point while also being awesome. Plus Karl Davies unf unf.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 11:53:59	@roomerholmes I'm madly in love with Lyle tbqh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 11:50:55	@roomerholmes @zestylime YES SOMEONE ELSE HAS SEEN KINGDOM
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 11:46:00	So who wants to help me find a dress for the rugby banquet this weekend?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 11:42:34	@pineapplecakes @zestylime all ya'll nasty but we love it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 11:35:52	A conspiracy theory show starring Cappie and Mark Green? Yeah, you've got my interest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 11:29:07	That one time Castle calls himself and Beckett Caskett. God bless this show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 11:23:26	@zestylime @roomerholmes big booty bitches that's where it gets
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 10:46:35	@zestylime @roomerholmes except that one toy horses song which sings about him
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 10:44:15	@zestylime THE BLUE WHALE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 10:43:56	@zestylime Okay so thoughts on the new series? Way less of a sausage fest but I've come to love my boys. Too many new people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 10:37:00	@zestylime ps I'm so so happy there's somebody else QI-ing it around here
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 10:36:42	@zestylime bahahahahahaha

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 10:00:28	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux @pineapplecakes Tom Brady Sucks Dick. (Apparently Colt dicks)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 09:57:30	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux bow chicka wow wow
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 09:51:09	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes Unless it's your own dick being sucked because otherwise no thanks
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 09:48:05	@pineapplecakes dick sucking is always better when it happens in your vicinity
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 09:46:54	@pineapplecakes you mean every day of the last million years?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 09:46:36	@roomerholmes A Butler thing. Pop quizzes about Butler games for bonus points.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 09:41:42	@roomerholmes I had to have one to pass Biochem.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 08:51:41	It'd be total batshit, but ASDFJKL: YES PLEASE -- US, Canada on Super Rugby radar | Super Rugby | Fox Sports: http://www. foxsports.com.au/rugby/super-ru gby/us-takes-first-step-to-super-rugby/story-e6frf4qu-1226560600003#.UQcchHakAY8.twitter …

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 08:48:26	@tui_talk LONG HAIR DON'T CARE GO 'CANES GO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 08:44:51	@tui_talk The Hurricanes are awesome I'm predicting them to win the Super Rugby this year.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 08:44:28	@tui_talk Years of Bruins indoctrination will not easily be undone with tweets.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 08:34:36	@tui_talk my entire family is super Bruins loyal so we might have a problem.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 08:34:09	@tui_talk give me a couple of weeks and I'll be shouting the exact same thing. Bruins, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 07:53:41	@mmdahlia27 Sad day, sad several months, six of one half a dozen of the other.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 07:53:03	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 My only worry is they've about hit the point where I get fed up with the book and throw it in every adaptation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 07:25:23	@hubbit No! The inhumanity!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 02:16:58	Second, I'm not sitting here contemplating following all the characters on twitter. Nope. Not at all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-29 02:16:17	First off, I blame Tumblr for my new Lizzie Bennett Diaries obsession.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-28 23:14:32	@tui_talk that sounds heavenly. It's -5 here today!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-28 10:57:08	ASDFJKL; @gin_wigmore WAS AWESOME GUYS. AWESOME.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-28 06:47:31	Playing spot the amish while there's still light outside.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-28 06:33:13	What do I do with myself?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-28 06:32:53	What's particularly nice about this trip is I've completely taken the night off. No papers, no textbooks, no data analysis.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-28 06:29:13	Leavin' on a jet train to see @LizCanTweet ! Are you jealous of me? Because I am.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 23:10:46	@LizCanTweet @chidorme I wish it was easier to go back in twitter so I could reread our conversation about the Sound of Music and Werewolves
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 13:07:09	@pineapplecakes alright my staying up has been validated.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 13:05:08	you can get in my digital shorts anytime sandberg
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 13:04:24	oh sweet bb sandberg i've missed these digital shorts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 12:44:42	@pineapplecakes that takes effort. staying on the couch doesn't.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 12:43:47	@ljsgecko They're sketchy rumors but if they come true you'll be the first to know!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 12:43:09	@pineapplecakes I just want to go to bed but I don't want to risk the chance there's more Andy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 12:40:27	@pineapplecakes MOAR SANDBERG PLS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 12:38:39	Spending this entire sketch waiting for more Sandberg.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 12:36:44	SANDBERG SITING this episode is totally worth it now
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 12:35:32	Adam Levine? Really? Okay bedtime.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 12:34:38	@mmdahlia27 Nope. Not allowed to at the moment, actually.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 12:32:17	@ljsgecko There's whisperings of a conference in Seattle sometime this fall. I could totally pack a spare beercase.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 12:19:56	Clive Owen, why is your attractive face in so many truly rubbish movies?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 11:50:58	@tui_talk I do it in jest, but I know so many people who say it in all seriousness and just. No.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 11:45:32	@tui_talk In retrospect, that last tweet makes me a little bit sick to my stomach. Ugh, patriotism run amok.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 11:39:32	@tui_talk PROUD TO BE AN AMURRICAN I BLEED FREEDOM AND SPARKLES

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 09:15:04	I'm 900% okay with this situation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 09:14:48	When I turned my tv off last night, there was a Clive Owen movie on. When I turned it on tonight there was a different Clive Owen movie on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 05:10:51	It's such a lovely day outside. http:// twitpic.com/byik8i
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-27 05:06:44	@zestylime @roomerholmes with a nice path up the middle

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-26 11:05:03	@roomerholmes any relation to Bloombito?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-26 11:03:44	@quarantedeux @roomerholmes life would be such a boring place without all ya'll deviants.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-26 10:40:33	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux :raises hand:
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-26 10:29:58	@quarantedeux It's a sign of how bad tumblr is that I never even considered the possibility.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-26 10:19:42	@LizCanTweet I'm thinking I'm going to train, but I'm a little worried about being able to make the last train back sunday night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-26 07:56:04	@roomerholmes OH MY GOD THIS IS THE MOST SHOCKING OF THE NEWS

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-25 08:53:52	The Internet: where an evening of live tweeting Jeopardy is wildly entertaining @roomerholmes @zestylime @pineapplecakes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-25 08:38:58	Am I hallucinating or is my entire feed live tweeting Jeopardy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-25 08:32:58	@tui_talk There's a definite upside to being a kiwi lover in the states. I have yet to pay more than 15 bucks to see an artist I love.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-25 07:23:25	@LizCanTweet Excellent! Do you know of any cheap places to park in the area? I'm trying to decide if I want to pay to train.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-25 06:50:29	@LizCanTweet Sunday night at 8:30. I've got to do a bit of figuring to see the cheapest way into town and when it gets me there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-25 06:42:16	@LizCanTweet this one in a few days.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-25 03:15:34	@papagena665 YES.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-25 03:11:30	@itskirstensmith I wasn't sure if you wanted serious or trolling, so I went both ways. I've got lots o' thoughts if you need more.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 21:18:29	@Spazophie @itskirstensmith Also we're self-centered and you don't have enough news to fill a half hour so you care about everybody else.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 21:17:43	@Spazophie @itskirstensmith Your focus changes so dramatically as an effect of moving back into basic cultural anonymity.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 21:17:03	@Spazophie @itskirstensmith Size. Life is so different when you're one of 4.5 million then when you're one of 300 million.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 07:36:37	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes @zestylime AWWWWWWWWW
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 07:32:40	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes FACT. It's all her damn fault. All of it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 07:32:13	@pineapplecakes @roomerholmes Luther
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 07:29:18	@roomerholmes I'm sure @pineapplecakes will back me up on this one. It's all her fault I watched it to begin with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 07:24:09	@roomerholmes It's a glorious well-told romp. Dark, but so well told.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 07:18:59	@roomerholmes have you not seen Luther yet? Oh son get on that stat. It's super short!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 07:16:31	@roomerholmes It looks really good but all I want is Luther news.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 07:16:07	So I guess I'm waiting for next month to drive after dark then
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 07:14:45	holy shit 100 dollars for a headlight what is going on volkswagen
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 01:38:33	@ljsgecko okay not my PSU. That makes much more sense
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-24 01:35:25	@ljsgecko PSU and who?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 22:21:02	This is amazing. Absolutely fantastic. -- Check out "R´ha [short movie]" on Vimeo http:// vimeo.com/57148705
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 12:55:13	@zestylime it's like fandom has a fever and the only prescription is moar mpreg, unfortunately
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 12:31:57	@zestylime things that ran me out if the harry potter fandom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 12:19:41	@tui_talk okay send me the weather from whangarei
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 12:15:06	@tui_talk send me some of that fine kiwi summer stat
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 12:13:21	@roomerholmes expat shield that shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 12:13:01	There is ice on the inside of my window. The inside! Aaugh! http:// twitpic.com/bxhmu9
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 11:48:33	@quarantedeux That's the spirit!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 11:36:43	@quarantedeux Sounds like a solid plan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 10:35:40	She also hasn't realized that I'm not going to do anything but troll her.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 10:34:21	She can text, but I don't think my mother understands there's a thing called an internet which will tell her what happens in Castle.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 10:19:23	@hubbit The annual BIG DRAMA SPECIAL GUEST TWO PARTER, I think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 10:11:32	Okay serious question time. They cracked Beckett's chest and all she has is one little round bullet scar?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 09:59:43	Tell her you love her! TELL HER YOU LOVE HER
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 09:57:34	This is exactly the moment where I said to myself when did I become this invested in this show the first time it aired.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 09:56:59	DON'T GO TO THE FUNERAL BECKETT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 09:52:15	"Tell me....please..." "NOPE YOU MUST SUFFER" When did I become fandom friends with my mother.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 09:49:42	My mother's texts while she watches the S3 finale of @Castle_ABC are hilarious. Poor girl, if she only knew the pain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 09:09:50	My parents are addicted to Castle and Dad just got the books out of the library. My work here is done.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 08:38:04	@roomerholmes i don't even want to live on this planet anymore
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 06:27:21	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes imma start praying now
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 06:25:27	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes nooooooo say it ain't so
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 06:24:38	@tui_talk the worst is the itm cup when all the matches are in NZ and at o'godawful hundred and I want to kill myself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 06:21:33	@tui_talk I do happy dances when matches are in SA because they're noontime and oh it's blissful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 06:19:58	@tui_talk let's not talk about sports at annoying times until you get up at 3am for a match.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-23 01:01:22	@roomerholmes And send Harry Potter fandom into apoplectic fits of joy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 10:59:04	@tui_talk But I have to go actually buy box mix. This is all just shit I have laying around.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 10:39:50	@tui_talk No but now that I know how to make this batter shit it's going to be dangerous.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 10:33:58	@tui_talk My first not from a box. The cake is fine but I'm pretty sure half the batter ended up in me ugh so delicious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 10:32:15	Bidens being adorbs too what are these flawless people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 10:29:25	NOT THREE DANCES MY LIVER CAN'T HANDLE THIS LEVEL OF ADORBS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 10:21:03	This batter is so fucking delicious and all I want is to sit and eat this by the giant bowl.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 10:20:15	I just made my first cake from scratch and this was such a terrible life choice.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 10:09:40	@ljsgecko Al Green! She's wearing Jason Wu- a lovely orange gown.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 10:03:58	Maddow can hardly contain herself with glee.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 10:01:21	@tui_talk WELL ON MY WAY THESE ADORABLE FUCKERS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 09:59:46	New drinking game. Shots every time Obama kisses his wife during this dance.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 07:44:36	@zestylime Twitter's shit too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 07:17:37	@roomerholmes Peekaboo!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 06:56:57	@zestylime Who?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 06:39:00	Beyonce looked like the face of America. If we're lucky.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 06:31:31	@darthraydor Normally my answer to that problem is condoms but does not apply so that's my next guess
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 06:28:58	@darthraydor airplane bottles?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 05:25:24	Joe Biden is the actual greatest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 05:21:52	And then Joe Biden ran over to shake Al Roker's hand.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 05:06:06	@nikkidarling They're passing the treasury though so they're nearly there. It turns at the end of the block.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 05:04:45	@nikkidarling this is more exciting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 04:43:09	When did trains to Philly become thirty bucks in each direction? I remember when it was thirty round trip!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 04:34:23	I bet nobody ever complained that Reagan was too Hollywood.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 04:33:17	@LizCanTweet Want to go to the world cafe recording next weekend? I'm thinking I'll come to town for it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 04:28:28	Morons.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 04:28:16	Surprise surprise, DC has a flag too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 04:27:02	People asking what that white flag with red stripes all over the place is for #headdesk
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 03:10:48	@chidorme @ljsgecko Things I should have mentioned a while ago- Toys R Us usually has them. They're a nightmare to keep shelved properly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 02:59:49	@pineapplecakes I would change the channel for that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 02:58:59	@pineapplecakes But actually it's just serving to make me more homesick for my city. DC I MISS YOU.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 02:58:07	@pineapplecakes Waiting for BriWi to bust out dem glasses?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 02:56:14	Why am I still watching inauguration coverage. Why.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 02:55:55	LOOK AT ALL DEM DC FLAGS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 02:54:55	@quarantedeux And for that, I wish you so much luck to get out of horrible job.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 02:43:22	@ljsgecko Those seasons kind of run into each other. The summer's the big flag market, definitely.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 02:33:24	@ljsgecko It's not memorial day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 02:21:09	@pineapplecakes KSedg's new movie has harry potter buttsex in it. At least there will be lots of torrents of it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:39:22	Paul Ryan creeping behind Beyonce. This is fabulous.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:35:46	Maddow sounds a little bit like she's creaming herself right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:32:22	@pineapplecakes FACT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:31:32	BIDEN U SO DISAPPOINTED SHE WALKED RIGHT PAST YOU
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:29:52	CBS is probably taking this moment to plug the super bowl halftime show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:29:10	@pineapplecakes YES IT IS PRAISE BEYSUS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:28:45	BEYSUS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:27:57	At least they didn't get a Catholic it's not 1659 anymore RT @jfruh Good lord they got an Episcopalian, is this 1956
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:25:13	@mizujada that man could fill my city any day
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:20:47	Today at noon on Fox News Kids: Math time for sad people who want to feel better.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:15:55	@chidorme @mizujada Hells to the yeah. There's very, very, very few things that are glamorous about being a scientist.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:15:12	@nikkidarling I'll help if you invite me to Obama family functions
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:14:10	Let this serve as a casual reminder that we didn't care about the American Idol winner after the first one
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:11:31	@nikkidarling He's rocking the Princeton pride
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:07:59	FOR IF WE ARE TRULY EQUAL THAN SURELY THE LOVE WE COMMIT TO ONE ANOTHER MUST BE EQUAL AS WELL
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:06:12	@mizujada @chidorme NEW. LIFE. GOAL.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 01:05:07	Is Fox News even showing this, or are they airing a recount of Ohio?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:59:46	I want so badly to spot Martin Sheen in the crowd.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:54:49	@hubbit Totally. I want his job.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:50:55	I just rose too
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:47:56	"Without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion" So that's the part that tripped up Bartlet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:45:52	"...and the restraint to respect the results" Somebody's getting hazed in the Republican bathroom.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:44:33	OH LAWDY THEY FOUND A REPUBLICAN
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:36:24	@chidorme ditto
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:30:39	I figured we'd get at least ten minutes in before we started invoking Lincoln. Wow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:27:05	@chidorme I was stuck in traffic in DC coming back to the Briar after being abroad.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:25:44	"This basically unfolds like the greatest graduation ceremony ever" Go Maddow
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:24:07	DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DOO DOOOOOO DO DO DO DOO DO DO DOOOOOOO
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:20:05	I SPY A PRESIDENT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:10:27	@ljsgecko But I'm still totally homesick.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:10:18	@ljsgecko I kick myself that I didn't take the acceptance I got at Georgetown, and then I remember my program is 100x better.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:04:49	All these panoramic shots of the mall are making me so homesick for DC.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:01:47	HILLARY MY LOVE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:00:53	CNN was a terrible choice for this game.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-22 00:00:38	Wait. Hold the phone. This is our second african-american president? Second?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 12:00:40	@quarantedeux He and Tahmoh are everywhere these days
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:58:22	The best part of this is watching celebrities shut down douches who hate on their football teams.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:52:48	@zestylime TYPO STANDS AS TRUFAX.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:51:33	Bother against brother. So Civil War II starts in two weeks?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:48:05	Not as in kaboom exploded. Ravens batshit exploded.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:47:47	Holy shit guys the biker bar across the street just fucking EXPLODED.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:46:26	Great throw, wrong team bro.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:41:17	@zestylime six consecutive tweets about bradyface. the world is beautiful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:38:30	@tui_talk Protip you're unlikely to ever need: #trollingpensfans is not recommended in person. #terriblelifechoicesivemade
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:36:41	BRADY YOUR FACE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:36:16	@tui_talk I mean, there's not much choice here either but that's more to lack of available options, for the most part.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:33:54	@tui_talk It's a hilarious contrast. Professor didn't believe me when I brought it up in class.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:33:02	@tui_talk what do you mean?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:32:11	@tui_talk Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's done. Market of 4.5 million isn't worth the campaign tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:31:27	I may not love Bud Light, but I definitely love these superstition commercials.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:28:53	@roomerholmes yours is an evil laugh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:28:03	@tui_talk Which I find hilarious because we're talking two opposite healthcare systems. One fucking huge and private, one tiny and public.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:27:06	@tui_talk So fun fact. The US and NZ are the only two countries in the world which allow direct to consumer drug marketing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:26:08	@tui_talk There's definitely some truth to that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:23:09	@tui_talk I've been back long enough to have lost my perspective on how silly we we really are from being away, these tweets are good for me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:09:59	@darthraydor I really don't know why that is though tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:08:57	I'm on yo internets, fillin' up yo skypes. RT @darthraydor so many @funkasarusrexes! pic.twitter.com/wuMu2jQu
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:05:58	@tui_talk WELCOME TO MURRICA LET US CRY RIDICULOUS TEARS OF FREEDOM
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 10:01:31	@roomerholmes I appreciate that you're tweeting in the correct pronunciation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 08:51:59	@roomerholmes Is it bad my first thought was "For once, it wasn't the Iggles!"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 05:27:57	@darthraydor I will help you make it, but I will not stop that kind of awesome
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 05:12:44	@LizCanTweet @chidorme @mmdahlia27 i'm on my way home but there's an accident and nothings moving. I may not make it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-21 03:24:10	That last RT is both a) flawless b) about Welly and therefore made of awesome and c) hilarious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-20 12:34:20	I feel so patriotic after that commercial for heartburn medication.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-20 12:33:56	THIS IS AMERICA WE DON'T LET HEARTBURN GET INBETWEEN YOU AND THE ONE YOU LOVE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-20 12:27:11	@roomerholmes So is Alan's Lady Macbeth
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-20 12:22:34	Internet friends: for when you need help finding porn to play to shut up the loud annoying people next door.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-10 11:40:59	@tui_talk Pilot's good, but give it a couple. Very western/sparse.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-10 11:39:02	@tui_talk The opposite end of the spectrum from say Major Crimes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-10 11:38:38	@tui_talk Way less than you would think. Drama with a slight hint of crime.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-10 11:36:25	@pineapplecakes om fucking nom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-10 11:36:10	@tui_talk She has a show too, Longmire

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-10 10:58:39	You want to sell me delicious NZ candy that I crave, but shipping it to me costs more than the candy. WHY CRUEL WORLD
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-10 08:34:10	@darthraydor That's how my mom and I watched it last year.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-10 08:33:58	@darthraydor It's been up for aaaaaages and ages.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-10 06:07:29	@darthraydor rewatch outrageous. On ze netflix.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 23:45:46	@zestylime obvs he's being sarcastic, it's New Zealand
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 23:45:42	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme Please don't die Julia. It's not in the budget.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 23:41:34	@zestylime that's what I thought if you don't like NZ you can gtfo my heart.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 20:45:36	@pineapplecakes is it the town of cougar because if so ilu you continue to enable me

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 08:58:59	@chidorme oh sweet. I'll worry less about you :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 08:48:32	@chidorme That undergrad is a class all of it's own.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 08:41:09	@chidorme @mizujada Are you at St. John's?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 08:11:22	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 @ljsgecko And our lives revolve around NIH funding.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 08:09:34	@mmdahlia27 @ljsgecko That's how all of our funding goes. If you're three years into your thesis and your PI loses funding, you're fucked.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 07:13:53	@chidorme We're more than 50% women. In fact, I have a class that's entirely women. In the sciences!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 07:09:37	@chidorme I still have two classes to get syllabi for. Stipend? What stipend?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 07:04:27	@chidorme I've never had classes with legions of texts before, but this semester's going to be a doozy. Multiple professors=multiple texts.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 07:03:18	@chidorme Between three texts and software, one class is running me almost 400 alone. I don't even want to take it. Fuck statistics.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 06:54:58	I've been to three of my classes and already I'm looking at more than a month's rent in textbooks. Why, science? Why?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 06:53:44	I knew not having to buy any textbooks last semester would come back to bite me in the ass.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 06:41:57	Tonight's quality reading? "A July Spike in Fatal Medication Errors: A Possible Effect of New Medical Residents" Welcome to grad school.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 05:24:47	@dks2008 FACT.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 05:24:03	@dks2008 Tyre's not archaic if you're a kiwi.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-09 05:21:39	This leads to the awkward moment where my knowledge is from my broken brain and that his drug gave me tardive dyskinesia.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 11:38:37	Finally said fuck it it's bedtime and the lights came back on as I got to my front door praise beysus it's a miracle.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 11:16:38	Can the power come back on yet so I can go home and watch this nonsense in peace.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 11:00:02	@quarantedeux bama banana whatevs
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 10:58:41	@quarantedeux sneaking suspicion he's putting it on the annoying drunk banana fan's tab
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 10:57:28	When I swore at the touchdown the bartender comp'd me a drink to help ease the pain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 10:54:52	@mizujada me and 3/4 of my twitter feed
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 10:54:20	@pineapplecakes MINE IS AN EVIL LAUGH MWAHAHAHAHAHA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 10:53:49	@pineapplecakes whatever everything is better than football on nbc
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 10:52:07	This is 10000% better than Monday night football on NBC.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 10:48:29	This game is giving me superior feels and making me miss rugby so much
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 10:36:06	@pineapplecakes so say we all
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 10:15:24	Biker bar full of people dancing just two lone gingers watching the game at the end of the bar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 10:12:37	Yessss Monsters University
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 09:06:03	Now seems like an excellent time to go drink at the biker bar next door.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 09:05:01	The bad thing is that instead of breaking my head it broke my windshield.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-08 09:03:25	Transformer blew just as I got out of my car, I hit the deck. Good thing too, since a spare piece went flying right where my head was.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 21:28:05	@pineapplecakes ditto
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 12:55:17	@chidorme I am too, but it's also got an element of here we go, back to the grind.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 12:43:18	It's been fun and although the truth really smarts It's time to admit tomorrow brings classes start.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 12:42:19	I'd be fine if there wasn't such beer on the floor all from one staggering chick who's a whore
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 12:40:44	'Twas the night before classes was a raging success but now my apartment is a total mess
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 08:20:38	@dks2008 THIS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 07:00:48	So @sarahnathan7 tipped me off to @budget_bytes . Ya'll should check this out immediately. It's DELICIOUS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 06:15:07	Did I just eat the rest of the breadcrumbs from the zucchini fries? ...noooooooo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 03:57:22	@quarantedeux I don't like how they're saying Lebanon like the country. Round here it's Leb-nuhn. This concerns me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 03:36:20	@quarantedeux this Ohio dude isn't even saying Lancaster right gtfo my tv.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 03:02:58	@quarantedeux why did you tell me about Amish Mafia I can't stop watching.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 01:44:51	@quarantedeux NO IT AIN'T
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 01:43:59	@quarantedeux Missed opportunities for frakstache rides.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-07 01:42:06	@quarantedeux who?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 23:50:28	@quarantedeux I always cheer a little inside at that point. I just finished Exodus, and the Tigh feels are running high.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 23:48:15	@quarantedeux Same. I went to pukesville and then my bed was calling more than anything else.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 23:47:11	@quarantedeux SAUL TIGH STOP GIVING ME FEELINGS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 23:46:18	@quarantedeux @switterbeet Mission: Accomplished.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 23:45:57	@quarantedeux Why does the start of season three have to be so frakking good?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 21:41:59	@mamma_kye It comes with the fire hair :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:56:09	@quarantedeux womp womp womp womp womp womp Get Helo his Tuba!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:50:32	If you ever get sad, remember that there’s a mash-up of “Under the Sea” and “Ms. New Booty.” http:// tmblr.co/Z60JHyb4p2Pi
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:42:51	No, please. Kill Baltar. Save us all a lot of trouble.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:41:12	Passacaglia, giving me the feels as always. #bsg
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:40:07	Incapable of anything else, tbqh. RT @quarantedeux why so creepy, Leoben?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:37:15	Cavil is the trolliest when he's rocking the shades.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:32:43	@quarantedeux I love papadama getting angry with his toys.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:28:09	@quarantedeux Amazon does too. If I wasn't so lazy I'd pull out my DVDs to check them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:26:13	@quarantedeux I don't know why "Fight 'em until you can't" isn't more of a tagline from the show
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:24:59	@quarantedeux his power for enormous fuckups amazes even me, an enormous fuckup.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:24:12	@madelineab That sketch is 100% accurate to the life of a BSG fan. That's totally how I watched the show the first time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:20:19	@quarantedeux Most Satisfying of All The Things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:19:52	@quarantedeux I wish I could find it again. I'm trying to start posting fic to fyar regularly, but can't be arsed to read any new shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:18:48	@quarantedeux Ugh not as satisfying as Occupation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:17:46	@quarantedeux This scene reminds me of it every time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:17:29	@quarantedeux I read a really great fic once where Kara overheard a Spaceparents sex session in that connection raptor.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:15:37	The brosiest RT @quarantedeux I like it when Saul and Kara are bros
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:14:39	Seriously I'm just sitting here waiting for Fat Lee.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:14:27	People change...into FAT LEEMO.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:11:35	@quarantedeux Same. But he never says how much longer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:09:04	@quarantedeux you can clearly tell where our priorities lie.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:08:08	FRAKSTACHE!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:07:15	@quarantedeux but a whole year in Baltar's greasy hair ew
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:06:35	SO MUCH. RT @quarantedeux oh god how much does Adama hate taking orders from Baltar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:02:38	Time to start off Baltar's presidency with a bang.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 12:00:54	@quarantedeux We forgot the other point of this show: showing off Tricia Helfer's body.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:59:44	@quarantedeux I'm just going to sit here and feel the uninterupted feels I'd forgotten about them like this before they got together.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:58:51	@quarantedeux I think I only believe in it because I'm 24. I never would have gone for it in middle school. Now I love it's complicated love
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:57:09	@quarantedeux what?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:55:45	@quarantedeux FEEEEEEEELINGS

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:50:25	Spacedaddy sees straight through your bullshit spacemommy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:48:09	@quarantedeux It's really a question of who does he hate less?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:45:01	@quarantedeux At least somebody in that nonsense has some sense (Dee)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:40:43	@quarantedeux You have no idea.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:40:30	Spaceparents now please. RT @quarantedeux but there is an awful lot of Lee/Kata bs happening and when do we get to the spaceparents
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:39:45	SHIT'S GETTIN' REAL, TEAM. RT @quarantedeux @pineapplecakes WHO YOU CALLIN' PAL, FRIEND?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:37:46	@quarantedeux It's taken me TWO YEARS to figure that out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:36:57	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes Same thing happened to Kat tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:36:37	Just when I got my wife out of jail, she goes back in again. #poordumbHelo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:35:31	@pineapplecakes WHY ARE WE SHOUTING. LOUD NOISES.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:34:42	Look daddy, I brought home my boyfriend to meet you!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:34:03	I like cylon! Ellen so much better.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:33:08	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes YES THAT TOO.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:32:41	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux Ah, but there were other aspects to his character. And, oh, I don't know. He developed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:31:39	@quarantedeux Why doesn't Sharon say anything? I've never understood that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:31:12	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux she started whining in 33 and never stopped.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:29:13	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux Irene wasn't a simpering ninnypants. She was fierce and awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:27:42	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux I will beat you right back with a complete lack of any character development.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:26:38	@quarantedeux SO THAT'S THE ABSTINENCE SUIT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:24:02	@quarantedeux fucking Cally can gtfo my show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:22:01	There is never enough Cottle. Ever.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:15:14	@quarantedeux Restart whenever you're ready
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:14:41	@quarantedeux The whole reason I started watching BSG was somebody convinced me it was the West Wing in space.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:14:16	@quarantedeux That too. But not all the angsty dramz.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:13:48	@quarantedeux Shit, I'm already on it. Yeah.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 11:10:46	@quarantedeux I think I'd forgotten that with these episodes I'm only here for the spaceparents.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 10:25:12	@quarantedeux let's roll
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 10:23:14	@quarantedeux deck's cleared for action
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 10:20:25	@quarantedeux Can be. It'll stop me from trying to punch Cain's face through my tv.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 10:16:58	@quarantedeux Mind if I chime in? I'm stuck in the Pegasus arc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 10:11:09	@quarantedeux mine's paired with powerade and saltines. Got any episodes in mind?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 10:04:14	That one time we were all so excited for a few seconds that there was another Battlestar around.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 10:03:40	@quarantedeux BSG is the best medicine for an upset tummy.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 09:20:44	@quarantedeux When you thought it wasn't possible, PR that's more useless than Romney's was.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 09:17:09	That one time a cylon was the lead reporter for the colonial fleet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 09:04:06	@quarantedeux I guess yay money flowing into the area?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 09:02:44	@quarantedeux We've come a long way from the days local TV wouldn't air the first Amish in the City show when I was in high school.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 09:01:49	@quarantedeux I can't believe this is an actual thing they actually film down Lancaster. Sweet. Baby. Jesus.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 08:57:33	@hubbit @quarantedeux Does seeing someone make an unidentifiable hand gesture out their buggy at a too-close speeding car count?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 08:56:28	@hubbit @quarantedeux you'd need to end that sentence with a nye art jiggy (which I don't actually know that there's a spelling for)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 07:48:26	Okay so I set fire to some of the pretzels in the oven. It wasn't the caramel though so idgaf.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 07:43:25	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes I did that yesterday with some other hopefully troll blog. CAN'T LOOK AWAY.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-06 07:30:32	I just made caramel and it DIDN'T catch fire! Monumentous occasion, guys.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-05 10:10:43	@ljsgecko You're making me want to bag out on my Breaking Bad session
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-05 10:05:13	@ljsgecko I love that man. His soliloquy about Norther Ireland goes straight to my brainy lady parts.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-04 10:34:57	@quarantedeux I wonder if they do hearts for Valentine's Day...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-04 10:33:00	@quarantedeux How do you feel about the pumpkins vs, the trees? I tend to prefer the pumpkins myself. More peanut butter.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-04 10:30:32	@quarantedeux otoh, lots of cheap reese's. and frequently the air smells of chocolate, so. can't really complain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-04 10:24:37	@quarantedeux Nothing makes you hate chocolate more than moving to Hershey.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-04 10:24:00	@quarantedeux The other road around town takes me past the main Hershey's factory. There's no escape.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-04 10:21:57	@quarantedeux They make them down the road from me. It takes every inch of willpower to drive past that factory every day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2013-01-04 10:20:22	I'm fine, I said. Three miles was nothing, I said. Let's do a Jillian Michaels workout, it'll be fine, I said. #mybodyisbroken

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-12-03 20:22:19	@mmdahlia27 I'm guessing a pneumonia-style disease caused by silica from erupted volcanoes.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-12-02 20:04:01	@tui_talk So true. Such a bag o' douche.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-12-02 13:46:23	The worst part of being a grownup is having to tell yourself it's time to turn off the christmas tree and go to bed.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-28 02:47:32	trololol-ing at ESPN's list of notable bad DC sports seasons. At least one for every sport!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-28 02:41:17	@quarantedeux woop!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-28 02:33:20	@quarantedeux And then there's being the only person out there making quality spaceparents at the moment.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-28 02:29:43	@quarantedeux Hers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-28 02:24:28	@quarantedeux I get it, it's in your sidebar, make constructive posts don't complain?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-28 02:15:19	@quarantedeux I feel like this embodies something similar to tumblr's social justice system.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-28 02:14:27	@quarantedeux I see what you mean by every five minutes. I'm in the middle of my first manic thing and do you see it anywhere? Okay now yes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-28 02:13:24	@quarantedeux So I never actually read this adama chick's posts before, I just didn't like how many there were. Seriously what is this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 21:18:52	It's not much, but I'll take it. #snow ! http:// twitpic.com/bgxejj

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 09:45:13	@nikkidarling That's a line from something I really like, but I can't remember what.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 09:44:39	It's not the fourth quarter. Why are we moving the ball?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 09:35:28	@roomerholmes BIG10 Inelligibowl!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 09:18:32	If you need me tonight, I'll be continuing the family tradition of napping on the couch while the Eagles are on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 08:32:39	@tui_talk @Jane_Glatt True that. I'm definitely not a fan of going blind.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 08:29:17	@Jane_Glatt It definitely is when it's mixed into a drink.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 08:27:22	@zestylime Is it bad that I can't decide if I'm more jealous of the cast of of Welly because one is in the other?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 08:18:20	@zestylime I have friends who live on Courtenay Place. And others who worked on it why am I not in Welly anymore why.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 08:16:27	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux Tumblr may be full of crazies, but I'll take ya'lls kind of crazy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:42:41	I never thought I'd regret unlimited full-text PubMed access.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:42:21	So basically what PubMed is telling me is treating one of my psychiatric conditions makes the other worse and vice versa. Okay, fun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:38:22	@quarantedeux It's so hideously not quality sometimes, I cringe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:35:33	@quarantedeux I didn't realize what maintaining a daily blog ad infinitum meant. But also crazies.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:34:24	@roomerholmes Without tumblr my life would be without a @quarantedeux or a @pineapplecakes or many other top quality people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:33:48	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux I love cats but am also not for the homo-fetishing that happens. Instead, quality people
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:33:01	@quarantedeux Still not sure what I was thinking when I started that blog. DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS GETTING IN TO.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:32:17	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux I made the mistake of having a dual rl/internet twitter handle, so tumblr gives me a way to keep stanning separa
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:31:15	@quarantedeux @roomerholmes There's still a lot of quality out there, you just have to weed it out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:28:05	@quarantedeux @roomerholmes Glee? GONE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:23:58	@quarantedeux the things I do for freakyeahadamaroslin.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:23:20	@quarantedeux I saviored her too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:21:38	@quarantedeux was it the house adama chick? because yes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:20:12	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux i savioured someone's handle because I love them but needed to unfollow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:19:36	@tui_talk wait what what waht what. how.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:18:05	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux Even I'll chalk that was creeptacular.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:17:31	@roomerholmes The porn is frequently surprising. Oh look, a Sabrina the Teenage Witch gifset! And now a clit. Oh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:16:58	@roomerholmes Hence the most of. I really like what comes through the few people I trust to filter out the nonsense.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:16:03	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux followed me. And I'm not a tumblr anybody in the remote slightest definition of the word.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:15:41	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux Somebody went all kinds of excited when I followed them, they knew how many days it had been since they
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:15:12	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux I'm picky about who I follow for just that reason. Some of these people are scary.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:10:12	@quarantedeux SACEPARENTS AT ALL THE FRAKKING SPACEPROMS ALL THE TIME
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 07:04:43	I never quite noticed Billy shacking it in the background behind spaceparents at spaceprom.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 06:30:45	I never managed this in college, so to manage it in a PhD class is kind of amazeballs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 06:29:04	Crazy-ass Bag-of-cats bipolar brain of mine really likes this thought.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 06:28:25	Guys. GUISE. I can no do any work for the rest of the semester in one of my courses and still fall within passing range.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-27 05:25:39	At the halfway point... http:// twitpic.com/bgr4u8
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 21:01:38	@mizujada @chidorme @mmdahlia27 I knew my obsession with the british royal navy had to come in handy sometime.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 09:18:30	@mizujada Rock me like a hurricane, baby.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 09:05:18	@zestylime Then again, I was in ridiculous tears five minutes into Kaddish a few weeks ago, so my feels may be not for consideration.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 09:04:35	@zestylime I had no idea what was going on at that point and I was left speechless. I love a stunning graphical opening with awesome music.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 09:03:58	@zestylime Release it all over my body pls.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 09:00:43	@zestylime SAMESAUCE WE COULD HAVE HAD IT ALLLLLLLLL
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 08:59:56	@zestylime I had a MOMENT in the theaters. Similar to the one from Dragon Tattoo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 08:58:57	@zestylime YES. Also agreement that Jack White left me totally disappoint.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 08:57:20	@zestylime That's true. I liked the skyfall graphics more, though. I vote on whole product, tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 08:55:55	@zestylime I totally agree with you on the excellent Casino Royale open, though. brb re-acquainting myself with it.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 08:34:51	I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch. It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 08:30:04	How many of you you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 08:23:41	If you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia and die.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 08:07:06	BOO, YOU WHORE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 07:58:24	It's like I have ESPN or something.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 07:08:01	That's why her hair is so big, it's full of secrets.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 07:07:41	Don't have sex. Because you will get pregnant and die. Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 07:06:36	I like math. 'cos it's the same in every country.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 07:02:31	And on the third day, God created the bolt-action rifle so that man could fight the dinosaurs- and the homosexuals.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 07:01:45	It's Cady's big day!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 07:01:23	This is your lunch okay? I put a dollar in there for you to buy milk. You can ask one of the big kids where to do that.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-26 02:16:21	You know your choral arrangement has problems when even the deaf people are signing about how bad it is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-25 21:47:17	Hey twitter, what songs are you digging right now? Help me out of my music rut.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-25 09:42:25	"If I didn't know better, I'd assume you were reciting some sort of critical plot point" Forever loving that the Muppets have no fourth wall
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-25 08:49:23	Just realized O'Brien called the Penn State players a bunch of fuckers in his post-game interview. I might be in love.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-21 02:39:15	@atmodrop Nope, but those three are on in order every morning. How good would a turkey day marathon be though?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-21 00:02:40	Torchwood, Who, BSG. Clearly @BBCAMERICA is hell-bent on sapping all the productivity from my vacation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-20 23:49:00	My enjoyment of Thanksgiving is severely tempered by the annual force-feeding of the Cowboys as 'America's Team'.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-20 23:05:28	@papagena665 I really want to, I'm so irrationally excited for my first very own tree. But a long tradition inside says not for a few weeks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-20 23:04:22	If you're not Sears you're not doing holiday adverts right.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-20 20:58:28	That last RT is about my old research advisers. Yay monarchs!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-19 20:41:35	@dks2008 I need to switch it up with a new tactic or this is never happening.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-19 20:41:07	@dks2008 I lost nigh on 80 lbs that way, but I've put almost half back on from new meds. It's starting to feel like sisyphean weight loss.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-19 20:35:40	@dks2008 Without any carbs your body goes into starvation mode, which is metabolically identical to an overfed state. Limited carbs though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-19 10:51:21	New brain meds seem to have mean putting 30 hard-lost pounds back on in two weeks. Wanred? Your best weight loss ideas.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-17 09:42:25	@roomerholmes Is this your first read of these?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-17 09:42:13	@roomerholmes Awkward and so, so adorbs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-17 09:41:35	@darthraydor So I'm definitely thinking D*C next year.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 21:48:24	@quarantedeux Of the entire songbook, that one is my favourite to play. SO. PRETTY.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 09:03:23	@papagena665 Are you guys nerds about different things? We definitely are. Old vs. new Who, hardcore scifi vs. fantasy, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 08:57:09	@shewhoisAnna Uniquely Pennsylvania things, right there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 08:51:05	@roomerholmes Those are three of my favourite books. They're such well-characterized!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 08:50:33	This is my strange, roundabout way of complaining about how many prescriptions I'm paying for these days.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 07:36:31	@eroconnor @ljsgecko also naturopathic therapists are more likely to advocate against vaccination, which reduces herd immunity...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 07:35:35	@eroconnor @ljsgecko I already pay taxes for things I don't want. But without an acknowledgement of that civic duty society doesn't function
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 07:29:38	@papagena665 @mizujada I'd posit nature, as mine used to do SCA but keeps it very well hidden.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 05:26:52	@eroconnor @ljsgecko The difference in stringency between naturopathic licensing and medical licenture is staggering.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 05:25:05	@eroconnor @ljsgecko I'm all for naturopathic adjuvant therapies, but consideration as primary care is somewhat concerning.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 05:15:38	@Syfy @DhrPutzu See, the more you say that the more it feels like you're just holding the BSG hostage unless we perform.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-15 02:42:33	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 I agree. I think Ratatouille was one of the best, but it's often underrated as a Pixar. Also Monsters Inc.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 05:59:12	I'm all for adjuvant homeopathic therapies, but when you start touting the health benefits of arsenic I can't help but laugh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 04:18:22	@papagena665 Because what I wanted from life was sensationalism and inconsistency in weather reporting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 04:13:18	This naming system pleases me. RT @mmdahlia27 What, like Blizzard Bob? Nor'easter Nancy? Itscoldasfuck Ivan?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 04:06:46	@smlindemann Presumably with the notable exception of the married ones who need to be distinguished from each other.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 04:04:43	@TimGunn Are you speaking at university park?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 04:01:47	@papagena665 I don't see how there's an end to starting that. With tropical cyclones, there's a definite subset of storm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 04:00:28	@papagena665 Do you name all winter storms then? The ones that dump three feet of snow in the upper midwest? Or just the populous areas?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:57:06	@papagena665 It never ends, does it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:55:17	Wait. Are we naming winter storms now? Is that an actual thing?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:49:39	@madelinead @ljsgecko It looks like I was wrong. She just deactivated.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:48:24	@dks2008 @behrlie @ljsgecko @madelinead Although I'll admit, the number of alums expressing desire for the shirt is a little unsettling.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:37:39	@dks2008 @behrlie @ljsgecko @madelinead FOUND IT: https://www. facebook.com/photo.php?fbid =380425118705762&set=pb.157794254302184.-2207520000.1352317029&type=3&theater …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:34:06	@dks2008 @behrlie @ljsgecko @madelinead TRUTH.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:32:55	@dks2008 @behrlie @ljsgecko @madelinead Fact: I've never not made the cut. This is a new one. Alas, my source!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:30:54	@behrlie @ljsgecko Right here with you. I miss the cheeky the ass you save may be your own shirts.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:29:17	@behrlie @ljsgecko @madelinead @dks2008 JLundz was my fb souce, but I feel like she may have defriended and blocked me overnight.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:28:49	@behrlie @ljsgecko @madelinead @dks2008 Yep. I feel like I saw it last week, but I'm having trouble tracking it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:25:18	@ljsgecko I don't know that they would have if it had just been us talking about it. National media, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 03:19:47	@ljsgecko @madelinead I'm not really sure. I think I remember JLunds being excited and wanting one last week. College republicans?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 02:36:37	@madelinead my thoughts exactly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 02:28:54	@madelinead I vaguely remember seeing it on facebook last week but not actually reading the shirt. I'm gonna go with yes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 02:07:33	I love the cheeky cheeky shirts Sweet Briar ladies come up with, but perhaps we've gone a cheek too far.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-08 02:03:21	Embarrassing. RT @suzyji Ugh. T-shirts at Sweet Briar college in Virginia: 'Are you an American or a Democrat?' http:// twitpic.com/bax2c8
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 15:33:21	@mmdahlia27 But I agree, whatever is happening around me is fucking awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 15:32:59	@mmdahlia27 Tomorrow morning is five hours away and consists of a renewed round of science hazing. It's only good till I go to bed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 15:29:52	The only thing that could make tonight better would be if Representative Bachmann got voted out of office. Surprises for tomorrow?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 15:28:55	Four for you, New Hampshire Congressional Delegation! You go, All-Female New Hampshire Congressional Delegation!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 15:14:54	Are we clapping for Tom Brokaw? Okay then, let's clap.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 15:12:58	We're all engaged in a conversation about how we're all screwed and no one could have fixed it. I LOVE EVERYONE IN THIS BIKER BAR.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 15:06:36	95% sure nothing could be better than right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 15:05:52	What is happening this shit is amazing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 15:05:24	One large bearded biker man followed the corner douche out back, another one is buying me a beer for being so well educated for a young'un
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 15:00:34	LARGE BEARDED BIKER MAN JUST CALLED THE DOUCHE A MISOGYNIST OMG LIFE US PERFECT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:59:03	WE ARE MORE THAN A COLLECTION OF RED SPACE AND BLUE SPACE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:58:44	Bartender and I are shutting down the misogynist asshole in the corner. This is fucking awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:57:09	Guys, the biker bar was the best possible decision
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:26:38	@Superglrl Maryland means my best friends are getting hitched. Hope abounds!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:25:47	@Superglrl is he caffeine free too? Shit, I finally have something in common with mittens.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:24:18	@zestylime FUCK YES but obligatory response to my beautiful blue state
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:22:20	@zestylime PENNSYL-FUCKING-VANIA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:19:18	@Superglrl I think you're right. I'm going with a stealth Valium in the diet coke.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:13:12	BRB bouncing to the biker bar for the President's speech.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:12:41	@Superglrl The text of the speech was very well done, concise, not blaming or pointing fingers. Roll mittens writing staff?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:11:41	@Superglrl he was scarily happy. That threw me. I'm going with somebody slipped him a couple of valium.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:08:00	@Superglrl Hi! idk who you are but you just tweeted the front so clearly we should be friends #drunktwitteristhebesttwitter
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:05:44	The expression on BriWi's face when pollster man started talking about the 1928 election.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:04:05	@chidorme That was a very well played speech, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:03:43	@chidorme Also probably the drunkest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:02:29	Wait. I thought Bartlet was the first person on the presidential campaign trail with MS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 14:00:24	@pineapplecakes @nancepelosi sky rockets in flight.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 13:57:09	Possibly Mittens is high. But most likely drunk.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 13:56:10	THIS MAN IS DRUNK.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 13:55:34	MITTENS OH BLESS YOUR HEART now go away.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 13:54:13	I'm drunk and hilarious. LET'S GCHAT THIS SHIT. Who's with me?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 13:47:41	@chidorme You tweet about cackling, and I began to cackle. MWAHAHAHAHA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 13:38:12	SO I PUT MY HANDS UP THEY'RE PLAYING MY SONG I KNOW I'M GONNA BE OKAY IT'S A PARTY IN THE USA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 13:28:35	@raymondreports our ancestors would be so proud.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 13:23:58	@raymondreports now is the time for us all to be drunk
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 13:20:37	FOUR FOR YOU MARYLAND. YO GO MARYLAND.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 13:13:39	Yes, tell me more about vaginal probes BriWi
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 13:00:53	@mizujada Yep. No idea where to find it, but if I do I'll ship it your way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 12:58:34	RACHEL MADDOW IS MY QUEEN. She's delivering a monologue for the ages.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 12:57:40	@ljsgecko Almost. Not quite.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 12:52:24	Alright guys. Let's get this marriage referendum passed. GET IT MARYLAND.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 12:45:03	That awkward moment when what's happening on Fox News is funnier than what's rolling on Comedy Central.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 12:43:33	I don't even know how to find Fox News on my tv.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 12:39:38	@amuzzing My professor lost a grant application last week. That's all he could talk about in lecture today.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 11:40:54	Who's got the CNN bit about bashing rape as a terrible campaign strategy? I want to see this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 11:39:17	@hubbit If BriWi starts slow jamming the news we'll know who's got the freshest reports.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 11:35:52	@hubbit NBC has Mittens at 174. Totally schrodinger's poll.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-07 11:35:03	@atmodrop OKAY FINE GINGERS TO THE LEFT

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-06 23:13:14	@maryrtaylor10 We're in that part of PA that's actually Alabama. The democrats run for election but I think even they know they have no hope
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-06 23:11:48	@maryrtaylor10 Oh they just harass the one democrat pamphlet guy who's there all alone at every election.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-06 23:10:37	@maryrtaylor10 Honestly though we're such a tiny, middle-of-nowhere town that I don't think anybody really cares.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-06 23:06:46	@maryrtaylor10 They stand in the parking lot and throw note pads and buttons and harass the poor token democrat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-06 21:46:52	There was one lone person handing out leaflets for all the democratic candidates. He looked so happy when I turned up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-06 21:44:15	This year was a pretty small ballot, really. No referendums, just a representative for each body and a couple of state officials.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-06 21:29:14	I guess the advantage to living in small town bumfucknowheresville is I've never waited more than ten minutes to vote.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-06 10:47:39	...okay, maybe not the Saints fan over in the corner.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-06 10:47:03	There are at least two other people in the library listening to this football clusterfuck. NEW FRIENDS TIME.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 09:30:56	@HOBradshaw I'm doing okay. School is NUTS, but I'm really enjoying myself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 09:28:40	@HOBradshaw I can totally modify that plan. I've already been to Dublin anyway :) Where in England? What for? DEETS PLS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 09:24:11	@HOBradshaw Seriously though how are you doing?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 09:23:39	@HOBradshaw It's going on my list. Santa Fe, China, Ireland, Spain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 09:13:23	@HOBradshaw You temptress.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 08:54:50	@mmdahlia27 Not like what? Encyclopedias?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 08:54:26	Actually, that would be a pretty phenomenal practical joke.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 08:53:51	Where did my computer get the idea I wanted Romney-Ryan ads touting support for the anti-abortion movement?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 08:17:22	Let's be honest guys, Mean Girls is going to be one of the classic films of our generation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 07:52:52	I just have a lot of feelings.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 07:52:37	SHE DOESN'T EVEN GO HERE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 07:52:14	I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school. I wish I could bake a cake full of rainbows and smiles.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 07:45:39	@HOBradshaw You are awesome. Why are you so far away from me?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 07:45:09	How many of you have every felt personally victimized by Regina George?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 07:42:31	@HOBradshaw I forgot how much I love this movie :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 07:39:12	You're going to want to take off your clothes and touch each other. If you touch each other, you're going to get chlamydia.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-04 07:21:24	BOO YOU WHORE.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-03 06:40:00	@mizujada they farm us out to off campus for what I'm looking for, but I see what you mean with this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-03 05:59:02	@mizujada ?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-03 05:55:48	There's a student reaching out for help from counseling services, and no one can fit them in for three weeks? I just can't with this.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 12:24:14	@brittania_ it was a stomach bug and i was doing okay but then a skunk in the graveyard out back and welp.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 12:22:21	@brittania_ i'm vomiting and attempting to study protein translation. I feel ya, sister.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 10:35:30	@mizujada you have no idea how much I agree with you on that point. Eventually this science hazing has to end, right.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 10:26:59	@mizujada That sounds lovely. I'm vicariously immensely enjoying your evening.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 10:13:51	@tui_talk Aside from that whole eating thing that sounds fabulous.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 10:06:34	My life has become a revolving exercise in #gradstudentproblems
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 10:05:38	Please tell me about your fun halloween plans. Because mine are recovering from a stomach bug and studying for a four hour exam tomorrow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 06:20:19	@hubbit Indeed. They're the earthquakes of the internet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 05:58:52	@hubbit Normally I'm fairly blaze about outages, but when you go down and take my exam with you panic will inevitably ensue.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 05:56:38	Google returned, exam submitted, stomach contents continue to remain in their designated location. Everything is good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 05:55:19	@tui_talk I still had ten minutes. If it went out, say, now, then I'd be freaking.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 05:50:57	@tui_talk it's back. wow, that was scary for a second. my entire exam that's due in ten minutes is on my drive. Phew.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 05:49:11	We're two months too early for the apocalypse. Google shouldn't be down yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 05:46:39	...did everything google just go down? No drive, no gmail, no youtube. What.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 05:05:29	Have managed to keep a small bowl of applesauce down for an hour. The end is near thank god.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 03:02:25	@quarantedeux Although saying that when you live five blocks from the kitkat factory seems a bit scary. They might come for me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-11-01 03:01:39	@quarantedeux I'm not sure who thought it would be a good idea for hershey to make kitkats in the us. it wasn't.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 21:30:32	@hubbit Perhaps some Sunday in the Park with George instead?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 21:27:26	@sonacroi @darthraydor most definitely.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 20:41:09	@darthraydor @sonacroi that was an excellent afternoon
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 11:13:14	@dks2008 that's sure as hell what my reaction was.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 06:58:07	@pineapplecakes Of all the places in my hometown, we had to report from the trashiest of all the trailer parks in town. #sayingsomething
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 06:57:27	@pineapplecakes if tomorrow was election day then the storm would be because of the gays and how god doesn't want gay marriage in maryland.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 06:50:10	You know it's getting serious when the reporter has to move out of the trailer park.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 06:48:10	Weathermen during a major storm are the best time to watch nerds in their natural habitat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 06:26:15	@leadingladyDE they just finished a long discussion about how the core of the storm is heading into central PA. I think ya'll made it throug
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 06:18:54	@shewhoisAnna I hear that's mostly from storm surge from an already high tide? I'm there with you though man. Soon, hopefully!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 06:05:08	@shewhoisAnna If shit gets real, it'll get real where I am long before it does up over the hill in Etown. I'll let you know if that happens.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 06:04:06	@shewhoisAnna Oh absolutely! I've been drinking all day, it's wonderful!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 05:59:30	@shewhoisAnna And for your atlantic city worries, that's about four hours away. Really, really far. Things around here are pretty good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 05:58:22	@shewhoisAnna Most of the storm is running about 45 minutes south of where we are down by the maryland line.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 05:57:02	@shewhoisAnna Etown's fully inland, none of the major creeks or tributaries are anywhere near it and it's up on the high ground around here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 05:51:46	@shewhoisAnna I'm in Hershey, which isn't quite Etown but very close. There's very little anything going on right now around here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 05:43:22	...was that an anti-Freed, pro-Sandusky ad? That's not even going to fly here in Penn State country, guys.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 05:39:31	@shewhoisAnna She's at Etown, right? Shit around here's pretty low-key. About half an hour south of here it's getting a little nuts

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 04:37:36	@ENbrian Her complaints are focused on the lack of reporting on storms, not the lack of storms.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-30 03:58:23	@pineapplecakes Pretty sure the governor would support that. He was getting all sassy about idiots taking weather photos this morning.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-23 02:29:29	@hubbit @pineapplecakes @quarantedeux you make a blog with a url you might want to use someday. I have one, but I'm not a big url changer
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-23 02:21:37	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux Are other people's spread out over lots of email addy's? That could do it.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-23 02:06:49	@brittania_ Oh lordy. I didn't know I needed this in my life 'till right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-23 02:05:34	Today went from shit to fantastic in two returned grades. It appears I'm excelling at Scientist Hazing. Bring on the naked blindfold runs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-23 00:38:28	@jasperfforde when clueless people can't find the big 50 Shades display by the door, I give them your book instead. So much better.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-22 08:36:00	@mizujada I didn't mean to go off caffeine, it happened on accident, but the biggest loss was a decent cuppa of black tea.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-22 08:31:46	@mizujada I've missed black tea like britain misses it's empire. Oh sweet baby teasus, I'm home.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-22 03:44:01	Today turned into a day of massive unfucking. I'm totally okay with this.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-19 08:27:16	@chidorme I may start troll-spoiling people that way. Could be fun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-19 08:26:19	@chidorme I was so stressed out waiting for the shoe to drop. But many other things happened and it didn't and I was refreshingly pleased.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-19 08:24:47	@chidorme I'm actually really glad it went that way. I was told a character I love died, but then they didn't. Subterfuge-spoiling?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-19 08:23:43	@chidorme I thought I'd been totally spoiled for a major, major event. But it didn't happen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-19 08:18:50	@chidorme @LizCanTweet I'm hoping to help maintain that subterfuge for everybody else.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-19 08:18:21	@chidorme @LizCanTweet That's all I've got. I hopped onto itv to watch it last night and what I thought was going to happen didn't.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-19 07:44:59	@quarantedeux It could be on Alaska time. Eesh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-19 07:28:40	@shewhoisAnna I'm right there with you. It's just this slit, it comes up to places slits shouldn't go.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-19 07:17:59	@mizujada I. Yeah. That couldn't have been good.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-18 14:39:50	And now I'm awake, and I still have to pee but I am NOT going back in there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-18 14:38:54	I would like to not be awake at 2:30, but I went to the bathroom and there was a FIVE INCH millipede coming out if the sink drain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-18 14:30:06	@tui_talk But this is me we're talking about here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-18 14:29:56	@tui_talk Not really a legend, but actual directions that came stuck to my pomegranate. If I recall correctly, it went very badly for me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-18 14:24:44	@tui_talk They say there is and it involves a large bowl of warm water. I don't believe them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-18 11:56:38	@chidorme Hm. I may need to keep on with this, eventually.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-18 11:42:43	I don't think I've ever watched Dave Letterman before, and I don't think I ever will again. This is not fun.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-17 00:48:56	@roomerholmes I do love the excuses people drum up when you call them on it, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-17 00:46:40	@roomerholmes it boggles my mind that some people don't know that, but they don't. Particularly if you're the only girl and move a lot.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-17 00:42:55	@melissaeramos @jasminemdjones @madelinead Ditto!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-16 22:54:16	That's definitely the first time in my life I've been told I'm more mature than some of my peers. Small victories?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-15 07:57:10	Guy in the library just pulled off a Penn State hoodie to reveal an Ohio State shirt underneath. What's going on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-15 07:51:29	@smlindemann that's what happens when you don't even go here.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-15 04:40:36	Football gods, my heart can't handle an overtime right now. Oh boy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-15 04:36:37	I can't watch. Setup on the Eagles 1.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-15 04:35:44	The longer you hold your hands up in the air, the less time you have to score.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-14 12:43:59	So who wants to hear my new Fat Lee theory and tell me it's shit?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-14 12:41:47	Is that a gif of Beaker the muppet singing "I put the pussy in a sarcophagus"? Yes, yes it is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-14 12:30:14	@quarantedeux no worries I didn't make it that much longer. just y'know thoughts to be had in the future
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-14 09:17:33	@madelinead Are there a lot of direct flights from vegas through that airport?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-14 09:14:53	The touch judge for our match this afternoon was wearing a tuxedo jacket, cumberbund, tie, and old as fuck rugby shorts. It was awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-14 09:06:29	@tui_talk Since we're advertising Not On My Patch again, remember when we had the promise of a year of new stories? *le sigh*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-14 09:05:44	@dks2008 I love you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-14 09:04:50	I'd really love to stop forgetting Penn State has a bye this week and panicking that I can't find the game.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 19:20:23	@HOBradshaw @mmdahlia27 somewhere there's a pub with TARDIS bathrooms. This must be the next best thing.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 12:06:29	Pinkman telling his people to apply themselves is the absolute greatest thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 11:43:02	@quarantedeux Two words: DRUNKSTAR GALACTICA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 08:44:03	Sal val cabinet finally made it inside. Drinks and hardware refinishing? I think yes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 08:03:53	@brittania_ AMEN. Exceptions made for cosplay. And really well-thought out fetish setups.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 06:55:10	@brittania_ If I recall correctly, the white ones were associated with Arafat, and the red ones are associated with Jordan, I think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 06:54:09	@brittania_ They were mostly offended by the way the chick was wearing it too- as a top, survivor-style.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 06:47:35	@brittania_ The thin patterned ones can be, but I've only ever heard offence about them once, from two jewish girls from the west bank
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 04:41:25	Reading papers on the genetic distribution of long chain fatty acid alleles and the spread out of africa makes me want to think Battlestar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 04:38:12	@mmdahlia27 that's what she said
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 04:25:11	@mmdahlia27 rather, TWHS

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 04:15:51	@chidorme I had two four-hour exams this week. I'm really glad my jokes are still a little funny.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-13 03:12:55	@chidorme @leadingladyDE what, not the 47% who are never going to vote for-sorry donate to- the annual fund? #hee

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-12 02:28:15	@behrlie You know what's cool? I used to work with one of those women, and I know another. Some kind of telepathic awesome is going on here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-11 14:07:02	@pineapplecakes you hang out back there too long, you'll get gingervitis. shit's catching, y'know
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-11 14:03:39	@pineapplecakes GET OUT OF MY HEAD BUCKEYE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-11 13:59:37	@pineapplecakes This paper just referred to a solution as 'getting salty' and for some strange reason I thought of you
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-11 13:12:36	"Did he bite you on the neck right before the job was done?" Gin Wigmore, why did you take so long to become the soundtrack to my life?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-11 11:41:08	Raided the cupboards for a study snack, came up with a magic hat, a banana, and pumpkin spice kisses. Life of a student, right there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 19:56:23	One of today's Nobel Laureates is hard out trolling. I might be in love.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 12:19:32	@NathanFillion Hang on. Was there another reason to watch this?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 11:05:58	@ForeverKith And his standup is an entirely different beast of off-color excellence from his tv show
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 11:03:53	@ForeverKith He does, but I think people thought that meant like his show. I'd bet at least half the audience has never heard his standup
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 10:48:42	@ForeverKith Yeah, but in central pennsylvania people don't understand what that warning label means, let's be real.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 10:20:07	The best part of the @CraigyFerg show was the old woman behind me who made scandalized noises every time he swore or said 'clitoris'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 10:14:41	@roomerholmes "I said to my agent get me Hershey on a tuesday! I must have it!' I love when people are straight up about having to come here

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 07:59:02	You know what's great? Being able to get drunk and walk to the @CraigyFerg show. Finally, an upside to central Pennsylvania.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 01:22:13	@ColdWarKids Heh. I'm just happy I happened to pull up twitter just as you dropped the offer. Very fortuitous timing :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 01:08:17	@ColdWarKids YES PLEASE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 01:03:37	I guess if you look around during an exam and think, 'hey, this is really fun.' you're doing the right thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 00:51:36	@papagena665 They do list some distance learning graduate classes. I could get behind that indeed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-10 00:50:23	The best part of this whole #craigyferg show tonight is I don't have to go anywhere, just walk down the block for some awesome. #score
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-09 18:57:06	I'm absolutely becoming a partisan scientist. I was psyched for the medicine Nobel yesterday, but today's physics nobel is uninteresting

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-09 12:54:19	Tomorrow ranges from an mRNA exam and a #craigyferg live show. Variety is the spice of life, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-09 11:06:03	"Just because your genetic code is degenerate doesn't mean you have to be" Ladies and gents, my lecture notes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-09 10:44:20	In other news, grad school has been renamed Science Hazing, a far more apt moniker than 'PhD in Biomedical Sciences' ever was.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-09 10:41:28	The last tweet brought to you by the slow degradation of my brain into gruel by scientist hazing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-09 10:40:21	Blah blah in vitro promoter assays blah electrophoretic mobility shift assay blah blah miRNA gene silencing blah blah fuck my life
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-08 19:50:24	In contrast, Gurdon published almost 50 years ago. Sometimes we just don't see it. Although he's a pretty eminent scientist, so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-08 19:44:37	Now if only we could suss out how to get them to stop forming teratomas in clinical use and we'd be completely set.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-08 19:43:38	Particularly because Yamanaka only published his finding six years ago. SIX YEARS to a nobel prize, that's got to be a record.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-08 19:42:34	De-differentiation of fully differentiated cells to become stem cells again. This one is BIG and super awesome. #nobelweek

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-08 01:05:09	This is one of those great moments where the entire area is at war over football. Even the Ravens fans are jeering the stillers fans.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-06 01:18:31	@LizCanTweet so the guionites have tempted me home. Still looking for a lift to homecoming?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-06 01:15:29	"He had a great lab here, but then he went to Ohio State. Boo." Unbiased science professors are unbiased.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-05 06:22:53	@brittania_ oh sweet bb I will understand it enough for the rest of them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-05 03:23:03	@chidorme I so desperately want a stab at cards against humanity.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-05 01:24:38	@chidorme @papagena665 in particular, a few jewish friends who are going after some hardcore christians for being included in their hate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-05 01:23:34	@chidorme @papagena665 there are a couple trolls who are making it all worthwhile for me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-05 01:22:44	I could write myself a note to check out the @CraigyFerg Paley thing tonight. Or I could just remind myself I'm seeing him on Tuesday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-04 18:54:39	@tui_talk you doing anything fun?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-04 12:07:18	@tui_talk WOop
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-04 11:38:46	Let's be real- the real winner tonight is the University of Denver in scads of free advertising.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-04 11:26:07	@GerryBM We used to call getting laid feeding the beast, which adds a whole 'nother level of hilarity to the discussion.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-04 11:13:58	"Does this count as feeding the beast?" Are you asking what you think you're asking, MSNBC?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-04 11:12:36	@tui_talk I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS WOULD HAPPEN. It always happens to me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-04 11:09:26	If this is true, it means I introduced myself to one of my profs by offering tickets in a 50/50 based on the size of my tits. Oh god my life
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-10-04 11:04:28	In related rugby news, I'm pretty sure the lecture I missed this morning in court was given by the flanker from the men's team. Oh boy.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-30 11:15:09	@zestylime Bahahahaha. I'm calling him shotsawhowhat from now on out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-30 11:12:23	@zestylime Bernstein's Kaddish/Symphony 3. THE PRETTY. But all my irl friends just give me crazypants looks at my excitement.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-30 11:10:08	@zestylime I'm hitting up my second-favourite text-made-into-a-symphony tomorrow and no one understands my excites. help.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-30 11:05:21	On the bright side, tomorrow brings Leonard Bernstein's Kaddish to my ears. YES PLS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-30 11:04:13	These fourteen-hour saturdays are going to be the death of me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-29 10:39:18	I wish my used tissues were enough to take out this cricket when I fling them at it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-29 10:36:33	@tui_talk That man is flawless and also perfection.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-29 08:03:00	@walkezb0 Amen to that. Somebody pointed out it's ten years this week since it started. It just seems fitting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-29 07:18:55	Massive head cold? Sounds like a good night to curl up with a mini West Wing marathon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-29 01:53:09	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @LizCanTweet I'd offer to do a live when it airs in the uk, but I don't know if I'll be back by then.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-28 13:53:29	The biggest delusions that the West Wing gave me were about the apartments you can find in DC.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-28 10:45:40	Let's tale a moment to discuss the supreme awesomeness of my old lab. http:// news.yahoo.com/bizarre-tumor- case-may-lead-custom-cancer-care-210909883.html …

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-28 09:13:13	@pineapplecakes shit. I was hoping it wasn't actually the end of the world yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-28 09:11:55	@pineapplecakes STOP THE PRESSES WHAT IS IT YOU ARE CURRENTLY WATCHING
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-28 08:49:56	@quarantedeux And particularly not their skinny jeans. They're horrendous. And cut short.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-28 06:01:55	@mmdahlia27 We're still around if you get back anytime soon!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-28 02:09:48	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 @LizCanTweet Can do! I'm around all afternoon, mostly (for once. yay!) Just shoot me los links.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-28 01:52:08	@AIRNZUSA I'm fully Whanganui. Get me back on that river.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-28 00:46:49	@mmdahlia27 @LizCanTweet @chidorme Honest fact- I have been paying approximately no attention to this discussion (sorry!). What time?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-28 00:44:19	@quarantedeux A M E N. When you don't have it, it's the worst thing ever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-28 00:39:26	@hubbit @quarantedeux It also feeds in to the plan to get rid of all those pesky socially liberal voters.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-27 21:08:00	First tie-in books, then graphic novels, now coffee. @Castle_ABC is better than your favourite show.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-27 11:27:47	Of course, I'm scanning the Pandora Pampers offer to see how much of a hell it will make a cashier's life. What even is my brain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-27 11:25:05	Got a Pandora ad from the Babysaurus. Had horrible flashbacks to my register. Can't get away from the toysaurus empire.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-27 09:48:08	@darthraydor So there was Kevin. Threesome?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-27 09:47:01	Where the hell are all these crickets coming from?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-27 05:13:08	@sonacroi preposterous! completely unbelievable. Nobody would buy it, it's not even remotely rooted in reality.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-27 05:02:40	@sonacroi I thought that was the hallmark for YA novels- no vampires, it's not YA. Haaaaaang on a second...

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-25 22:02:01	@dks2008 I have a quarter cup of normal coffee and I'm tweaking out and up all night. I think we're the opposite ends of the spectrum.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-25 21:56:05	@dks2008 I bow to your superiority. Four shots of espresso and I wouldn't sleep for a week, at least.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-25 11:25:49	@JessiaSott OH YEAH.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-21 04:52:47	@LizCanTweet @chidorme @mmdahlia27 well shit, I'm clearly not on top of it. Anybody still around?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 09:43:18	Organic doesn't mean not-GM. Organic means grown without chemicals, irradiation, or additives. In the US organic food can be GM.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 09:41:28	You wouldn't need right to know labeling laws if there was a basic level of scientific literacy in this country.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 09:39:52	Aaaaaaand we're hating on the FDA. Does no one realize the hurdles the FDA sets up for approval? Running a 2hr marathon would be easier.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 09:36:30	I really hate Monstanto, but I hate science illiteracy even more.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 09:36:08	This guys is not talking about the Death Gene in seeds. Monsanto never actually put that in their seed, guys. Come on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 09:29:39	Ugh NPR THIS MAN IS TALKING VERY BAD SCIENCE. Getting non-GM soybeans is nigh on impossible. Somebody stop this dude.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 08:56:00	You should turn on NPR and listen to the Libertarian candidate for president. I don't agree, but I might be in love. Coherent thoughts!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 05:27:14	@tui_talk @mmdahlia27 As a related note, oh how time flies with no new YW books. Remember those golden days of one a year?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 05:26:29	@tui_talk @mmdahlia27 I KNOW. I sat and thought about it and did a mental double take. Oh how time flies.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 05:16:56	@mmdahlia27 @tui_talk I think of people based on where I met them. I met Tui online...god, almost a decade ago now? Wow. And you at college.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 03:55:46	Seems there's a TEDx during Georgetown's homecoming this year. Seems I might just end up going.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 03:53:28	@tui_talk I didn't think so, but I figured I'd drop the devil's advocate thoughts. I only complain because I like penises, I swear!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 03:47:10	@tui_talk It's funny how many things frustrate you stem solely from a desire to get laid.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 03:44:13	@tui_talk in the direction I'm interested in. It's frustrating, but good frustrating. Flattering, but ultimately futile.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 03:43:44	@tui_talk I don't care if people think I'm gay, I'd just really appreciate it if the ratio of men:women that hit on me were higher...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 03:21:28	@tui_talk @mmdahlia27 You know what's really cool? Online and RL fiends interacting. Really, really cool.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 03:15:55	I just want to talk to a human being why is this so hard. Is this what the future will be like?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 03:01:40	There are ten options. They all end in an answering machine. I'm beginning to think the state is running a scam.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-20 00:32:30	@madelinead you're welcome! The best way to get started is hands on practice, I'm happy to skype you some starting tips if you want :)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-19 11:06:12	@chidorme @LizCanTweet I mean, it doesn't look like there's much else going on that night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-19 11:00:59	@behrlie @chidorme @mizujada this fits alarmingly well into my exam schedule/only bye week for rugby. Who planned this?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-19 10:57:32	@chidorme @LizCanTweet hmmmmm indeed

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-19 07:56:10	@halfpress Unintentionally, but indeed it is. I haven't been back since graduation, I think I might like to come back this fall :)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-13 21:14:01	@darthraydor I don't think so. They'll charge it through. I went to consider it last month, clicked a link and suddenly it was charged.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-13 20:57:11	@darthraydor but dude. Why cancel a free trial afore it's over?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-13 20:37:05	@darthraydor I used to say YES but now that I have prime I'd vote for that. Cheaper per year (get student!) AND free shipping!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-12 07:43:09	@LizCanTweet @chidorme That's the problem- I have a scene, but only the sketchiest of backstory that I don't know how to build.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-12 06:46:47	@chidorme @LizCanTweet I'm going through an extended period of obsession with this band but also THIS SONG and the ideas it puts in my brain
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-12 06:28:16	@LizCanTweet @chidorme Roughly the first two minutes and change of this song? http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=dWS-5l E4SWk …

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-11 09:00:40	Alright I'm here. Who else is MC-ing it? I haven't been here for this in aaaaages.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-11 04:09:33	@HOBradshaw I guess so? I mean, we're not working with it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-11 03:23:26	@HOBradshaw I want to rotate in a lab that works with the vaccine, but to do that I have to get vaccinated. It doesn't make any sense really
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-11 02:34:26	I never realized there was this much documentation involved to get the smallpox vaccine. Wow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 12:14:18	@quarantedeux Fantasy: some day I'll creep on a BSG-watching neighbor and it will be one of ya'll awesome internet people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:57:58	I'm so cool with this, I'm going to sit on my front porch and enjoy the free Dylan concert.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:57:35	So I was mad at the loud concert noises coming from the park before I realized it's Bob Dylan. I'm totally cool with this now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:34:24	@quarantedeux Be honest you totally would too.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:28:14	@quarantedeux I got one to post the first fic I'd written in aaaaaages about a year ago. I like being able to give kudos
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:26:25	@JasonTD Then again, I came to Who in the Moffat days purely for him. Jekyll has long been one of my favourite programs and I wanted more.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:24:47	@JasonTD without him Sherlock never happens in the first place. It's not pretty to be him, but I'm happy he keeps writing TV.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:23:15	@JasonTD I say this in particular because of hoe the Sherlock fans react to him. They hate him, they hate Irene, they want him gone, but
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:20:36	@JasonTD I genuinely think that the fandom just has it out for him. I mean, he didn't even write this episode but got tarred and feathered.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:18:30	@JasonTD And we're all entitled to our opinions. I'm a big fan of most of his episodes; I think he writes amazing stories.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:17:11	@JasonTD The hate that rolls in on him whenever River turns up in an episode is unbelievable. Also Irene Adler started the vitriol parade
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:14:48	@quarantedeux Bookmarks are utterly my downfall though. SO MANY THINGS to read later.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 09:14:17	@quarantedeux innit great?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 08:19:27	@quarantedeux I think I may have burnt a couple of the little ones, but they're absolutely delicious and mission successful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 08:17:53	@arysteia Cheers!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 08:15:58	@JasonTD Although the referred hate Amanda Abbington got for defending him is pretty indicative of the levels he must have been getting
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 08:12:08	@roomerholmes I'm pretty sure they're cooked now. Defs takes longer than that though, the first couple were still rubbery
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 08:01:09	Hey do any of ya'll know how to tell if scallops have been fully cooked?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 07:58:31	@JasonTD I saw screenshots floating around tumblr earlier today, but I didn't mark them. If they pass by again, I'll send them on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 04:58:03	@Rizzz @pineapplecakes YASSSS. Except everybody hates the Cowboys, doesn't matter what division.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 04:55:05	@Rizzz @pineapplecakes Hey, we should get together and hate the cowboys sometime! Or even better the Giants at @pineapplecake 's expense
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 04:51:57	@pineapplecakes @Rizzz NOPE. COMPLIMENT TAKEN EVEN IF IT WAS A MISTAKE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 04:51:27	@Rizzz @pineapplecakes As an iggle, I'm contractually obligated to hate the redskins. Ain't got no other options tbqh.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 04:22:00	WHAT ARE YOU DOING VICK. Do you not remember last season? If you let yourself get broken again, I swear to god.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 04:13:13	@pineapplecakes @Rizzz I hate the Redskins more though. Can everybody lose?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 04:11:55	@pineapplecakes Maclin tho. My precious bb recievers are doing what they do at least.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 04:10:42	@pineapplecakes I'm literally screaming "WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON" at my television.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 04:10:04	@JasonTD There's artistic criticism, and then there's death threats after many months of unending hate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 04:08:22	@pineapplecakes Are you watching this shit? This is a sewer leak of a football game.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 04:00:50	Seriously, what the hell is going on? RT @awfulannouncing And now the Browns do lead thanks to a Vick pick six. It's a funny game, Monty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 02:19:05	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 @LizCanTweet Probably me too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 02:18:30	I just want to find Vince Young and punch him the the face for saddling us with this Dream Team nonsense.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-10 02:11:07	Forever disappointed that the Redskins have more Super Bowls than we do.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-09 22:32:41	@dks2008 He's a corny as Kansas in August? He's a normal as blueberry pie?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-09 22:04:32	If you're not watching the paralympics rugby I don't want to be friends anymore. This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-09 11:58:44	In retrospect, liberal application of icy hot to half my body at once was a terrible decision. #ohgoditburns

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-08 15:02:34	The gauge for how absolutely drunk I am right now wil be how much of these nachos end up on my duvet tomorrow morning.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-06 14:05:42	@mmdahlia27 And jackalopes! Seriously honest to god rabbits that get HPV that grows into wart-horns on their heads. COOLEST THING EVAR.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-06 14:04:50	@mmdahlia27 I learned SUCH COOL THINGS about HPV viral capsid protein orientation and antigenicity today. But punnet squares too. Ew.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-06 13:54:06	@mmdahlia27 I hate it because it's taking over my every waking and breathing moment, but I'm loving it while it happens. Sort of.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-06 13:34:31	@tui_talk Bums. Is any of it black? Chuck it all together and it's perfect for a Welly night out! (Srsly, what is it with Welly and black?)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-06 13:28:50	@mmdahlia27 I thought it was always Sept 24th or something like that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-06 13:26:42	Problem set that has been bothering me for four days has finally resolved itself in my brain. I might like science again. Maybe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-06 13:15:28	@tui_talk Moderately clean clothes?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-06 10:53:07	I never realized I could hate science as much as I do right now, and it's only the second week of classes. welp.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-06 10:44:18	Fuck genetics, fuck Mendel and his pea fetish, fuck fucking alllelic hierarchies. Setting fire to my textbook now, brb.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-06 05:39:39	@mmdahlia27 not till the end of the month, sadly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-06 03:32:25	I have masses of generics problems to do. All this Castle news is not helping.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 11:38:33	So when during this election do we start talking about Alaskans with their Eskimo poetry?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 10:44:38	@roomerholmes As a female, I appreciate that there are males who agree that's just silly. Unless it's your kink, then go for gold I guess.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 10:01:19	@roomerholmes Allow me to put my objective science brain aside for a moment: eeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 09:57:13	Pretty sure it's impossible to accurately describe post-meiotic segregation in 50 words, but I guess I'll try, online quiz.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 09:55:12	@roomerholmes Dude, it's science. Salty solutions sting in the eyeballs. Fact o' life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 09:48:57	@roomerholmes oooh hell no. my eyes hurt a little now but that shit STINGS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 09:43:51	@roomerholmes ...does it help if I point out the eyes are only a problem a'cos of the birth control I finally got my hands on?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 09:31:17	@roomerholmes Seriously though I'm pretty sure KY isn't approved for ophthalmologic use.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 09:25:36	I know nothing about eyeballs and issues. Aside from dumping chemicals into my eyes that one time I have never had a problem
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 09:24:35	Alrighty tweeps, I know some of ya'll have contacts/eye things. What do ya'll recommend for keeping your eyes moist?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 09:13:39	I've never had a medication side effect in my entire life, but apparently if you put a Rex on hormones you get all of them at once.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 08:52:42	@roomerholmes Yeah that was a long afternoon. Gonna be a rough season, yo.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 02:53:03	@darthraydor I didn't catch this week's yet. I'll watch it with you when you get to it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 01:44:48	If you need me, I'll be consuming my body weight in pumpkin spice.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 01:18:24	@steveplace I also tend to think of Helo as Will Bailey. He turned up late and all the bad shit happens to him.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-05 01:16:16	@steveplace Well, there was that incident with the prostitute...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 23:35:01	Worker's comp is hard. And confusing. What the hell do I fill out?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 22:51:58	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @LizCanTweet I don't have anything remotely resembling a set schedule atm. Pick a time and I'll see what I can do
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 22:47:32	@steveplace Saul Tigh is totally Hoynes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 22:34:20	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 @LizCanTweet There was a pun in my brain but it definitely didn't transfer on the way out. Whoops

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 11:25:23	@mizujada BRB going to work for NOAA and naming all the hurricanes after BSG characters.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 11:20:00	@mizujada "Kirk is not expected to live long and prosper" Actual NOAA bulletin that actually happened.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 11:10:27	@chidorme Well, at least it was only softcore. That's typically easier to explain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 11:09:21	For some A+ nerdy reads, check out the discussions of Hurricane Kirk http://www. nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2012/K IRK.shtml … ?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 10:43:42	@chidorme @LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 I vote for google hangout, personally (now that I've figured out what's going on)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 10:42:36	@chidorme @LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 Also I don't know what we're doing but judging by the people involved I'm in without question no matter
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 10:41:47	@chidorme @LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 I don't know how, but I'm here let's make this happen
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 06:16:31	@zestylime Perhaps spin spin I'm so hateful, considering their view of beauty
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 06:02:25	@zestylime just get some eggs. Nina will take care of the rest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-04 05:11:43	@tui_talk I hate it when that happens! Fucking gremlins.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-03 23:21:18	@pineapplecakes @darthraydor Met a young twiggy black guy today with Michael Paul Chan's voice. My brain exploded a little.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-03 21:01:57	How does spell check have noncorrosive but not corrosive. The chemist is confused.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-03 20:34:47	If you've got a spare 90 bucks to part with, the complete West Wing is ridiculously on sale on Amazon today. Whooo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-03 10:27:37	@chidorme @LizCanTweet @mmdahlia27 YES PLEASE. How did I not notice this conversation going on all day?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 15:54:26	Why am I still up. Why.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 14:53:14	Mwahaha. http:// instagr.am/p/PEEXcgGHuT/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 09:58:51	So basically next week we've got Jurassic Potterwholock. Okay.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 09:02:45	@zestylime I was thinking the same thing about Peen State earlier
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 08:20:27	@darthraydor dates pls
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 08:16:04	@darthraydor HOW LONG ARE YOU OVER HERE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 03:38:02	@brittania_ everything needs moar River. Those stupid faces need to deal with that situation though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 03:35:30	@tui_talk No worries! :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 03:18:44	Oh god what happened to my football game? I watch Doctor Who for an hour and it all falls to shit, apparently.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 03:16:36	@tui_talk Trust me, the last thing I want to do is spoil people for the awesome :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 03:13:37	@tui_talk I thought I recognized an actor. Turns out I was right, that's all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 03:07:54	Who else is watching Doctor Who on the livestream? Is this who I think it is?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 02:08:54	@roomerholmes shots from the Nebraska game at the end of last season and player interviews. TEARS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 02:00:56	What is this tear-inducing poignant nonsense you're airing ESPN. Why.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 01:53:52	Alrighty. Let's see if I can football and Who at the same time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 01:36:25	@chidorme I love Rory and early Amy. But the last few eps she's just been rubbing me the wrong way. I'm hoping the new eps fix that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 01:35:12	In case you can't tell, I'm all over my first Penn State game as an official Penn Stater.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 01:33:09	fight on state fight on state strike your gate and win victory we predict for thee we're ever true to you dear old white and blue #PennState
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 01:24:12	@chidorme Also I'm not a fan of The Girl who Waited, but it definitely goes in with the great eps. It's good, but I've soured on Amy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 01:20:24	@chidorme Give us some time to get used to the plot device before cramming it down our throats LOOK HERE IS WHY WE DID THAT, y'know?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 01:19:37	@chidorme True. But did we need a two-parter? And right before the finale? Would have been better earlier in the season.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 01:17:37	@chidorme Aside from the flesh episodes, definitely awesome. The back six is all top quality, straight through.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-02 00:46:12	All I really want from life tbqh RT @zestylime you should be able to buy an internet cable subscription goddamnit

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-01 23:29:32	People taking pictures with a JoePa bobblehead in lieu of the statue. We just can't be stopped, I guess.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-01 22:51:34	@roomerholmes I mean, I'm taking a date but there may well be lesbians in the front row. That would be pretty hilarious, negl.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-01 22:22:29	Front row tickets to @CraigyFerg next month? Yeah, I have those :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-09-01 21:08:28	Color me shocked there are names on the backs of the new PSU jerseys. I don't know if I can handle this much change this quickly.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-31 08:50:54	"Are we in the fourth quarter yet?" "At some point it has to happen" This is the greatest football commentary ever.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-31 07:31:47	I find it very hard to believe no one has complained about fios not carrying the local network that airs the Eagles.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-31 06:51:01	Clearly there are too many football markets here. We don't need the Steelers Y/Y.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-31 06:50:28	We're in market. Why do you air an in-market game four hours late? Aaugh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-31 06:48:10	Local football selections: Steelers, Ravens. WHERE ARE MY EAGLES WHERE.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:25:44	@chidorme They have no idea what they're in for in terms of change of lifestyle, poor things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:25:22	@chidorme I am, thankfully, from here so I know what I'm getting myself into. I feel for the people from big cities joining my program.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:24:29	@chidorme YES. #sweetadventures indeed. Better (cheaper) than alumnae travel tours and without the old women to judge you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:21:46	@chidorme Nah. My options are Hershey and up at State College. All rural. A lot like Lynchburg. Great place to have a family not to be young
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:20:52	@chidorme Kicking ass and taking proteins, that's me :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:19:42	@chidorme True that. I just wish I wasn't in the absolute wop wops. I'd much rather be in a metropolitan area. Not in central PA anymore.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:18:39	@chidorme Hence, I joined a rugby team! I can't be all school, all the time. I need something that isn't or I'll go mad (see: my senior SBC)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:17:47	@chidorme It totally is, but as your only option it's a little scary. I know I'm not good with that, so we'll see how it goes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:13:39	@chidorme Law school is apparently a zombie.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:13:15	@chidorme I'm not really sure how I feel about that, but since I'm in the middle of nowhere it's about all I have to work with, really.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:12:51	@chidorme That's pretty awesome! It's a good way to look at it. I know the next five years of my life will be all science, all the time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:12:03	@chidorme OM NOM NOM tasty humans and their tasty brains.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:11:29	@chidorme I spent a few weekends with her when she was at Annapolis and holy shit, man. It took me a week or two to come out of it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:09:28	@chidorme I'm looking forward to it. I start monday and I'm kind of freaking out a little, but in a good way, I swear.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:08:31	@chidorme But as a grad student you're much better formed, not living on campus inundated by the campus culture, etc. etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:07:51	@chidorme I worry about anyone else I love going into that environment now, after watching what it did to her.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 03:07:26	@chidorme That's what I was thinking. She went whole-hog into St. John's life and then went to Santa Fe sophomore year and lost it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 02:50:50	@chidorme Mostly, I'm very happy for you, I know you'll love it there. You'll be a force to be reckoned with once you come out :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 02:50:17	@chidorme Then again, that was undergrad and we were straight out of high school. Ugh. This is not the point I meant to make.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 02:49:42	@chidorme Although after seeing what Emily went through at St. John's, I think sorting your shit before you get there is pretty essential.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 02:48:28	@chidorme happy to hear you've sorted your things out!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-09 02:46:56	@chidorme @papagena665 My best friend went there for undergrad, and I never tired of the looks I got into life there. It's so fascinating.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 08:35:58	@nikkidarling You just accurately summed up my feels about Sherlock. I tend to stay away from the Closer stans, though, which is nice.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 05:52:04	@hubbit No pun intended
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 05:51:56	@hubbit Not so much death as never-ending emotional pain. I feel as though adding a character-killer to the mix would be deadly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 05:43:42	@hubbit I had those same thoughts about a Moffat-Whedon show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 04:11:35	I joined airpoints to fly standby with @FlyAirNZ while I was in NZ, but now I have an airpoints card and no idea what to do with it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 04:08:27	@tui_talk now that's love.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 03:06:50	@HOBradshaw I love that you think that's a foregone conclusion in my life. It brings me joy :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 02:27:52	@mmdahlia27 it's a bible, but it was also my textbook for religion class sophomore year. I went to catholic school.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 02:09:24	Currently taking ideas as to why there's html written in the back of my high school bible/textbook.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 02:07:39	@papagena665 that's how I ended up with all of these. Problem is they're plastic and mostly all broken from years in the backs of drawers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 01:31:12	I remember how excited I was to get this @GALadmiss . I can't believe I still have it. http:// instagr.am/p/OCQk_fGHhu/

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-08 01:10:50	@brittania_ we all do, let's be real.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 23:05:54	@chidorme @mizujada Nice save.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 23:04:00	@mizujada @chidorme I think we can safely assume that zombies are also a passion of the alter ego, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 23:03:34	@mizujada @chidorme What do you think would work best as a bribe? Do alter egos have separate desires?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 22:59:53	@chidorme @mizujada Tease.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 22:59:43	@chidorme I go with my gut feelings after a coin flip. If I immediately feel bummed about the flop, then I know where to go.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 22:13:02	@quarantedeux I know, right? I didn't know people still used that for anything other than club polls in college.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 22:08:56	(Side note: my mom used to sing with the Baltimore symphony. I met a lot of the great conductors sitting in the back of rehearsal as a kid)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 22:05:29	When I was 12, Marvin Hamlisch convinced me to stick with an instrument I hated. I no longer play, but I've never regretted listening to him
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 21:59:22	Three months for the toysaurus departing employee survey to get to me, and it's from surveymonkey. Can't decide if it's funny or typical.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 20:44:07	@ENbrian It's dangerous. If only the comics weren't so wonderfully optimized for ereaders.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 20:39:44	@nikkidarling I realize I'm just hanging around foe the Tao, but even I'm not that impressed with her these days.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 20:37:36	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme ...wow. That puts my coin flip to shame.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 11:43:06	Your Catholic is showing @StephenAtHome , I like it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 11:37:26	Do they make pedialyte for grownups? Will I get the necessary nutrients from haterade?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-07 07:32:15	@chidorme I'm not accustomed to having to make this many life decisions at once. Is this what being a grownup is like? I don't like it.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-06 10:28:38	I love that point in Hamlet where the running body count commentary can kick in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-06 10:15:49	David Tennant, I see you making a penis hand gesture. I'm pretty sure that's not what Shakespeare intended with that line.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-06 09:22:43	Flipping between football and a version of Tenant's Hamlet with truly terrible subtitles on the Spanish PBS channel. An interesting combo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-06 08:53:59	You know, I don't think I knew we got the NFL Network. HELLO SEXY IT'S FOOTBALL TIME.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-06 05:54:54	The problem with Doctor Who is you can't watch anything British without trying to figure out what the actors were in Who.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-06 00:31:11	@behrlie Have fun!!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-06 00:30:45	It's official. Nothing is funnier than a cat with hiccups that doesn't understand what's going on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-05 09:42:49	Sitting on my new patio, listening to the dulcet tones of 98° floating over from the stadium. I could get used to this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-05 06:48:49	To his credit, he insisted on loading it all into my car for me and snagged a sixpack for his troubles. I think I can get behind this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-05 06:46:42	Walked out of the beer store, arms full of beer, as grandpa came out of the barber. Now I remember why I didn't want to move to Hershey.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-05 06:19:23	I discovered today the I can follow the exciting olympic things by the cheering from the Biker bar across from my new place.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 19:16:28	Whoo! Found a copy of the super rugby final. Time to get my early morning rugby on. #nospoilerspls
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 10:13:11	@brittania_ Billy, yo. It still hurts inside.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 10:11:09	Have you heard about the Aussie news stations that don't want to admit NZ is ahead of them in the gold metal count? So so funny.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 07:55:24	No, not two weeks. ONE WEEK. ONE WEEK TO CAMP. Me, I am excite. @samson_today @dani_dien can't wait to see all ya'll.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 07:54:01	Realize camp is two weeks away, realize you've had a year and you're still not that good at the guitar. Mission failure.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 07:53:06	@roomerholmes i'm a scientist. gotta figure out the theory before you start experimentation. plus, ow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 07:47:02	@roomerholmes still tryina figure out if that's possible
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 06:51:07	@roomerholmes yeah, nah I definitely got you the first time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 06:48:12	@roomerholmes Part of me wants to say challenge accepted, but.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 01:24:52	All I want from a Doctor Who special is an exploration of the life choices which led Captain Jack to become a giant head in a jar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 01:16:53	@brittania_ I had a moment there. I use cleanup on aisle 3 for spaceparents feels, it just felt wrong to put anything else in that aisle.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 01:07:09	@brittania_ ASDFJKL: This is definitely the story of how I died from excitement.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 01:03:39	@brittania_ or I could just check tumblr. Take my keyboard away, I fail at interneting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 00:57:47	@brittania_ i'm rubbish at finding them sharesies?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-04 00:48:02	@dks2008 I feel your pain. I've managed to chuck more than half the things I own in the last week or so to avoid moving them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 23:51:43	Stopped to pet the neighbor's other cat and Not My Cat flew into a jealous rage. The neighborhood cat hierarchy is hilarious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 23:46:51	@chidorme Those too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 23:42:37	@mizujada @chidorme @behrlie You've got the corn and water, I've got the corn and amish people. One of these is easier to cross.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 23:41:35	@chidorme @behrlie I like these ideas. I mean, my birthday is two weeks from yesterday, although we don't finish till 5:30 that friday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 23:32:37	@chidorme @behrlie Just barely! I'm down in DC all the damn time. Plus seriously there is nothing but corn up here.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 23:16:56	@chidorme Evidently they're instituting a Doctor Who Happy Hour in DC. I feel as though this could be worth a trip someday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 22:56:56	WHY DID I LEAVE DC? RT @BYT Preview: a very nerdy (very awesome) Doctor Who-themed happy hour at @BlackCatDC . http:// ow.ly/cIvpe
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 21:44:52	I can't tell if they're saying Alice or Alex Morgan, but I keep expecting someone to whip out a gun on the field.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 21:41:17	NZ v US in the soccer and I don't know who to root for. #help

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 20:46:01	I really, really hope NBC airs the men's single sculls awards ceremony. Lots of emotion, support between the athletes, this is awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 20:41:10	Mahe Drysdale is definitely nursing a semi for his gold medal presentation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 12:21:02	Well, this has been a lovely reminder of why I never watch the local news.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 12:20:24	"If you're a fan of hazy, hot, and humid weather you're going to love this" Our weathermen are such weenies. Giant weather weenies.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 12:14:43	Local anchorman can barely keep a straight face talking about the recall of two pound bacon cheeseburger boxes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 12:07:01	Apparently orientation now includes a child protection seminar. On my birthday. Just what I always wanted, thanks penn state!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 11:58:49	You're supposed to put your hand over your heart, not cup your muscle-boob Michael Phelps.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 10:57:20	Was that just the canoe slalom in the visa commercial? Be still my beating heart!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 09:13:38	That strange moment when you read a fic you wrote years ago and it makes you break down into tears. I'm sorry for that, YW fandom.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 09:11:23	@zestylime if you speed it up right, the dial up tone totally fits with the doctor who theme song
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 09:11:01	@zestylime dooo weee ooooo doooo doo dooooooooo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 09:07:13	@papagena665 I just rented an apartment in Hershey a little nicer than my one in DC for less than a third the price. I don't understand.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 07:06:30	@zestylime my very last in-class playing test before I switched over to contrabass was the day I got my bottom ones put on. #horrors
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 06:49:10	@zestylime worst experiences of my entire musical life throwing up during a choral concert solo included.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 06:48:27	@zestylime yeah definitely no. stg when i still played normal clarinet my mother would time new boxes of reeds with braces tightening.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 06:37:12	@roomerholmes that joke is never complete without a tonguing crack either :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 06:24:04	@zestylime Although once I switched to contrabass there was no helping my jaw period #orchestraldeepthroating
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 06:23:17	@zestylime oh sweet baby jesus even when I played regularly I could never manage to handle 4's. My condolences to your jaw.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:59:39	@mizujada It's funny because it's (sadly) true.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:59:01	I made a mental bet on how long before the bots rolled in after a porn joke. Clearly I overestimated by about five minutes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:55:27	@mizujada Sweet Briar: where you announce the quality of your poops but porn is taboo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:54:57	@mizujada I'll never forget the shock that rolled through the first night of first year that (heavens forbid) skinemax started showing porn
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:54:03	@mizujada I guess cable hopes so. They still have all those adult ppv channels.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:48:31	Chuckling at the discounts on the premium movie packages- everybody except skinemax. No discounts on porn, apparantly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:32:21	RT @tui_talk Every time a journalist uses the phrase "slash fiction", something gets Rule 34'd.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:30:34	@quarantedeux massive downsides to a major city, eh? Otoh, you're probably not surrounded by cornfields.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:24:21	@quarantedeux eeesh. Also strange, comcast 'round here is cheaper than anybody else.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:23:46	@mizujada That's my plan. I'm trying to hold off signing up until I have actually moved in. Hoping I can go in with a neighbor.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:21:52	@quarantedeux I'm moving into the wops. I'm shocked I even have fios as an option tbqh. Have you thought about getting tv somewhere else?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:20:30	@quarantedeux Can we discuss how tempting 150/65mbps internet speed sounds. So expensive, but so pretty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:18:13	@quarantedeux Wow. Market differences? I'm looking at options for 80/mo for fios or 70/mo cable. Fios gives you the package breakdown.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:07:11	@quarantedeux @mizujada I'm trying to decide what to pick up. I need interwebs, and cable is just six bucks extra. I mean, how do you say no
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:06:17	@quarantedeux @mizujada I'd love to use that option, but they're hard to find for anything but the most popular shows
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 05:05:28	@mizujada @quarantedeux we couldn't plan a battlestar rewatch in a rabid fandom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-03 04:59:56	@quarantedeux @mizujada I find myself with the problem of wanting to watch live with my friends, since it's more fun. I'm hesitant to drop.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 23:50:14	BBC playing chariots of fire while the women's K1 medalists come out. Tee hee hee.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 23:43:33	The whole crowd is joining in on the British anthem at the Men's C2 medals, and it's awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 23:39:43	In case you're interested, the women's whitewater kayak slalom: France, Spain, Aussie.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 23:36:56	I'm not really clear why there are playboats going down the whitewater course right now, but I'll happily pretend it's an event.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 23:34:56	You know what's awesome? Seeing competitors be genuinely happy for each other when they win.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 23:27:58	LOOK ALL THE COMPETITORS ARE HUGGING. Female paddlers are a rare brand of awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 23:20:38	What is it with the French doing amazing things with the eddies today? Unf. That was a run.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 23:16:47	That's the most impressive surf I've seen after gate 10 on this course yet. Dukatova taking air like a boss.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 23:05:53	Yes! Finally! A stream of the women's K1 final1
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 22:47:06	@mizujada I want them to include freestyle playboating a la snowboarding in the winter olympics.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 22:44:44	@mizujada Plus that standardizes the course. Other competitions are racing on creeks and some playboating freestyle competitions.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 22:43:48	@mizujada It's a slalom course. You need gates otherwise it's too open to interpretation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 22:40:18	@mizujada Gold and Silver for GB when they weren't really expected to medal
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 22:37:15	Even the coach jumps in the water to celebrate! I fucking love paddlers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 22:34:42	The crowd has been abnormally loud at the whitewater events because there isn't usually a crowd at the whitewater events.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 22:32:07	It's the final "and now they're actually trying" Seriously these slovak guys are the absolute shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 22:28:26	Those frenchies just hit that eddy like a five dollar whore. I am so aroused right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 22:23:57	Was that a paddle five in the finish pool? I think that was a paddle five.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 22:20:55	I'm always so impressed by the tandem whitewater events. I can barely make it down a course on my own with full control.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 22:16:18	Give me all the whitewater and rapids you have.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 21:21:03	Allow me to attempt to convey to you my excitement that they're airing the kayak slalom live.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 21:19:02	@chidorme and NZ took their first gold! I woke up to facebook going apeshit. So funny.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 09:46:35	Stopped for gas and was given the great entertainment of watching some moron get his trailer stuck in the Wendy's drive through. Heh.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 06:35:50	@shewhoisAnna the few hopeless democratic candidates always stop by to meet me because i'm the youngest regular voter by decades.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 06:31:31	@shewhoisAnna damn congressmen who say they believe in term limits and then actually follow through.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 06:31:00	@shewhoisAnna mine's Platts. He might be a republican but he's straight up. So sad he's stepping down.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 06:08:13	@pineapplecakes @nikkidarling wait. That's not a typical weekend for you?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 06:05:38	@pineapplecakes friends on the fb are plotting to go make out in chick-fl-as on saturday. I have lulz.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 05:59:16	Don't go towards the pigeon, Leemo!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 05:57:54	Everybody beat up Leemo 'cos he doesn't have a battle station. Mwahaha.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 05:55:02	Forever laughing at Tigh's reaction when he walks into the Cylon Revelation Room. #BSG
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 05:49:16	@nikkidarling god forbid you write a character that is the doctor's equal. All women must be superior.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 05:48:02	You know what you can't just do? You can't just settle on BSG as something to have on while you find something to watch. #sucksyouin
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 04:51:09	Delivering ads saying Penn State should give up their football team to someone in a Penn State network. Facebook, you're doing it wrong.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 03:09:32	@pineapplecakes can't damage our prefect white shiny teeths
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 03:06:07	@pineapplecakes Problem is nobody plays canoe polo here. I haven't played since I moved back from NZ a few years ago :( Someday, maybs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 03:04:15	@pineapplecakes I roll like a G6 http:// twitpic.com/aebflq
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 02:55:25	@pineapplecakes I've never been clear on if that's a completely legal move, but I never got cited for it so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 02:54:26	@pineapplecakes Bonus points if you can keep the ball in your possession while you're doing it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 02:54:07	@pineapplecakes Even cooler: chuck your paddle to stop an attack, flip over to dodge and roll back up using your hands.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 02:37:34	That awkward moment when you know more about blood donation than the customer service person at the Red Cross.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 02:37:04	@chidorme If you could, no one who comes into contact with me would ever get anything done. Probably a good thing, really.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 02:08:08	@pineapplecakes BOO YEAH. It's like the winter gateway sport for whitewater paddlers. Instead of bashing rocks, you bash people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 01:58:48	@mmdahlia27 I'm a 112-er, myself. Or I try to be, when I'm not getting the runaround on when I can do another double red donation. Argh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 01:53:10	@quarantedeux Or I would have noticed but it probably wouldn't have bothered me as much as it does now, since I just got back here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 01:52:36	@quarantedeux Likely. Although to be honest if I hadn't lived outside the US (and particularly during an olympics) I wouldn't have noticed
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 01:51:25	@mmdahlia27 It's a cumulative period of five years or more in a variety of european countries for CJD prevention.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 01:48:06	@quarantedeux He (and his brothers) are startling reminders to me that there are people who actually view foreign things with distrust.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 01:47:18	@quarantedeux I just spent two weeks with a cousin. He spent the whole time telling me why asian trucks are inferior to american ones
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 01:45:02	@quarantedeux I think it's reinforcing it in those who insist upon it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 01:34:37	@pineapplecakes I love playing sports where you're legitimately liable to lose an eyeball if you're not careful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 01:34:08	@pineapplecakes canoe polo >>>>>>

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 00:48:29	That awkward moment when you spend the entire cadillac commercial naming the turns in monaco.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 00:39:34	Of course, I also expect the stores to run out of aspirin as people try to take advantage of their new free birth control.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 00:37:31	Today, I'm going to the doctor and getting the hormone treatment I should have been on for years now but couldn't afford. WOOP #womenshealth
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-02 00:00:08	@chidorme Nobody expects the equestrian inquisition?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 23:48:53	@chidorme Anything involving a kayak, yes. I used to play canoe polo-it's the gateway from whitewater during the winter No water polo though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 23:47:12	@quarantedeux I...don't think I know what that was. Bummer. I was hoping I finally had some way to get me the rugby. Alas.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 23:26:00	@chidorme What I said about water polo the other day? Disregard. I forgot that canoe polo isn't an olympic sport, just the swimming kind.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 23:21:21	Wait. Is NBC Sports channel Universal Sports under a different name? Will I finally get rugby on my tv? Or is this just a new channel?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 23:09:37	Mostly because some of the guys on this team are the only people I've ever met who were going to the olympics, and that's kind of cool.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 23:05:52	I know nothing about soccer but I will sit here and cheer on the Oly-Whites as they get slaughtered by Brazil.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 22:18:04	@chidorme I like it Kiwi-style. Celebrate everybody and then get ridiculously excited when you nab a metal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 19:41:52	@mizujada Sorry, reflexive reaction. Couldn't help myself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 19:41:33	@mizujada kitty!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 14:24:11	On the other hand, 2am is the only time of day it's cool. This is a great time to test out my new cleats.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 14:17:18	Schwings with Dr. Pepper sauce should not have contained enough caffeine too keep me up all night. Body,we need to have a talk.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 13:01:12	@LizCanTweet hiiiiiiii stranger
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 12:28:50	According to comcast, 'All Olympic Sports' are cycling and soccer. All this nonsense for just two sports? I don't get it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 12:23:39	@pineapplecakes WHY. Why would you give her flawless face material like that? WHY.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-08-01 12:21:14	@pineapplecakes OH SWEET BABY JESUS WHERE THE FUCK DID ALL THESE FUCKING FEELS COME FROM

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-31 21:21:26	@chidorme also water polo gets nastier than you would expect. Otoh, if you want to dodge somebody you can just roll over.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-31 21:20:35	@chidorme they're my favourite events! I've paddled the olympic training course in NC, it's a beast.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-28 12:18:12	@halfpress The Kiwis were celebrating everybody (except the Aussies ofc), which I enjoyed. That's what the Olympics are meant to be.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-28 12:14:57	I'm sorry our guide light is interfering with your air-conditioned palace. Allow me to stumble down the hall of my ten to my personal toilet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-28 12:12:57	A guy in the RV with more square footage than my apartment that came in today just got out to tune off the outside light to the toilets.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 09:49:46	@brittania_ it's starting to affect how I rewatch LTM a little bit.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 06:44:40	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux @pineapplecakes guaranteed to put a smile on my face
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 05:57:10	@zestylime @roomerholmes I love the science imaxes! Especially the ocean ones. But also avengers.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 05:53:45	@tui_talk how so? This is intriguing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:39:49	@shewhoisAnna be not amazed if we know not how to internet?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:37:23	@shewhoisAnna the dog ate my homework for the modern age.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:36:55	@shewhoisAnna although idk if I would call New Zealand the wild frontier
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:35:30	@shewhoisAnna someday. I'm coming home and dropping right into the start if grad school, this pattern of confusion will continue i'm sure.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:34:10	@shewhoisAnna this is interesting, though. I liked the red cross's response when there was a tweet about getting slizzered. Less inflam, tho
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:32:33	@shewhoisAnna the only non-PSU news I get is when all ya'll tweet about it and I catch it. Be not surprised I know not what are the haps
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:31:19	@shewhoisAnna dude. I've either been in another hemisphere or in the wilderness since the beginning of june.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:23:24	@shewhoisAnna what happened?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:22:58	I climbed two mountains today. I think I've earned a little tv-catch up downtime. Y U make it so hard, internet?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:15:32	@quarantedeux the worst part is we have cable, but the rents have no memory of logins whatsoever
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:14:12	Do we know if Kristin Wiig has outdoorsy family? Because I'm pretty sure I saw her on the way down our second mountain today.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 04:10:41	TNT: watch full episodes, but only if you have cable.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-26 03:47:35	Nathan Fillion referring to BSG actors by their callsigns is the greatest modern scifi smashup I can think of.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-25 11:10:05	Went on a kid's nature-type boat tour, discovered it's run by an alum. Great to see an alum doing something seriously awesome. #gosweet

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-24 07:13:09	@roomerholmes some guy got harassed today for his PSU hat. I pulled off my giddier to avoid it happening to me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-24 07:11:16	@roomerholmes truth. So, so happy I'm not home for this nonsense. Otoh, people not in PA hate PSU more, so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-24 06:44:51	@roomerholmes keeping it classy, bobby
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-24 04:19:00	But did I take off my Penn State sweatshirt when it happened? Indeed I did.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-24 04:18:59	Saw a guy in a PSU cap get harassed for supporting kiddie fiddlers in the park visitor center this morning. Unspeakably angry? Yep I am.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-24 01:39:46	@roomerholmes weird that they chose the years after Sandusky was fired to vacate, yeah?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-24 01:38:23	I'm concerned about what the fallout will be from these sanctions. Somebody's going to sue for breach of sanctions and this will get uglier
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 23:04:43	@quarantedeux yep yep. Whackos will always to whacko things. We need to accept that those things happen n not glorify disaster porn
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 23:02:06	@quarantedeux that's how I feel about air security in New Zealand. Fully just to say they have it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 21:56:16	When do we stop making more victims?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 21:53:06	Sorry, you will never play in a bowl for something that happened when you were five.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 21:52:11	I feel so bad for the freshmen who committed to play for Penn State this year.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 08:54:25	@sk8tegr8 I know! I'm so excited! I haven't been up in a couple of years, it's nice to be back
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 07:47:25	@sk8tegr8 yep! Got in this morning. Mom spends summers on MDI, we're up with her for a couple of weeks
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 06:38:31	@sk8tegr8 I was in freeport this morning!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 06:29:37	Contemplating taking the meat fork to bed to ensure I actually have space to sleep. Good idea y/y?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 04:23:48	I might have just accidentally organized my PhD cohort's first social outing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 04:17:00	@chidorme such a wonderful way to spend a day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 02:53:41	On the other hand, MDI I am on you! Let the excellent Maine-ness commence!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-23 02:34:42	Get all the way to Maine and the sports radio is talking Sandusky. Great.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-22 15:15:54	I haven't had so much fun driving in longer than I can remember. I am clearly a nutter.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-22 15:15:19	Did the PA->CT leg of the fifteen hour drive, over the GW bridge and past the Bronx to get through NYC. Call me crazy but...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-22 13:02:50	On the road again, late night people watching at the service station in Jersey. This is awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-22 09:07:34	@chidorme I feel sad for people who have never experienced Old Bay.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-22 09:05:58	@mmdahlia27 She tried to convince me all my batshit I went through senior year was because I was judic chair. No lies.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-22 09:05:12	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 Indeed, particularly of brain sort. I went for help and got nothing but a waste of what little time I had.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 12:29:43	@ENbrian Old bottle, old cork. Thing was only half in to begin with. This is also shitty wine. Not a real loss, actually.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 11:48:09	I'm alarmingly attracted to Cavil in sunglasses. #bsg
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 11:47:11	@atmodrop and then takes Laura in a manly fashion many times.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 11:46:36	@atmodrop what about the cylinders?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 11:44:54	Cavil looks just like my manager at the toysaurus. Freaky.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 11:44:05	@atmodrop holy shit, I was like five mins ahead. Fixed
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 11:41:40	@atmodrop you're at a frakstache?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 11:39:24	@pineapplecakes @atmodrop but will we get papadama guilty feels for leaving a man behind?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 11:37:52	@atmodrop my box set came with super extended cut and more extra scenes. Made the whole purchase worth it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 11:36:38	And go?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 11:35:45	@atmodrop @pineapplecakes okay I think

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:59:53	I maintain my initial watch assumptions that the cylinder were only keeping Gaius as a sex slave #bsgmarathon

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:51:53	@atmodrop i'm attempting to rock this from my phone. Not going so well
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:49:40	@pineapplecakes @atmodrop I think I may have forgotten to turn off skype and fb messenger. This could get fun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:47:38	@pineapplecakes welcome to my life. If we doto this again I'll do a proper two-monitor setup.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:46:06	@pineapplecakes sorry.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:45:49	@pineapplecakes @atmodrop I want Sharon vs. Eddie the gangster more tbqh

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:42:38	@atmodrop 1:48
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:40:23	@pineapplecakes @atmodrop I blame the amish.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:39:39	@pineapplecakes @atmodrop fucking power company, man.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:39:17	@atmodrop it came right back in, give the modem a minute and we should be good
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:38:33	@atmodrop that was until the power went out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:37:56	What.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:37:49	Clearly to livestream properly a multi-monitor setup is useful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:37:06	@atmodrop fucking. Too many damn screens.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:36:09	@atmodrop @pineapplecakes sweet that means its working. Cleats, not shoes :p
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:34:14	@pineapplecakes I think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:32:49	@pineapplecakes http:// livestream.com/funkasarusrex
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:30:18	@atmodrop will do. @pineapplecakes get your ass over to livestream. channel same as my username.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:28:42	@atmodrop the universe loves us. Plus I got a stream setup!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:19:39	@atmodrop ...but I already thought that?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:16:11	@atmodrop go for it. I may have just figured out how to stream my desktop so we can rope in a cakes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:13:53	@atmodrop well, we can keep going or we can random number it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:10:22	@atmodrop Rather, which episode.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:09:13	@atmodrop what are you on?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:05:09	@atmodrop @pineapplecakes and if not can we stream it to her
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 10:04:49	Every time I launch BSG on Netflix it gets stuck, like it can't decide which of the many half-finished rewatched episodes to start with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 09:40:35	@quarantedeux let me know when you hit the next one! in the meantime, to see if there's any wine I haven't moved yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 09:38:05	@quarantedeux Want company? I'll chime in on the next one
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 09:37:38	@quarantedeux Absolute true facts.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 09:27:48	@quarantedeux Is everybody on an end-of-S3 kick right now? These episodes keep popping up/I had a mini marathon the other day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 07:07:55	Pretty sure my drunk aunt's facebook has turned into the old-man-tricked-into-googling-on-twitter thing. Oh boy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:56:37	I love that the Onion managed to balance being the Onion and reporting the Aurora shooting perfectly http://www. theonion.com/articles/sadly -nation-knows-exactly-how-colorado-shootings,28857/?ref=auto …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:50:24	@roomerholmes As well there should be! Just let's be reasonable with our hate, please. Hate the kiddie fiddlers and cover up not the players
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:49:17	@roomerholmes I was talking to a Bama fan last spring who refused to slag off psu because 'what if it had been Bear? how would I react?'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:47:45	@roomerholmes Hence why I'm so interested in Saban's thoughts. It could (won't but still) have happened at Bama. How would he want it to go
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:46:14	@roomerholmes As Bear is part of ours. Also the football family is so similar at both places.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:44:59	@roomerholmes This is my first football season as an official (if already life-long) penn stater. I'll be hanged if I'll let them take that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:43:30	@roomerholmes Ditto. Whatever went on off the field, if we're talking football we're talking legendary.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:42:48	@roomerholmes If they cancel my football season I'm marching into the NCAA and demanding back my student season ticket money.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:37:47	@zestylime @roomerholmes Nah, but as far as people who might know what it's like Saban's it. I value his perspective on all this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:34:09	@chidorme I remember the St. John's because my best friend went there. I start in two weeks. eeep!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:33:11	@roomerholmes The whole thing is just so raw. God got fired, died, and then turned out to not actually be God. I'm just starting to process.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:29:20	@roomerholmes @zestylime Had he been eager to come to judgment, I'd agree with a lime, but his remarks were considered and focused.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:25:05	@chidorme Does just St. John's start in a month? When does maryland start?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:24:09	@roomerholmes He's got the best perspective almost anybody else could have, so it's heartening to get constructive ideas from him.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:23:21	@roomerholmes And it's good to see them providing perspective on the issue. I don't know what it's like to be in JoePa's position, but Saban
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:21:32	@roomerholmes Me too. I think coaches who stand a chance to go down in history can learn from our massive fuck up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:20:43	@chidorme I got my orientation/class packet today. Freaking out, man.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:18:11	@roomerholmes i think i might be in love. his reaction to the statue question.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:14:29	@roomerholmes praise the sweet zombie jesus somebody is talking sense
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:12:39	@roomerholmes eh? haven't stumbled across them yet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:07:17	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes we deactivated him for almost an entire season in a team full of ex-cons and douchebags. says something.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:04:03	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes is TO even on a team this year?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 06:01:50	@pineapplecakes @roomerholmes I've got a list of players I'm happy we're rid of, and he's the tip top of it. NFL rehab failure case.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:58:12	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes you weren't the only one on that midnight thought train.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:57:37	@roomerholmes I live in a world trying to pretend my neighbors aren't recreating hatfields and mccoys with stillers/cravens
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:55:33	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes seconded.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:53:52	@roomerholmes All over the damn place. Lots of Steelers gear, too. I just. Don't. Understand.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:52:53	@roomerholmes NOT SOON ENOUGH.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:52:33	@pineapplecakes @roomerholmes top three teams for gear seen on people in New Zealand: Raiders, Jets, Broncos. What is wrong with the world.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:50:40	I miss this. Is it football yet? RT @pineapplecakes always RT @roomerholmes : much fichigan RT @funkasarusrex : and michigan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:47:21	@pineapplecakes and michigan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:43:14	@pineapplecakes whatever. you're a buckeye, i bleed blue and white. let's be honest, we'll never stop judging each other.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:42:30	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes I marathoned it netflix style
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:41:41	@pineapplecakes @roomerholmes wait. seriously? And ya'll were judging me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:25:14	what in the flying fuck is a teddy bear doing here #breakingbad
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:22:00	@pineapplecakes I'll admit, from what I've heard about this season it might just be worth all the awards. The first three really weren't tho
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:15:11	@roomerholmes Breaking Bad. I sat down and sped my way through Mad Med last summer. It was good, but not stunning-win-all-the-awards
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:11:49	@roomerholmes I tried once ages ago and hated it, but I just tried again and sped through the first season.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:10:37	@roomerholmes like a lizard.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:09:17	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes I haven't seen any of this season yet. But this season hasn't won any awards, either.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:08:52	@pineapplecakes I mean, I liked it. I avidly watched the first three seasons, but there's definitely better television out there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 05:05:10	So unlike all the emmy noms for Mad Men (which I don't understand) I can fully see why Breaking Bad gets all the damn awards.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 04:31:53	@pineapplecakes flawless perfect but not better than a crazy chemist cranston
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 03:45:44	@pineapplecakes Detective Sanchez the meth kingpin. I love breaking bad.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 03:26:34	@roomerholmes it's awesome, negl. Man, NZ addicted me to all the weird sports.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 03:18:36	@roomerholmes do you have a team?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 03:16:17	@roomerholmes yes please this
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 02:22:30	@pineapplecakes i think i just squicked myself, tbqh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 02:15:38	@pineapplecakes HALLO SHMEXAY want to see what I can do with a hamster?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 02:08:42	@pineapplecakes YES HOW DID YOU KNOW CAN YOU SEE ME ARE YOU WATCHING ME IN MY SLEEP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 01:47:25	That awkward moment when you already own all the required textbooks. #gradschool #unrepentantchemist
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 01:40:37	Shit shit team. semester course schedule, summer reading, and entrance exam info just rolled in. #gradschool #itshappening #ack
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-21 01:33:47	Moving is the single most effective clutter-reducing motivator I've ever had. It's hot, I'm lazy, if I don't want to move it it goes! #ufyh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 22:04:27	I want this little genius kid to end up running the meth trade #breakingbad
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 20:56:20	@tui_talk your couch is indeed very comfy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 11:39:57	You guys, Breaking Bad is all my #unrepentantchemist dreams for a tv show come to life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 10:29:12	"I said fuck you and your eyebrows!" Breaking Bad, we're going to be friends.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 10:16:13	@tui_talk whaaaa
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 06:56:53	@chidorme I spent that entire summer planning out what I was going to say, and then abandoned it all on the moment when that thought hit me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 06:08:20	There's an Idris in Thor? SHIT YES.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 05:43:25	I hate packing to move. Blergh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 04:59:59	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme You've all come here as Sweet Briar girls. When you leave, I hope you'll have earned the right to be Sweet Briar women
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 04:59:20	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme I think of it the way I said it to the froshies at the honor code orientation:
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 01:33:23	@brittania_ ugh David Paymer. Bow to my spelling will, phone.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 01:27:33	@brittania_ Although my particular favourite is David Palmer as the sassiest judge you've ever seen on TV
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 01:25:33	@brittania_ The show gets a host of fantastic broadway actors as guests since they film in NYC. I love it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 01:20:21	@brittania_ definitely. I turned up solely for Alan Cumming and I'm so glad I did. Plus, Nathan Lane next season!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 01:14:56	@brittania_ The Good Wife, man. Definitely got passed over.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 00:36:55	Get asked for tips for places to visit in NZ, accidentally write eight pages about it. #whoops
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-20 00:26:14	@chidorme this is very true. I'm on mission 12, and emotional reactions get me worried. Now I fear what is to come.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 23:12:44	@chidorme Aaugh not spoilers!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 21:46:00	@witzseeker True that. The only awards I'm invested in are the Tony's.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 21:31:59	@witzseeker true that. there's just so much quality tv out there. it's so hard to decide.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 21:27:45	@witzseeker but just think- soon she'll have her own show for all the damn awards.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 21:02:55	@dks2008 that story came to me with a 'be careful out there, guys' from the paddling club. I had to laugh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:55:42	@cleveradjacent ...that would make a great horror movie, actually.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:55:14	@cleveradjacent except everyone is dead.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:54:27	@brittania_ I didn't know there was going to be one, and I just had a slight doubt about the deposit i put on the complete boxed sandman
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:47:55	@cleveradjacent I could get behind that. A new super-secret very elite underground tap club.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:29:52	@dks2008 @melissaeramos I am so disappointed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:27:59	@cleveradjacent Consider yourself lucky. You transferred, you missed the culling of the fold :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:27:19	@dks2008 @melissaeramos seconded. or thirded.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:22:51	@dks2008 @melissaeramos Did you answer? Please tell me you answered.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:22:23	I never had problems with ghosts at Sweet Briar, probably because I sacrificed freshmen every fall on monument hill. #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:15:27	@maryrtaylor10 My thoughts exactly. What did you think of the quality of the ghost stories?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:11:21	People on the internet speculating that Dani is Indiana's direct descendant #dyingoflaughter
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:09:27	@maryrtaylor10 That was clearly not the Briar. You'd figure they'd at least come round for a few quick exterior shots.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:06:18	@dks2008 @melissaeramos I want your life. That's amazing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:05:47	Alright ladies, in the wake of that nonsense what are your best Sweet Briar ghost stories? #schoolspirits #sweetspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 11:02:38	I'm disappointed. Most of the good, classic Sweet Briar ghost moments aren't scary, so they can't be sensationalized. A pity. #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:55:33	The following is based on actual accounts from Sweet Briar. The footage is not based on anything remotely resembling SBC #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:53:30	Plus they're better stories. RT @melissaeramos i like the nice, friendly ghost stories we tell the kids during college tours #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:50:11	I'm surprised they haven't tossed in that story about the books flying off the shelves in the library.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:47:52	I'm a fan of the Lucian-haunts-the-horse-stables theory. None of this creeping around the dorms nonsense. #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:39:01	@mizujada 'there's no way for a man to get on campus' 'they have to be accompanied by a student at all times'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:38:22	Lucian Fletcher. Conveniently gifted with an evil name. I've always thought that a bit suspect tbqh. #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:36:56	What are these bullshit rules about men on campus? Way to make us sound like crazy people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:35:42	@melissaeramos hahaha probably. People think they see ghosts it's just CM's tapping.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:35:10	OH GOD A MAN ON CAMPUS. WHAT WILL WE DO. #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:33:43	@melissaeramos @CEG10 @Ebie_B Yes this. This is so true.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:30:08	My god, it finally actually looks like Sweet Briar. #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:28:55	Somebody whistling in the dark? Probably just a tap club. #sweetbriartruths #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:27:52	I was waiting for Lucian or whatever the fuck the uncle's name was. #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:26:00	Who was it that had the Meta Glass poltergeist theory? Was that you, @ljsgecko ? #sweetspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:25:20	Girl, don't ask for Daisy. Daisy doesn't scare people. She just fucks with your shit for kicks. #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:20:39	Wow, I didn't need a key to get to the fourth floor of Meta Glass. Maybe to get to the virgin vault... #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:18:50	OH YES THE META GLASS FREAKY ELEVATOR STORY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:18:13	"One weekend where I had nothing going on" Not possible this is Sweet Briar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:17:07	Wait. Are we making Daisy into something menacing? Is this really happening? #sweetspirits #schoolspirits #whatever
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:15:19	These are the worst SBC ghost stories, man. Where are the good ones from the ghost tours? #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:14:14	@melissaeramos YES THANK YOU
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:13:53	RT @melissaeramos what campus is this?? at least google what our campus looks like before you throw some random buildings here and there
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:12:08	@melissaeramos this is ridiculous.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:06:05	@ljsgecko These are all pretty and non-threatening, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:03:12	None of these exterior shots are from Sweet Briar. Seriously questioning the validity of this thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 10:00:56	Alright let's get some sweet sweet Sweet Briar #schoolspirits
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 09:56:14	wait what #schoolspirits there is no gray stone on campus what is this nonsense in the promo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 09:20:37	@pineapplecakes now that I think about it, that's an accurate description of his entire character arc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 09:17:17	@TeamUfYH You rock never change keep unfucking all the things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 09:12:25	My crazy pink undergrad is the focus of tonight's @hauntedschools . Internet friends, help me stan it for some perspective?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 09:08:20	@pineapplecakes lol nope not drunk enough killed my wife and made my brosef dissapoint
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 09:05:54	The ship! It's in the frakkin' ship! #trololol #bsgmarathon

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 03:55:08	@tui_talk that's terrifying. it's one thing as a fancy dress joke, sure.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 02:45:24	@ljsgecko This could be fully profitable for them. Internet, no more than 10 channels. Done.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 02:44:37	@ljsgecko I'd be happy to pay more per channel per month for the handful of channels I want than a lump sum for a lot of useless garbage.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 02:36:49	Can I just get a cable subscription that has just the channels I want? Can that happen?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-19 01:16:07	Lawyer type friends! What's the best way to go about finding one?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 04:57:55	@ENbrian more technical, better onboarding and preparation. Plus this guide is just plain funny. Super basic, but hilarious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 04:56:53	@ENbrian i'm getting the vibe that it's related to men's the same way whitewater kayaking is- less brawn, more technical
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 02:58:15	"Do not pass the ball forward. If confused, run like hell." the new player packet is fantastic #rugby
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 01:08:23	Dear world: just because I have tits doesn't mean I need to have shiny pink cleats.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 01:02:19	@chidorme Club rugby, perhaps?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 01:00:17	@chidorme Yep, I'm playing with the local team. Is there a name for this level of play? Not professional, but not school either. Hrm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 00:48:54	@chidorme Fuck no. I wanted to support the local shop, but the dudebro at Dick's was so helpful I'm going back there to buy them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 00:47:30	@tui_talk @lcsnz Too late now, but in the future, Booze Cake: layer kahlua, ice cream sammies, whipped topping, choc sauce. Repeat. Done.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 00:45:18	@chidorme Clearly the dude is nuts. Although he was slagging it off to me, he probably wouldn't to a male player tbqh they're beasts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 00:44:12	@chidorme He spent the whole time telling me I need a toe cleat and that it's stupid that rugby cleats don't have one like football.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 00:43:38	@chidorme I think he thought I'm stupid because I was looking at soccer cleats, but rugby cleats are nearly impossible to find here
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 00:42:19	@chidorme Rugby! No mafia, but plenty of badasses.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-18 00:10:10	I came into your store to buy cleats, don't slag off on my sport. Asshole.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 10:14:55	Alright team. It's been more than a month, and I'll be damned if anything gets between me and my own bed.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 09:37:16	@quarantedeux YES THIS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 09:28:42	There's a Bamber in Perception tonight. TNT is BSG-ing it up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 09:15:28	@quarantedeux idk how I feel about these commercials. It's like, 'guess who's not the leak!'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 09:02:42	@quarantedeux I'm indulging in the thought that this is his wife from when he served in the 4077 in Korea.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 09:00:07	@tui_talk It's really one of the few uniquely american creations. Most of what we have is just lumped together from everywhere else.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:58:12	@tui_talk I might have just taught myself how to play it on the guitar. It's a love/hate relationship.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:56:00	@tui_talk wow, I'm really bad at this whole where are the musicians from thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:53:30	@tui_talk Good god yes, if that's the hill you're staging. I'd stage on the motown and blues hill happily, because Call Me Maybe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:51:08	@tui_talk Nickelback? Really. Really.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:39:17	@tui_talk Well, for english language acts anyway. My thought was more in terms of sheer volume. More population, more of the good and bad
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:34:54	@tui_talk The british sure as hell have us beat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:34:30	@tui_talk Nope not at all. Just US vs NZ
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:33:56	@tui_talk Yeah, what spawned this?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:33:48	@tui_talk "Aotearoa Roots" Fat Freddy's without any quality at all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:31:31	@tui_talk on the flip side, I could likely come up with a longer list of great acts too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:31:03	@tui_talk this is an unfair game. There's a larger volume of american music, I'll run out of bad NZ long before we run out of bad US tunes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:30:19	@tui_talk this is unfortunately very true. Six60?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:24:54	@tui_talk Wow. All this time, I totally thought he was canadian.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:24:38	@tui_talk HOW BIZARRE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:21:19	@tui_talk Southside of Bombay. Really, What is the Time, Mr. Wolf?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:11:33	well, the chords are in a different order. My point was more simplicity than anything else.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:09:09	Wagon Wheel and Call Me Maybe share the same four chords ad infinitum. One is loved, one needs to go away. Interesting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 08:07:09	@tui_talk Blues, though. Blues.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-17 05:10:38	All I've been doing for the last hour is trying to hold my eyeballs open. Will. Not Sleep. Till. Normal. Bedtime.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-16 21:32:34	I missed the Aurora Australis by a couple of days? Hot damn. Seeing both auroras are definitely on my bucket list.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-16 18:37:05	@pineapplecakes @darthraydor so who's going to hook me up with last week's closer?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-16 09:16:39	Last flight is three hours late. I JUST WANT TO STOP TRAVELING. SOMEBODY MAKE THIS SUNDAY STOP.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-16 08:31:57	@dks2008 definitely not, but I'm very handy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-16 07:25:35	Guys, it's still fucking Sunday. Sunday started 37 hours ago. This is the day that never ended.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-15 13:39:28	@darthraydor we will make this happen sometime. Eventually.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-15 13:38:59	I'm really happy I get to see my bags again in LA. I checked my headphones and my american sim card. Slight problem.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-15 13:32:27	Just a bot of #koruspotting at the auckland airport http:// instagr.am/p/NFwIVnmHml/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-15 12:12:16	@darthraydor no worries! It's better this way, as I have exactly five bucks to my name atm. Have fun with your dad!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-15 11:42:59	@darthraydor so are we doing a meet?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-15 10:45:32	@Belender i've got plenty. Will do!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-15 10:44:03	I've definitely got enough beer to keep me going the four hours till my plane. This is gooooood
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-15 10:40:58	Does anybody know if there's a liquor zone around the auckland airport?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-15 10:39:53	Couldn't fit all my beer in my bag and be under weight allowance, so I guess I just have to sit here and drink it in maccers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-15 09:08:22	Hanging out in the airport next to the Force. Having an internal rugby heart aflutter moment.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 15:33:32	@tui_talk sweet sweet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 15:27:44	@tui_talk it'll take me at least that long to get back to town and over there. Don't hurry on my account though!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 15:18:12	@tui_talk mission unsuccessful. Ack. That's your house number yeah?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 13:22:29	@tui_talk Alrighty! When I get a flight (hopeful thinking!) I'll let her know not to look for me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 13:15:36	@tui_talk have fun with your bestie!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 13:15:12	@tui_talk thank you, thank you!! You're legends. I'll know in about two hours, I think (there are three flights left)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 12:58:03	@tui_talk i'm sorry to ask so last-minute, but it's mostly as an extreme backup plan
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 12:45:12	@tui_talk i'm planning to hit the airport mad early tomorrow morning to do this again if the next couple of flights are full
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 12:44:11	@tui_talk I may not br able to get out pf her tonight. Could I crash on your couch tonight if this doesn't pan out?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 12:42:50	@tui_talk I was going to fly standby up to all, but there were some cancelled flights or something earlier, all the flights are full full
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 12:04:43	All this difficulty, all I can assume is that I'm not supposed to leave Welly. Argh blargh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 11:16:47	@ScotDec unfortunately, most of the middle here in pa is sparsely populated, doesn't require half the infrastructure NJ needs
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 10:46:32	@tui_talk phone still flat? I have a small problemo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 09:28:03	On the hunt for a decent US proxy. Internets, what are your recommendations?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 02:56:10	I have the feeling that this weekend is going to be a long string of truly excellent poor life choices. I like it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 01:57:20	@papagena665 Yes! I really enjoyed Kingdom, once it got it's feet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-14 01:55:36	Miss last bus out of town, spend two hours sitting on the cold pavement waiting for the trains to start. But I made a new friend!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 13:14:21	@tui_talk d'you mind if I ask what your thoughts are on key and his current waitangi kerfluffle?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 13:07:33	@eroconnor that's why I've given up on buying recently-printed copies of gone with the wind. They always fall apart!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 11:45:27	@mmdahlia27 my thoughts exactly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 11:26:08	@tui_talk nah, just tweeting. How was aussie?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 11:25:40	Te Papa gives my inner lighting designer wet dreams. Unf.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 10:24:40	I'm sitting on a bench and just got moved an inch or two sideways by the wind. Typical Welly day, really.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 10:23:07	My absolute favourite spot in town, in contention for my favourite spot on the planet. @Wellington_NZ http:// twitpic.com/a6y80q
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 06:58:42	I don't wanna pack, I don't wanna go home.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 04:02:17	@behrlie this begs the question what non-American athletes would you like to see on the list?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 03:58:59	@samson_today last week of july. We're bringing my cousin up to hang for a bit. NZ is awesome! Cold, very cold, but great!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 03:47:49	@samson_today ahhhh. What for? We go to mount desert island, mom lives there in the summers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 03:43:54	Oh. Oh god. This is why I'm glad I'm not at home for the Sandusky trial. Sweet zombie jesus, this hurts.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 03:37:10	@samson_today how long are you in Maine? Where in Maine? I'll be there in two weeks!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-13 03:28:25	@behrlie this is awesome, but it's just american athletes, not the world. #sigh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-12 20:16:42	The Block NZ is the worst put together reality show I've ever seen, and I'm completely obsessed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-12 20:03:23	Runners! Help me unfuck my knee and keep getting started on the yogging. I've stuffed it up and have no idea how.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-12 19:58:14	@darthraydor I sat at my laptop and cried tears of spaceparents and it was goooooood.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-12 19:54:49	@TeamUfYH loving being in the wrong time zone. I read this and think 'bitch, I just got in!' and then make it again anyway.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-12 19:52:37	@qikipedia thanks for that, captain pedantic.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-12 19:52:05	I was excited to nab @jasperfforde 's new book before I leave, but $40 for a paperback, man. I'll just wait for it in the States. #alas
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-12 07:40:41	I've never been as terrified as I was when I paddled this river at flood. Glad to be taking it on again. http:// twitpic.com/a6kenh

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-11 09:56:26	If I smother myself with aloe for four days I won't have to be horribly sunburnt on a 14 hour plane ride. Maybe? #wishfulthinking
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-11 09:53:49	@stevebragaw welp, there goes that plan to put my sbc degree to good use.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-11 09:44:48	@ENbrian something to do if you ever find yourself back in this part of the world? Hopefully by then it will be more than just one room.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-11 09:42:05	@dks2008 I hate this country. Send ozone or smog please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-11 08:35:17	Shit fuck shit fuck the sun is out for twenty minutes and my ginger ass is already burnt to a crisp.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-10 14:05:35	I can find Penn State everywhere, even at the New Zealand Rugby Museum #weare http:// twitpic.com/a5yzlg
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-10 13:51:01	@ENbrian from what I can tell, it was an inconsequential little thing before the world cup. It's still pretty small, really.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-10 12:05:04	@darthraydor I strategically timed my trip to a brewery to be far away from the internets when shit went down.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-10 11:59:26	Spent the morning at the Rugby Museum and the afternoon on the Tui tour. A blissful unbelievably kiwi day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-10 03:12:12	@brittania_ this is very very good news indeed
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-09 16:54:57	Having my first Tui of the trip in a grotty shower. Gods, if this doesn't bring back the hostel memories.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-09 16:45:34	"Three bloody years in Palmerston North!" made Eric complain. One bloody night is more than enough imho @OFwestside
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-09 16:43:07	@darthraydor and by my way, I mean I'm booked on the worst possible flight- lands 1:30a in dc. Campaigning for the later redye.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-09 16:41:04	@darthraydor thanks, but I'll pass. Enjoy one for me! Knowing the flight gets in 1-.5 h early, five hours. Possibly longer if I get my way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-09 16:33:05	There's something kind of humorously practical about spattering your toilet walls with brown paint.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-09 15:25:41	Road hazards encountered today: sheep, goats, cattle, peacocks. What kind of place is this?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-09 04:55:45	I've joined rush hour traffic except around here rush hour rolls down the beach.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-08 17:04:50	@chidorme occupational hazard, eh?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-07 06:35:45	We booked in for dinner, and then I realized we can stalk the Hobbit wrap party from there #unexpectedwin
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-07 06:34:19	@jasminemdjones in new Zealand. Hanging out with Emma at the moment
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 20:49:14	@jasminemdjones as did my Saturday. Time zones are weird.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 18:25:11	@jasminemdjones girl, friday's almost over! What are you talking about
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 17:24:28	May have just thrown all my scroggin at Richie Macaw's stupid face.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 17:06:09	House full of kiwis and I'm the only person paying attention to the rugby. And I'm hiding because it's too stressful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 16:12:53	Oh how I've missed you, quality rugby.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 12:41:43	There is great irony in this encounter, and the mental judgmental chuckling does not cease.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 12:40:34	Drunk dude shouts at two indian guys (with kiwi accents) for being in his way, then tells me that they should stop letting immigrants in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 12:39:23	Palmerston North will never cease to amaze me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 12:37:41	And we have a road sign warning of 'Facial Excema Risk'. Oh, Palmy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 12:15:23	@tui_talk have they finally opened the airport?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 10:28:21	@darthraydor if I still went for that shit I'd be begging for a care package. That's a brilliant combination.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 09:55:38	@hubbit all these grownup feelings making me feel really fucking old. I was hoping to hold off on that for another decade.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 09:30:21	@hubbit ta! Last time I bawled uncontrollably the entire hour and a half flight to auckland. Today just a couple of sniffles. Less odd looks
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-06 09:22:37	Leaving the bestie for another indeterminate period of time. No heart breaking sobbing with my head on the floor this time. Improvement?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-04 12:10:43	@thejohnsonrule can do. I've been in and out of Welly a bunch of times.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-04 06:22:30	@tui_talk making glorious sinful ribs. But making them in Napier.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-04 06:21:45	@tui_talk grilling happens on a grill. That's why it's called grilling #freedom #andothervariouspatrioticclaptrap

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-04 06:16:06	@tui_talk you grill things, yes, but not this kind of barbecue
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-04 05:17:10	Today's adventure: a Rex attempts to barbecue in a country where barbecue doesn't exist. Also swimming with sharks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-07-04 04:54:48	All set to punch out a delicious freedom feed for my kiwi hosts. If only I had some liquid smoke.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-10 21:59:40	@zestylime Duh. None of them cut quite the comic figure necessary for Lestrade though, at least not to me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-10 21:58:49	@zestylime I can't decide if I like Coulson better as Mrs. Hudson or Lestrade, tbqh

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-09 23:39:12	@mamma_kye so fun fact. You checked in somewhere in Sullivan county, where an old friend of mine used to live...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-09 22:29:43	@madelinead but let me heartily encourage you to try again, especially if you've got a negative blood type.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-09 22:28:24	@madelinead those are the worst. My big one came from an infiltrated vein ob a double red donation- needle in one side, out the other. #ow
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-09 13:19:40	@madelinead I'm actually pretty obsessive about giving blood regularly. My biggest bruise was almost 7" across, small ones don't bother me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-09 13:18:08	@madelinead you should do it again! Just make sure to drink HEAPS of water beforehand and explain to the phlebotimist which vein was trouble
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-09 13:16:15	@thejohnsonrule tbqh the only thing i want from life is ejo reading spaceparents smut.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-08 22:00:09	@pineapplecakes I know. Pope as the leak would be completely not surprising and disappointing as a plot point
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-08 11:16:29	@pineapplecakes I've decided I want Pope to be the leak and go to jail so there can be wonderful Closer/Oz mashups.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 21:53:04	Also I may have just shouted at my books for being so good to make me love them so much. #bibliomaniacproblems

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 21:14:40	I've discovered I can tell you where each of these books came from and if it was a gift. Even the kids books.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 21:12:54	While I cull the book fold I'm calculating how much I've spent on these books. One bookshelf down, $930. No wonder I'm always poor.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 20:25:52	I keep picking up a book and getting a warm flash of the story and how much I liked it and putting it on the keep pile.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 03:24:55	@quarantedeux @roomerholmes @pineapplecakes I was so very confused for a minute there. 10 is good. I can do that. Yes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 03:17:20	@roomerholmes argh blargh the killing takes priority but I'll be on top of it at 10.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 03:16:41	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes great minds, man.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 03:12:49	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes YASS. Please don't tell me it's at 9 and we'll be good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 03:09:04	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes What.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 02:47:29	@pineapplecakes and awesomeness.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 02:43:10	@pineapplecakes yep
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 02:40:48	Headlines I'd never quite dared hope to see in life: CDC Denies Existence Of Zombies Despite Cannibal Incidents http:// huff.to/JRDxjS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 02:40:07	@pineapplecakes idek but it will only get worse once jury selection starts next week.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 02:37:54	@pineapplecakes at least we'll have good football in hell.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 02:37:25	@pineapplecakes some bitch keyed a mad psu car next to mine in the parking lot the other day because of pedos
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 02:36:12	@pineapplecakes nah man i just take out my frustrations on kiddums.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 02:33:32	I can't say I'm ecstatic about McGloin, but at least we've finally got a confirmed, definite quarterback.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-02 02:32:55	@pineapplecakes truth hurts. but it is absolutely trufax.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-01 20:53:23	@chidorme Lolita? Are there enough dresses in Priscilla: Queen of the Desert to count?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-01 20:50:08	@LizCanTweet @chidorme I concur.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-06-01 04:20:08	@tui_talk Yeppers!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-31 12:06:04	@pineapplecakes @thejohnsonrule @shinythings_ I'll be in my bunk.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-31 11:46:41	@tui_talk Duhno either. The only one I hit up was Windy Lindy, and I obvs didn't need housing for that, since I was local.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-31 11:43:24	@thejohnsonrule SAME. This trip may turn into Caitlin-hangs-out-with-internet-friends-all-over-the-damn-place. #topquality
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-31 11:41:27	@tui_talk Would you mind terribly if I took you up on that offer? Because that would be absolutely brilliant.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-31 11:07:32	@tui_talk Is housing a thing for dance weekends in NZ? It's always a thing when I hit them up here, but...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-31 03:28:30	@papagena665 ROCK. ON.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-30 10:59:00	It's really quite entertaining to see which of my kiwi makes are making plans with me. These are not all people I expected. #awesome
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-30 10:55:13	@thejohnsonrule many awesome things will be happening in two weeks and only one of them is getting on a plane to NZ.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-30 10:10:20	Please take this songbook away. Stop me from an encyclopedic knowledge of american folk songs on guitar. Please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-30 09:19:57	Why did you convince me to watch the Killing @ENbrian ? WHY.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-30 08:56:19	@LizCanTweet I love kids movies for exactly this reason.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-30 08:55:06	Imagine if you lived in Agrabah. Why is the sky so dark at noon and HOLY FUCK GIANT SNAKE IN THE PALACE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-30 08:51:09	Jafar had some pretty twisted fantasies for Jasmine, man.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-30 07:25:20	@tui_talk YES! 14 June-15 July. Welly, I'll see you in two weeks asdfjkl; i'm finally coming back.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-30 05:16:08	@tui_talk it is hot and muggy as an old man's hairy geezer balls here right now IS IT NZ TIME YET
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-30 05:13:19	Wow, that hail and severe weather warning was so long it cut off in the middle. I didn't know you could do that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-30 05:11:32	Guys, it's not even June yet. #summer #shitballs http:// twitpic.com/9qqiya
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 18:51:28	@dduane I'll assume I can find a copy of the landing guidelines in the manual as well.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 10:54:56	Found my long-lost VHS of Dark Harbor. Hello, Alan Rickman.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 10:46:35	@zestylime we sell so many of those. and the lamb thing that's very similar. they sound pretty awesome negl
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 10:45:13	@zestylime YES PLEASE. I bought one last christmas at the toysarus because i am a srs grownup and it was SO SOFT http:// twitpic.com/8du8ib
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 10:42:12	@zestylime I had a neon orange stegosaurus which was just like that and I loved it until all the stuffing fell out the giant hole in the leg
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 10:41:20	@zestylime I had this obsession with the way they drew minnie's shoes and bows, so I loved all the minnie things, which only come in pink so
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 10:38:42	@zestylime mine was light green with some form of duck on the wall. nice, simple, not pink until I wanted minnie mouse on my bed at 7.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 10:37:58	@zestylime not considering that if their next kid is a boy they'll be back for a new stroller and high chair and crib and car seat and and
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 10:37:25	@zestylime i rage against this every day. or the parents who have to buy ALL PINK EVERYTHING PINK for their first baby girl
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 10:36:03	@zestylime fuck the parents who were mad razor doesn't make a pro scooter 'for girls'. IT'S BLACK. IT'S GENDER FUCKING NEUTRAL
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 10:32:36	@zestylime i work there. after days like today, I wish I could express that same sentiment.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-29 09:41:03	@brittania_ @pineapplecakes all I want from life is my sweet bb psychopath on my tv.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 22:16:13	@girten09 evidently. I worked Easter too. You want to know something funny? I'm a certified baby consulant now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 22:10:57	@girten09 I'm staring my PhD at Penn State. Biomedical sciences and an MBA, here I come.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 22:09:45	@girten09 I mean, I'm spending my holiday today working at the toysaurus. Not quite the dream yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 22:03:18	@girten09 YEP YEP. New Zealand, new apartment, camp, kitty, PhD! It's awesome when things finally work out right.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:48:37	@girten09 I can't take a kitty till august, but it's fun to start looking now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:48:03	@girten09 Clearly I missed that second Not.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:47:29	@girten09 I'm moving in right across the street from Hershey Park, and just down from Zoo America. Not a good place for an outdoor cat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:47:04	@girten09 She spent the last half hour in my bed. She's still here. But she's an outdoor kitty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:24:12	I feel as though there is some small form of fuckery going on right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:23:39	The local SPCA has pet search based on personality, training, etc. Apparently my best match is a cat which looks exactly like Not My Cat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:22:35	@mamma_kye I'm definitely a cat person. Are there skittish cats?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:21:37	@i_see_the_sea Where are they? I'm looking to get a cat, and I feel like I should get one from a kill shelter, for obvious reasons.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:11:05	@i_see_the_sea I guess who to adopt from? Things to perhaps avoid if you're a first time pet owner?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:10:03	@i_see_the_sea I note that simply because she's currently asleep in my bed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:09:31	@i_see_the_sea i'm not really sure. I've never adopted a pet/ had anything more than a fish before. Well, except my neighbor's cat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 21:05:25	Does anybody have experience adopting pets from shelters? What should I watch put for?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 11:16:28	If the fangirls will do whatever the frumious cumbersnatch says, they'll stop with the @steven_moffat is misogynist nonsense now, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 10:49:22	@thejohnsonrule gtfo my fandom people, and take your cartoon masturbating laura roslin with you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 10:48:41	@tui_talk @cz_nz If I was planning to drive past hastings I guarantee that would have to be a stop, if only just for the lulz.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 10:44:04	@tui_talk I'm pretty sure they are, but if they aren't that will factor into my wandering itinerary.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 10:35:00	@tui_talk hey weird question. The only coasters in NZ are at Rainbow's End, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 10:30:14	(If you can't tell, I'm really excited. Excited to move the fuck out of my parent's house.)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 10:29:15	Also can I just point out what the view from my new apartment will be? Not the Blue Ridge, but it'll do #rollercoasters http:// twitpic.com/9q42bq
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 10:24:21	@tui_talk best idea of all the times for a bathroom window. All the light and none of the peepers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 10:07:43	Settled on my new apartment today! Check dat stained glass. http:// twitpic.com/9q3vba
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 08:31:09	It's really weird hearing about your area on the weather channel.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 08:13:23	Current weather: crash crash boom boom monsoon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 05:15:36	@pineapplecakes it brings me great joy that someone else calls him that too. Although I'm fully in appreciation of his cumnersnatchly face.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 05:13:17	@thejohnsonrule @pineapplecakes asdjaf what kind of fuckery is this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-28 05:10:28	@brittania_ sweet. Jesus. The death is sweet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-27 03:07:50	Temp dropped eight degrees in ten minutes. This is gonna be an incredible storm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-26 19:43:26	Morning guys. Is Cardiff still standing? Pile of embers?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-26 19:41:09	@ENbrian yep, she was one of 'em
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-26 11:56:30	@zestylime these are my feelings exactly. I want to know everything about this Banner, not so much about the other ones.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-26 11:55:50	@zestylime his whole movie was candy. Also, his inability to know what to do with innuendos from the other cast members is wonderful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-26 11:54:47	@zestylime science bros ftw. I haven't slashed anyone is so damn long that the force of my shipping that rather took me by surprise.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-26 11:52:51	@zestylime I was unable to hold back my pleasure at his boxing ass in imax 3d. oh jesus yes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-26 11:52:11	@zestylime science and sexy men and a wild ruffalo with longer hair and did i mention science because that's what really gets a rex going
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-26 11:43:35	@zestylime I wasn't going to ship it. But that yellow shirt gives me SO MANY FEELINGS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-26 11:31:36	In the last hour, I've texted five different people, all of whom are named Liz. Is it the end of the world now?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-26 10:39:27	hide and seek in the dark is a great idea. unless you're unfamiliar with the poison ivy patches. #itchy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 22:29:53	@PennStateFball This will be my first football season as a Penn Stater! I was raised on blue and white, and I'm finally officially family!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 20:06:08	@shewhoisAnna Caffeine is evil. The last time I had a cup of regular instead of decaf on accident I didn't sleep for two days.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 19:56:15	@shewhoisAnna fun fact: I get like this after less than half a cup of regular coffee.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 19:55:22	And it's day one of Caitlin: Substitute Teacher. Bring it on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 11:21:39	My friend just shipped out to Air Force basic. This gives me hope for him. http:// abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics /2012/05/air-force-academy-graduates-first-openly-gay-cadets …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 10:50:00	@LizCanTweet HOLDING. Purely for the accessory feels your tweeting is giving me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 10:42:47	@pineapplecakes kind of madly in love with that show, tbqh. jvdb is the actual greatest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 10:40:53	@pineapplecakes is that on now? I like it on the hulu, but haven't the foggiest when it's actually on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 10:33:54	@tui_talk Hey are you doing tapping the blues?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 10:27:28	@LizCanTweet @mizujada No, but the silence will.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 10:14:43	@shewhoisAnna same. I'm also a big fan of the loosened-collar-when-you're-always-buttoned-up. BIG FAN.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 10:12:49	@shewhoisAnna all of us *le ded* And then there's that bit later on when he starts shouting fuck you fuck you. Unf.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 10:11:29	@LizCanTweet shit. keeping my mouth shut now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 10:08:30	@LizCanTweet Hell in high heels?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 10:03:51	@shewhoisAnna yes yes I remember this one. This was goooood.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 09:56:20	@shewhoisAnna WHAT NO LOS LINKS IMMEDIATELY PLEASE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 09:54:12	@shewhoisAnna that happened at the very height of my hilson/all-slash-all-the-time days. I lost all ability to can.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 09:48:42	@shewhoisAnna truth. All hail st. Doris.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 09:44:25	@shewhoisAnna yes me too. Davis Shore is the king of fanservice, but not that far :(
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 09:39:10	@shewhoisAnna I might have rewatched that bit over and over the first time I saw it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 09:38:35	@shewhoisAnna leave them alone so Wilson can have his bucket list threesome in my bed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 09:36:04	@shewhoisAnna does he get scruffy in last days of disco? I can't remember.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 09:34:41	@shewhoisAnna YES THIS ALL THE RSL SCRUFF PLS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 09:09:40	Next time I start to think I have some semblance of drawing skill, please refer me to the iron man I just submitted to drawsomething
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 08:55:40	You've got mail is the standard to which all romcoms should be held.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 08:05:34	@mizujada @chidorme and by random, I would mean generally optional.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 08:04:57	@mizujada @chidorme yes, yes. Also I have concerns about my ability to do wash regularly when I don't have one right there #sideissue
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 08:02:05	@chidorme @mizujada i get guilted into cleanliness and putting clothing on, things I generally need in life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 07:56:34	@chidorme @mizujada mine has waned significantly since grad school ended, I will admit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 07:53:19	@mizujada @chidorme THIS. This is such truth.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 07:49:36	@chidorme @mizujada my reference is my dark, damp apartment from dc though. This one has high ceilings and is full of light, so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 07:45:23	@chidorme @mizujada otherwise i'll just disappear into my apartment for days on end and that's not so good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 07:44:32	@chidorme @mizujada it was, but it wasn't good for my brain. I either need roommates or a pet which requires actual care.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 07:32:34	@mizujada yeah, but it's two years of living by myself. Not sire how I feel about that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 07:14:29	@ENbrian I'd take it in a second tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 06:51:42	And do I really want to live across the street from Hershey Park. A view of roller coasters would be great but loud in the summer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 06:50:30	STAINED. GLASS. WINDOWS. But a two year lease. Erm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 06:49:16	Seriously, how can you say no to an apartment which come with stained glass windows?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 06:20:15	I can't quantify how much this needs to be in my next apartment -- Blue Canary in the Outlet by the Light Switch http:// shar.es/q2WQP
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 06:18:59	@sarahnathan7 One of these must adorn my next apartment http://www. thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/lig hts/e791/ …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 05:57:55	@chidorme or back to Madame Tussauds'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 05:57:02	@ENbrian At first I thought it might be, what with Mordecai. Absolutely brilliant idea, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 00:43:48	@quarantedeux I do too. Someday, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 00:28:17	@quarantedeux How are you at origami? That could be a fun way to freak other people out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-24 00:26:50	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 @middlemuse I had a great time. I got to spend the morning out of class and DOING MATH. What could be more fun?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-23 23:35:47	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 @middlemuse Clearly I am a complete crazy person.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-23 23:35:33	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 @middlemuse It would be bad to note I took it so cold I didn't know there would be an essay and rather enjoyed myself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-23 22:32:25	@ENbrian I LOVED the hell-type-bureaucracy, though. That should be in all the things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-23 22:31:33	@ENbrian It was, and I can't stomach anything remotely resembling horror because I am a sissy ninny pants.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-23 22:16:25	Cabin in the Woods was unexpected. Bradley Whitford actually plays Josh Lyman in all his roles, doesn't he.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-23 09:54:17	@madelinead I haven't seen it yet! A friend shipped out to basic today, so we were celebrating him instead. Hopefully on demand tomorrow
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-23 06:02:46	@thejohnsonrule clearly you're a brilliant genius.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-23 05:33:49	@thejohnsonrule I get in at 5:30 for about five hours. I don't know actually anything about the layout of LA/proximity to the airport.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-22 10:32:12	@TMarr11 I was thinking more i have no emotional attachment to it, unlike my PnP one. The TNT name is just too awesome to get rid of.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-22 10:25:37	@TMarr11 @mamma_kye @artisus @carinafinn @mmdahlia27 Me too. I love my PnP sign, but I'm pretty sure the ΤΦ one won't last the year.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-18 09:39:42	@roomerholmes I was secretly hoping there might be a easy way to do it. Hard way it is, I guess. Thanks though!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-18 09:38:59	@roomerholmes I can see a plan to get it how I want, but it's a long one. And will take forever. I don't think I care that much tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-18 09:38:08	@roomerholmes I'm also in the midst of a good tate/bad taste/does it really need it argument with myself. This may all be a moot point.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-18 09:35:38	@roomerholmes I'm familiar with animating gifs, so I was planning to take that route

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-18 09:10:36	@shewhoisAnna @pineapplecakes YES PLEASE. I might just have to make sure I pack a tuba. An inflatable one, at the least.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-18 09:00:35	@shewhoisAnna @pineapplecakes I think I'm going to go this year and I have every intention of doing just that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-17 12:47:04	@thejohnsonrule The more pictures of that thing roll in, the more I agree with you. Looks great from the cleavage angle, not from the others

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-15 10:28:16	@madelinead I think it's more cancer story lines which do it to me, but I'm right there with you on that one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-15 10:21:30	@ENbrian That was the first time I shouted, and again when he took her badge. I cannot wait to see where they take this next.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-15 10:05:36	Anybody got a spare bucket around from our Battlestar days for me to put all these #House creys into?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-15 09:45:56	@LizCanTweet I didn't notice it. Nor do I notice what's-his-face's on Fairly Legal. Perhaps because I'm so used to his Aussie from House?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-15 09:44:24	I don't think I can handle much more of this cancer story line. This episode has reduced me to tears twice and it's not over yet. #house

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-15 09:11:55	@shewhoisAnna Still not clear. All signs point to definitely watch this episode even if you don't watch anymore because RSL is magnificent.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-15 09:11:15	@LizCanTweet It's very distracting to watch Jesse Spencer work with an american accent. It doesn't help that his Aussie keeps slipping throu

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-14 21:35:03	@thejohnsonrule Also, fuck inline citations, man. APA has such a raging hard on for them and I hate them with a fiery passion.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-14 21:33:35	@thejohnsonrule the same way, just add a header on every page and insert headings somewhere inside the bullshit. And dates.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 10:09:29	@jasminemdjones if I hadn't lost it so badly there, I'd be right with you. coffee/dinner/whatever soon? I'd love to see your face!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 10:01:54	@jasminemdjones being a grownup is HARD, man.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 09:52:47	That awkward moment when you can't tell if you just made plans with a friend or you're going out on a date.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 09:15:00	Also, grownup Mr. Robinson = cartoon Dr. Wassell. This cannot be unseen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 09:13:02	THEY BOUGHT HIM A PLANETARIUM. I can't make it through this without all the nerdy tears streaming down my face.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 09:10:57	@thejohnsonrule holy shit. Thanks for filling me in on this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 09:08:08	There really isn't an accurate description for how much I love Meet the Robinsons.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 09:04:46	@chidorme I think I scared my advisor at first. "I want to major in biochem, study abroad in New Zealand, oh ny the way Hi I'm Caitlin'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:45:59	@chidorme let's not discuss the hoops I had to jump to go abroad. If I hadn't come with 25 AP credits, never would have happened.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:41:53	@chidorme that may have just been my department, though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:40:44	@shewhoisAnna yeah, me neither. Screw wholock, I want carrolllock.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:39:43	@chidorme they try to talk us out of every non-essential humanities course. Theatre minor? Language? Politics? Heavens forbid.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:37:45	@shewhoisAnna all mimsy were the moriarties and the mome johns outgrabe?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:34:58	@chidorme @Sweetbriaredu that's also a definite point. You can't really minor in a language we don't offer, eh?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:34:09	@chidorme @Sweetbriaredu my problem may have been that I had a science advisor, they're notoriously critical of required LA classes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:30:18	@shewhoisAnna he's the frumious cumbersnatch! His vorpal blade goes snicker-snack
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:26:41	@chidorme @Sweetbriaredu from the beginning I was told a non-SBC language would never be approved and not to even try
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:23:43	@chidorme @Sweetbriaredu first semester, facing an 80-credit major, I wanted to take a lang I already knew but was told to take one at SBC
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:19:57	@chidorme @Sweetbriaredu I took one chem class by consortium; the process was easy but the course itself was horrible.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-09 08:16:58	@chidorme @Sweetbriaredu My advisor put serious effort into dissuading me from doing just that. I'm concerned what students will be offered
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-08 22:43:40	@mmdahlia27 I KNOW RIGHT? RIGHT!?! I'm having so many feelings about that scene and him stopping her at first and ugh this. fucking. show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-08 22:28:34	Only though the grace of David Tennant in leather pants did I make it through that horror movie.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-08 04:26:39	Working at a baby store really drives home the biological certainty that everyone else is having more sex than me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-07 11:43:03	@mizujada true. that. Although we had a pretty averagely cold winter this year. It's just really, really bad for deer ticks 'round here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-07 11:31:15	This year's deer tick count has now ratcheted up to seven. Fuck, do I hate spring.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-07 10:54:38	@mizujada I get equally frustrated when there's a general lack of Wilson on House. It's always the Watson character for me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-07 10:47:28	@mizujada Watson's always my favourite character in any Holmes incarnation. This ep is the one I like the least, probably for this reason.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-04 09:53:38	@chidorme ...i definitely just started writing that graphic novel in my head.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-04 09:43:27	@chidorme I'd end up just getting a microscope, probably. Or lurk in a dark room with viral minions sliding sneakily along the shadows.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-03 06:49:54	@shewhoisAnna not really. It hit way too close to home when I saw it though (right out pf college, no jobs, etc) like St. Elmo's Fire

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-02 19:26:21	@hubbit I saw a few within the past year or two at some small suppliers 'round here. I think some camping manufactures still make a few too
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-02 19:21:20	@hubbit Have you tried hunting supply stores?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-02 10:27:10	@thejohnsonrule my plane tickets put me in LA twice this summer. Obviously this needs to happen.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-05-02 00:52:22	That's about the worst logic I've ever heard. None of the PSU players ever had anything to do with the batshit going down.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-30 18:57:21	@tui_talk it's been so lovely and warm here that I forget it will be winter there and I can't just sit on a beach when I come. #problem
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-30 11:52:39	I should have bowed out before we hit Unfinished Business. I was not prepared for all these spaceparents feels #bsgmarathon
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-30 10:31:53	Those moments when Bill looks at Laura like she's a stone cold straight up crazy botch. #bsgmarathon
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-30 09:56:31	@quarantedeux I felt so bad putting her flawless face on savior, but needs must
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-30 09:52:30	@quarantedeux @hubbit Just tags. My attempt to cut down on the Mary the other day was an epic failure.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-30 09:51:31	This is my fourth group of people I've done a #bsgmarathon with. I have top quality friends.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-30 09:50:06	Previously, on Battlestar Galactica...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-30 01:31:03	@chidorme @mizujada @mmdahlia27 You'd have to be nits to want to do that. ...wait.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-29 11:54:08	Mark Sheppard. Why is your face on every television show ever. #inplainsight
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-29 05:47:16	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux what the hell are you two watching?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-29 05:44:46	@quarantedeux unf.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-29 05:14:23	@quarantedeux I marathoned it like two weeks ago. FLAWLESS.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-29 05:08:58	@quarantedeux bother's all over everywhere these days. I've got three currently airing shows with his face rn.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-29 04:30:48	An interesting idea, but how many 10 year-olds do you know with smoking problems? http:// twitpic.com/9ew3f5
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 23:21:40	@sarahnathan7 God bless technology.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 22:52:35	@zestylime love it. Hope you have as much fun at greenwhite as I did at bluewhite last weekend.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 15:50:37	I don't know why I'm awake, but am I awake enough to go hunt down a stream of the Canes match?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 13:38:58	@pineapplecakes Just take away all the Mary Inspiration Testimonials and give me more whiskey.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 13:37:54	@patrickcarney Are you lamenting that you'll miss it on tour or lamenting that they happen?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 13:37:12	@pineapplecakes just the ones that ship raydor/brenda. A lot of them don't i don't think. Fucked if I know. I'm just here for the Tao tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 13:34:38	@pineapplecakes on the bright side, I can take pleasure that this will piss off wheathertheimafuckwad too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 13:32:44	@pineapplecakes Oh god. There are blingee balloons. The fuck is this nonsense.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 13:31:33	@pineapplecakes Shit son, I haven't checked the tags. This is just from my dash. It's only been an hour!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 13:30:54	@pineapplecakes Also this is why I love you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 13:30:39	@pineapplecakes THANK GOD. May the sweet lords of kobol save us from the Mary fangirls.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 13:29:50	@pineapplecakes Would it be wrong of me to tumblr savior the McD for the next 24 hours?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 12:20:04	That thought I had the other day? The 'I wonder when even the caffeine in chocolate will keep me up' thought? Looks like that day has come.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:26:47	@shewhoisAnna Unless they're bad subtitles. Then you can mock the subtitler.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:26:09	@shewhoisAnna oooo? How so?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:24:50	@shewhoisAnna My brain goes into fits trying to figure out what language it should be thinking in and I just give up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:24:25	@shewhoisAnna I don't know enough to not need them, but I know enough to be able to half follow what they're saying...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:23:21	@shewhoisAnna I love films with subtitles. Unless the film is in spanish.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:18:56	@shewhoisAnna Ooooh that's a good double feature. I'm definitely stealing that idea.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:15:18	@shewhoisAnna I remember that week. It's all a haze of dark rooms and booze and a stuffed robot. That was a good marathon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:13:50	@shewhoisAnna I just want to bang him, tbqh. Brainy and beautiful. Unf.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:13:11	@shewhoisAnna I do the same thing. It's almost perfectly tailored to my interests by now, and it drives her nuts.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:10:26	@shewhoisAnna I'm totally starting an IPS Netflix binge. Riiiiiiiiiiiiiight.....now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:09:48	@shewhoisAnna I know right? Last season when he threw himself over her during the gunfire and not Abigail? Classic.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:09:05	@shewhoisAnna The internet is calling you. It wants you to download things. Give in. Listen to the voices.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:06:46	@shewhoisAnna Gaius H. Christ woman. Not another show. Yeah, the promo is Marshall telling Mary he loves her. FUCKING FINALLY.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 11:04:16	ASDFJKL KEYSMASH KEYSMASH Why would you tease that moment in the promo. That's the only thing I wanted to happen in the finale #inplainsight
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 10:04:23	@jasminemdjones i'll keep my eyeballs peeled
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 09:55:02	@jasminemdjones I could totally be talked into that. I need to get the hell out of York
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-28 08:55:28	I'm awake. Did Cincy draft Still? Do I finally have a Penn Stater in the draft?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 23:01:29	@quarantedeux yeahhhh diggity. I'm joining a rugby team in the fall, now I gotta actually get fit. Eek.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 21:36:43	I'd love to know why the job site thinks I'd be a great high school sports content producer. The rest of these are chemist jobs. #what
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 21:23:50	@jdjackson Would you be less disappointed if DeCastro had gone to someone other than the Steelers?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 21:18:47	@jdjackson I think it was a good move. They'll get more high quality depth this way (and it pains me to say good things about the Ravens)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 21:13:39	I came in under 200lbs today. I haven't seen that since..2009? FUCK YES, GUYS. FUCK YES.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 11:06:06	Wilson? Not what I was expecting. Interesting
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 11:02:09	I'm genuinely interested to see who the Giants pick. It's weird to care about the Giants. What is going on?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 10:45:10	@tui_talk I've been doing it since 2008. Only time it gets weird is the month inbetween our switches in DST.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 10:31:18	Take a Mercilus, draft a B1G, make a Rex happy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 10:28:11	Blah blah quality not quantity who cares it's the Pats. NEXT PLEASE.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 10:11:52	@zestylime @roomerholmes Quietly seething right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 10:08:41	@pineapplecakes @kyrasedgwick can't let quality drop off tv without a proper sendoff
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 09:50:35	I always forget San Diego actually has a footbawl team.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 09:32:36	@roomerholmes What a waste of an excellent WR.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 09:30:37	I missed something. Why is Kolb trending?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 07:01:27	@madelinead start telling them stories about your cats. With pictures.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 06:50:30	@zestylime DO WANT. Sweet baby jesus, does that need to happen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-27 06:49:17	Not My Cat's been asleep on the sofa for hours. Didn't even budge for hamburgers. I don't have the heart to tell her she doesn't live here.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-26 11:28:40	@shewhoisAnna ON IT.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-26 11:28:26	@shewhoisAnna Heh. I usually don't give something up, I try to make myself a better person- last year was doing the dishes every day
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-26 11:25:50	@shewhoisAnna NIIIIICE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-26 11:18:12	@shewhoisAnna I'm terrified of the NFL draft tomorrow for the exact same reason.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-26 11:14:52	@shewhoisAnna I gave up swearing. I failed pretty spectacularly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-26 11:14:08	@shewhoisAnna Although I'm really only a Caps fan because sometimes they call up Bears to play.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-26 11:13:30	@shewhoisAnna ME TOO. jfc where has a lime been keeping you all this time. (although I'm a slight caps fan)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-26 11:10:12	@shewhoisAnna I don't think so. I just hadn't realized the season was over already.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-26 11:07:38	Wait. That was the last new @UglyAmericans ? Well suck my balls, that sucks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-26 11:07:08	A remote cabin miles from civilization? A maniac would never think to look for us there! #uglyamericans

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 23:41:25	@madelinead There are a very few which are dangerous at an early stage. But thymomas are not. They have like a 90% survival rate

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 23:06:09	@madelinead I know right? But thymomas are the opposite of dangerous for the most part. I don't get this super-deadly-stage-two-cancer thing
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 23:04:23	I guess I'll never be done fighting with the SBC registrar. Argh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 11:22:23	Seems I'm regressing tonight, curled up with a flashlight and the gameboy I unearthed today. Non-backlit screen hurts the eyes. I feel old.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 10:16:54	@papagena665 Classiness at its finest, I expect.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 09:09:38	O Brother, Where Art Thou is one of my favourite movies. Now if only it would reminding me of Dr. Tamburr and making me a little sad.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 08:53:49	@mizujada @madelinead @ljsgecko unf. Yes indeed. Also the Peabody library.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 05:13:52	@quarantedeux I shall consider it starting a slightly early birthday present myself. Hooray!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 05:12:23	@brittania_ bought. Do want do want dooooo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 03:14:24	@pineapplecakes @roomerholmes bahahaha

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 01:08:44	@pineapplecakes OSU-PSU is a night game this year. Cue great excitement on my part.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 00:44:27	@mizujada I'm already madly in love with the google play music thing. Bring me storage too? Yes please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 00:14:41	@papagena665 Have you seen the promo for next week? I wonder if I can turn off my science brain to suspend disbelief for an hour...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 00:13:47	@papagena665 they could have at least picked something with some danger to it! All his poignant I dont want to die scenes will just anger me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 00:11:47	@papagena665 Unless you're 85 and already near death's door or it's invaded to your brain (so, stage 3/4) you're going to be just fine.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 00:10:17	@papagena665 But it's a stage two thymoma. I mean really. They're rarely malignant and easily treated with surgery and a small bout of chemo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 00:09:32	@papagena665 All my science is making this hard. I want to be terrified and wallow in what will undoubtedly be a phenomenal performance
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 00:08:02	She was so excited when I walked up. I don't usually take literature before I vote, but I felt bad. She looked so bored.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-25 00:07:15	You know you live in a conservative small town when there's one person at the polling place with leaflets for all the democratic canditiates
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:26:01	@shewhoisAnna I KNOW RITE? Also the Hotel is beautiful and art deco in the best possible way. And there's a brewery right down the hill now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:22:33	@shewhoisAnna It's also downwind of Hershey sometimes. On a good day it's like chocolate heaven.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:21:05	@shewhoisAnna Although I'm moving to Hershey in a few months, where I expect to put on 10 pounds just by smelling the chocolate air.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:20:34	@shewhoisAnna YES IT IS. I'm south of Harrisburg (basically in Maryland), but we're scattered all over Hershey/Lebanon/Amish Country
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:17:07	@shewhoisAnna WAIT WHAT. What is this small world?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:16:03	I can't wait to see what resolves out of the clusterfuck of people running for congress in this district. Tomorrow shall be exciting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:14:56	Hey fellow Pennsylvanians! Don't forget to go vote tomorrow, and be sure to bring along ID!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:06:16	I'm unclear why you would think it's a good idea to send campaign calls out at 11:00 at night, even if it is the primary tomorrow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:05:24	@shewhoisAnna we had a fistfight on black friday which nearly avoided turning into an all-out brawl. I'll take the much-welcome break.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:03:24	@zestylime That's what tumblr (and by tumblr I mean @brittania_ ) was saying, so I jumped on the Who bandwagon. #excellentchoices
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:02:41	@shewhoisAnna Like I said, it's not hard to figure out. Plus christmas is over, all the crazy batshit people won't come out till the fall.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:01:49	@shewhoisAnna @zestylime Wilson's face with the spinny blood machines lost me a couple days of tears.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:00:38	@shewhoisAnna To the point that you're not allowed to list it as an employer in your facebook job-information-box-place
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 11:00:11	@shewhoisAnna There are very, very few toy retailers out there, and we're not to mention it by name anywhere on social media, so it's hard.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:59:18	@shewhoisAnna @zestylime All these people were talking about River, and I wanted to know what the fuck all the nonsense was about.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:58:47	@zestylime @shewhoisAnna B L E S S. That rocks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:58:13	@zestylime @shewhoisAnna I've only gotten mom onto 11, but Dad's chimed in for bits of my 10 watching. I started with 11, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:57:08	@zestylime @shewhoisAnna Me too. But now that I love her her whole story is better from start to bus death.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:55:49	@shewhoisAnna YES PLEASE. I would rage more about mine at the toy store, but they're hyper-vigilant about social media, so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:54:29	@shewhoisAnna @zestylime Good woman. I've done in a few months what my father couldn't do in 30 years and turned mine into a whovian (yess)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:52:14	@shewhoisAnna @zestylime There is never an end to Leemo jokes. That well is bottomless and ever-eating.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:51:00	@zestylime @shewhoisAnna I wanted cameron for her vests tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:50:22	@shewhoisAnna @zestylime there was a lot of it floating around at the time. I think I ended up with one on audiobook maybe?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:49:36	@shewhoisAnna @zestylime Although I did enjoy early New Team. At least the boys, anyway. Kutner vs. Taub was lots of fun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:48:28	@shewhoisAnna HI NEW FRIEND.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:47:29	@shewhoisAnna @zestylime The only good thing about that arc was the truly inventive Hilson-get-married-to-not-have-to-testify fic.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:45:15	@shewhoisAnna @zestylime THE NET IN THE KITCHEN. Which wasn't season two but still Wilson's hopeful face.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:43:45	@shewhoisAnna @zestylime The pranks, guys. Dem pranks. And the poker night episode? Season two was so good to us.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:41:48	@shewhoisAnna @zestylime An hour of RSL on anything (speed, cocaine, a bed of furs) will make me happy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:40:55	@zestylime @shewhoisAnna eaurgh no thank you please. I thought I wanted it and then it happened and it was awful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:40:14	@shewhoisAnna @zestylime I will be perfectly fine living in the first couple of seasons from here on out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:36:52	@madelinead getting spoiled is the worst, man. I'm glad you said something, though. I thought I was the only one still watching House.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:35:52	@zestylime I feel the same way. This season started out good, got bad again, but I'll pay rapt attention to anything Wilson-centric.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:32:38	@zestylime cackling.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:29:20	@zestylime slash I will be a motherfucking mess the whole way though this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:28:53	@zestylime Wilson's the only one I have any kind of emotional investment in/the hots for. Cannot WAIT to see what he does with this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:28:11	@zestylime CREYS A GALACTICA FOR MY FUCKING CREYS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:18:46	@madelinead I'm really looking forward to what will doubtless be a very juicy storyline and will earn said actor All The Awards. How's that?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:17:46	@madelinead That's all I'm saying. I try not to live tweet the things ya'll watch too, but I had to say something.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:16:22	@pineapplecakes I SAID WHAT WHAT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 10:04:34	Sweet. Zombie. Jesus. I guess I'll spend the last few episodes of House bawling my eyes out then. Hell, the promo is making me tear up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 09:40:46	Unlike the last several episodes, this one is seriously lacking in fountains of fake blood. #house
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 07:01:02	Cat, I hope for your own sake that that isn't crab rangoon filling all over your fur.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 06:29:27	I'm looking at you, @governorcorbett . Your voice has left three messages on the machine in the last couple of hours.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-24 02:57:03	The sheer number of bible movie torrents I've just stumbled upon is staggering. What Would Jesus Pirate?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-23 22:57:46	@hubbit I have never seen so many mennonites so happy about something other than a major holiday before.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-23 22:55:20	@hubbit All the guys down at the market this morning could talk about was how happy they were it only snowed in northern PA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-23 09:59:03	I cannot wait for the primary election tuesday, if just to make these horrible attack ads go away for a few months.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-23 09:42:58	"Don't vote for him because he's a dodgy bastard. Don't vote for this other guy because he coted for Obama." Great comparison, guys.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-23 09:29:34	@pineapplecakes yaaaaaaay

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-22 10:43:42	@mamma_kye fun fact: i met her while i was doing the lights for my high school's musical. her son was on sound.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-22 10:43:09	@mamma_kye SBC '86, first name melinda last name phillips
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-22 10:28:49	@mamma_kye It was a vera bradley bingo, definitely to be expected. Alas, I've met the only other SBC alum in the area (she was PnP!)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-22 10:08:54	@tui_talk I WAS SO CONFUSED.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-22 10:08:37	@tui_talk shit, i thought you were talking about the rugby. north american teams playing now makes perfect sense.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-22 10:04:24	@tui_talk they're playing this early? wow.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-22 07:07:49	The old women next to us have a quarter keg in an oxygen tank cover. These are obviously bingo professionals.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-21 12:21:40	@GerryBM Noted. I work at the toysaurus, I'm planning to steal empty boxes from there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-21 12:20:50	@ENbrian There's a good reason I call it my library. I think I even had a dedicated loaning-out notebook at one point.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-21 12:14:43	@ENbrian If I kept just a fifth of my library, I'd still have about 120 books left. Probably more. ...actually, that might be doable. Hmmmm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-21 12:12:58	@ENbrian I just had a minor panic attack at that thought.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-21 12:01:25	@tui_talk is this #undisclosedcharacter perhaps running for some form of public office?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-21 11:53:53	@GerryBM I think I'm only at about 600 books and they're mostly paperbacks (yay). It'll be the scad of science texts which will defeat me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-21 11:50:18	@smlindemann If you can figure out how to stop, let me know. Also sell it after that, you'd make a fortune.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-21 11:43:43	I've finally come to the realization that when I move this summer I'll finally have to move my library, too. HELP. TIPS PLEASE.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-21 05:27:59	@zestylime @roomerholmes it sucks you in, man. I watched the Mary episodes and then a whole extra season for Mark Greene gettin' dead. Oops

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-20 21:50:39	@thejohnsonrule SAHWEET. Prolly just watch it with other CNS depressants (anti psychotics, alcohol, other sleep drugs) as with any sedative
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-20 21:10:29	Somehow, it seems appropriate that a majority of @brianblessed 's tweets are in caps.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-20 19:47:20	@thejohnsonrule It was really common once for surgery, I think. I just know it as an old class of analgesics, replaced by the modern stuff.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-20 19:43:23	@thejohnsonrule Erm. It's a sedative and a mild analgesic? Also pretty sure it's a hypnotic, too. I think they use it to treat the DT's.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-20 04:19:06	@ljsgecko THAT IS SO AWESOME. They've really kept the school vibe, I'd love to keep a few of the features but make it primary residential
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-20 04:15:26	@ljsgecko I had to go get fingerprinted today, they're in the old high school which rebuilt outside the city. All that space got me thinking
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-20 04:13:33	@ljsgecko Oh, nice! What happened to the rest of the school?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-20 04:06:44	Those massive walls of windows in classrooms would make such an awesome design feature
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-20 04:04:51	I guess I know what I'll be spending my evening working on. Public school blueprints, here I come.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-20 04:04:07	What if we could repurpose old schools into residential spaces. WHAT IF.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-20 03:47:08	@ljsgecko It's a pity those are so bad, because @jasperfforde 's Shades of Grey is absolutely phenomenal. I fear bad associations, though.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-17 00:33:13	@hubbit @quarantedeux that is funnier than I could ever tell you. NZ is a wonderful place which clearly has excellent emigration priorities
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-17 00:28:59	@hubbit @quarantedeux 'I think I'll move to New Zealand?'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-17 00:23:05	@hubbit @quarantedeux the poor, deluded little boy. Why would you ever want to move to Aussie?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-17 00:18:50	@pineapplecakes I want to do an epic unfuck of my habitat before I settle in i think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-17 00:12:46	@pineapplecakes I give myself a week before I bust out the photoshop again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-17 00:12:13	@pineapplecakes i'm baaaack. Hope somebody saved my seat for me.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-16 08:46:24	@ENbrian Holder's not dirty. He can't be dirty. Tell me he's not dirty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-16 08:44:41	@mizujada which explains why he turned up at my front door to meet me personally, I guess.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-16 08:44:06	@mizujada He said it's because I've voted in four of the last five primaries. According to the internet it's someone guaranteed to vote.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-16 08:25:55	Even more fun fact: I learned this when one of the dems running for congress stopped by to meet me. #whatismylife
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-16 08:24:37	Fun fact: around here, among registered democrats, I'm the youngest super voter by well over a decade. #strange #alsowhatisasupervoter

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-16 07:32:23	@ENbrian pretty sure I'll be caught up tomorrow. Why's it gotta be on the same time as the good wife?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-16 07:30:18	@ENbrian absolutely. This is so twisted in the best possible way. Give me all the dark and twisted tv, please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-16 07:28:23	@ENbrian thankfully all of season two so far is on demand. ON IT.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-15 10:32:21	@pineapplecakes as a proud perpetrator of massive fucking tits, let me just say- back problems. Ugh.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-14 11:19:23	@ENbrian I can definitely see that. He's pretty excellent.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-14 10:17:03	@tui_talk You hit it right on the nose. Really I'm all about the Bears, but they're AHL, so...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-14 10:13:33	@tui_talk Haha I mostly roll for the Caps (some Bears play for them on occasion), but around here it's hard to not be a Flyers fan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-14 10:06:18	@tui_talk please tell me you're a flyers fan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-14 09:59:50	@tui_talk then again, science may be better for that though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-14 09:59:21	@tui_talk I love when we play in south africa. Matches are at noonish, I just pop 'em in my ear and keep working.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-14 09:53:59	@tui_talk I love you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-14 09:53:20	@tui_talk I KNOW RIGHT. Also time zones. Time zones are hard. I don't want to get up at 3am to watch a match.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-14 09:49:30	@tui_talk this sounds like me and my attempts to watch the rugby

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-13 08:27:50	@zestylime i just. don't. get it. Netflix used to be so good with the recommendations. Now I'm just confuzzled.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-13 08:20:31	@tui_talk I haven't fully realized how bad it could have been, but I'm perfectly fine, so I guess I knock on wood and thank my lucky stars?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-13 08:19:29	@tui_talk It definitely was. I'm not kidding, almost 20 doctors turned up at first based on the potential hazards on the MSDS.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-12 22:48:19	@ENbrian they gave me oxy and an eyepatch. There is only one outcome in that situation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-12 22:47:19	@tui_talk i'm good. Some minor skin burns on my eyelid, but my eyes should be fine once the irritation drops.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 10:35:11	@ljsgecko I'm in the same boat. We shall persevere.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 10:14:17	@papagena665 haha that's my reaction to most things I watch on hulu. I watched a show for two seasons without any idea when it aired
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 09:22:56	@papagena665 clearly I need to investigate this for myself. When is it on?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 09:17:02	@papagena665 ooooooh. Now I can get behind that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 09:16:32	@papagena665 you're the first person i've heard say that, tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 08:58:41	Photo: › occurred to me the other day you’ve been gone now a couple years but then i guess it takes awhile... http:// tmblr.co/Z60JHyI_qwKp
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 08:38:58	@papagena665 would you recommend starting once upon a time at the beginning, or farther in?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 08:33:13	@papagena665 @LizCanTweet i've been told it's great, but super frustrating if you're a big Fables fan. I'm not sure yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 08:30:11	@papagena665 @LizCanTweet @mizujada that shows based very heavily on Fables. Such quality stories.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 08:20:58	@LizCanTweet @mizujada if you think that you should read Fables. Snow White is fabulous.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 06:20:01	@tui_talk we'd likely revolt if you took our work away
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 05:08:48	@thejohnsonrule you're welcome to study my anatomy any time
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 05:01:12	@tui_talk yup. Our store is open Easter Sunday. I'm scheduled to work a full shift. Argh blargh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 04:55:41	@tui_talk we live to work. Plain and simple.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 04:54:42	@tui_talk we had it at catholic school, but we tend to shy away from overtly religious holidays here tbqh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 04:53:24	@tui_talk Nope. Some places will give you easter Monday, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-03 04:05:17	Bossman you did not just reprimand me for following established chemical safety guidelines following exposure to a hazardous chemical #itson
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-02 20:22:50	Did I just (very poorly) draw BLJ as a drawsomething clue for @thejohnsonrule? Maybe.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-02 20:19:06	@Alancumming @stephenfry I have that desire every day of my life. Well, the ale in Welly part anyway.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-02 10:29:06	@ZombiesRunGame I backed the kickstarter, and I'm a bit frustrated. Anything more specific you can tell us about the Android version?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-02 09:54:12	@ljsgecko Hooray! Such excellent literary choices
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-02 09:35:10	Nothing like paying international calling rates to sit on hold.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-02 08:52:50	@WNRSfm @poorerthandead it brings me so much joy that my time slot is now occupied by professors
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-02 00:19:38	Thin Mints are people food, not cat food. Silly kitty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-01 21:36:48	You would not believe how much the cat is judging me right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-01 21:31:13	@roomerholmes we used to shout WITF in the halls of high school. they're a pretty average public radio, unfortunately.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-01 11:52:20	a long day at work us made much better by a warm kitty and castle
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-04-01 00:32:27	Camp people are my favourite people. Even just planning camp makes my whole week better :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 10:05:32	There's nothing which will get me excited for an early bedtime like the promise of Camp people in the early morning. Five months!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 09:06:36	@mizujada @ljsgecko and mire often than not, they're quite a stretch and add nothing to the story.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 09:05:19	@mizujada @ljsgecko my frustration is more with YA as a whole. Ever since HP, it seems every series has to have an epilogue
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 09:04:23	@ljsgecko true. And this epilogue was definitely warranted/well done. Typically they're horrible mary sues.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 08:42:58	"He also called me a yellow-skinned peking duck fucker." Ted West is all class. #outrageous
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 08:24:32	"All babies love animals! They're equally stupid!" #outrageous
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 08:01:11	Aaron Spiller you are the greatest hopeless creep of all time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 07:19:15	@ljsgecko oy. I don't need a happily ever after. The Giver just ended with a Thing happening. Let me wonder. Give me some room to think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 07:08:10	Why does there always have to be an epilogue? Do we not just end stories anymore? #mockingjay
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 01:01:28	@pineapplecakes and just like that, feelings ERRYWHERE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 01:00:06	@eroconnor hooray flakes! I'm going back to NZ thus summer, I intend to stock up on all forms cadbury when I come back.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 00:58:23	@roomerholmes which makes it all the more exciting
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-31 00:58:06	@roomerholmes I put the pdf on my phone last night, i'm doing the same thing in between experiments. I haven't been spoiled for this one yet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-30 13:08:56	To start #Mockingjay tonight? I want more story, but I really don't want to put on clothes to go through the house to get it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-30 13:05:51	@roomerholmes I feel as though we're reading these on the exact same schedule. I'm having an internal debate to start mockingjay tonight
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-30 09:38:55	@thejohnsonrule although, to be fair, I didn't draw a helix. I drew the sugar-phosphate backbone and the bases.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-30 09:36:58	@thejohnsonrule i even wrote double helix. some people just can't handle their science.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-30 09:35:26	@thejohnsonrule I got DNA once, so I drew the chemical structure from memory. The other person immediately deleted the game
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-30 09:31:57	@thejohnsonrule also, I have a tiny screen and no apparent drawing skills. it's on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-30 09:25:55	@thejohnsonrule clearly my phone is lacking in games with you
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-30 02:43:23	I'm beginning to suspect my boss is on a mission to buy every broken DNA synthesizer on the east coast. Current total:12
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 21:58:50	And what will I do with my time, you may ask? The looks on their faces when I said full-time toy retail were too priceless for words.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 21:56:48	Have officially put in my notice at horrible scientist day job. Three senior scientists down, one to go.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 13:25:13	ANCHORMAN 2. I am 72 percent sure that I love this news.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 12:51:38	I can't remember the last time I read a book in one sitting. Now all I want to know is how did it take me so long to read these?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 10:57:29	@sarahnathan7 informing you of potential disturbances is all part of the service, ma'am.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 09:59:22	@roomerholmes i just got to that part. Why all these feels so soon?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 09:58:31	@LizCanTweet It was fun :) How times have changed, though. They played in DC last year and I never even considered going.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 09:37:39	@LizCanTweet the best i've seen was when they played with the baltimore symphony (same tour). Or when I got to go onstage in raleigh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 09:36:35	@LizCanTweet my obsession, it is long and it is hard.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 09:34:39	@LizCanTweet more than that, they played with the philly philharmonic. Would have been summer of 07
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 09:33:33	Have finally retrieved the book from underneath the cat. Time to start some hunger gamin'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 09:28:45	@LizCanTweet not quite Virginia. Raleigh and DC and Philly were my solo shows, I think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 09:21:34	@LizCanTweet you know, I went to three decemberists concerts alone while I was at the Briar. NOW I find people to go with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 09:19:55	@LizCanTweet heeeeeeere she comes in her palanquin
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 09:18:21	I was going to start reading the Hunger Games, but then this happened. http:// twitpic.com/92mpg2
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-29 05:06:16	Attn @sarahnathan7 : @BBCAmerica Hosts a LIVE Cook-off in NYC’s Flatiron District Tomorrow http:// bbcamerica.tumblr.com/post/200772932 82/bbc-america-hosts-a-live-cook-off-in-nycs …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-28 22:52:45	@mmdahlia27 I just. THIS SHOW. I didn't know I liked it this much. It's just wormed its way into my brain and gotten comfy there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-28 22:50:21	A friend of mine joined a cloistered convent several years ago. People posting happy birthdays to her wall will never stop being funny.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-28 20:13:11	@tui_talk That show is such a tease. A TEASE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-28 04:22:02	Putting an @bearmccreary station on the work Pandora was a terrible idea. Having all the feelings at the lab bench is not such a good thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-28 00:48:21	@quarantedeux true that. By now it'd be too much hassle to try and separate everything out, so roll with it I shall.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-28 00:44:40	@quarantedeux it helps that many of my irl friends are big into fandom. Like @mizujada . I chuckle a little when ya'll tweet at each other.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-28 00:41:55	@quarantedeux uh oh. What for? I'm mostly okay with how it's all fallen out, although I definitely tend to edit my fannishness.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-28 00:35:10	@quarantedeux I wish when I'd joined Tumblr I'd realized what it could be. I'd already spread it all over irl when I fell back into fandom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-27 11:29:16	@mizujada she didn't come out until i'd put half my bag of emergency treats on the floor.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-27 11:17:40	@mizujada the real problem here is she's not my cat. I have to put her out soon, but I can't get close without getting savaged.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-27 11:16:42	@mizujada i'm getting death growls from under the coffee table.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-27 11:09:32	I just tossed the cat. I was flailing so much in frustration at @Castle_ABC that I tossed. The. Cat. What even is my life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-27 02:56:01	@melissaeramos clearly we need to chat an commiserate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-27 02:41:45	I feel like I'm living How-Not-To-Run-A-Biotech 101.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-27 02:40:43	I've been here six months and there's only one other person still here who was here when I started. And we're both leaving within the month.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-27 02:39:14	There were four senior scientists, then three, now just two. It's fascinating watching this company fall apart in front of me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-26 20:46:38	Really explains a lot about me. RT @qikipedia : The Slinky is the official State Toy of Pennsylvania.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-26 10:16:37	You can't end there! I want to see Alicia verbally eviscerate Jackie and then throw a punch! @TheGoodWife_CBS you're such a tease.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-26 09:29:15	"You're the woman? I'm the black." As usual, @TheGoodWife_CBS hits it right on the nose.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-26 09:19:01	Is there a twitter savior? I want to avoid the Mad Med 'till tomorrow
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-26 09:11:39	@LizCanTweet That's the beauty of Rory, let's be real.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-26 09:08:01	@LizCanTweet That's one of my favourite quotes form the entire episode.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-26 09:07:38	@LizCanTweet HELLOOOOOO BENJAMINS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-26 09:05:44	@LizCanTweet GINGERS. TRUE EXCELLENCE. (I'm not biased in the slightest.)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-26 08:06:05	@stephenfry milford sound will leave you pining for the fijords, but hopefully not demised.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-26 08:04:10	@madelinead most brilliant plan of all time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-25 22:32:06	A lazy sunday morning in bed with a kitty and back episodes of Castle. Just what the doctor ordered.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-25 11:31:57	I'm not up late putting @coldwarkids songs into sign language expression. Nooooooo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-25 01:57:02	@quarantedeux my favourite part is where they find something already abandoned and compare it to their theories.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-25 01:48:57	@quarantedeux I mean, it's a show of speculation. I like that they don't say why all the people disappeared just tackle the science of decay
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-25 01:46:00	@quarantedeux thoughts on life after people?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-25 01:44:16	@quarantedeux post-apocalyptic practicality, rather.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-25 01:43:27	@quarantedeux I LOVE THAT SHOW i'm such a sucker for post-apocalyptic realness.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-25 01:28:49	SEASON SEVEN, GUYS. THE TRAILER. FLAILING.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 20:45:30	@witzseeker everything hurts but in the best possible way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 10:59:28	@thejohnsonrule Clearly it is :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 10:58:38	YESSSS @thejohnsonrule work it woman.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 10:54:43	@mizujada @chidorme I don't get it either. BSG taught me no character will be perfect, but take all the female awesome when you can get it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 10:52:42	@mizujada @chidorme I want to make everyone sit down and watch Jekyl and tell me he doesn't write amazing women. *le sigh*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 09:46:38	@thejohnsonrule whoop?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 09:46:21	@mizujada @chidorme it bled over into sherlock as well. I think his women are fantastic, personally.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 09:39:05	@chidorme @mizujada aka. fandom deciding they hate moffat and everything he does ever is super sexist.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 07:55:02	@roomerholmes Rocks for normal, but there's a place that makes killer frozen blood orange ones. All depends on what you're putting in it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 07:53:24	@quarantedeux Now I want margaritas. Me gusta.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 07:50:27	@quarantedeux ahahaha fair.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 07:48:14	@quarantedeux @roomerholmes So do you have a salt replacement for doing body shots, or...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 07:46:50	@roomerholmes @quarantedeux How do you maragarita without salt? For that matter, how do you tequila without salt?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-03-24 07:37:16	So I guess I've rediscovered photoshop, then.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-23 02:59:07	@eroconnor this begs the all-important question, which cadbury's is your favourite?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-22 20:35:17	@GerryBM I was at one point, but I graduated two years ago.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-22 10:34:54	@LizCanTweet @mizujada @chidorme I'm rubbish at giving things up, so I usually try to do something (the dishes every day, etc) instead.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-22 10:01:29	I think I'm going to try giving up swearing for lent. I'll never make it, but it's the effort, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-22 05:09:14	@jdjackson I guess they're not choosing civility then.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-22 05:08:51	@jdjackson bahahahaha
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-22 00:42:33	@quarantedeux i'm kind of surprised Georgetown hasn't tried that angle yet. Gotta love 'em though

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-21 10:44:41	@mamma_kye one of my very favourite episodes. The lorry challenge is one of the few which rank above it

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-20 10:59:35	@hubbit I do so love doing light design though. One giant puzzle, really.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-20 10:58:07	@hubbit I wanted to be an architect almost the whole time I was little. I still think it would be fun, sometimes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-20 10:29:25	@hubbit i'm doing the light design for a local high school's musical. My plot is for where i'm going to put all the lights.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-20 08:32:59	@hubbit I wish. This light plot is a nightmare to do by hand.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-13 11:04:56	After all these years of student poverty, the concept of bi-weekly paychecks is still something to marvel at.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-13 02:28:09	WE'RE GONNA HAVE A THREE-WAY WITH THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE #sweetjesusyes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-12 11:44:35	@pineapplecakes can it go away yet?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-12 09:49:52	@dks2008 Just left work. Gutted I missed the fun :(
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-11 22:03:12	This hotel is full of PA high school wrestlers. So many bare feet and mullets at breakfast. #saveme
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-11 11:16:27	Best interview yet, guys. #hopes #ihasthem

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-10 07:52:07	@tui_talk Ta, love. SO EXCITED. ALSO SO TERRIFIED.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-10 07:51:44	@hubbit Ah, thanks! This is the interview I want the most/am most terrified for. #knockonwood
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-10 07:51:04	@hchatt10 mine is an evil laugh of premeditation of my evil deeds.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-10 07:45:07	Also, I should like to note it's really lovely to not need GPS or a map of any kind to get to the PhD interview. #averynicechangeindeed
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-10 04:25:17	I have never been so excited for a PhD interview. EEEEEEEE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-08 11:30:50	@brittania_ are you still looking for book recommendations?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-08 11:13:26	@brittania_ the frumious cumbersnatch only does it for me in sherlock hair. the ginge just doesn't cut it. as a ginge I find this unsettling
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-07 11:04:07	@thejohnsonrule yesssss
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-07 11:02:38	Castle and 1940's. I am a very very happy Rex.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-07 10:55:38	@thejohnsonrule the sound that just came out of my mouth was inhuman. DO WANT RIGHT NOW.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-07 10:51:52	@thejohnsonrule I particularly love drinking on rooftops
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-07 10:51:38	@thejohnsonrule eesh. okay, A++ location, though. I looooooove rooftops.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-07 10:42:57	@thejohnsonrule i don't know that I have words for how badly i want to trade with you right now
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-07 08:38:29	This time three years ago, I was in a plane to Aotearoa. *sniffle*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 12:24:39	@dks2008 the rugby starts soon! definitely good for filling the football gap.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 11:09:54	@dks2008 it's peanut butter ruby time, yo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 10:56:58	@brittania_ @pineapplecakes DO WANT DO WANT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 09:30:44	On the other end of this webcam is a mate at the other end of the world. Second half? What second half.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 09:03:33	Very surprised the commercials thus far have been completely Black Keys-free.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 08:22:23	@roomerholmes Vivaldi I thought
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 08:16:32	Should've just rerun the Vader kid guys
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 08:12:01	I'd be gunning for Trivial Pursuit: The Movie, but Jeopardy might have a problem with that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 07:34:09	@roomerholmes this was my favourite song to play when I was sitting in the stands
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 07:12:46	@pineapplecakes good luck bb. It's gonna be a long night for you methinks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 03:36:09	@quarantedeux YES YES INDEEDY. Although the boy in tow was a total douchey mcbroseph, so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 02:36:48	@quarantedeux saw a girl at the market in an irish goodies, asu sweats, and a Loyola hat. Nearly went a tiny bit apeshit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 00:41:05	May have accidentally made a skype date during the game tonight. Oh well. #bestmatesfromnz #alwaysbetterthananythingelse
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 00:26:43	@zestylime i whore my show out to everyone with moderate success, but outrageous fortune is kiwi so it counts as different right
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-06 00:22:51	@zestylime yes yes my thoughts exactly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-05 22:18:59	@zestylime I WAS NOT EXPECTING HER. Brilliant twist, Moffat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-05 22:18:02	@zestylime Occupation made my heart hurt so much I had to turn it off. The way is cute but mostly about martin sheen. Cold feet is funny tho
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-05 22:17:16	@zestylime he hasn't done a lot of sexy roles. Coriolanus was awesome, and five minutes is good for his irish accent
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-05 22:04:26	@zestylime when she's on the phone talking about how his eyes go dark when he fucks her. i lost all ability to can for a moment.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-05 22:00:36	@zestylime also it doesn't help that his human counterpart is an older version of the boy i'm still a bit in love with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-05 21:59:45	@zestylime it's his errything, let's be real.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-05 21:54:57	@zestylime i think it's the eyes. like they're dark because he's ready for sexytimes with you, even if you just met.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-05 20:26:09	@zestylime whoops there go my mr. sexypants
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-05 13:26:46	@thejohnsonrule I didn't know that! I came along after eleven though, so...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-05 13:19:59	@thejohnsonrule did you just...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-05 04:16:44	A nose full of sawdust is an unfortunate reality. I built some awesome shit though, definitely worth it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-04 10:03:14	@zestylime it's not that great tbqh. But on the netflix for your judgment
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-04 08:48:15	@thesyddiegrl @ladysilver814 @ljsgecko Alas! Give her our love!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-04 08:39:48	@LadySilver814 @thesyddiegrl @ljsgecko on my way

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-04 08:32:18	@thesyddiegrl @LadySilver814 Me too!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-04 08:26:51	@ljsgecko how does one get in on this?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-04 08:25:42	@chidorme good luck lovely lady! You'll be choice.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-04 06:52:00	Holy cow, guys. My recommender just sent me a copy of her recommendation. This is amazing. Wow.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 06:03:12	@chidorme @LizCanTweet Subconscious eye roll.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:42:50	@LizCanTweet @chidorme Challenge: accepted. I told Not My Cat the joke instead. She just twitched in her sleep.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:39:32	@chidorme @LizCanTweet must. resist. urge to make smutty joke. must. resist.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:35:17	@pineapplecakes ummmmm do i have to push enter to do links
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:33:55	@pineapplecakes oh got it maybe somebody wrote a tutorial somewhere?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:32:26	@pineapplecakes hey hey hey you seem to know what you're doing what is a tag
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:28:05	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme @LizCanTweet the gift that keeps on giving
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:23:46	@chidorme @LizCanTweet It took me a minute to get that one. Well played.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:19:26	@quarantedeux I just got a flash of an A/R fic I read once. RIDING AROUND WITH THE RAPTOR TOP DOWN.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:18:37	@quarantedeux RIDING AROUND WITH THE CAR TOP DOWN AND THE RADIO ON
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:16:16	It's not just me, it's physically impossible to say anything other than Brender and Eddie, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:14:29	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes @brittania_ for me, that's the end of all tolerance, tbh. I don't wanna see your tits all over my stalker feed
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:13:50	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes @brittania_ although a girl i went to high school with is doing sexy titties modeling and has that up
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:13:09	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes @brittania_ I will make ridiculous fannish plans with rl firends I've gotten hooked on things, but otherwise.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:12:33	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes @brittania_ I think it's her face in a crowd next to Meryl. Or perhaps just meryl. Still though,
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:09:08	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes I think I just caught the tail end of those days. PLEASE YES PLEASE ALL TAO ALL THE TIME ...wait.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:03:45	@brittania_ @quarantedeux @pineapplecakes "...there is a definite chance that [McD] could fall in love with me based on a secret variable."
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 05:01:51	@brittania_ @pineapplecakes @quarantedeux she tweets about her Mary dreams. i want to make graphics of this. must. resist. bitch mode.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 04:59:24	@pineapplecakes it's one thing to speculate, it's entirely another to ask for definite facts.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 04:55:21	@pineapplecakes #reasonswelovecakes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 04:53:02	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux @brittania_ the only acceptable explanation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 04:52:46	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux @brittania_ it's classy because it's in french right
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 04:44:58	@brittania_ @pineapplecakes @quarantedeux defs doing that the next time I go in for a massive queue dump. Brilliant plan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 04:42:49	@quarantedeux @brittania_ @pineapplecakes drunken trolling opportunities ahoy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 04:36:01	@brittania_ @pineapplecakes @quarantedeux i track that shit purely for frakyeahadamaroslin purposes, and I wish I didn't have to.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 04:25:41	@brittania_ @pineapplecakes @quarantedeux ps so, so happy I found ya'll first when I hit BSG fandom and not the crazy ass bitches
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 04:22:22	@pineapplecakes @brittania_ @quarantedeux How do those things even go together? Okay, Who and Sherlock are Moffat, but supernatural? HOW
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 04:21:37	@quarantedeux @brittania_ @pineapplecakes my thoughts too. I love the excellence but the fandom can gtfo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 03:55:36	@pineapplecakes what even is a turrr and why does my phone have it remembered
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 03:54:27	@pineapplecakes top quailty signage right turrr
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 03:47:44	@pineapplecakes superstar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 03:42:03	@brittania_ pretty sure that's how the fleet stayed resupplied on water tbh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-03 03:35:39	@brittania_ The help raft was not as seaworthy as I'd hoped. The waves repeatedly threatened to swamp it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-02 23:48:14	@quarantedeux weird local pride is the actual best
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-02 23:46:28	@quarantedeux then again, it's our fucking whistlepig and we'll celebrate it if we want.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-02 23:46:00	@quarantedeux 's a major holiday here in the pennsyltuckey.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-02 10:46:42	Drunken mid-week skype dates with the best friend. Everyone should have them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-02 09:07:32	I have lost all concept of keys. Anybody want to be a guitar guinea pig?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-02 08:08:59	Attepting @ColdWarKids tabs is making me want to throw the guitar across the room. Everything wonderful is hard, I guess.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-02 06:11:52	I just love this fuzzball so much. http:// twitpic.com/8ehs30
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-02 05:43:26	Day one of new brain meds going swimmingly. This is excellent news.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 13:03:37	@hubbit ta! tomorrow should be an interesting day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 12:42:27	Tomorrow begins my first major shift in brain meds in nearly a decade. Cautiously optimistic. Hoping I don't start tripping balls.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 12:38:19	I never really got bitten but the sherlock bug that hard. Curse you, @zestylime for sending the bugs my way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 11:12:07	@zestylime watching all the damn commentaries now. "i left my threeway with a bowl of porridge" sweet jesus these thoughts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 10:08:24	@KVanValkenburg I once saw a girl who reminded me of the babe there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 09:49:18	@zestylime it makes me envision john/sherlock porn with the necessary vorpal blade went snicker snack line #thevorpalbladeismypenis
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 09:48:04	@zestylime the best shows always dooooo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 09:25:47	@zestylime truth. all of these are things which bring me joy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 09:23:20	@zestylime also the frumious cumbersnatch as alan rickman is possibly the most ovary-explosion inducing thing since i met alan
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 09:20:28	@zestylime LIES ALL LIES THIS ONE http://www. mediafire.com/?hhdi1fer9tz66 f9 …

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 09:05:44	@zestylime WHERE WHAT HOW WHERE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-02-01 08:40:15	@sk8tegr8 what for?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 12:45:29	@thejohnsonrule mine is a dinosaur appreciation life. dinosaurs in all formats, except the large purple singing kind.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 12:43:49	@thejohnsonrule even a dinky little one like this guy http:// twitpic.com/8du8ib
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 12:39:58	@thejohnsonrule Okay, significantly less exciting. Although in my life any kind of dinosaur is cause for excitement.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 12:25:16	@thejohnsonrule yessssss.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 12:01:43	This fourteen hour work day nonsense needs to stop.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 07:59:14	@zestylime bless.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 05:46:33	@witzseeker excellent. Are you from the area? Do you know anything about the whole thing?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 05:42:16	@witzseeker if I were to do it this year, I'd go may-june. I'll know in a few months, definitely.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 03:58:29	@witzseeker I definitely want to do the Spanish part. I'm not much if a trekker, bit I definitely want to do this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 03:51:44	@witzseeker I'd love to do it from Paris, but I'd never make it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 03:51:15	@witzseeker I think just the camino Frances. Probably startjng in St Jean.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-31 03:40:41	Having serious thoughts about walking the Camino del Santiago this year before grad school (if I get in, of course)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-30 12:25:11	@brittania_ @pineapplecakes is it bad i want so desperately to bring home a brown boy just to watch my dad try to react civilly?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-30 12:22:03	@brittania_ @pineapplecakes it scares me so much when they're serious. how can you even still think like that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-30 12:16:35	@pineapplecakes @brittania_ yesterday I met a man who genuinely believed a black man shouldn't be president just because he's black. fuck.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-30 12:12:08	@zestylime it's not division, but i'm happy to make it mine.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-30 11:16:26	@zestylime hear that @pineapplecakes you need to get on watching a Jekyll.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-30 10:49:23	@zestylime I was thinking getting cakes on a Jekyll actually
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-30 10:48:04	@zestylime do you think we can get a cakes in on it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-30 10:47:27	@zestylime tbh after all this i'll take a nesbitt over a cumberbatch in half a heartbeat ughhhh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-30 10:41:39	@zestylime unf unf. Yes. I'd like to sleep in that mighty jungle tonight.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-18 01:58:33	@maryrtaylor10 with the notable exceptions of the doctors wife and Craig's triumphant return.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-18 01:57:01	@maryrtaylor10 yeah. Those movies are really just small bits of fun. And naked Stephen Fry, which is always good for the lulz
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-18 01:54:38	@maryrtaylor10 I'm so tired of the hate on him for River's storyline, watching it bleed over into Sherlock from Who frustrates me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-18 01:53:33	@maryrtaylor10 truth. In the RDJ version she gets offed on account of her own (implied womanly) carelessness. No one cried foul there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-18 01:33:55	@maryrtaylor10 If you compare the treatments of irene in the two sherlock out there, moffat's is much less stereotypical
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-18 01:32:31	@maryrtaylor10 i'm definitely in the random decided moffat's sexist and now don't like what he does camp.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-18 01:27:38	@maryrtaylor10 personally, I think his characters are wonderful. They aren't perfect, but imho they aren't sexist. They're badass
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-16 10:29:20	@quarantedeux Welcome to the dark side.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-16 10:28:16	@quarantedeux yessssss.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-16 06:53:03	Right. My phone doesn't have Tumblr savior. Shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-16 06:49:42	@zestylime his is the troll existence we all aspire to.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-16 06:46:39	DEAD. RT @zestylime : DO IT FOR THE PUPPIES ELI #gobbmannings
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-15 14:57:45	@GerryBM always. I much prefer the drunken sweet briar women once they're grads in their own homes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-15 11:48:52	Oh, how I missed you drunken sweet briar women.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-15 07:20:23	@mizujada that sounds like a modest proposal for a saturday night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-15 07:19:47	@quarantedeux still not happy about her as Stephanie Plum, tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 12:40:42	@thejohnsonrule i think i could gif this happpen with montana and this ER episode. well, if I had the patience to gif atm. hmmm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 12:24:28	@thejohnsonrule AND A CHRISTINA HENDRICKS. I have found nirvana.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 12:22:23	@thejohnsonrule all the fandoms, they crash together into one. there's a Kingston and a Mary in the same episodes of ER. EXCELLENCE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 12:10:34	@pineapplecakes @thejohnsonrule Mary is Willie Rae's daughter-in-law in ER. shut the front door.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 11:26:02	A few lovely papers on the advantages of diisopropylamino protection of bases. Helloooo, friday night #unrepentantchemist
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 10:47:34	@zestylime yessss. I love that I had this in my queue long before I knew what a Kingston was for the Clive Owen. Surprise extra sexy!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 10:39:01	@zestylime I watched it in two bits like a week apart, I feel as though I missed some excellence that way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 09:58:25	@zestylime how far in are you?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 09:55:54	@zestylime innit awesome though?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 09:07:17	@zestylime it's not bad, great for the excellent eye candy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 08:51:17	@zestylime croupier, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 08:50:51	@quarantedeux mmmm. Yes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 08:27:13	@quarantedeux i'm totally in for starting next week if you are! I could use some good snarking time :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 08:10:12	@quarantedeux oh jesus. Next week maybe? Full rematch or just the hits?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 03:01:27	@thejohnsonrule aaahh. I'm on a mission, yo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 00:44:47	@thejohnsonrule yet, rather.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 00:44:09	@thejohnsonrule although tbh if there's already a masterpost somewhere I don't want to know href, i'm rather enjoying the challenge.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-14 00:41:20	@thejohnsonrule I checked mcawesome but I couldn't find one. Perhaps I'm just being thick though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 22:30:43	@thejohnsonrule I just want Nola, is it too much to ask of the internet?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 14:46:11	I am so disappointed in the internet that there isn't an Emmy Rossum masterpost to make my life easier.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 14:44:22	@pineapplecakes searching for nola 2003 makes me feel like I'm robot hunting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 14:41:33	@pineapplecakes yeahhhh. I'm planning to start hitting people up once I know what does and doesn't have seeds, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 14:37:01	@pineapplecakes do you have evidence of blood?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 14:33:48	@pineapplecakes there are 37 things waiting to start. my torrent client won't know what to do with itself, I rarely have more than two
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 14:32:56	@pineapplecakes no worries, I've got that one in my massive, massive fucking torrent queue
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 14:27:48	@pineapplecakes i had passion fish and sneakers why oh why did I let them go. ugh files come back to me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 14:27:12	@pineapplecakes you legend. the TV eps will be easy, it's the movies I'm having trouble with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 14:19:22	@pineapplecakes I definitely thought LJ would be a better source than it has been.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 14:17:50	@pineapplecakes Certified nutty pants. I'm decently surprised by how much I've gotten already. Now for the tricksy ones, I guess.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 14:14:00	@pineapplecakes I need a project, so I've embarked on a masterpost. May the gods save me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 12:59:56	@pineapplecakes jfc Mary's movies just get worse and worse. WHY.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 12:31:24	Caprica's finest BBQ. @quarantedeux let's have an old-fashioned psychotic robot barbecue in the backyard, Daniel
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 11:52:40	"Dirty laundry does not go on my Allman Brothers records!"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 11:35:30	I was really hoping she would be the dead mother at the beginning so I didn't have to watch the rest of the movie. #lesigh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 11:33:06	I have a feeling the movie I just started is going to become one of those 'the things I do for you, Mary McDonnell' moments.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 11:10:37	@quarantedeux slash access to current seasons
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 11:10:20	@quarantedeux The only real advantage to Hulu is immediate access to shows the day after they air. But you could just download them too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 11:08:59	@quarantedeux Netflix. Hulu+ was disappointing. Then again, that was before I descended into watch all the TV all the time land.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 10:54:45	@mizujada They can go hand in hand, really.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 10:33:35	@dks2008 i have such a sudden urge to drink with you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 10:01:28	@pineapplecakes i will burn everything osu loves that application was such a clusterfuck of non-organization.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 09:56:17	Submitted OSU and UAB applications tonight. I feel like my grad schools have come from twitter @roomerholmes @pineapplecakes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 09:25:42	@quarantedeux yours shouldn't be too screwy then. I can only imagine if you took the old-old GRE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 09:20:53	@quarantedeux it looks like they completely redid it again in August 2011, so everything is weird and scaled now. Did you write an essay?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 09:16:26	@quarantedeux Solution: set fire to my GRE score reports. Then set fire to the GRE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 09:15:18	No, I will NOT tell you where else I'm applying, tyvm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 09:12:27	@quarantedeux it looks like these days the scores only go up to 170. the fuck did they do to the GRE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 09:10:44	@quarantedeux mine are too. My scores haven't changed, but the percentiles did. I don't know which ones to report now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 09:09:50	@quarantedeux THE ONLY SCORE RELEVANT TO MY DISCIPLINE WENT DOWN I AM NOT OKAY WITH THIS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 09:09:08	@quarantedeux I have score reports printed a year apart. On one, it's 83 quant 92 writing, on the other it's 81 quant, 96 writing WHAT IS IT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 09:05:57	Has anyone else had their GRE percentiles change since taking the test? Which do I report?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 09:00:25	I swear to god this application embodies errything I hate about Ohio State but ugh god the shiny research.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 08:53:42	I love when grad schools ask for my Alien Number. Do they want to believe too?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 08:48:11	OSU your online application is the actual worst. I don't want to be a buckeye, I just really like your phd program. ugh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 08:18:38	"From the darkness you must fall, failed and weak to darkness all." moar caprican poetry, please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 05:38:58	@roomerholmes i've long been convinced that the sexiest possible getup is a towel. Pizza in a towel wouldn't do it for me though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 04:00:05	@hubbit @quarantedeux I can't see where it would be a sacramental problem so long as it's consecrated with the rest of it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 03:59:02	@hubbit @quarantedeux I think there are a few convents of nuns who make it gluten free anyway for churches to use.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 03:57:55	@quarantedeux that was a huge problem for a friend of mine who's becoming a nun. Take communion or poison yourself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 03:55:44	@quarantedeux methodists, man. Catholics won't even allow gluten free communion wafers. Needs to have wheat to be the body of christ, seems
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 03:51:50	@quarantedeux whaaaa. We have a recovering alcoholic priest, so we get grape juice on the altar sometimes, but the parish still gets wine.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 03:48:53	@quarantedeux and that'll be my dose of sacrilege for the day, then.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 03:48:20	@quarantedeux bahahaha. Come to the papist side, we have communion wafers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-13 03:45:56	@quarantedeux @brittania_ idk what it is about papists that scares them off so. But at least that way they can't argue you haven't found god
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 12:51:55	@pineapplecakes I hate the Giants and you've convinced me to love Eli. #wonders #neverend
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 12:50:29	You will rightly rule the world RT @pineapplecakes the day writing smut about gay football players becomes a legitimate career...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 12:46:42	@pineapplecakes DONE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 12:43:16	@pineapplecakes tbqh I would not be so mad at last season if Eli was the reason my quarterback was broken all the time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 12:40:11	@zestylime I have lost the ability to can.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 12:37:17	@pineapplecakes @zestylime it's like a baptism. you served your time here take the blessing of my godlike face.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 12:35:27	@pineapplecakes we'll go off into the sunset and build cabins and fight over the big 10.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 12:33:45	@pineapplecakes that is now my mental image of my love for you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 12:33:26	@pineapplecakes PERFECTION.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 11:50:44	@papagena665 a foolish thing was but a toy?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 11:29:44	Sherlock, honey, you can't tell what's in a compound by looking at it. May I suggest an HPLC? Mass spec?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 11:27:22	Television often sends my inner scientist into apoplectic fits. All of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 11:26:37	Aaugh. @steven_moffat was doing so well with the science jargon, but you can't use a microscope with your eyes three inches from it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 10:53:05	@quarantedeux Fair. I no longer care for science tv programs in much the same way, I guess.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 10:50:34	@quarantedeux Add another to the pile. Watch all the sexy sexy Idris Elba.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 10:10:10	Should I do another PhD application tonight or apply to this lovely job?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 09:49:55	There's a Kiwi doing HPV research at this school. If I get in, I know what lab I'm gunning for.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 09:00:23	Since I'm applying to Penn State, I feel the need to note that it's 8:00 and Michigan Still Sucks. #weare
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 08:57:03	@quarantedeux I didn't think mine did either, but that's what this certificate says so I'm putting that shit in my application.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 08:53:46	I wish I'd noticed I got academic honors in grad school five phd applications ago. Oh well.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 08:50:30	@chidorme bingo. thank you thank you!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 08:46:48	@chidorme the first year one? i got the other two, but that one is lost to me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 08:45:20	When you can't remember the name of that one honor society from five years ago #gradstudentproblems
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 08:43:59	@pineapplecakes list of twee faces which give me diabetes. bad diabetes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 08:27:23	@pineapplecakes can she go away yet?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 08:15:35	@roomerholmes what the actual fuck.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 08:10:11	Found the perfect job at UVa. I like this plan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 08:00:32	@LizCanTweet I know I'll have a bit of a lag between my bus and train on the way up, but i haven't decided on the trip home yet...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 07:55:02	@mizujada All of this has just made me want ice cream. Preferably in a root beer float. mmmm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 07:52:32	@chidorme @mizujada We're not grownups, we're lushes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 07:50:15	@mizujada I wanted to drink the bourbon, but I couldn't justify drinking my dinner. So I made it into my food.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 07:49:04	@LizCanTweet Weekend of the 20th. I'm going up to NY to visit @sarahnathan7 and see Alan Rickman, but if I can catch you on the way...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 07:44:46	@LizCanTweet hey, I'll be coming through philly in a few weeks...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 07:43:22	@LizCanTweet @chidorme @mizujada I wish I'd found a way to put bourbon on the asparagus. Eating all the things bourbon, yes please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 07:39:07	@chidorme @LizCanTweet @mizujada Baked chicken with homemade barbecue sauce, honey bourbon carrots, and asparagus.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 07:18:32	@TheBlackSeeds When are ya'll releasing your North American dates? I have a powerful hankering for some sweet kiwi music.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 06:40:26	Fat Lee followed orders to get rid of the black market in the fleet. He ate it. #fatleefacts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 06:38:40	The Cylons didn't take Tigh's eye. Fat Lee was in the same cell and got the munchies. #fatleefacts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 06:23:23	So, comic-inclined friends, what comic/graphic novel should I read next? #nospandexplease
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 06:20:05	I've finally read all the #Fables . Now I have to wait a whole week for the next one? I am not okay with this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:43:50	...now Fat Lee eats his feelings at Dee's diner down the street. #fatleefacts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:43:17	@quarantedeux I knew there had to be one there somewhere.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:42:30	Fat Lee used to eat his feelings at Starbucks, but they won't serve him there anymore. #fatleefacts (ta, @quarantedeux )
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:39:20	@quarantedeux i was thinking something like Fat Lee used to eat his feelings at Starbuck but they won't serve him there anymore.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:29:51	@quarantedeux there's a fat lee and Starbucks joke somewhere, but I can't quite find it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:21:44	@quarantedeux cackling quietly at my desk tbh. Very hard to hold in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:20:34	@quarantedeux Fat Lee's post-chilli flatulence caused the Tillium contamination. #fatleefacts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:17:11	@quarantedeux the water tanks exploding wasn't cylon Boomer. Fat Lee just wanted to go for a swim. #fatleefacts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:11:41	@quarantedeux true that. Although now my brain wants to make #fatleefacts a thing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:08:04	@quarantedeux fat lee's workout music is Helo on his tuba.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:03:31	@quarantedeux yep. Also Fat Lee.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-12 01:00:19	@quarantedeux apparently we're autocorrecting aargh to watch now. Okay then.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-11 10:56:21	@quarantedeux My friend J played it on the piano and errything. And there might have been unintentional three-part harmony. We were drunk.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-07 14:53:43	@brittania_ YES PLEASE. Seriously though, I'm good at 40's style and stage makeup and that's about it. Any good resources?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-07 14:47:53	@brittania_ Ugh yes but what are makeup skills. Must investigate.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-07 14:46:16	@brittania_ Ugh Gillian. Fuck you phone, you should know my ships by now.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-07 04:00:51	@chrytonbaine It is, I was making a terrible pun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-07 04:00:21	@roomerholmes Our public schools are so, so terrible. I think they've gone for the throw paint at the wall and try anything approach.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-07 03:57:44	His Vulcan blade will go snicker-snack. @JamesUrbaniak What's all this about the frumious bandersnatch being cast in Star Trek?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-07 02:26:03	@hubbit I prefer the I can't do it one, personally. Then again I wore that song out in high school and have been hiding from it ever since
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-06 22:44:10	@maryrtaylor10 biotechnology. Sustainable development sounds like a lot of fun though. You up to anything else exciting?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-06 07:56:28	@chidorme always my favourite. Also, the only thing i'll drink vodka with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-06 07:54:13	We have 16 different types of sterile pads, bandages, and turnicates, but no band-aids. I don't understand.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-06 02:02:07	@chidorme bringing new meaning to the phrase "I just ate that book right up."
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-05 08:15:02	@mizujada same, but the @stephenfry version jovially trolling his staff with his nakedness accentuates the difference from his brother imho
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-05 08:08:12	Two Mycrofts in one week, but I can't decide if I prefer @stephenfry or @Markgatiss . Such different takes on my favourite Holmes character.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-04 13:13:43	Can anyone explain to me why you would ever want that man back in office? Politics aside, the man is seriously unpleasant.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-04 13:12:23	As a former Santorum constituent, I don't understand what the actual fuck is going on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-04 11:00:22	Started a Hornblower reread. I continue to refuse to believe heterosexual naval fiction exists.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-04 10:32:40	@zestylime I used to be a giant fucking slasher; the no pants in buckingham palace bit was definitely my fave.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-04 07:38:35	@zestylime I really liked the first third, but the rest was not as awesome

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-03 03:10:55	The true freshman QB's had two plays and he's already more interesting than Bolden. Wop wop.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-03 02:39:26	It really helps if you throw the ball Bolden
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-03 02:35:48	There is nobody in the Cotton Bowl. Half the damn stadium is empty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-03 02:31:29	Watching this game from under the blankets and between my fingers. My heart, it cries.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-03 01:40:40	Broken quarterback is broken and not there and frustrated Rex is frustrated.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-02 05:14:27	I think the eagles have gone for the 'who hasn't played yet this season?' defense.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2012-01-02 05:10:37	Everybody goes to the right, balls go the left. Beautiful touchdown.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 08:20:14	@zestylime What's food retail like though? I've never ever done food service, I've always been curious
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 08:18:31	@zestylime I wanted to beat them with my giant fucking master's degree.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 08:17:47	@zestylime I heard them in the next aisle after all 'aren't you glad we're not stupid so we don't have to work here?'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 08:16:44	@zestylime Depends. They didn't do any damage, so I found all the pieces and repacked them up. Other times, we do.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 08:13:44	@zestylime Although yesterday I also had a kid getting his first non-handmedown bike. He was all appreciative and lovely made my heart hurt.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 08:12:15	@zestylime I had to chase a set of parents out of the drum kits last night. They had five out to "test" for their kid. The fuck? NO. GO AWAY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 08:09:14	@zestylime Toys toys toys fucking toys fucking everywhere. We're not a playground, we're a store. Parents are worse than kids though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 08:06:13	@zestylime sweet. zombie. jesus. I had to chase a kid on a bike around the store yesterday. Fuck that, control your children.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 08:05:32	@zestylime The problem is I really want to help 'cos there's a little kid on the other end of the sale but ugh these people
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 08:03:50	@zestylime We very rarely have coupons at the toysaurus. Usually just on baby items and only at the christmases. But ughh the anger.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 07:58:20	@zestylime Also the anger that their coupon won't work because every fucking item they have is on sale. EURGH.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-20 07:57:26	@zestylime I hate the 'i can't use this 10% off coupon to save 50 cents on this item? I don't want it'

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-04 14:42:05	@alisontroup @tui_talk It's a bummer, being cold for the holidays. I want to have a big family party on the deck, but then it's 2C out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-04 14:37:50	@tui_talk @alisontroup Personally, I'd rather have a sweet Kiwi summer for the holidays. Warmpth for gatherings is much better.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-04 12:58:56	@chidorme Paul McGann is one of my favourite actors. I was always going to like Mark, but once he teamed up with Luther I was done.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-04 12:16:35	@chidorme I KNOW RIGHT. I want Mark, Luther and Alice to go off traveling somewhere taking down serial killers.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-04 01:28:31	What is the outer acceptable limit for continuous watching of White Christmas? January 15th? February?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-04 01:26:09	@chidorme YES YES. A lovely psychopath to keep things interesting. I love her relationship with Luther. Are you on series one or two?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 11:58:25	Picking faculty members you'd like to work with on an application is like buying shoes online. You've gotta meet them first, yo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 11:38:02	Obviously, deciding I want to apply to a school and realizing the application deadline is tonight is creating a lot of anger in my life.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 11:22:05	@dks2008 I'm actually contemplating it. I'd love to get into science law. Lots 'o lawyers, few with the science training, etc.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 08:01:17	Two seasons, two teams. Looks like we got rid of McNabb just in time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:53:35	This molecular biologist is very confused about what exactly is so molecular about molecular gastronomy. #pleaseexplain
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:34:46	@roomerholmes Duly noted.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:32:53	@roomerholmes Oh geez, do classes tend to devolve into that? Good to know/look out for.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:31:59	@roomerholmes He was completely deranged but it is definitely nice having something with some history to it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:29:45	@roomerholmes We've also got his papers from the nutty bin he was in. Found that when i found his name on a register while writing a paper.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:28:59	@roomerholmes I'm keeping my eyes open for photography classes locally. I'd love to learn how to work a camera properly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:27:59	@roomerholmes About the only kind of heirloom my family has etc, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:26:21	@roomerholmes Ah yup. I requested it from the estate when he carked it back in junior high. I won't ever want to sell it; my kids might tho
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:23:03	@roomerholmes niiiiiiice. I've got my grandpa's Leica II he took with him to europe in the war, but I'm too terrified to shoot with it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:17:05	@roomerholmes Unfort, my camera broke this summer, and my other isn't as fun since I got over the lomo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:16:17	@roomerholmes Now that's a bummer. I'm a terrible photographer, but I like just fucking around with it when I feel like it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:11:27	@roomerholmes Preach. I like not knowing what I'm going to get until its developed. Anticipation FTW.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:09:47	@roomerholmes Shit, really? God, snapfish has spoiled me with my other film development.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:09:09	@roomerholmes It can't be too different from developing gel radiographs. ...i hope.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:08:24	@roomerholmes sahweeet. I think I'm going to gift myself C41 developing chemicals for christmas. #justwantmypictures
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:06:54	@roomerholmes I can't find anywhere that'll do it for anywhere near a reasonable price. Argh blargh asking everyone tbh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-02 07:06:18	@roomerholmes Ahhh got it. I'm on the hunt for somewhere to develop an approximate metric shit ton of C41.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-01 03:07:22	@dks2008 I just want to grow up and overhaul the science education system in this country. Ugh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-01 03:03:25	@dks2008 I didn't just mean fear in healthcare. The degree of science illiteracy in this country is shameful. And mostly willful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-01 03:02:07	@dks2008 no, they aren't. Jesus where the fuck do people get that information from?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-12-01 02:56:56	@dks2008 I just don't understand why people are so afraid of science in every context.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-21 08:08:06	@TMarr11 I mean, it didn't pay well. We had almost no set for this play so they tossed a bit which was left over in my direction.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-20 02:21:04	@TMarr11 In all reality, don't stress it, you'd be amazed how much you already know. Just bring your badass self to the party.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-20 02:20:22	@TMarr11 Then she tried to lord her PhD acceptance over me, I guess in retaliation? idk, just so glad that batshit is over

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 21:49:02	@roomerholmes I haven't gotten that far into it yet. Ugh. Send that man to the special hell.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 21:46:56	@roomerholmes had I gone to anyone else without being taken there by Rose, i'd've been immediately fired. Could have been the case.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 21:45:27	@roomerholmes exactly. I worked with kids once and the reporting setup was to report to my immediate supervisor.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 21:44:24	@roomerholmes I think it's telling that JoePa wasn't charged and his superiors were. It looms like he was kept quiet to me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 21:43:30	@roomerholmes especially from a football program where misbehavior is Not Tolerated.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 21:12:45	@roomerholmes thank. God. Somebody else is saying something like this too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 13:30:01	Marginally coherent thoughts about JoePa from someone who saw him as God. http:// tmblr.co/Z60JHyBkQ3MN

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 12:31:51	@pineapplecakes ugh god no. they can gtfo.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 12:31:25	I will mourn the loss of JoePa as many would the loss of a family member. As a child, he was the kind of person I was told to grow up to be.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 12:27:08	The strange thing is, if I were in State College right now I'd be rioting, simply because I don't know what else to do.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 12:20:53	I was raised with two Gods and one of them was JoePa. My entire world's been upended and I don't know what to do now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 12:11:47	Shit, that wasn't just a twitter hoax? JoePa's really gone? These are legitimate tears on my face.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 12:03:14	@ENbrian But we don't know yet. It'll all come out soon, and when it does I'll be the first to admit my god has fallen. But not until then.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 12:02:34	@ENbrian Fact is, I think that since his immediate superiors were charged and not him, it's highly possible he was kept quiet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 12:01:41	@ENbrian Welp, that doesn't work at all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 12:01:02	@ENbrian https:// twitter.com/#!/funkasarusr ex/status/134478761935646721 … This convo has my thoughts
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:57:34	I wanted JoePa to retire at the end of the season anyway. It's frustrating that it had to go like this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:53:29	@pineapplecakes And I think that theory is suggested in that his immediate superiors were charged but he wasn't.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:53:00	@pineapplecakes I think that's bullshit too. I'm saying for all that he is God, people could still pull rank to keep the whole thing quiet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:47:51	The fact of the matter is, we just don't fucking know yet and it's a shame such a venerable career got tainted for somebody else's shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:45:54	@pineapplecakes Morally he probably dropped the ball, but there may have been other powers at work stopping him from doing anything.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:45:21	@pineapplecakes But again, I'm not going to judge either way until we know just what went down.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:44:34	@pineapplecakes I think there's a real tell that he wasn't charged. If there'd been funny business on his part, he'd've been charged too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:43:50	@pineapplecakes Had I gone to anyone else if something had happened, I would have been immediately fired. We don't know if that was the case
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:43:23	@pineapplecakes I had a job once where if anything was reported to me, I could only report to my supervisor.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:42:48	@pineapplecakes I'm not saying he had no idea, I'm saying he might contractually have not been allowed to report to anyone else.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:39:29	@pineapplecakes Legally, he did what he had to. His hands might've been tied to do anything else. We just don't know.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:35:12	@pineapplecakes I'm withholding judgment until it all comes out. And it definitely will.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-10 11:34:42	@pineapplecakes Many state agencies have policies where you olny report to your supervisor. Go to anyone else, you're fired.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-04 09:47:38	@pineapplecakes i'm sitting through some seriously ridiculous batshit right now and since it's directly related to the closer i blame you.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-01 20:40:31	@madelinead True facts. I had so much fun playing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-01 20:24:04	@mmspoilers27 the next two episodes are among my favorites though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-01 09:19:45	Just finished @CraigyFerg 's book. Absolutely wonderful. Go read it!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-01 07:59:24	Five little girls in slutty costumes so far. I actually feel a bit bad for the kiddie fiddler down the street. He gonna have a rough night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-01 07:58:05	Parenting tip: if you stick your pre-pubescent child in a slutty costume, you're doing it wrong.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-01 07:52:45	Mommas got a bad fake tan, kiddo's hoo ha's nearly hanging out. I sense a disturbance in the force.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-01 07:48:23	Giving your fatass kids whoppers. They're young they can walk from house to house.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-01 07:23:09	I am a heinous ball of red from head to toe. I was so good at being hazed.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-11-01 07:20:28	Completely red flapper outfit from a bum run? Instant trick or treat candy costume.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-31 11:40:28	@dks2008 we had a small wall heater. But it never got below freezing while I was there, and we're two days without power now. Shit's cold yo
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-31 11:31:04	Apparently the threshold for warmth is two blankets, a down comforter, and a -20C sleeping bag. How were people warm before central heat?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-31 07:00:36	@justlikemars unf. Now I have heat AND whataburger cravings.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-31 06:25:44	Otoh, snow looks really pretty in front of trees that still have leaves on them. But having heat would be nicer.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-31 06:23:03	All I really want is for the power to come back on. It's supposed to be even colder tonight. #brrr #socold
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 08:09:41	Blessed glorious heat. Second time this fall the neighbors have come to stay during severe weather. This may be a sign. http:// twitpic.com/77vh0z

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 05:51:07	This game isn't football, it's hot potato.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 04:56:10	Found the emergency radio. Penn State game, rail baron, and several bottles of wine. My family does winter weather well.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 04:54:23	@pineapplecakes Bless.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 04:36:45	@pineapplecakes TAKE MINE. We gave six inches and no power. How's the game going?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 04:35:45	@mmspoilers27 my favourite fucking set of episodes. And I keep getting the feeling it's really really important in the grand scheme
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 03:45:01	@LizCanTweet @mmspoilers27 truth. S6 has ruined her for me. #notreallyaspoiler other people love her more now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 03:38:40	First the cable, now the power. Gonna be a long, cold afternoon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 03:34:24	@mmspoilers27 @LizCanTweet #amycangtfo I really don't much care for her anymore. I'm rather meh about her in general
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 03:24:48	@mmspoilers27 River for ALL THE WINS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 03:23:06	NOOOOOOOO NOT THE CABLE COMCAST DON'T TAKE AWAY MY FOOTBALL BEFORE THE GAME WORK CABLE WORK I HAVE FAITH IN YOU
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 03:19:12	If the power goes out for real before the Penn State game is over I'm going to kill some adorable innocent things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 01:44:03	@roomerholmes when JoePa wants a whiteout game, god complies.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 01:43:24	I would not want to be in Paternoville right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 01:20:29	I wasn't worried about all this snow until @JimCantore came into the area to report. Now I'm seriously concerned.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 01:02:55	@sarahnathan7 I felt bad last year because I kept legitimately running out right before it snowed. Every time. Now the beer run is crucial.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 00:56:10	@sarahnathan7 That is right up my alley! Thanks for the heads up!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 00:54:07	@sarahnathan7 OH NO I MUST BUY ALL THE MILK BREAD AND EGGS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-30 00:53:41	Four inches of snow already? Bring it the fuck on, winter weather.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 14:40:30	Took a dance break, got sucked into a heated debate about marvel characters. It's hot, steamy, bluesy, and nerdy in here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 14:35:45	Of the lot only Captain Mal was any good. And damn can that boy BLUES.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 14:34:06	So far tonight I've danced with both the tenth and eleventh doctors, jango fett, mal reynolds, and three mad hatters Swing dancers are NERDY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 13:57:06	It's 2AM. The blues can only get better from here. #dance #dance #dance
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 05:58:00	Who thought giving me BSG was a good idea? brb doing ridiculous things with spaceparents.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 05:53:32	"just love someone look he volunteered" "oh shit she's dead" "i'm so mad i can barely shave" "frak under a tarp? okay" top quality scenes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 05:51:29	Finally compiled all the input for the spaceparents top 25. I think I'm just going to keep my working titles for them though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 04:23:29	@hchatt10 This is true. But I have all these serious scientist thoughts which no one will listen to until I can wave a PhD at them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 04:01:06	In other news, apparently I'm becoming a ballroom dancer. I think I might be okay with that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 04:00:30	I don't scoff at your neat and tidy and sparkly ballroom-ness, don't scoff at my love of down 'n dirty unstructured blues dance.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 03:57:52	@hchatt10 Because no one will take me seriously as a scientist unless I have a PhD.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 03:55:39	The looks of disgust when I talk about how learning to follow makes you a better lead and vice versa are absolutely priceless.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-29 03:54:39	Nothing is more fun than trolling ballroom dancers with my swing-inspired gender equality dance ideas.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-28 23:24:18	Bill Bailey's Remarkable Guide to the Orchestra makes a perfect background for pounding out the last bits of these grad school apps.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-28 11:25:26	Can anyone recommend a good bit of standup? I'm in the mood for some laughter tonight.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-28 11:11:37	"Do you know what necrophilia is, Elmo?"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-28 11:08:45	Internet, all I want from you is more than two minutes of Ricky Gervais riffing with Elmo. Elmo wants this tape? Caitlin wants it too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-28 10:48:28	I JUST MISS MATH OKAY. If loving multivariable calculus is wrong, I DON'T WANNA BE RIGHT.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-28 10:01:49	@quarantedeux welp it was nice knowing you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-28 09:57:47	@brittania_ @quarantedeux you just summed up my life in a tweet tbqh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-28 09:50:53	@brittania_ the only movie I want to see is spaceparents on new caprica.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-28 09:30:03	Okay, so in retrospect I fully understand that going after the stink bug with a tennis racket was a terrible decision.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-27 11:10:09	@hubbit I'm not really sure what I was doing, really. I'm watching Daleks v. Cybermen, that's what I'm doing.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-27 10:56:45	@hubbit @quarantedeux That sounds DELICIOUS. What's it entail?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-27 10:56:14	Really? Cybermen again?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-27 10:32:09	@witzseeker All the anti River people can't seem to shut up about Rose, so I was curious. Now I'm just confused.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-27 10:30:12	@chidorme Now THAT gives me something to look forward to.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-27 10:28:09	It would appear I've already seen most of the Ten/Rose episodes. I still don't see this great love everyone is going on about.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-27 10:24:21	@mizujada @chidorme @LizCanTweet That was my first thought at the unborn baby killings.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-27 09:35:58	@mizujada That's very true. Although I'm given to understand the Briar used to have a much, much higher profile in times past.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-27 09:24:02	@mizujada Is it bad that I'm not really surprised at all?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-25 11:34:09	@chidorme Merely attempting to accurately describe the game. Although there were moments where it felt like I was watching my turdy birds.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-21 07:50:02	@roomerholmes @pineapplecakes I'm thinking vodka with a hint of vermouth, twist of lime, and sours. And bacon garnish o'course.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-21 07:35:38	@pineapplecakes what kind of base d'you think. i'm thinking bourbon. or vodka. hrm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-21 07:31:58	@roomerholmes or a bacon garnish that could work too
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-21 07:29:21	@pineapplecakes Bacon Sedgwick would make an interesting cocktail too.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 08:01:54	@roomerholmes Poobah is my favourite honorific. There's something so epic yet cuddly to it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 08:00:43	@roomerholmes ...that's actually a pretty excellent title.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 07:57:50	@roomerholmes poobah, supreme grand whatever, duhno the right title. Sharesies?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 07:50:24	@pineapplecakes @zestylime oh god it just occurred to me that I know at least 4 guys who actually go by TC someone get me out of hickville
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 07:46:20	@pineapplecakes ...nawp. doesn't quite work. i think it might if I didn't already know your real name.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 07:45:28	@pineapplecakes sweet chickens, it's TC then.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 07:44:59	@dks2008 i just reread it too. it seems SO LONG AGO before welly broke my poor little heart. i'm hoping to visit within the year
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 07:43:36	@pineapplecakes monday night's my tee vee night. ALL THE SHOWS are on mondays. ALL OF THEM.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 07:42:21	@pineapplecakes Also, TC: The Colts TC: The Closer. I may start referring to you in my brain as TC.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 07:40:40	@pineapplecakes Jus' wonderin how your deep-seated passions divide. Eags have monday night on the 7th, idk what I'll do.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 07:37:39	@pineapplecakes I guess it would have to be, since things are ending before next football.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 07:36:13	@pineapplecakes Serious question. What would you do if Colts MNF and the Closer overlapped?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 07:34:59	@dks2008 drinking shit chardonnay in my parent's junk room alone. we're completely normal.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 05:26:31	@chidorme @mmdahlia27 Very true. I'm whoring myself as a published, trained cell culture technician. Very shiny, I hope.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 05:22:48	@mmdahlia27 @chidorme True, but I think it's less so in the hard sciences. Those who were, still will. Few who weren't will.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 05:12:07	Additionally, holy shit I found a program with a stipend over $30K/year. Finally, decent wages for graduate student slave labor.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 05:09:31	@chrytonbaine every year i've applied the deadlines have moved up a month. next year deadlines will be in october

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 05:07:21	If I were still an undergrad, you would miss the most important year of my education. I'd be applying based on only three years of uni!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-18 05:03:44	Reduced-price applications due by the middle of November: the new trend in ridiculous graduate application policies.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-17 10:45:52	@quarantedeux Also, I will watch absolutely anything with Eric Stoltz in it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-17 10:45:19	@quarantedeux That's the only show I've ever watched on Syfy, but if this is a recurring thing I hate them too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-17 10:42:53	@quarantedeux It's not big kabooms and epic speeches, it's wonderful in a different way. It was just getting really hot when it ended too :(
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-17 10:39:28	@quarantedeux I saw it on accident before I even knew what BSG was. I was so so in love, and then I found BSG and it all got more awesome.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-17 05:00:50	@ENbrian I thought it was equal parts hatred and 'oh, you silly little children go sit at the kids table now.'

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-16 09:44:02	@Belender true that. Well, I had the hugest thing for him, and did nothing (stupid me) and ended up getting really messed up over it

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-12 01:42:00	All this new 'And with your spirit' changes rather makes us papists sound like giant hippies. Excellent choices.

Now to sleep, perhaps...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 12:05:01	@LizCanTweet I saw it as a DVD from the 'flix, if it's any help
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 11:51:50	@LizCanTweet I absolutely love Catherine Tate, and Tennant as the Doctor is growing on me. Slowly. Tennant as Hamlet though? UNF. UGH. YES.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 11:35:29	It would appear my iTunes-sourced S5 of Doctor Who does not play on my phone. Hellooooo S6 torrent, now I have an unbelievable use for you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 11:31:01	@LizCanTweet This will obviously require me to watch more of those two than just River's grand entrance in the library. Mwahaha.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 11:25:02	@LizCanTweet I'm very glad we have these chats on twitter rather than anywhere else so that there is permanent record of the Excellence.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 11:22:04	@LizCanTweet But how do you get Ten, Donna, and the merry Ponds together? That can't...oh wait. It's fic. And not likely to be plotty either
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 11:16:32	@LizCanTweet Who says they need to be around? They have their own bunk beds to go worry with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 10:54:20	@LizCanTweet YES. I will share ALL THE THOUGHTS once I get meds again and can focus for more than a minute at a time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 10:53:11	@LizCanTweet I need to settle on who. I've shippes 11/river since the byzantium, but some sort of hallucenogenic 11/tardis is also tempting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 10:34:37	@LizCanTweet I have all these thoughts about possible uses for tardis sex pollen. I blame you in the best possible way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 10:19:22	It would appear that thanks to @lizcantweet I associate all forms of sci fi pollen with sex pollen now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 09:18:24	@LizCanTweet @chidorme @mizujada I mean, i'm still not convinced by the doctor's explanation of the time-pollen-in-the-tardis, let's be real
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-11 09:06:03	@chidorme @mizujada @LizCanTweet but doesn't she count as parents though?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-05 03:27:43	Have short conversation about atrix accessories with @chrytonbaine , get insta-laptop spam. Wunderbar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-05 03:12:40	Funny. Removing my graduate degree from my service job applications has garnered me a few calls back. So, worthless master's, then.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-05 03:11:00	THIS. RT @tui_talk christine baranski has the world's most amazing laugh.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-05 02:56:12	@chrytonbaine plus, I do too much photoshopping and general fanon that isn't supported by a phone os.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-05 02:54:52	@chrytonbaine totally not worth it unless you're also in the market for a new laptop at the same time
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-05 02:51:07	@chrytonbaine Atrix, but not the laptop extension. Still wonderful though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-05 02:50:22	@pineapplecakes step in line, sistah
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-05 02:45:58	@chrytonbaine I love my android, it was such a good decision. The people at the store pushed apple hard as they could, though.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-04 12:14:51	@LizCanTweet My brain consumes crack at a rate comparable to a black hole. I have to feed it with something.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-04 12:09:52	@LizCanTweet I nabbed a copy years ago from... @labellementeuse I think. Right up there with Spock sings about Bilbo Baggins.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-04 11:37:03	@chrytonbaine Only if you're shaped like a molecule. Or really into the extremely abstract. I'm balls with everything that's not molecular.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-04 11:15:36	Just gon' sit here with some cell culture papers and make my science self feel better. Maybe draw some DNA too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-04 10:54:17	@chrytonbaine I know, but they could try. No harder to put a real DNA structure picture up instead of random molecules. Throw a dog a bone
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-04 10:50:34	@chrytonbaine I'd need another look to ID the molecules on that screen, but they're defs not DNA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-04 10:48:19	@chrytonbaine Still not DNA. I can draw that in my sleep by now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-10-04 10:43:44	Television tonight appears to have made a collective decision to throw ALL THE SCIENCE out the window. Aaaaugh.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-28 09:34:52	@mizujada I was three pages in when I decided its ideal for reading aloud.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-28 09:33:37	@dks2008 I enjoy that it offers a way to find humor in it. You can't make it through without finding humor somewhere.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-23 13:50:28	@tui_talk Not to perpetuate drunken kiwi stereotypes. Just that I tend to get drunk and then watch Outrageous and that keeps it fresh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-23 13:45:30	@tui_talk Seriously, though, The more I drink, the more I talk like a kiwi, the more I miss Welly. It's a vicious cycle. I need to get back.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-23 13:44:17	@tui_talk That's the problem with being so walkable. No one feels the need to deliver.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-23 13:35:51	@tui_talk I'm also very impressed that I can remember all that in the fairly drunken state I'm in. Gods, I miss Welly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-23 13:34:33	@tui_talk oooh yeah I can see that. my alternative was always ban mai on vivian st for some nommy thai. idk if they deliver though.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-22 23:00:44	@codainviere At one point, in another fandom, there was talk of a fic-helper database for people who know places, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-22 22:55:47	@codainviere Mmmm math. I love math too. And anthro! When I grow up i want a job that combines science and a little bit of anthro.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-22 22:50:29	@codainviere But back to my original point of ugh god fic set in places you know well written by someone who can't work a google search.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-22 22:49:30	@codainviere That's completely legit, yo. Me, I just love science SO MUCH. But you can't so it without degrees. Fuckers.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-22 22:43:04	@codainviere It really doesn't help my case at all that I only went there for grad school. Undergrad there would've been horrible.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-22 22:37:44	@codainviere It's the same thing with fic set in DC. I'm constantly screaming "NO! YOU IDIOT THAT ISN'T THERE GOD LOOK ON A MAP."

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-21 11:28:02	@roomerholmes Indeed. Frankly, I'm surprised the Penn Staters were that nice. But coming from the south, hospitality is a Complement.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 10:07:34	Thank god halftime has coincided with the only emmy category I really care about.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 10:02:06	Called that field goal failing as soon as they lined up. Still bitter about them trading Akers, can you tell?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 09:59:38	You ain't Akers, don't even try. Why did the Eagles ever trade Akers? Why oh why oh why.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 09:56:30	@pineapplecakes WAS IT?? THAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 09:54:01	Bitter about that TD call, don't mind me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 09:53:17	@pineapplecakes NO I WOULD HAVE FELT BETTER ABOUT THIS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 09:49:44	He didn't get two feet down, don't think that was a touchdown. Hold your roll, falcons.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 09:48:33	lol at Vick interrogating his players on the sidelines. YOU FUMBLED THE BALL BRO AIN'T THEIR FAULT.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 09:47:40	How many eagles does it take to stop a falcon with a ball? All of them, apparently.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 09:46:11	How about we not fumble the ball please?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 09:39:25	@pineapplecakes forever my favourite.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 09:09:18	Dude. Making faces and wobbling your fingers at Vick ain't gonna change he left your team. Deal, bro.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 08:56:17	The announcers are assuring me it's gonna be okay after the falcons TD. Do I believe them?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-19 08:34:38	So apparently Vick's gonna be sassy from the get go. Gonna be a good game

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-17 09:06:51	@mizujada And thus, my first legitimate feminist moment was born.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-17 09:06:22	@mizujada Which got: "I have a snatch and sometimes it bleeds. It's a biological certainty. Fact of life. There is no reason to be ashamed."
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-17 09:04:37	@mizujada Some woman told me off for carrying a tampon in my hand on the way to the toilet. Apparently that was vulgar, no one should see it

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-17 02:06:55	@quarantedeux As a result, I tend to think of these situations in terms of 'everything is dead quick let's salvage things' not in updates
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-17 02:04:53	@quarantedeux Right, options! My knowledge of this is solely from my "shit the windows boot loaders are irreparably corrupted must rebuild"

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 22:58:46	@mmdahlia27 welcome to the ADHD brain. It's madness all up in here
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 10:42:41	You guys, I'm gonna sleep tonight. I can't tell you how exciting this is. #ohstimulants #blessyooou #youletmesleepandiloveyouforit
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 09:02:02	@roomerholmes In every show, there is a first time for everything.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 08:53:31	@roomerholmes Jeremy would likely outpace him in the 'bago
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 08:26:14	Awww, Jezza interviewing his great love. #topgear
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 08:24:41	@roomerholmes I love so much that I can always turn on the TV at night and BBCA's showing Top Gear.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 08:21:02	@roomerholmes Indeed. I want a car that'll set off car alarms, tbh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 08:18:30	@roomerholmes That's one of the reasons I love this episode so much
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 07:50:01	@roomerholmes bahahahaha
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 07:07:41	@mizujada I used to do electrics in an ungrounded theatre! I ain't afraid of no lightening!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 07:02:49	Grilling my steaks in a sudden thunderstorm. Waving around long metal tongs like a boss.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 07:01:37	@mizujada @mmdahlia27 in my case, grad part one was easier than undergrad. Much easier.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 07:00:03	@ENbrian haha fair. But on the whole series three is mosy excellent. I've almost worked out kara remembers on the piano, so excited
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 03:39:50	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux Pretty sure they just get reblogged to spread the tears to other people. "I cried? TEARS FOR EVERYONE"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 01:54:35	@dani_dien You okay?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 01:46:32	I'm rather concerned that I already have nearly everything necessary for this mission saved on my computer. #notanerd #IJUSTLOVEHISTOLOGY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-15 01:44:30	Have decided to overwhelm the HPV-hater with SCIENCE. Graphs, facts, papers, histologic sections of cervical tissue... #itworksbitches
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 23:27:00	@quarantedeux Needless to say, he went away quickly. The real pity is HPV doesn't give guys cancer so you cant market it to them easily
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 23:26:03	@quarantedeux I had an ex who didn't think I should get it because its 'unnecessary' My family has p53 mutation, any prevention is necessary
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 23:22:53	@quarantedeux It also contains antigen to trigger you body's immunity to blatant stupidity. 's what causes the side effects but its worth it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 23:18:13	@quarantedeux I stuck a CDC factsheet about HPV in all its forms on facebook without comment. Apparently that was TEH EVIL or something.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 23:14:21	@pineapplecakes @quarantedeux My mom watched it with me on a rewatch and seriously thought they were an item.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 23:12:11	@quarantedeux I have ~feelings about the importance of vaccines. And even stronger ones about bad science for political gain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 23:03:40	I haven't talked to you in five years! At least! How did you even know I worked in that lab? Take your bad science and shove it up your ass.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 23:02:19	Woah. Just because I worked for the lead HPV vaccine investigator once does not mean you can come after me with politics and bad science.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 22:40:37	@quarantedeux @pineapplecakes Obviously my evil brain is turned way down to zero. That's the easiest thing ever!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 22:29:36	My last three employers are all SRS BSNS scientists. I don't want them to get "Hi, I'm calling from Olive Garden" calls. What to do?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 22:28:35	Guys, I have a major #firstworldproblem . Trying to get a waitressing job, but they all want my last three employers for references.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 12:06:14	@ENbrian haha nah, I was thinking of the Woman King: Helo vs.the racist doctor
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 11:38:26	@ENbrian YES. Except that it also contains the worst ep of the series. But is otherwise all around excellent.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-14 11:04:30	Ohhh Cavil and your giant boner for public execution. #bsgmarathon

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-13 03:44:06	@pineapplecakes my first thought was LIKE A MOTHER FUCKIN' BOSS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-13 03:43:43	That job looked like so much fun until it required a born-again christian spiritual testimony to apply. Guess my catholic ass isn't welcome.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 08:26:49	Rocky Horror as Hamlet. @LizCanTweet and I are geniuses. http:// bit.ly/r41cOA
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 08:03:46	@LizCanTweet ehhh. That breaks up the flow. I want one picture for the two of them. Just gonna stick with eddie's face. Better cap anyway.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:37:59	@roomerholmes Truth. We play so rarely, though. And it's guaranteed to be good football.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:32:09	@roomerholmes I can't imagine him retiring without dying. Unless we wrangle a perfect/near-perfect season somewhere. But even then...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:28:38	@roomerholmes I don't even want to think about football without JoePa. He'll probably die in the offseason one year and that will be that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:27:50	@roomerholmes it's awesome. no lies, I'm jealous. then again shouting "we are" at people running the USMC marathon got back "penn state!"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:26:03	@roomerholmes Me too. He's a hands-on coach, it's where he belongs. I think he does better that way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:25:09	@LizCanTweet I'm debating about using a shot of eddie's blood on the floor of the freezer for R&G. Thoughts?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:22:11	@LizCanTweet jesus woman, I'm not done yet :) I can't decide how I feel about all the colors. I have an uncolored version too...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:21:30	@roomerholmes We keepin' our football fashion amish style: nice and simple.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:19:39	@roomerholmes on the decently outside chance we win, that is. But god is it gonna be a good game.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:18:50	@roomerholmes ...yeah, you're right. for win 400 mom sent me videos of her dancing with the nittany lion statuette we have #gonnahappenagain
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:14:34	@roomerholmes The concept of spoilers for a sports game is somewhat hysterical, tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:14:10	@roomerholmes I'm so looking forward to that game. I'm recording it to watch when I get home from the Black Keys so I'm spoiler free.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 07:04:30	@lizcantweet this is what I've got so far... http:// twitpic.com/6i0arh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 03:57:53	The rivers would get fat from a storm named Lee #bsg
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 03:37:58	The local weatherman is practically giddy with all the time he's spending on camera.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 03:35:06	The nice thing about all this flooding is flood coverage has preempted all the 9/11 retrospectives.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-09 02:06:26	And there were lights. And it was good. #huzzah
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 21:44:03	@dani_dien no worries! Stay safe today!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 21:13:57	@dani_dien this is a terrible time to ask, but saturday? Black Keys? Question mark?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 21:05:00	I wish I had a boat atm, the urge to paddle main street in town is so massive. #flooding #makethebestofit
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 21:01:56	So this happened. http:// twitpic.com/6hstzg
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 20:07:03	Indulging in a little phone internets with brekkie. Still no power, but plenty of water in the basement.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 19:59:14	@cz_nz That is ny favourite line of the entire show. Hands down.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 12:17:36	Oh, lovely, the power's gone out. #sandbagginginthedark #soundskinkierthanitis
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 12:13:16	@ENbrian If we could fast forward past the booming to the world burning I'd be grateful. #getonwithit
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 12:05:09	@ENbrian Pretty much, yo. The last roll shook the lamp on the table.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 11:58:37	@mizujada It's been raining almost four days now. So long as it's just the next street over that's flooded imma not panic, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 11:53:35	Yes, thunder, I didn't forget about you either. I hear you shaking the house, I know you're back too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 11:52:07	Shitballs, team. The rain is back with a venegance.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:48:41	@LizCanTweet YES. AND CLAUDIUS GOT THEM TOGETHER. THIS WORKS SO WELL.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:42:28	@LizCanTweet He might be a better Eddie? Shows up once and fucks everything up.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:37:32	@LizCanTweet Wait. We need Brad.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:34:57	@LizCanTweet Ugh. Internet I don't want Glee caps. GTFO my lovely lovely movie.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:32:19	@LizCanTweet Also, I'm making this into a meme. Pretty graphics and all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:30:49	@LizCanTweet Hence, Patrick Stewart in a wheelchair. Have you seen the Tennant version?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:29:08	@LizCanTweet Dr. Scott!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:28:31	@LizCanTweet YES YES YES THIS FOREVER AND EVER THIS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:27:36	@LizCanTweet Now I'm getting images of Patrick Stewart in a wheelchair with a terrible german accent.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:25:53	@LizCanTweet And Eddie can be the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They're a package deal anyway.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:23:02	@LizCanTweet Riff Raff for Polonius!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:22:32	@LizCanTweet I have these visions of Ophelia singing toucha-toucha-touch me, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:21:59	@LizCanTweet *g*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:20:29	@LizCanTweet Hamlet: play in a play. RHPS: Floor show in a musical. If Columbia is Ophelia...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:19:02	@LizCanTweet You. Win. Forever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:15:53	@LizCanTweet what's more concerning is that #nc17hamlet probably exists.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:14:05	@LizCanTweet If Hamlet's coming out of the closet we need to have a whole reinterpretation of the play. And Laertes, probably.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:12:56	@LizCanTweet #sexyhamlet indeed. more like #nc17hamlet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 10:09:19	@LizCanTweet That line forever makes me think of the gag in Reduced Shakespeare. He comes before me!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 09:52:58	The excessive water is not helped by my mother running about yammering on about Agnes and the house floating away.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 09:46:45	Apparently the next street over is nearly underwater. I've never been so happy to live on a bit of a hill.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 09:37:14	@dks2008 somebody's trolling hard out.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 08:32:02	@codainviere we should obviously write tv that would be pure excellence
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 07:38:06	@codainviere I follow that. I want moar jeff goldbloom.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 07:30:50	BAHA THE WHITEBOARD IS BACK really you couldn't make a graphic? We're relying on an elementary-style lined whiteboard for flooding updates?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 07:14:19	Local news is using a white board to go over local flooding and states of emergency. Welcome to high tech central Pennsylvania. #dying
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 06:56:11	Well shit, that was the main street up in town all flooded on the national news. Last time we made it on was for creationism. Improvements?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 06:31:26	@roomerholmes It's a mountain up in State College. Very pretty, etc, also home to the mountain lions that used to plague the Ag school
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 05:49:52	@AramFingal Probably. I bet those cars make nice eddys to park a boat in to look a while.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 05:26:32	@AramFingal i'm not hardcore enough for the rivers that still need first descents. Main street, otoh...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 05:12:10	@AramFingal Then again, I view spontaneous flood waterways as an opportunity to paddle something new without travel.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 05:09:12	@AramFingal This is a gift from the whitewater gods. That can't end well. ...actually, if you're a stand up paddler that could be fun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 05:02:41	Also, guys I'm standing in the middle of the yard in the grass and there is water up to my ankles. #monsoonseason #inamishcountry
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 04:53:52	This creek is usually dry and an eight foot drop. Just look at that beauty. #whitewatergivesmefeelings http:// twitpic.com/6hi9vs
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 04:51:41	Neverending rain gives everything I want in a house: whitewater out the back and a moat. http:// twitpic.com/6hi8f4 http:// twitpic.com/6hi90w
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 02:54:47	@pineapplecakes do one every week for a few weeks. you can catch everyone that way?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 01:05:44	@chidorme @ljsgecko this is absolutely true!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 01:05:15	@chidorme so far, UCSD, UNC, and a Cambridge-NIH program
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 01:04:21	@ljsgecko @chidorme anyone to take my thoughts seriously as a scientist I have to have a PhD first #somanyideas #noonelistens #frustrating
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 00:37:28	@chidorme I started phd applications today. Once more into the breach.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-08 00:35:05	Hello new dinosaur friends. It's a pleasure to have you here today, welcome to my stomach. http:// twitpic.com/6hfe4m
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 22:11:23	"Watch out for the puffy paint." @codainviere NTSF IS SO EXCELLENT
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 12:26:40	@pineapplecakes it's like they knew it was coming. This will never not be my favourite ever. Plus, nothing to do with chocolate at all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 12:25:58	@pineapplecakes two days before this came on tv the guys next door spent three hours getting their laptops to play this in perfect sync
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 12:23:36	@pineapplecakes shit needed to be giffed though let's be honest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 12:22:54	@pineapplecakes IT AIRED ON ACTUAL TV DURING THE 2008 OLYMPICS AND I LEGITIMATELY FELL OFF THE COUCH LAUGHING. GOD LOVE NEW ZEALAND.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 12:19:59	@pineapplecakes GREATEST COMMERCIAL OF ALL TIME. http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=TnzFRV 1LwIo …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 12:18:09	@pineapplecakes I mean, I giffed a cadbury's commercial with a gorilla in it. it happens.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 11:37:43	@codainviere yessss. hit me with one too? I want to try but i hate getting disappointed by no responses to the ask posts.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 11:29:47	@codainviere please tell me you got my second ask. i went to rethink it but then i couldn't come up with another color.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 10:57:43	@patrickcarney I'm enjoying watching you troll my feed. Please troll the crowd at freefest too. #notagoodconcerttillsomebodytrolls
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 10:48:10	If you set my soul to music I'm pretty sure It'd come out as @blackkeysnews 's Everlasting Light.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 10:26:36	@LizCanTweet there aren't enough bunks to contain that, methinks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 10:05:00	@LizCanTweet ALL THE SHOWS CROSSOVER INTO ONE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 09:35:36	THIS. RT @quarantedeux I like the end of Daybreak plenty. If by "like" you mean "unable to stop sobbing (despite knowing what happens)"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-07 05:58:25	So apparently latex paint is somewhat water resistant. Definitely stretchy though. http:// twitpic.com/6h2xe2

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 23:21:57	@quarantedeux I like the end of daybreak so much more now tbqh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 23:20:26	@roomerholmes I'm gutted I'm missing the game live. How am I supposed to choose between Black Keys and Bama/PSU?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 23:12:23	@quarantedeux BAHAHAHAHA IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 16:22:11	It's not a party until the corpse starts spewing pepper spray #thecloser
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 16:18:24	@pineapplecakes question about the end tho. But i'll message it to keep spoils spoily
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 16:17:05	@pineapplecakes interesante. I think Taylor's tie is worse than the song tbh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 16:15:57	@pineapplecakes @MadameAirlock wrote the episode or the song?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 16:14:44	The Closer obviously hired an out of work songwriter this season.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 16:10:35	@pineapplecakes REWATCHING. IF I CAN'T SLEEP IMMA STAN ME SOME EXCELLENCE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 16:08:31	@pineapplecakes OTOH EVERYTHING IS CAFFEINATED CAPSLOCK AND SASSY GAY LAWYERS WITH TWIZZLERS AND NOTHING HURTS

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 15:56:58	SIXTEEN HOURS ON ONE CUP OF PRETEND DECAF COFFEE JUST LET ME SLEEP PLEASE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 14:57:58	Obviously the waitress at lunch thought I was kidding when I said decaf, I can't have caffeine. UGHHH I JUST WANT TO SLEEP.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 14:52:21	@ENbrian far more quality than the gifs i'm making. actual substance blogging. This concept eludes me.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 08:10:52	I love it out here. All I can see is rain, corn, and the lights from the horse and buggy coming down the road.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-06 08:05:01	I would really love it if my mother would stop trying to recreate children of the corn. In the rain. At night. By the institution. #hideme

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-05 01:17:51	Should have worn my "I'm the stig" shirt to the grand prix. Ah, well.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 08:40:09	@dani_dien want to come? It's down near dc, but you can crash with me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 08:37:09	Anyone have a desire to see The Black Keys (or anyone else playing at free fest this saturday? I have a spare (free!) ticket
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 08:24:36	THIS RT @pineapplecakes : Smurf turf is unnatural. You don't deserve to be a ranked team if your field is BLUE.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 03:18:53	Loving Utah State's coach shaking his ass all over the field though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 03:15:26	@pineapplecakes okay scratch that. This game is crazy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 03:13:13	@pineapplecakes least we ain't losing to Utah state
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 03:05:59	41-7 to Penn State. Good way to start the season. #weare
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 02:06:15	@dani_dien indeed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 01:47:34	Honoring Legends. Lol what a nice way to say "you're not good enough", Big 10.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 01:40:18	Did I read that right? Mississippi State 59?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 01:38:00	@pineapplecakes inferior hawkeyes pulling out some legitimately .teresting ball.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 01:35:49	Holy 89-yard touchdown, Iowa!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 01:34:38	@pineapplecakes so looking forward to some quality football stanning
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 01:28:11	28-0 not a bad way to enter the half
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 01:26:15	@pineapplecakes @roomerholmes dying.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 01:21:04	That was a little too close for comfort, McGloin.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 01:15:37	Why is the mascot humping a board? #pennstate
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 01:13:53	@roomerholmes gotta 'preciate the excellence.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 01:05:18	Aahhh, the first sack of the season. Feels so good. #pennstate
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 00:53:23	The best plays are the ones where even the cameraman seems surprised when the ball finally gets run out of the madness.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 00:39:56	None of this required weekly test nonsense during my football, please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-04 00:27:23	Oh, hell. I forgot football season means mom gets the nittany lion cowbell out. And the Beaver Stadium replica. And the Lion statuette.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 23:06:22	I have a spare ticket to Free Fest this weekend. Anyone want in for some sweet sweet Black Keys? (And other things)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 12:05:56	@mizujada @chidorme I came in on eleven and while I've dabbled a bit in ten, I don't think I have it in me to do the whole show.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 11:48:54	@chidorme And my dreams tend to be full of cracktastic nonsense and dinosaurs. I'm sensing a theme here...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 11:42:41	@mizujada @chidorme Suspenseful I like. Suspenseful I can -almost- handle easily.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 11:41:34	@chidorme I love being scared, but my brain doesn't let go afterwards. I'll be scared for the next week or two and that's the real problem.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 11:38:27	@chidorme Gotcha #horrorandcaitlin #donotmix #atall ...although I really rather wish they did.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 11:35:49	@chidorme Excellent. I think I'll (finally) add it to my list.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 11:34:36	@chidorme I made it fifteen minutes into 1408 before I gave up and I had bad dreams for a week.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 11:34:06	@chidorme Really? I loved Black Sheep for the camp, but the something-goes-bump-in-the-dark seems too much for me. Hmmm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 11:30:55	@chidorme i want to see it for the pretty, but I can't handle scary at all. Would you recommend it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 11:21:42	jesus, mary just get there so pictures can go up and I can go to bed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 10:51:21	@pineapplecakes It's probably a good thing I didn't go to D*C, I'd be driving through Atlanta stalking the GPS right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 10:49:31	@pineapplecakes I WILL GO DOWN WITH THIS SHIP.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 09:26:57	Why do I watch BSG when it's on when I could just stick in the DVD and have no commercials?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 08:33:14	@dks2008 I keep a bottle of jack under my bed for late night whiskey time. I feel you, to.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 08:30:50	@dks2008 I drink so much less being home. Not sure if this is good or bad.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 04:34:21	Guy on the other end of the phone interview was from Lynchburg. Oh, what a small, small world.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-03 03:54:37	Fifteen minutes to prepare for a last-minute phone interview? Bring it the fuck on.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-02 10:13:34	@dks2008 I still haven't unpacked. I don't want to acknowledge the move home as permanent in any way.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-02 10:03:09	Yes I will move around the world to work for you no one else has directed biotech education ministries. JUST LOVE ME OKAY.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-02 10:01:14	So about the two page letter I just shipped off to a NZ education ministry detailing all the reasons I'm perfect and they should hire me.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 23:56:41	@quarantedeux This person has obviously stolen my life plans and made it their own.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 23:56:06	@quarantedeux Yep, that sounds like me. I'd love to do an MD-PhD, the PhD for srs science and the MD for shits 'cos I love the material.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 23:55:12	I appreciate the offer, kitty, but I don't need any help typing my resume. Thanks though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 23:54:07	@quarantedeux YOU FOUND MY SPIRIT ANIMAL. I just want to do that, I can't believe someone actually did!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 23:02:43	@chidorme It's specifically included in the dirvers ed curriculum, but it's really only relevant in this area. Also driving around combines.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 22:59:58	@chidorme True that. It's nice being back up here, all I really need to watch for are horse and buggies.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 22:57:30	@chidorme And during the times they're monitoring the HOV's, there's no chance of you ever hitting anything near the speed limit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 22:56:47	@chidorme My theory is that all the Baltimore people who moved up to southern PA are messing with the system of bad driver identification
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 22:54:58	@chidorme My favourite is people who get pulled over in teh HOV lanes. Serves them right.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 22:54:22	@chidorme But at least we totter in the right lane. Marylanders hit PA and totter in the passing lane going 60.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 22:52:55	@chidorme Not that anyone actually follows them, mind.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 22:51:41	@chidorme Apathetic was likely the wrong word. More like horribly indecisive about where they're going to put their car #justpickalane
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 22:50:15	@chidorme I have spent all my time in DC traffic on the maryland side of the force. This is a good point.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 22:44:57	@chidorme The problem in DC is they're not just bad, but they're also apathetic. NJ/NY they're bad but aggressive. You can anticipate that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 22:44:02	@quarantedeux It's wonderful! Not so good to listen to come, say february when the awful weather won't go away though.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 08:06:29	@AramFingal TRUE THAT.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 08:05:47	@AramFingal Although I don't really have ~feelings about any particular NHL team. I just love me some hockey, any variety.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 08:04:43	@AramFingal YESSS THE CAPS. I just moved out of DC, their games are fantastic to go to!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 08:03:02	@AramFingal All the hershey leagues play on the ice at some point. So do the regional leagues. I spend a lot of time there, tbqh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 08:00:46	@AramFingal Fact. Absolute fact. Nothing is funnier than watching five year olds play on the Bears ice. They're so little!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:59:15	@AramFingal Except that drinking at the Under-5 league games is generally discouraged.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:58:29	@AramFingal ughhh hockey. all my family plays it. such excellence. especially if you like drinking while fucking freezing like I do.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:56:44	@AramFingal I made that decision right before they made the ALCS run but I'm so very glad I did. Also, I've grown up to hate baseball.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:53:39	@roomerholmes @AramFingal I would have been an Orioles fan but at the age of five I decided I couldn't take the constant heartbreak.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:51:32	@roomerholmes Like JoePa said, when your name's not on the jersey you have to do something else to get people to remember it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:47:43	@roomerholmes It's an instate thing. Seriously, MASSIVE MASSIVE rivalry. Not just football, but ALL THE THINGS
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:47:00	@AramFingal @roomerholmes UGH NOT THOSE ANYTHING BUT THOSE. I want everyone to have the simplicity of PSU uniforms. Easier that way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:46:00	@AramFingal @roomerholmes The problem with VATech is the huge rivalry is with the cavaliers and they're...well.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:42:46	@AramFingal @roomerholmes I LIVE FOR THE DAY. Please football gods let it happen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:42:09	@roomerholmes Sparty's good but wildly inconsistent. They'll beat OSU then lose to Minnesota.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:41:02	@AramFingal @roomerholmes It gets really boring when absolutely everyone around you is a diehard endgame PSU fan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:40:24	@AramFingal @roomerholmes I would love that too. Because this area's not football chaotic enough already.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-09-01 07:35:58	@AramFingal @roomerholmes Not entirely crap, Wisconsin did surprisingly well last year, and I like to think JoePa still has...something

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-29 06:20:22	@chidorme my thoughts exactly. I rather like the effect this has on everything we've seen so far
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-29 05:53:06	@chidorme seems some people are very, very angry with moffat now
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-29 05:51:25	@chidorme the line seems to be now her entire existence is defined in terms of a man and giving up her regenerations makes her less powerful

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-27 11:30:31	@quarantedeux true that. Gotta find something to do in the offseason.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-25 23:27:21	@sonacroi @codainviere I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO LEARN THAT. I wonder if we have one...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-25 23:26:12	@codainviere I used to play contrabass clarinet, shit was awesome. Normal clarinet no so much. What did you play?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-25 23:15:31	@codainviere i'm in desperate need of a project, and the only other option is clarinet. I never liked that piece of junk.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-13 04:32:24	@dks2008 they're wonderful I absolutely love mine. Take some serious getting used to though be careful in them.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 22:31:53	All this talk of what Sweet Briar means just reminds me all I got was a year from hell, loss of my shit, and an advisor who didn't notice.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:34:29	@AramFingal I think we've just identified the least appreciated players in football. What a way to live your dreams of playing in the NFL.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:31:56	@AramFingal Color me suitably impressed. I couldn't tell you who the snap is for the Eags.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:28:46	@AramFingal I thing the long snap jersey would have to be personalized too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:23:13	@AramFingal But seriously, do they even make those? What about for tight ends? The puns would be endless.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:22:44	@AramFingal Especially not the one punting for the Ravens tonight.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:21:51	Lawlz. RT @AramFingal : @funkasarusrex I need to look into punter jerseys. No one appreciates the punter.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:16:31	@AramFingal True that. So under appreciated.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:12:30	HOW DID I MISS THE NEWS AKERS SIGNED TO THE 49ERS? My Eagles jersey is an Akers jersey. #wellshit #gonnawearitanyway
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:06:56	@AramFingal The only thing that makes me happier than than is watching Ohio State lose.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:04:05	@chidorme @LizCanTweet I could totally be persuaded to that with very minimal arm twisting.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:03:34	@AramFingal tbqh, I'm actively anticipating watching them loose as much as I am eagles winning more games.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:02:22	@LizCanTweet And monday would be such a good choice for my birthday shenanigans, but I'm in the wilderness sat till next friday. Hrm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 11:01:44	@AramFingal Unfortunately our crap teams sometimes play very well. They're not just consistently crap.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:59:07	@AramFingal It's so nice to have options, isn't it? ;)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:57:00	@LizCanTweet When d'you leave for the West? I'm in town tomorrow afternoon to check on the house again...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:56:32	@AramFingal Is Dalton starting for the Bengals? Did they decide that yet?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:52:36	@LizCanTweet Obviously we need to plan a whiskey fun night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:51:08	@AramFingal AAAAUGH THE HORROR
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:49:34	@AramFingal Even though the thought of a bengals/bills game makes me want to headclutch
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:48:46	@AramFingal I second that. I'm pretty happy that game shaped up pretty well to some not-entirely-terrible football.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:45:15	@AramFingal I stand corrected. That cannot be disputed.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:43:54	@AramFingal But it's better than CBS commentary. That's the worst.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:42:29	@AramFingal You would think that would be the logical path but someone forgot to mention that to them.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:41:54	@AramFingal Not recently. Mostly the Giants.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:40:37	SUCH TRUTH. RT @AramFingal : @funkasarusrex How lucky! All three fan bases are such joys! *shifts eyes*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:40:03	@AramFingal Not as bad as being an Eagles fan in DC. Shit, that's deadly!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:39:33	@AramFingal Truth. Thankfully they're out of conference, I don't have to worry about that too much :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:38:37	@AramFingal It is! I'm in the strange eags-ravens-steelers bermuda triangle
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:37:16	@LizCanTweet Wait, you don't drink whiskey neat? I can teach you some wonderful mixes!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:36:40	@AramFingal We get philly everything else, so it usually balances out somewhere.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:36:08	@AramFingal I didn't know that, interesting. I figured it was just because both local ABC stations are out of baltimore.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:34:36	@AramFingal Hahahaha fair enough, I just wish I had an option for something else.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:34:17	@AramFingal The only way that could have been worse would have been an ending in an interception.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:32:04	@AramFingal YES YES indeed. And it's so very blatantly pro-ravens commentary it's not funny.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:31:04	Two end-zone receptions in a row, both out of bounds. Well played, #ravens . Well played.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:30:07	This is legitimately the worst football commentary I have ever heard. #ravens #eagles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 10:15:38	Dropping the football one yard shy of the endzone? Wop wop. #cravens
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:46:52	@pineapplecakes My reality crack is Project Runway tbh
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:46:07	@pineapplecakes Duly noted.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:45:18	@pineapplecakes Confession: I've never seen any BB ever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:44:57	@pineapplecakes He? Realz?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:43:14	@pineapplecakes @roomerholmes When ya'll tweet about Brenda on BB I get very confused as I assume Brenda stan is Closer stan. #failure
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:40:41	@pineapplecakes We play the Steelers next week. It'll be unusual neighborhood war: part 2. Gods save us all.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:37:55	@pineapplecakes This is going to be so much fun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:37:44	@pineapplecakes @roomerholmes YES CANNOT WAIT. I've been so long without people to stan football with. What get for going to women's college
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:36:07	@pineapplecakes Oooh excellent! But also disappointing, we're not likely to play each other.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:35:12	@roomerholmes Hahaha yeah, I showed up to the party after the last football season ended.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:34:52	An interception in the endzone is always exciting #flyeaglesfly
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:32:42	@pineapplecakes Most accurate description of the Eags ever. What's your team?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:31:57	@pineapplecakes Them and their fucking towels. The house down the street has a ten-foot towel they hang out in the postseason.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:31:14	@pineapplecakes True. But he actually served his whole sentence, so I'm fine. Ugh don't get me started on the Steelers fans.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:28:41	@pineapplecakes i thank my stars I wasn't born in DC, then I'd be a Redskins fan and that would be terrible terrible terrible
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:27:52	@pineapplecakes Just because we always choke in the postseason doesn't mean we're not quality.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:25:37	@mizujada They're playing all rookies and n00bs this half. I was expecting horrible football, this is actually pretty good!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:23:18	@pineapplecakes Bitch, please. I love my turdy birds.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:22:43	@pineapplecakes Eagles/Ravens. Two of the three major in market teams, people are shitting themselves with excitement.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:21:58	@pineapplecakes Oh god my condolences. At least I'm getting bad football from quality teams.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:21:03	@pineapplecakes What game do you have?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:19:29	@pineapplecakes YESSSSS YES THIS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:19:21	This is surprisingly quality football for the second half of a preseason exhibition game.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 09:10:39	@ljsgecko Aw man talk about a lack of quality football! My condolences. Not that what I'm watching right now is in any way quality.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 08:55:34	Oh, preseason football. Gotta love the flags-on-every-play game.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 08:48:11	It's fun to watch your team and only care about saving face with the neighbors.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 08:47:34	I quite wish there were more meaningless NFL games of purely local interest like this one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 08:43:15	@ljsgecko what team markets are you in out there?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 08:42:45	@ljsgecko Will do, but you're not missing much. I have a feeling all the quaity football happened in the first quarter with the starters.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 08:35:33	I live in such a rich football market. Eagles, ravens, steelers and some substantial skins and giants fanbases as well. We get all the games
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 08:29:04	INTERCEPTIOOOOON and half the neighborhood cheers, the other half boos. #neighboorhoodbonding #ornot
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 08:20:27	I love that we have an option: ewatch the game on the station out of bmore or philly. Pick your team's commentary!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:55:25	@tui_talk I read it at camp (for adults with devlop disability) one year and promptly completely lost my shit.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:53:45	@tui_talk It's my goal in life to get as many reasonably intelligent people to read that book as possible. Defs the scariest thing I've read
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:52:48	@tui_talk haters gonna hate. they can kindly exit through the airlock. It's just making me happy Flowers for Algernon is as high on the list
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:44:05	@tui_talk I have hope things will change. On a related note, this entire conversation just started rolling into my phone. It's gone mad!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:41:30	@tui_talk And L'Engle! She'd be on there too,
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:41:13	@tui_talk Truefax. I have this feeling we'd all be happier with things if "YA" was included. LeGuin'd have another few spots, for instance
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:39:12	@tui_talk looking for the poll, y'know?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:38:28	@tui_talk Very very true. Tbqh, I listen to NPR every day and didn't know this was happening. I feel like the poll voters are those who went
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:36:16	@tui_talk It's very true. But several of those books have HUGE out-of-genre appeal (like Brooks), and so bring in more votes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:33:15	@tui_talk Really my only thoughts about the list were "yeah, Tolkien again" and "BOO YES FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON" that book does not get love.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:32:21	@tui_talk I never considered that to be YA? Ever?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:31:09	@tui_talk But that's less of a thing these days, but as the list commentary points out, you're likely to score better if you've been around
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:30:38	@tui_talk Not saying that men make greater authors, just that historically the best female writers tend to stay out of the genre.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:29:56	@tui_talk Not really. Great authors tend to produce more all-around fantastic books than authors who have one really good hit, IMHO.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:28:42	@tui_talk They do though! LeGuin is on there twice.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:27:43	@tui_talk They excluded YA from the list, so Earthsea, etc. wasn't elligible.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:27:05	@tui_talk have you read the list commentary as well? http://www. npr.org/blogs/monkeyse e/2011/08/11/139346998/nprs-top-100-science-fiction-and-fantasy-novels-parsing-the-results …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:24:56	@tui_talk @neilhimself The list isn't 50/50 female authors, but it's a good chunk of female authors. But the genre isnt 50/50 authors either
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:22:20	@tui_talk Bradbury got four slots too, and none for series. I'm saying it's not as bad as it may seem at first glance.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-12 07:13:44	@tui_talk But it's not 14 out of 100, it's like seven out of less than fifty. Even @neilhimself is on there four times.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 22:59:28	11 AM and Not My Cat and I are on our third nap of the day. Today is going to be a very good day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 22:49:39	One of my fighting neighbors got pranked. Ravens flags replaced with Eagles ones and green 'n silver streamers all over the place. #love
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 22:20:02	@codainviere I'm too lazy to dig through twitter but how was it?? Did you have an awesome time? Were the ladies super adorbs again?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 09:28:07	@codainviere MY JEALOUS FACE IS SO HAPPY FOR YOU.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 08:18:21	@chidorme A wise, wise decision.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 08:00:57	@chidorme Eagles. Always. I love my turdy birds. Ravens, presumably, for you?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 07:58:12	@chidorme otoh, FOOTBALL. TOMORROW. YESSSSSS.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 07:57:06	@chidorme VERY TRUE. I'm hoping this is just them working out their excitement for the season with beer and shouty bits.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 07:54:55	@chidorme Only in the post season, usually. But that requires the eags to get their shit together all season
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 07:52:50	@mizujada Usually it's the Steelers guys three houses down which cause all the problems with the Ravens kids next door.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 07:52:07	@mizujada If football was religion, I think I might live in Jerusalem. This is a rare occurrence though. Eags/Ravens don't play very often
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 07:47:31	If the arguing is this bad today, I can only imagine what it's going to be like tomorrow during the game. #flyeaglesfly
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 07:43:44	Sweet zombie jesus people, it's a Ravens-Eagles game, not world war three. I think my neighbors might actually kill each other.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-11 06:40:47	I believe the question isn't so much 'Who was in hitchhiker's guide?' but is rather 'who wasn't in hitchhikers guide?' This is wonderful.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-10 02:26:41	@dks2008 I can't see why not. Spread and let it set, you'll be oily for a while but it hydrates really well
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-10 02:23:35	@dks2008 Have you tried Vitamin E oil? Works a treat. Best suggestion I ever got from the Magruders.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-08-10 02:21:19	@dks2008 Last time I got a bad burn I did a weekend of swing dancing and the sweat made my dead skin look like leprosy. It's the worst.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-30 10:57:05	@quarantedeux THE MOST HORRIFYING THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-30 07:51:09	Going to start calling Not My Cat River Pond. Seems kitty hates the TARDIS noise too. I've never seen that cat move that fast.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-29 09:12:59	@bezybee the chick in line behind me has four fedoras on her pile. Madness.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-29 08:39:37	Buying my first non-kayaking swimsuit in five years. Shocked by all the spanx and giant fucking push up bras. I just want a normal suit!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-27 06:14:41	@mmdahlia27 She's a loner cat, and they have three cats. Lilly likes it better over here. They've offered her to me, someday she'll be mine.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-27 06:13:37	@mmdahlia27 She's my parent's neighbour's cat. She splits her time between houses. We pet her, they feed her and keep the litter box.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-21 12:15:16	@chidorme in small fandoms, there's more focus on just turningout love for the work, but when the love is inescapable...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-21 12:12:32	@chidorme I always thought it had to do with the size of the fandom
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-21 12:11:44	@chidorme I can see that, although i never noticed excessive hating on the books (the movies, however...)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-21 12:04:06	@tui_talk Oooooh?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-21 12:03:35	@chidorme What do you mean?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-21 12:03:11	@chidorme Or a dateline piece.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-21 11:59:54	@chidorme All fandoms have their pervy bits, why did it have to be HP fandom to knock it out of the park?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-21 11:58:37	@chidorme I think it's the grownups who commit most of the really twisted stuff. The downside to a truly multigen fandom?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-21 11:54:39	@chidorme TRUTH. They had it coming. (heh) I got in deep and then got scared off, and I'm hard to squick.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-21 11:51:16	@chidorme The ultimate revenge to the pervy 2/3 of that fandom. Out Mary Sue the twelve year olds on ff.net.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-15 05:17:01	@jasminemdjones I can send you some shots of me that should solve your problems :)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-15 03:25:16	@chidorme @mizujada Case in point: Mary McDonnell is up for one for an ok guest spot in The Closer when she should have had several for BSG.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-08 05:07:51	It's strange, at one point in my life I'd've been going absolutely bonkers over all this HP awesomeness. Now I'm just mildly excited.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-08 04:37:03	@qikipedia Any news on when the next series will air?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-08 03:29:05	I can't get over how much nicer my monthly budget looks now. I might send my pharmacist a thank you note. Or maybe one to Alza. Them too.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-07 07:47:29	@tui_talk This is very true. Random question: do you refrigerate your eggs at home? That was the biggest culture shock when I got to NZ.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-07 07:45:22	@tui_talk I don't like eggs on their own and they don't like me. I'm trying to find ways to not have to have them around
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-07 07:32:34	@dani_dien Me neither. Actually I don't know if I'll be instate then but I'm getting excited anyway.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-07 02:16:29	Baking with mayo as an egg replacement is very successful but it takes three times as long to bake. Sill though, didn't have to buy eggs!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-01 23:01:29	@mizujada Preclinical tests showed a slightly elevated risk of thyroid cancer so it will never be allowed for something not life threatening
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-01 23:00:15	@mizujada Easy answer: the FDA. Pets can't sue for damages from a potential carcinogen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-01 22:54:19	@mizujada Ergo, it's a lot easier to protect against something very different from native cells if similar it's hard to just kill the bug
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-07-01 22:47:46	@mizujada The real problem is that vaccines are most effective against viral infections and malaria is caused by a protist- a eukaryote.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-06-28 07:54:25	My computer may be dead, but thanks to the wonder of all-in-one copiers I'll still have plenty of resumes for the job fair tomorrow #bitchin
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-06-28 06:36:51	Anybody familiar with ubuntu? I'm going to try using it to salvage files off my dead computer, but I've never used it before.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-06-28 05:00:11	@chidorme Hexxus is my all-time fave cartoon villian. I loved him as a kid, and now that I get all the entendres I love him even more.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-06-21 10:44:52	@sarahnathan7 It was great hanging with you this weekend!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-06-21 10:39:56	Denying myself nutella has produced some seriously bamf lit-chic nails. Not a bad way to spend an evening, if I do say so myself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-06-21 09:59:02	NOTE: Drinking rum after you've used it to put words on your freshly painted nails is not a good idea.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-06-19 06:02:54	@mmdahlia27 You know, I never really understood the attraction to the Awful Waffle. Guess it's the Yankee in me?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-06-16 10:45:52	Downside to filmed theatre: no complete shaming of people who talk by the entire audience. Just my smattered ineffective shushing.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-18 10:07:27	@LizCanTweet AGONIZING SHOW IS AGONIZING. It's been 24 hours and I'm still tweaked out by the finale. #quality #suchquality
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-18 06:14:09	@jasminemdjones Passing the time by creeping on cars for you. This is way more fun than it should be :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-18 02:46:53	Dear @Georgetown , the administrative hold music will haunt me for the rest of my life. Adds a nice christmassy touch to my nightmares though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-18 01:32:17	@mmdahlia27 ME TOO. It's one of those excellent episodes you need to see more than once to get a handle on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-17 21:41:58	@sarahnathan7 Oh no! Catch up! It was an excellent hour of television
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-17 11:52:15	@dks2008 You bring me joy. Have fun with your PLCs!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-17 09:58:09	@mizujada I did! Thank you so so much for letting me tag along! It's fun hanging with you guys :D

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-17 07:07:09	@mizujada That's what i figured. Should have covered the jar first, though. #iswearthemicrowavewasalwaysred

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 10:55:52	@pineapplecakes Salinas is way more exciting than Bladerunner. I fully support this plan.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 10:38:37	After a fun night of tweeting Blade Runner, @edwardjolmos crushed the dreams of millions of BSG fans. Standard night. http://bit.ly/mhSN4l
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 10:20:49	@OneNoteMule Now how exactly does that work? Does Lee knock up one of the natives?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 10:02:36	@ljsgecko Huh?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 09:54:15	It's always the Sixes which have god complexes. #royandhisnails #movienighttweet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 09:49:56	Have you also seen a star go nova, Roy? There's this guy called Cavil, has the same thoughts. #movienighttweet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 09:41:09	@edwardjolmos I can't tell if I'm watching Bladerunner or Wolfen right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 09:39:32	"worst glory hole ever, roy" i have the craziest friends. #movienighttweet #bladerunner
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 09:24:43	@edwardjolmos So THAT's why we never saw the sevens in BSG

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 09:09:26	Just like the Admiral, Deckard needs to spend some time at the sink during intense emotional scenes. #movienighttweets #bsg #bladerunner

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 08:23:47	@pineapplecakes SUCH TRUTH.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 08:21:31	They don't neeed harrison ford and his gun, they need Laura Roslin and her airlock to run retirement. Efficiency. #movienighttweet

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-16 07:56:17	@edwardjolmos Theatrical cut or director's cut?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-15 08:18:41	That was an excellent day indeed. So nice to see so many people at #SBCgraduation11
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-15 03:03:07	"Minnesota! ...what state is that in?" @hasminemdjones is crazy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-14 14:10:42	I've been drinking for nearly twelve hours now. I should not be this sober.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-13 12:00:38	@chidorme I constantly wonder why they let me out in public.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-13 11:56:15	Someone please convince me that a cylon flash mob in the Smithsonian Hall of Human Origins is a bad idea. #bsg #galactifyeverything
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-13 11:52:26	Hey @dks2008 tell me things about colorado! I might be moving there...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-13 08:51:21	@mizujada @LizCanTweet This is a very exciting fact of my life!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-13 07:49:40	The keg store knows the department chair by name. My program is AWESOME. #alwaysorganizingeverything #sometimesitsfunthisway
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-13 00:48:52	@mizujada @ljsgecko We had torrential rain all senior week last year but gorgeous weather on the day. I hear they've have a gorgeous week...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-13 00:38:20	@mmdahlia27 my life gets more and more surreal as the semester continues
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-13 00:37:37	@mmdahlia27 I roped her into looking over a fic for me that is evidently much sadder than I had the capacity to realize while writing it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-13 00:36:43	Had half a tall iced coffee with my interview. Now I'm all OMG CAFFEINE WHAT ARE WORDS LOOK AT THE SHINY THINGS. #caffeinesensitive
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-12 10:08:58	'Sometimes you have to troll the hard six' is the best thing to come out of my best friend's mouth her entire life. #newlifemotto
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-12 10:08:16	@sweetgreen I didn't get a chance to pickup a shirt at #sweetlife (too afraid to leave the pavillion) is there any way to get one now?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-12 09:01:34	That awkward moment when you can't tell if someone is recruiting you to their PhD program or hitting on you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-12 08:34:25	http://twitpic.com/4wfpw0
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-12 07:35:13	You guys, I just re-found my old livejournal icon-making account from YEARS ago. I can't even...what? What was I doing with my life?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-12 07:15:29	@LizCanTweet But all the best quotes are taken entirely out of context!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-12 07:10:39	@LizCanTweet Crack to make it better? http://archiveofourown.org/works/198318
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-12 06:25:29	Seriously though @LizCanTweet your response fills me with happy. I was so afraid I'd lost the point in all that flashing about.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-12 06:24:21	Things I did today: interviewed for a PhD program, took a final exam, ate a hamburger, and made @LizCanTweet cry.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 20:39:57	@tui_talk All that talk of sevarfrith and astafrith and all kinds of german language spams started following me. Where are the Speech spams?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 20:26:13	@stephenfry Incongruous?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 13:13:33	@tui_talk I can totally see 'Mela's wedding: Her, some alien cocoa trafficker, and Kit trying to keep from traumatizing Helena's kids
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 13:11:07	@tui_talk And if you were trying to marry someone of another species? AW MAN. So much comedy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 13:09:50	@tui_talk Possibly. But you're not likely to be out to your grandma or your great aunt mildred. And they'll want to be at your wedding.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 13:07:20	@tui_talk I was thinking more logistics. I could be asking the same questions about a marriage between two wizards.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 13:06:18	@tui_talk Sooo that fic I sent you? That was immediately relevant to this conversation. And now I'm really just curious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 13:01:41	@tui_talk That's defs something to be concerned with. Also you'd need a body. We haven't encountered any of those yet. @dduane
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 12:47:53	Hey @dduane ! Let's say your planet is sevarfrith. Burial by local customs? If so, where do you put the day-glo christmas tree?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 12:38:35	@tui_talk Excellence: Achieved. I have so few people to bother with these thoughts these days, the twitter was the best way :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 12:08:23	@tui_talk I obviously meant sevarfrith. But that doesn't change the need for an explanation of the day-glo bedecked evergreen by the casket
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 12:06:51	@pineapplecakes @kateesackoff I guess when you're an honorary Adama you get into the family business too
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 12:04:26	@tui_talk So have you ever wondered how a wizard's funeral would go on a planet that's astafrith and observes local burial customs?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 11:18:04	I accidentally bought a bottle of Perrier yesterday. Now it's on sale. CAN'T STOP.THE BUBBLES ARE SO GOOD #fourthbottletoday #mybubbles
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 11:12:25	@bezybee I mean, I'm sure they're desperate for money but this is a strange way to go about it...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 09:43:46	@tui_talk Truth, I've forgotten entirely what it was about. Rereading this would be a good idea eh?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 09:41:25	@tui_talk Totes!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 09:36:38	@tui_talk My love for you continues to grow after all these years. Speaking of picking things apart, did you ever get the fic I sent you?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 07:39:39	@tui_talk That was without a doubt the strangest birthday of my entire life. And I'm usually at a camp for adults with mental retardation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 07:35:20	@tui_talk @kitsunerei88 I get the same red face every time I remember I wedged a chuck norris minivan against the side of your house :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 07:09:44	@tui_talk @kitsunerei88 Hahahahahaha I totally am no worries. Just confused. But a lot of old peeps are popping up on the new fb group
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 06:53:25	@tui_talk @kitsunerei88 Erm. Huh?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 06:27:36	I would really love to know why Sweet Briar just started sending me library overdue notices a year after graduation...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-11 05:45:33	Please, someone take photoshop away from me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 10:06:41	Castle tonight has an adama and a santos in it. EXCELLENCE #allthetvshowsrolledintoone
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 09:54:00	The worst part about mondays? Having to watch #DWTS while waiting for @Castle_ABC to start.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 09:06:20	@LizCanTweet Phew. Had me worried there for a second.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 08:44:22	"Somehow, in time, I'm going to find a way to blame this on Jerry Falwell." Aaron Sorkin is ALWAYS relevant to my life. #sportsnight
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 08:43:38	@LizCanTweet WAIT WHAT it isn't on till 10, right?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 07:48:34	@chidorme @papagena665 @LizCanTweet Poirot and his little grey cells will always be my one true love.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 07:45:11	The music in sports night is surprisingly similar to the Firefly incidental music. SO DISTRACTING.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 07:21:25	@mizujada @LizCanTweet Nevermind! It has arrived!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 07:06:21	@mizujada @LizCanTweet I checked them all, but I didn't see one. Where did you send it? #futureproblems
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 06:54:05	@LizCanTweet @mizujada Color me confused?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 06:45:12	@papagena665 @chidorme @LizCanTweet I get the feeling this is one of those Poirot/Marple things. You always love your first the most.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 04:46:38	@papagena665 Well, little in comparison to ALL THE OTHER DOCTORS. And this would be my first foray into the fandom.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 04:45:56	@papagena665 I've heard so many good things about River Song, I want to see what it's all about. Plus,there's little of the 11th to catch up
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 04:40:22	I'm thinking about starting with the Eleventh Doctor once finals are over. Thoughts?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 04:39:27	@chidorme @LizCanTweet Real life. So overrated.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-10 04:39:11	@PhiBetaKappa @chidorme I always enjoyed the exercise bra-breast movement iPod chargers.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-05 21:48:04	@mizujada @papagena665 TRUTH. The trip from frederick to silver spring is 45 mins at 6, two and a half hours at 6:30.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-05 21:27:14	@papagena665 Timing always helps. I find it's easier to go well before seven or after nine-thirty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-05 10:20:07	@mizujada According to @qikipedia , handicapped/disabled access is a dalek conspiracy. I'm inclined to agree.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-05 10:14:28	The fact that I was the only one who was astonished by that is proof positive that I'm the only chemist in my program. Yay @SBCChem !
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-05 10:13:19	Fact: DuPont originally developed both GC AND DSC and didn't retain the licenses to either. My mind has been completely blown.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-05 09:53:44	@butterandguns @joysonism You had me at Battlestar Galactica. It's mostly a question of how many people I can rope into it with me :)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-03 11:29:57	@tui_talk I'm so glad I was having post-concert euphoria last night and missed the news until this morning. Less raging at people that way
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-03 11:26:26	@tui_talk And I thought the conspiracy theorists over here were going mad...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-03 09:47:29	@dks2008 That's the exact same mistake that put me on someone's running of the brides team. Madness :)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-03 09:18:14	@mizujada I do, and we should! Definitely!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-03 09:17:53	@mizujada Often, yes. I'm not near a metro station, so I typically bus everywhere. Plus it's cheaper!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-05-03 09:10:37	The man at the back of the bus just stood up and took a piss. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. What do you do in this situation @metroopensdoors ?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-27 08:56:30	@mizujada I believe the internet is watching glee, if the madness of my tumblr feed is any indication
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-27 06:42:22	@mizujada The part which needs the most advertisement, indeed. Then again, I also scoff at the visit lancaster adverts, since that's home

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-26 11:47:49	@LizCanTweet Ta :) This is my first one, I'm SO EXCITED.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-26 11:28:22	@LizCanTweet I didn't write any of it. Just contributed to the knowledge base of the larger project, so I get included as an author.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-26 11:27:33	@LizCanTweet 6th author on a 15-author paper of which mine was a small piece of the large project. i only know two of the other 'authors'
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-26 11:13:55	I'm getting published ?!?!?!!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 10:15:26	@LizCanTweet My mom said that to a girl in a dressing room yesterday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 10:15:00	I guess @qikipedia isn't always right- sorry, @stephenfry , that's the sign for x (or need), not Ronald Reagan. Good effort, though! #asl
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:56:41	@LizCanTweet Looks like it's only available by disc now anyway. They also did the scottish play, midsummer, and much ado
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:54:16	@mizujada @LizCanTweet HP was the first I discovered fandom and all the fun you can have
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:51:54	@LizCanTweet It's streaming on netflix, i believe
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:51:34	@LizCanTweet @mizujada True facts: as I age and find new fandoms, I ship the good ships cannon more than the slightly scary ships slasher
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:47:46	@LizCanTweet Have you seen the BBC's shakespeaRe-told? She's fan-fucking-tabulous as The Shrew.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:43:14	@LizCanTweet @mizujada I tend to just hide from the fandom in general. I got in deep and realized the depths it's gone to and ran away
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:36:36	@mizujada @LizCanTweet Truth. Those are the ones written about the weasleys.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:35:52	@LizCanTweet @mizujada Probably. Or it could have been JKR herself, considering the mary sue she published at the end of deathly hallows

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:33:11	@LizCanTweet @mizujada I'm pretty sure I saw a malfoy family fic once that had the same title.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:28:06	@LizCanTweet @mizujada I only ever read the other boelyn girl. I'm glad I'm not missing much :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:23:51	@LizCanTweet I bet she'd be the supernatural fandom. I don't know much about it, other than there's a lot of incest, which she's all about.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:21:37	@LizCanTweet Also, are those the Dear America princesses books on your top shelf? #creepcreepcreep #bookshelfcreeper
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:20:29	@LizCanTweet If Philippa Gregory was just a ficcer in a fandom somewhere, everyone would love her.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-25 09:09:32	@mizujada @LizCanTweet do I want to know what you two are up to?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-24 04:13:54	@tui_talk truth. But easter's not an unbelieveable commercial holiday, either. Also, it moves every year.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-23 22:54:57	@sarahnathan7 although it does add a nice layer to col. Brandon, makes her rejection 'cos he's old seems less shallow

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-23 13:39:37	@tui_talk I can't tell you how stoked I was that Vic gave the long weekend. The downside to full separation of church and state, i guess
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-23 13:28:16	@tui_talk Although Easter weekend isn't the standard long weekend over here. Most places don't give any time off
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-23 13:27:32	@tui_talk Hee. I have a great love of traditions, and I was raised catholic. I'm never getting out of it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-23 13:19:10	@tui_talk I am so jealous of your life. For me, Easter means I will reek of incense for a week.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-17 14:49:12	@tui_talk I get those feelings when Josh goes after the trekkie temp, not so much from the lemon lyman madness
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-17 14:37:12	@tui_talk See, that always makes me laugh! Reminds me of when i first discovered fanfiction.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-17 14:01:47	@tui_talk Are you watching TWW for the first time? I'm so jealous of you if you are. I'd love to do that again :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-17 13:20:32	@tui_talk Also, Two Cathedrals is the best hour of telly ever made, IMHO. The Cathedral is just up the road, i get a little teary on the bus
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-17 13:19:13	@tui_talk Series two is my absolute favorite. Series four comes in as a close second though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-17 07:20:44	@mizujada Compare a chicken and t rex skeleton and you'll never be convinced otherwise.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-16 23:59:43	@behrlie Real or pretend? Either way have heaps of fun!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-16 10:05:03	oh no oh no the mosquitoes have returned.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-15 09:44:40	Scratch that. I put the piracy in conspiracy! #arrrrr
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-15 09:38:59	You can't spell conspiracy without piracy. #iamabrilliantgenius
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-15 08:46:09	@lizcantweet it doesn't have to be crafted, it just has to be awesome! You have that in spades
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-15 08:43:05	@lizcantweet can we have a drunken story writing party sometime?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-15 08:32:57	@mizujada i just figured out how to optimize everything i've done so far. Tomorrow is going to be an excellent day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-15 08:30:13	I love that very delicate level of drunk where your work output is optimized. #thesisyouaremybitch #bringiton
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 12:40:47	@Brooke_Watts Good luck friend! I'll keep my fingers crossed
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 12:24:51	@Brooke_Watts Fight for who you want! I didn't fight, it'll totally be worth it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 12:19:07	@Brooke_Watts Not as satisfying as the baby you really wanted, but I thoroughly believe it all works out in the end.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 12:18:39	@Brooke_Watts Sometimes people will be bitches and your life will suck balls, but then a year later you get Dean Green for a baby
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 11:08:14	This might just rank as one of my favourite muppet sketches of all time. Beaker goes on a trekkie cruise http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=aar_-2 oLvmw&feature=share …
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 10:42:06	@chidorme @LizCanTweet That's a gauntlet not even I would throw
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 10:40:03	@chidorme @LizCanTweet We already knew that! :P
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 10:39:12	@LizCanTweet @chidorme New game: we get life points every time we make her say that. It seems to happen regularly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 10:37:21	@LizCanTweet @chidorme @mizujada Could be included in the mutation. Facultative aerobic mutated tastebud tongue heads. I could make that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 10:35:05	@LizCanTweet I feel compelled to share my favourite fanservice that I can think of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr5yCyLdvIE
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 10:34:26	@chidorme @LizCanTweet @mizujada Maybe the little heads could eat foods you don't like so you don' have to taste them?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 10:26:49	@LizCanTweet Truth. Or when House wakes up from being temporarily dead and says to Wilson "I love you" My flist EXPLODED that night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 10:21:39	@LizCanTweet Those are always the best moments. One of my fave BSG scenes falls directly into that category.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 10:16:21	@mizujada Frankly, I'm amazed the poor, beaten little thing still works. It's dented, the corner of the screen is cracked, but it keeps on
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 10:14:31	@LizCanTweet Fanservice at its best.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-14 09:57:03	Laptop, my iPod is almost six years old. I don't think a scan will fix the drive. Thanks for playing, though.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-13 23:06:03	Living the good life. RT @dks2008 is there anything better on a rainy day than van morrison, hot tea, and a comfy sweater?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-13 12:14:54	@LizCanTweet My best friend used to work there, but she was a fiddler. Less variation in that one
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-13 11:59:52	@LizCanTweet I was thinking of the Renn Faire, actually :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-13 11:52:27	@LizCanTweet You were a blackfriar at one point, weren't you?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-13 11:50:12	@papagena665 @LizCanTweet I've never heard of it before, it looks awesome!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-13 11:44:52	@LizCanTweet @papagena665 Family Reunion '11
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-13 11:44:28	@papagena665 @LizCanTweet The ones we get are geared toward older women. Less fantasy, more flab-hiding.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-13 11:36:47	@papagena665 That's the one I was thinking of! I expect they're women who were kicked out of the purple hat club for smoking pot out back
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-13 11:31:33	@papagena665 I always laugh when a women's catalog advertises "personal massagers" for your back which are obviously for another body part
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-13 00:29:23	Whoever decided to send Beaker on a Star Trek celebrity cruise is an unbelievable genius. #muppets #win
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-13 00:21:39	Dying of laughter at the @georgetakei spots on muppets tonight. "We've been rammed by the Battlestar Galactica cruise ship!" Poor Beaker.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-12 21:49:18	@tui_talk And I'm even a committed CJ/Danny shipper! It's just so hard to miss out on those two.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-12 21:48:40	@tui_talk The second half of series seven. Gaza, Noel, 17 people, Bartlet's third, SOTU, 12 hours in America.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-12 12:16:14	@xoxohappy @smlindemann I enjoy the coincidence that the line played as I read your tweets about #QVproblems
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-12 12:11:34	@xoxohappy @smlindemann Does that make the muppets communists?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-12 12:04:07	@xoxohappy @smlindemann Ya'll will appreciate this timely quote from the muppets: "Oh yeah? Well better dead than red!"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-12 11:59:12	Muppets Tonight was definitely not a kids show. This is HYSTERICAL.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-12 06:11:38	@dani_dien Anything interesting? I haven't made it to any of the meetings either

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-12 05:23:28	@JoshMalina @EliBraden I believe the accurate statement is you don't have to be stoned to enjoy GOOD reggae.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-12 04:47:24	How have I never comprehended the glory which is Muppets Tonight before? Miss Piggy doing the salad scene from When Harry Met Sally- WIN.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-09 07:39:36	FRAK YES. I won tickets to @NerdNiteDC from @BYT ! Birth control, explicit lyrics, and robot overlords. Should be an excellent night.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-05 12:14:02	Sweet lords of kobol, a sentence containing my name and 'had some spare black powder laying around' should never be allowed to happen.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-05 12:11:02	@ljsgecko @chidorme But if you say, had some black powder laying around...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-05 12:09:09	@ljsgecko @chidorme The easiest way is to take the lightbulb out of a microwave and nuke those suckers. Requires no other chemicals or flame
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-04-05 12:05:04	@ljsgecko @chidorme I can explode those too if you want! I have to put my chemistry degree to good use SOMEHOW

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-24 10:43:01	@LizCanTweet that paper. a diatribe on the road less traveled. some insane fic #thingsyouwrotewhenyouweresixteenthatshouldneversurfaceagain
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-24 10:40:08	@LizCanTweet Not enough plot, too much reliance on the environment as a character, Joseph was a child molester, racism is overdone...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-24 10:38:30	@LizCanTweet Aggghhhh I barely remember what I had for breakfast, let alone a paper I wrote junior year of high school :p
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-24 10:36:48	There's a high likelihood that I got offered a post-graduation job today, but I'm not entirely sure what happened in that conversation. Ummm
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-24 10:36:17	@LizCanTweet I wrote a six-page paper (HUGE, back in high school) detailing all the reasons I thought it was terrible. I own four copies now
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-24 10:34:19	@LizCanTweet The first time I read it, I hated it with the firey passion of a thousand burning suns. I read it again and it's my fave now.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-22 11:09:24	@xio811 SO TRUE. The number of RFR/Degrassi crossovers was excellent though. In my brain they're competing high schools or something
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-22 10:37:44	In honor of what's trending, I'd like to point out that Radio Free Roscoe was 1000x better than Instant Star at its very peak. #RFR

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-11 12:33:43	@LizCanTweet Truth. I have an entire playlist of only songs which are epic enough to be played during rooftop shenanigans.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-11 12:30:53	@LizCanTweet Also the observatory field during a thunderstorm is an excellent excellent place to be.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-11 12:28:19	@LizCanTweet I have this thing about roofs. I love them. I like dancing around on them late at night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-11 12:25:56	@LizCanTweet I used to dance around during rainstorms on the roof of Guion. That will forever be my favorite thing to do.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-08 21:05:40	@enbrian Have you heard about 17th Precinct? It's got half the BSG cast and its written by RDM. More excited for that than BSG:B&C
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-08 12:58:06	@ljsgecko I should have waited to start BSG till after I'd seen all of Caprica. I used to like this show SO MUCH.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-08 12:53:26	Watching Caprica is not so exciting. In 50 years, they'll all die in a nuclear holocaust if they're not dead already. Done.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-06 13:36:51	@LizCanTweet I can't tell you how much I wish I was kidding. I thought people like that only existed as the douchey villians in 80s movies
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-03-06 13:31:41	@LizCanTweet The reworks only work if you avoid changing any of the major, critical characters into monsters.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 13:07:16	@LizCanTweet @chidorme WEREWOLF!ROLF NEVER STOOD A CHANCE AGAINST MOTHER STAKEPERIOR.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 13:06:04	@LizCanTweet @chidorme TSOM and South Pacific are the same musical-same war, same issues, with nurses instead of nuns
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 13:04:21	@LizCanTweet @chidorme But it would also be a world without Carousel, and that is a better world.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 13:00:58	@LizCanTweet @chidorme They're already PWP but not in the good way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:59:44	@chidorme @LizCanTweet I'm just trying to figure out how hairy Rolf would be during the full moon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:58:04	@LizCanTweet @chidorme I grew up on them too, but there's no love lost there.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:55:03	@chidorme @LizCanTweet THATS HOW TO GET RID OF THE FIANCEE. She'd make excellent werewolf noms. #iamabrilliantgenius
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:53:49	@chidorme @LizCanTweet Rogers and Hammerstein are boring and predictable. It's much better if someone gets eaten in the second act.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:52:07	@LizCanTweet @chidorme Also, the hills are alive with the sound of werewolves (AOOOOOOOOO) with howls that have haunted for a thousand years
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:51:09	@LizCanTweet @chidorme its safe to sleep
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:50:52	@chidorme @LizCanTweet Remove nazis, insert werewolves. Climb every mountain, search high and low...stake every werewolf till
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:47:59	@chidorme @LizCanTweet On a completely different note, have I told you guys about my attempt to redo teh sound of music with werewolves?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:46:48	@LizCanTweet @chidorme I can only imagine what my reaction to this conversation would be if I had no idea what the hell was going on.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:40:04	@chidorme You can't haze the willing, my friend.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:36:40	@chidorme @LizCanTweet this is exactly why getting boosy with the old women at church choir practice and then getting on twitter is awesome
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:35:29	@chidorme @LizCanTweet I just want to carry you guys around as a Crowning Moment of Awesome of every single day.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:33:17	@LizCanTweet If you did that to me, me response would be "Thank you ma'am can I have another?"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:30:55	@chidorme Allow me to draw you into my crack den of tremendous crack and anthropomorphism.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:24:57	@LizCanTweet DO IT DO IT DO IT #everythingiscapslocktonight
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:23:58	@chidorme JUST WAIT. The nightmares from my somehow-the-tap-club-hats-are-male unrequiredangst!slash will BLOW YOUR MIND.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 12:09:34	@LizCanTweet WHAT IS THE QP AND WHERE DO I FIND IT I want to read your fannish shamessss (omg the bunnies they keep coming make it stopppp)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 08:15:13	@lizcantweet truth. And this may not be the most cracked thing to come out of my brain, either.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 08:03:18	@LizCanTweet @magnoliamae27 I'm going to need a brain transplant when I'm done with this and I'm sending the bill to you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 07:41:28	@LizCanTweet @magnoliamae27 If this thing goes in the direction it wants to, you're gonna need id to read it. WHY BRAIN, WHYYYY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-25 03:29:20	The plural of thymus is thymi. This is my new favourite plural word.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 12:13:54	@chidorme @behrlie SO TRUE. Finals? No sorry I'm sewing Beethoven onto this hat for the Dean.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 11:43:09	Just tried to turn off the tv with my cell phone. We've obviously not had enough to drink yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 11:14:34	@LizCanTweet You laid the gauntlet, I must respond. This shit is bananas. We're such slaves to our cracked brains.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 11:06:44	@LizCanTweet Truth. PS I'm working on the tap club fic. There is something seriously wrong with me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 10:55:23	@LizCanTweet Considering the depths of depravity that fandom lives in, its not suprising.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 10:47:59	@LizCanTweet As you can imagine, the fandom wank hit the roof and most of the hp fic moved off LJ
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 10:46:14	@LizCanTweet I don't really remember anymore, but some prominent hp ficcers got shut down during a sweep of child porn LJs
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 10:40:13	@LizCanTweet yes, an Ell-Jahy. All the fic is there! Or, it was anyway before the harry potter-child porn debacle.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 10:31:30	@LizCanTweet I'm glad you share my thoughts on crossover fic. It just doesn't do it for me (although the rare one is AWESOME)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 10:30:33	@LizCanTweet You don't have one yet? You've made it THIS LONG in fandom and haven't gotten one? That's just plain impressive.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 05:45:41	Really, american TV? Really? It was the second giant fucking earthquake in six months. Let's not immediately blame the government. UGH #eqnz
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 05:45:18	Just saw a story on american TV where the reporter tried to lay blame on the desturuction on the lack of rebuilding regs after sept #eqnz
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-24 05:34:28	@LizCanTweet Han...Solo? That Han?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-23 11:39:15	@Colin_Hanks Hanson, age 9, Hersheypark Arena. My aunt snuck me in backstage to meet them before, and then got me a spot in front.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-23 10:53:29	I obviously need to make friends with a cat burgaler for these impossible occasions.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-23 10:46:18	I have my keys in my hand, but im locked out of my apartment. Shit team, its cold out here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-22 11:12:08	@matisyahu You've just inspired my new roadside cardboard sign. "Will analyze dreams for concert tickets"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-22 10:58:51	my saucy mince is fine, panic mode can shut down. Still have high hopes that things go well in chch. #eqnz .
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-22 09:43:01	I need to get off the internets and stop reading about #eqnz until I hear from my biffle she's alright. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-21 16:54:29	@tui_talk Truth. Can the cicada be found, or is it lurking?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-21 16:48:20	@tui_talk I highly recommend old science textbooks for just this purpose.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-21 16:42:45	Also, it appears having coffee today was a serious PLC. It's almost 4 AM I JUST WANT TO SLEEEEEEP #caffeinated
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-21 16:34:21	My kiwi friends are SO AWESOME. Haven't talked to some of them in more than a year, but are willing to help a friend of mine moving to NZ.<3
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-21 14:27:34	@tui_talk , meet @hookedONphotos . She's moving to welly in a week!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-21 10:35:28	That awkward moment when you are passaging your cells alone in the lab while doing glissandos and discover someone came in half an hour ago.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-21 02:21:40	Someone in choir told me she's calling me Joan from here on out because I remind her of Joan Sutherland. I have no idea who this is. Help!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-19 04:48:12	Admit it, I'm the answer to all your problems.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-18 11:41:15	I love that every week when I come home from church choir I'm drunk. Catholics FTW.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-18 06:57:41	@papagena665 Best description of that performance yet.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-18 05:35:16	Tip: to make your eyes focus in two directions at once, stare into a microscope with one eye for an hour and a half.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-17 13:32:23	@cleveradjacent what if they'd played it when she came out to present a grammy?!?!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-17 11:43:01	@slightlystoopid at @930club . WHAT AN AWESOME NIGHT THIS MAKES MY HALF-BIRTHDAY
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-17 03:15:08	@papagena665 BUT IT WAS AN AWESOME STAGED READING. You got this in the bag.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-14 13:01:00	Apparently the mass my choir sings at is also the mass Joe Biden goes to every week. How have I not noticed this?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-14 12:10:44	I really, really love the commercials target does for special occasions on tv.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-13 12:53:12	@i_see_the_sea Remember that one time Drake got shot on Degrassi and we prayed for him in Fr. Cawley's class the next day? I miss you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-13 12:03:31	@girten09 Yes, it's a bad idea to drink to the mindfuck ones.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-13 11:55:18	@girten09 Dude, mindfuck movies are where its at!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-13 11:18:11	I need a new West Wing drinking game, there isn't enough drinking in this.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-13 10:26:14	I NEED TO JUST BUY SEASON 4 OF THE WEST WING. It took me waaay too long to find a disc full of episodes I like.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-13 09:14:39	@dks2008 I'm boozing and west wing-ing tonight. want to join?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-13 06:39:05	Let's just discuss how excited I am there there's rugby on my tv right now. Sure, it's just highlights from the sevens, but still. RUGBY.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-13 06:31:10	@Lord_Voldemort7 This is true at all times except when you're applying to grad school.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-13 06:25:46	@cleveradjacent @edgyasasatsuma I AM TOTALLY GOING TO THAT TONIGHT. WIN.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-12 14:01:59	@labellementeuse Alas!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-12 13:56:19	@labellementeuse wait there's one of those? Really? It appears we're enabling each other!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-12 13:54:32	@labellementeuse Also, there cannot be enough Outrageous gifs in the universe, just sayin'

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-12 10:39:10	@LizCanTweet @madelinead Yes, thank you! I can't believe my brain blanked out on that one.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-12 09:32:38	QUICK QUICK my brain has completely blanked out. What's the classic book where one guy uses another's words to woo a woman? #disbelief
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-12 09:00:18	@LizCanTweet See, now I was contemplating angsty UST. This takes it to a whole different level of insanity.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-12 08:54:57	@LizCanTweet lovelovelove. My brain is only starting to pick out a response to the gauntlet you threw last night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-12 08:36:34	@LizCanTweet although there's something to be said for the puns available from a bum/ass setup.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-12 08:35:55	@LizCanTweet I love that PNP/TNT gets classified as an OTP. My brain seems to want to do angsty pnp/asses
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-12 08:30:47	@dks2008 I am so jealous of your life right now.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 13:06:08	Not if I have anything to say about it. #onedaytheworldwillbemine RT @LizCanTweet #onedaytheworldwillbemine
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 12:58:48	@chidorme I did the same thing with @OFwestside , and only one person who follows me has any idea what it is. Yours are at least entertaining
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 12:53:08	@chidorme When I get around to watching this show, I'm rereading your tweets to fully appreciate the lulz.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 12:52:13	@LizCanTweet The only class I regret dropping during undergrad was Chaucer. I took stats instead, and never did finish the math minor. #FAIL
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 12:48:58	@LizCanTweet I can't argue with that logic. #truestatements
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 12:45:38	@LizCanTweet now this, THIS makes my brain hurt in bad ways. Mostly because the only person I've heard speak middle english was Dr. Tamburr.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 12:36:56	@LizCanTweet @chidorme I'm reading over my feed, can we discuss how much I love both of you right now?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 12:14:49	@LizCanTweet @chidorme Actually, it's not anything. God only knows why its rated explicit. Let's ignore the fact that I gave in and read it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 12:11:58	@chidorme @LizCanTweet I'm going to run away from what I found and comfort myself with the Rosencrantz & guildenstern/muppet mashup instead
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 12:10:41	@chidorme @LizCanTweet FALSE ALARM. http://archiveofourown.org/works/85120 To read or not to read, that is the question.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 12:06:55	@LizCanTweet @chidorme Also I've gone looking for muppet slash, it doesn't appear to exist. (Thank god, I think.)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 11:59:24	@LizCanTweet I've had some crack banging around my head for a while now, be afraid be very afraid.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 11:57:51	@LizCanTweet @chidorme I am SO SAD I came so late to the #bsg party. I haven't been this hooked on anything since high school.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 11:53:05	@LizCanTweet @chidorme I need to get past my newly-developed and completely insane #bsg obsession, and I will.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 11:48:33	@LizCanTweet @chidorme ...I don't actually know anything about merlin? I got stuck on the idea of muppet slash.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 11:44:44	@LizCanTweet @chidorme Alright, I'll see how much crack I can fit into some text. it me with a fandom, please.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 11:41:17	@LizCanTweet @chidorme I now feel the need to commit some truly terrifying fic just to live up the hype.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 11:37:08	@LizCanTweet @chidorme Mwahahahahaha
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 11:33:02	@chidorme @LizCanTweet I'm only a menace if I start committing some fic. It can be in my brains and not have catastrophic effects, yes?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 11:30:16	@chidorme @LizCanTweet My brain just exploded a little in the best possible way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-02-11 06:52:56	@enbrian it sounds like they're planning on airing some world cup matches too. This is a most excellent development.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-23 08:15:40	@dks2008 I was never this cold in EnZed. And knowing the Vic House living conditions, that's saying something.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-23 08:12:20	I can live the rest of my life under these blankets, right? My heater's broken.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-18 20:56:11	A snow delay is so much less exciting when your first class starts after it ends.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-18 13:29:16	@tui_talk PS I have a much less crackish YW fic I'm aiming to finish by the end of the month. Will you look it over, please?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-18 08:52:34	"He was up all night working on his project. But that's what you get when you have a science geek for a roommate" SO SO TRUE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-18 08:32:01	@papagena665 It was worth a try :) Also I'm watching Meet the Robinsons right now, I forgot how much I love this movie.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-18 08:24:45	@papagena665 It's a silver qwikset, nothing remarkable. I guess I'll just have to wonder, eh?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-18 08:10:35	@papagena665 This may just have to remain a mystery for the ages
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-18 08:10:15	@papagena665 Yes, the fraggle. He came sitting in a small packaging box, and when pulled him out of it today I found a key. Very curious.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-18 08:03:13	@papagena665 I found a key in the bottom of his box today. Did that just end up there at one point?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-18 08:02:28	@papagena665 Think back to when you tapped me and with my hat you gave me an awesome Wembley...

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-11 12:16:03	@andyblair1212 Twitter suggested I might know you, and I'm very confused how it knew I know you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-11 12:09:24	@chidorme Perhaps it's part of getting old, like wrinkes and conservativeness.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-11 12:03:10	@chidorme No book or movie has ever made my cry before but something about those two has me tearing up at every turn. So strange.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-11 11:58:06	@chidorme I also have a high expectation that I will be bawling like a little baby at the end. When did I become such a girl?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-11 11:57:12	@chidorme I have high hopes. And then I have the end of Caprica (prequel series) to watch, which will be as unsatisfying as firefly #sad
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-11 11:50:09	@chidorme @LizCanTweet Ahahahahahahah this is so true.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-11 11:49:24	@chidorme Technically 4.5 but really just four whole ones and a move or two. I'm only four episodes from the end! almost there!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-11 11:47:00	Adama and Roslin are the cutest and saddest couple I've yet encountered. I tear up a little every time they do a scene. ughhh #bsgmarathon

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-10 11:56:31	@bezybee @xoxohappy Now THAT was drama. Drama so big Cheryl got involved. I hope for @xoxohappy 's sake that doesn't happen again.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-10 11:47:10	It all went well and I'm still crying. #bsgmarathon , the things you do to me.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-10 11:45:31	@bezybee @xoxohappy Also the many rounds of "where do we put the freshman?"

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-10 10:39:16	And if all this goes badly, I'm going to end up bawling. #bsgmarathon
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-10 10:34:20	I feel like if all this goes well, I'm going to be doing a lot of flailing and awwwww-ing the next few episodes. #bsgmarathon #socute

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-09 15:05:07	@ljsgecko Oh good, I have faith then. I just hit the trial, and I'm getting a bit bored with all the preaching that's been happening
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-09 14:56:15	@ljsgecko And the #bsgmarathon spreads a little further! Is it just me, or is the second half of series three kind of dull?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-09 10:57:35	@chidorme Now I kind of want to put that statement to the test.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-09 05:51:39	And then Gaius Baltar had a cylon threesome. What timing. It's time to start drinking, I can't handle these people anymore #bsgmarathon

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-09 01:55:46	I've hooked two other friends into my BSG marathon, one is texting in from new england. I love my life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-09 01:02:22	Overheard: @lizcantweet : I'm still almost as verbose on Twitter as I am in real life. Too early to call... http://tumblr.com/xef17vtd4y
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-09 00:20:45	It's supposed to snow a little bit more, so it''s completely reasonable to stay in and keep watching BSG, right? That's what I thought too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-08 21:47:49	@papagena665 It brings me joy that we both tweeted about snow at the same time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-08 21:45:37	Snow? Excellent.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-08 21:39:16	@emnybo What book are you using?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-08 21:39:03	@emnybo That is the very best way to use your time in the early morning
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-08 12:29:29	I dragged a friend over for noms so I would stop my BSG marathon for a while. Turns out its his fave show. #missionfailure #backtomarathon
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-08 12:26:15	@Colangees If its any consolation, you're not the only nerd doing that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-08 11:27:15	@papagena665 When in doubt, blame the produce.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-08 08:31:08	I'm incredibly glad I started watching Battlestar Galactica this week. Classes don't start until weds, so I can gorge on it without worry.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-07 01:41:50	@unrepeatable I am equally excited, even though I'm only halfway through BSG and I never really liked Archie. I have a whole new appreciatio

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 13:01:07	@ljsgecko Moments like this are the real reason you never got rid of those giant undergrad science textbooks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 12:58:21	@chidorme87 I think of the crucible with Winona Rider.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 12:54:59	@papagena665 @LizCanTweet @chidorme87 This is truefax. But the same could be said of the entertainment industry at large
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 12:44:55	Yessssss @hulu just posted the last five episodes of Caprica #excitement #goaheadjudge
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 12:43:28	@chidorme87 @papagena665 I was thinking the Justice League on ice would be pretty neat, but SeaWorld could have coasters. Much better.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 12:23:26	@papagena665 @chidorme87 @LizCanTweet They say because gingers have no souls we can't read, I guess I'm really ahead of the game then
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 12:21:41	@LizCanTweet @chidorme87 @papagena665 In that case, Julia should be the one to get worried...

86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 12:06:11	@chidorme87 @LizCanTweet Organs first, then potential energy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 12:04:34	@LizCanTweet Although interestingly enough the amount of potential energy in you body, if harvested right, could do that.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 12:03:52	@LizCanTweet There is, however, a limit on the number of earth-shattering kabooms I could induce in you. :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 12:01:00	@LizCanTweet That questions would be very easy to answer had there indeed been an earth-shattering kaboom.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 11:56:06	@LizCanTweet The road to an earth-shattering kaboom is paved with awesome intentions.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2011-01-06 11:54:53	@LizCanTweet Life philosophies like that are why the world needs to be worried about me becoming a research scientist

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-25 14:05:50	On the other hand, have unearthed a stash of Mikes that dust levels date to high school. Young me was smart enough not to drink it. Good cal

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-23 11:56:12	@GALadmiss They couldn't fund trials for their discovery, so they DRANK BACTERIAL CULTURES to prove their point. Badass.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-23 11:50:33	@GALadmiss In that spirit, we should note that the two Aussies who won the Nobel for linking H. pylori and ulcers are badass scientists.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-16 10:38:29	@jasminemdjones Come crash with me then :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-16 10:06:29	@papagena665 That's what I say! Carrying capacity and all. Still kind of terrifying though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-16 09:28:55	@papagena665 The really terrifying ones are the ones that get around modern medicine. Like the non-asian hantavirus strains. Eesh.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-15 07:49:02	@papagena665 Have you already gone through Fraggle Rock? Took me at least a week and a half to go through them all ;)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-14 08:17:38	I had lab all day, so I keep thinking today is thursday. Seriously need to figure out my days of the week.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-14 01:19:32	Going to lab, missing the Penn State- Ohio State game. My life sucks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-13 10:38:26	@chidorme87 I would SO get in on that deal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-13 06:54:18	@labellementeuse I've heard it's true. I shall never know firsthand, but a few friends have said it's not too bad. Also, you never know!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-13 06:47:08	@jasminemdjones It's 5:45 on a friday! I'm amazed that that surprises you.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-13 06:37:16	That was at once the easiest and hardest final I've ever taken. I'm somewhat confused now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-13 06:24:56	@labellementeuse But once you're here and have stable job, it's easy to get permission to stay!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-13 04:29:10	Peanut butter final time. Best way to spend a friday evening.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-12 10:16:42	Tomorrow, experimenting with a recipe for funfetti from scratch. Who wants to taste test?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-12 09:46:57	No Davies classes anymore means eleven pages of notes makes my hand HURT. I can't decide if I do or don't miss that about Sweet Briar.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-12 03:53:08	Ten points if you can figure out what that's a flashcard for.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-11 22:46:37	@labellementeuse I do the same thing when I'm opening a Pomegranate. So messy, but so worth the end product.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-11 11:45:57	Laundry done, bed made, dishes washed, dinner cooked, brownies cooling, rug vacuumed, printer (hopefully) fixed. Homework done? Nah.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-11 10:48:59	Mmmmmm Brownies.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-11 09:45:53	@lenamorrill oooo what happened?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-11 08:46:57	Somehow, I think it would be easier to buy a new microwave then to get all this stringy squash out...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-11 08:11:03	So that's what happens when you explode a spaghetti squash in the microwave...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-11 07:14:03	"the text is so dry, it makes the biochem text read like a torrid sex novel" Gotta love lecture with Lab Prof.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-11 02:59:03	@chidorme87 It's Precrastination! The very best kind. You do something to avoid doing what you don't want to do.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-11 00:50:41	I'm pretty sure my lecturer just laid out an analogy between cancer drugs and bus terrorism.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 11:21:34	@dks2008 Hell, it's more humane than forcing someone to listen to Sean Hannity. That's a terrible place to be.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 11:16:57	my new fave past time is skyping my kiwi mates and convincing them to drink with me even though it's mid-afternoon there right now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 10:45:52	Drinking and listening to radio interviews about the last #outrageous means funny accent. Totes making calls to confuse people. Hee hee hee
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 10:29:52	WANT THIS. RT @grabaseat West is best! gonna have an Outrageous Fortune themed flight to co-incide with the OF exhibition at Auckland museum.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 10:22:44	Drinking and listening to radio interviews hyping the last #outrageous episode. WARNING: I'm talking in a funny accent.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 07:20:07	Officially hiding from the internet until I can download the final episode of @OFwestside . I will NOT be spoiled for this ep. #outrageous
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 07:18:10	@GALadmiss J.E.A.L.O.U.S. Enjoy, enjoy! I'd love to see her lecture!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 07:17:04	Last episode of #OFWestside tonight! So gutted my favorite show is ending. How will I get my weekly dose of Kiwi now? #outrageous
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 04:52:06	Just got an American Samoa quarter! I didn't know they were doing the territories too! So exciting
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 01:35:54	I spent all weekend in classes and studying and now I have absolutely no concept of what day of the week it is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 00:21:10	@chidorme87 I take no responsibility for the things my brain comes up with during exam times :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-09 00:06:35	@chidorme87 For some reason, today my brain referred to you as JPatt Diddles. Not sure why, but I like it :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-08 13:09:21	@chidorme87 @behrlie Or farther south- it's going into summer in the southern hemisphere!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-08 12:07:00	@chidorme87 ME TOO. I fear for the rest of the winter, it's too early to be this chill.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-08 10:56:06	@ljsgecko The worst part is that this class is ridiculously easier than Biochem with Dr. Jill.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-08 10:55:16	@ljsgecko Biochemistry. Transcription/translation and nucleotide synthesis. Only half the binder's for this test, four slides to a page.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-08 10:23:33	3" binder. Flashcards. http://twitpic.com/34xqdx
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-08 09:04:03	I can walk at night without fear. This stack of flashcards is large enough to beat anybody up with.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-08 08:20:31	And we're on to flashcard pack number three for this test. Two more lectures to go, nearly there!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-08 08:19:26	@madelinead My deepest condolences.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-08 07:30:08	just my luck. The best male specimen in the program is also that kid everyone hates who's a douche in lecture. #betteroptionsplease
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-08 07:10:23	@labellementeuse That's me and facebook every week after OF episodes! Never thought I'd be sad to not have to do that anymore.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-07 23:37:32	@dks2008 Did your check liver light come on this morning?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-07 14:08:06	I'm really happy daylight savings give me an extra hour to study for my exam.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-07 14:06:46	@dks2008 Pretend no knowledge until you next talk to your parents. Then feign ignorance!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-07 12:56:25	"Hey baby let's get out of here and make some overlapping degeneracy." I LOVE SCIENCE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-07 10:55:54	@dks2008 You expect somebody to get anywhere close? Even Bear Bryant only made it to 323. Plus all his wins are with one uni. Not six.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-07 09:42:06	@dks2008 I mean, we're only at six this season. But I'm pretty sure that 400 wins record is gonna stand forever.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-07 07:14:02	What a game. So fitting for the 400th. #wearepennstate
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-07 07:11:52	I SAY JOEPA YOU SAY TERNO! I SAY 400 YOU SAY WINS! Further proof that Joepa is, in fact, God.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-07 07:10:48	@dks2008 Oh, how the mighty have fallen. And JoePa just hit 400! WHOOO!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-07 03:46:21	Stimulants are such a hot commodity that they're hard to get even legit. And if you're actually in need, you defs don't need another hassle.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-07 03:42:05	Aside from mocking people with MR, NOTHING pisses me off more than people taking ADHD drugs to get their homework done.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-06 10:24:31	Hee hee. A flash card on degeneracy. http://twitpic.com/349ivr
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-06 08:51:54	Oh Pandora, you always know what I need to hear. If you were a religion, you'd have me on my knees.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-06 08:08:37	I can't tell you how nice it is to be happy and good again :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-06 08:08:19	You know what's funny? I think we can trace all my madness of a year ago to how badly my poor little heart broke two years ago when I left.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-06 07:35:26	This time two years ago I was bawling my eyes out on a plane bound for Auckland and then the States. I miss Welly. Aotearoa me te arohanui

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-05 04:56:54	This isn't even a long lab, and we've all gone insane. We've been dancing, singing, and swapping drinking stories with Lab Prof.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-05 04:38:27	Head of the program just stuck his head in and told us we're having too much fun in lab.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-11-05 04:30:56	"Does it need stroking?" Oh Lab Prof your giant TWSSs make lab awesome.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-31 14:31:48	"Did you just pull that out your twat?" Way to call it Cheryl. #outrageous

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-31 13:43:41	There's drunk, and then there's too drunk, and then there's obvs way too drunk. If you're gonna take advantage of that, let's not be friends
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-31 06:19:38	@kkategormann Tomorrow will be just as bad, the marathon's closing heaps of streets.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-31 05:38:40	Seven police cars flying down the street in DC is only strange when there is no limo with them.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-30 09:30:21	My apartment is so full of people. Family has landed. Don't quite know what to do with myself.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-30 07:05:31	@SBC_Voice What? Details, please!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-29 09:36:17	@madelinead Except I think I'd rather hang it from a tree in my backyard with a gauzy canopy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-29 09:29:31	@madelinead ME TOO that is my new interior decorating goal.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-29 07:59:33	I joked about me & my lab partner messing up our labs. Lab Prof said "I'd be worried. If yours doesn't work, no one else's will." So nice.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-29 07:35:57	I have never wanted yum yum sauce more than I do right now on my chicken and broccoli.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-29 07:33:43	@dks2008 That I don't know. Eating in lab is not encouraged. You don't know what bacteria that's touched etc, etc.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-29 06:53:18	It's even better when Lab Prof doesn't realize he's in a four-hour innuendo sesh and drops some beautiful that's what she saids.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-29 06:52:09	You know it's going to be a good afternoon when the first step in lab is pipetting something identical in color and consistency to semen.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-28 01:42:19	It's been so long since I've been legit sick beyond a cold or stomach bug that I don't know what do to with myself. I want my mommy....
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-27 23:24:54	@melissaeramos Hey, are you sick at all? I came down with something on monday, and it's not pleasant. I hope you're all right!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-27 23:19:30	I hate being sick. I haven't run a fever since sophomore year. What is this nonsense?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-27 21:32:52	@papagena665 I have this sneaking suspicious we've picked up the same thing. UGH THROAT HURT. I'm living off the cepacol and thayers.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-25 08:51:48	@labellementeuse The very best kind of multitasking. Also I'm so jealous of your bathtub. For the life of me I couldn't find a flat with one

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-18 09:12:11	Well, hopefully they're about to start playing.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-10-18 09:10:49	Yesssss New Pornographers about to start playing!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-11 15:35:36	That was the worst Rocky Horror I've been to. There were as many people in the audience as there were in the cast! Plus, no participation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-11 09:16:51	AH. They're showing Rocky Horror and Dr. Strangelove at the same time! How do I decide?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-11 08:55:24	I swear I used to have clothes that were appropriate to wear to rocky horror....

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-10 19:49:33	@labellementeuse That sounds like tasty bread. But are you making any mongolian fairy bread any time soon?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-10 11:11:05	"And they swim around. Just crusing. Cos that's how they are. The Van fish and the Munter." I love the fish speech #outrageous

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-09 22:17:21	From far away that smoke looked like a backyard barbecue. From up close it smelled like pot. Dedication.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-04 08:16:41	After terrorizing the woman at ATT, got my phone unlocked and my biffle's mobile number off my NZ sim to text to see if she's ok. She is.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-04 02:27:54	On my way home. So far i've taken a bus, metro, train, and the light rail. How many more transport types can I hit?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 08:07:21	@labellementeuse Jokes aside, let us not neglect the fact that my two goals atm are finishing masters and getting my ass back to welly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 08:02:46	@labellementeuse I'm going to invent a teleportation device and when I get back to Welly you can use it too :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:56:03	@labellementeuse Also, srsly why is it so far away? I just want to go back but have not the resources.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:55:22	@labellementeuse Defs. Although ya'll are great with the not-so-much-hating-as-making-fun-of-americans thing. I really appreciated that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:50:37	@labellementeuse NZ is a long way from everywhere, let's be real :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:47:03	@labellementeuse Some places, it's your nationality heritage that's the dividing factor. (eg. irish/italian. Same census group. Way diff tho
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:45:33	@labellementeuse What's interesting is the separation between nationalities/ethnicities put in the same groups by the census
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:44:30	@labellementeuse I'm all about the MMP. It's the biculturalism that got me. We're approx 10 million different kinds of weird.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:42:12	@labellementeuse My friend stephan was confused he was the only black guy around in welly. Then we pointed out NZ never had slavery
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:41:20	@labellementeuse It's so fascinating! I look the parliament tour more times than necessary. I just liked learning about it, its so different
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:35:43	@labellementeuse Truth. NZ is pretty homogeneous, yeah? Four or five big groups, not too much of anybody else?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:28:26	@labellementeuse This is the problem with having a history of being a melting pot. Too many damn options.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:27:01	@labellementeuse I wonder what other groups aren't covered. Non-hispanic carribean natives? Middle-easterners in general?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:25:55	@labellementeuse this year they changed it, lumped race and ethnicity together. Should make for some interesting answers
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:22:54	@labellementeuse I guess we'd have to be indigenous aussie to know. There is an "other race/ethnicity not listed" option too
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:17:50	I love the safety updates we get from Georgetown. "Indecent exposure on N street!"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:12:27	@labellementeuse Now I'm going to be mulling this over all night. Hrm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:06:24	@labellementeuse I guess you don't add a whole extra section unless you've got a few thousand people to make it worth the while?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:05:37	@labellementeuse You really piqued my interest. I found the foreign-born resident info for australians...http://bit.ly/agMm2E
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 07:00:45	@labellementeuse I guess they don't really fit into any of the other census ethnic groups. Really though how many are living in the US?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 06:51:44	@labellementeuse Wait....really? Where did you find that?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 06:32:51	This is what I did this afternoon. http://twitpic.com/2kn3zl
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-03 06:09:50	SCORE! Googling "skee ball DC" has so many actual results! WOOP

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-02 03:56:36	That is not entertainment! That is "caution going to Silver Spring tonight is not highly recommended" news!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-02 03:55:40	I find it very interesting that most of the articles about the hostage at the Discovery Channel HQ are in entertainment sections.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-02 02:28:59	YES finally three whole weeks of #outrageous to watch at once. Is it christmas already?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-02 01:11:25	I just sat here and watched all my courses roll in on blackboard. Cool, but I feel like a giant stalker too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 23:22:19	@jasminemdjones Now that I can do :D Plus we have a great Alum chapter in DC
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 23:15:48	@jasminemdjones So if my giving potential is negative....
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 23:08:17	@KBfromTN It is nice to get mail sometimes though, even if it is just from the Annual Fund :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 23:05:59	@jasminemdjones was right, guilt is the Sweet Briar way.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 22:59:46	@jasminemdjones Then let's wait till next june when I actually have an income :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 22:56:56	First day of classes and Blackboard says I already have four things past due. Seems the Biochem exams this semester are scheduled in 2008.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 22:49:16	@jasminemdjones You're nuts. Seriously I already gave to the Annual Fund this year. Can we at least wait till 2011?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 20:23:37	@jasminemdjones I know, I know, but do they have to tear out my heartstrings like this? I can't go! This isn't helping.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 20:11:56	Play somewhere you love? Honor somewhere you love? Connect with somewhere you love? WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME alumnae association? WHY?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 10:29:50	@dks2008 I guess I'm still in the adjustment phase. It's so quiet. I think I need to get a plant so I have something to talk to.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 10:26:46	Morrissey's speech form convocation was hilarious. I probably got more out of it than any of the first years there, too. Hee hee
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 09:57:52	Seriously, @sheetzcard could you have made the take-home coffee bags much harder to open?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 09:45:47	@dks2008 Living alone is so lonely. I can't decide if I like it or not yet
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 09:06:46	I practiced all my new signs the whole way home on the bus. Got some crazy looks from the suit sitting across from me #ASL

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 04:20:00	@labellementeuse No worries, I was mostly hiding from all the facebook status updates about the new episode :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 01:52:58	I put on sunscreen during the homily.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-09-01 01:52:15	I believe instead of calling that opening mass it should have been scriptire and sunburn.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-31 20:15:43	Three weeks behind on #outrageous . I'm officially avoiding the internets.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-29 20:52:30	@papagena665 Their son's whole name is nuts. Although if I recall correctly he was named after a grandparent. I think.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-29 00:47:11	I love sitting next to talkative old men on the bus.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-24 21:10:50	I don't think anyone has made a lab safety video since 1985.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-24 08:22:26	Dear Alumnae office: way to rip my heartstrings out with the ad for homecoming in the alumnae magazine. Let's talk about effectiveness
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-24 07:12:37	Alrighty, I'm done being a domestic goddess now. Can I be done unpacking now?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-23 23:05:40	Took my sweet briar textbook bag to the grocery store. Got a shoutout from an alum sitting in her car at a red light. Go sweet!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-22 08:26:55	Did i mention the local catholic diocese paid for my margarita yesterday?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-22 04:33:46	Isn't that what they recommend? Schedule a big event to avoid being homesick?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-22 04:33:24	I'm not too sad about missing #sbcmoveinday10 because my first apartment move in day is tomorrow!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-22 01:29:15	Packing packing, moving to DC tomorrow. Is there a word for that? Like wellingtonian. DCIte? Hmmm

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-20 22:13:26	Friday at camp always makes me so sad.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-20 11:12:30	We have the magical power to make the crotch funk go away, tears stop flowing, and sad faces go away so they all magically disappear.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-20 02:23:23	"All lies! Kick a christian! Kick a christian!" "What did you say Lori?" "Wish stick!" camp conversatons are the very best.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-19 10:14:00	Today's forecast: cloudy with a chance of happy pills. I love my campers, really I do.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-17 08:12:26	"is there any way we can give Nancy more happy pills?"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-17 01:19:01	Presents from camper so far: 4 gimp and bead bracelets, a stick with some yarn, and a backrub. I love camp
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-17 01:16:12	Im going to kill whoever told all the campers its my birthday. Slowly and painfully.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-15 02:30:02	@42below In a liquor store in the States. Two shelves above the only bottle of 42 below I've seen since moving back here
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-14 08:03:15	Vodka idea stolen from @42below http://twitpic.com/2egfd6
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-12 18:02:23	@dks2008 Same. My new life plan might maybs involve moving back to Welly *shifty eyes*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-12 12:00:56	@dks2008 Shit. Now I'm Welly-sick. There's no cure for this sickness except a nice, freezing, nearly-gale-force wet and rainy breeze.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-12 11:59:05	@dks2008 It is lovely but I was always more in love with southern cross. I love love it out back in the courtyard
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-12 11:55:05	@dks2008 Southern Cross! The best place in Welly I can think of
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-12 11:53:29	@dks2008 Is it bad I've already planned where I'm having it?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-12 11:53:03	@dks2008 My mad uncle is paying for a ticket back for graduation present. His caveat? I must host a large outrageous party at my fave bar
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-12 11:36:58	@dks2008 YES and YES. Also the canyon swing. And then expensive drinks on the waterfront in welly.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-12 10:41:53	@dks2008 We can run off to the land of the long white cloud and do awesome kiwi things
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-12 09:45:00	The gods have answered my pleas. Finally, finally a modern/alt rock station in york! Not as good as @wnrnradio but enough to satisfy for now
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-11 11:13:15	Now You Can Eat The Old Spice Guy http://bit.ly/cc4Qmz I want one of these too :)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-11 07:21:14	I always interpreted SBC judic as life skills education, and as punishment if you kept it up. This is interesting- http://nyti.ms/bcI7CU
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-11 07:10:45	@ljsgecko Wow, that's impressive. Junk mailers are slacking

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-09 17:56:53	That was the strangest dream I've had in a while. I think I need to get my ass back to EnZed soon.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-09 07:26:13	@booksandwindows That sounds ideal for you :) I love your lists
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-09 07:15:15	@jasminemdjones We'll just add it to the reasons I love you
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-09 07:14:00	@jasminemdjones Trying to figure out your logic makes my brain hurt. I feel like that's a bad plan
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-09 07:12:23	@jasminemdjones Also I totes thought I saw your truck without a wheel on the side of 695 today and was going to call you but mom stole phone
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-09 07:11:49	@jasminemdjones But aren't you tweeting by text? Thats some sketch you've got going on
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-09 07:09:09	@jasminemdjones Are you tweeting while you drive? I might judge you a bit for that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-09 06:59:56	@magnoliamae27 I love this planner but I want new quotes. Maybs that's a sign I've been using them for too long?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-08 21:45:25	@i_see_the_sea Just another awesome thing originally invented in New Zealand.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-08 20:23:40	@i_see_the_sea Did you go in the obo balls?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-08 09:37:54	@lenamorrill Best week ever. My year isn't complete unless I go to camp.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-08 09:35:54	This year's @NYPL Student Planner is chock full of quotes. Mostly quotes they used in the last four years of their planners. *sigh*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-08 09:30:18	@chidorme87 Ohhh the beer. Defs the beer. I'm a sucker for an amber ale
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-08 09:10:48	Is it bad that Im super stoked for a sleepless week of stress, molestation, and chasing half naked mentally retarded adults in the woods?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-08 09:07:10	@chidorme87 What kind of ice cream? What kind of beer?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-08 09:01:30	@chidorme87 Ice cream, then beer. Not both at once.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-08 07:56:03	Cabin coordinator this year. I'm moving up in the world. Cannot cannot wait for camp!!!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-07 11:09:16	Camp training tomorrow, get to see all my lovely lovely friends and tell all the highly inappropriate stories about the campers
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-07 08:08:39	@lenamorrill Pennsylvania. Approximately one hour. We shall do this again sometime too.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-07 06:59:45	I have this tremendous desire to go to Chuck E Cheese and get drunk and play skee ball. I think I'm going to give in this time
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-06 09:49:24	Presenting on my summer work tomorrow. I get to go last. Evidently I'm the lynch pin. Woo?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-06 04:25:10	I have this overwhelming urge to use 'diaspora' in everyday conversation.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-05 10:49:49	@dks2008 Which people?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-05 10:29:40	What did I do today? Messed around with a 3D image of a protein. Stood inside it. NBD #bestdayever
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-05 10:16:05	Lingerie is not usually ranked very high on the list of things you smuggle into jail. #outrageous

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-04 09:07:34	@papagena665 I think I can be glad my machine doesn't have XP-compatible mode. I'm forced to not run the Sims.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-03 18:01:35	@labellementeuse Yup, I'd never heard of it before I got down there.(Also, thanks for the warning. At least now I'm not half a season behind
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-03 13:10:13	I totally meant to go to bed several hours ago. Catching up with mates in different time zones/hemispheres is not conducive to sleep
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-03 11:01:41	Not that I'm making munitions. Just learning strange trivia I'll never need again. Yeah.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-03 11:00:43	Did you know if your GPS receiver is too powerful you have to sell it as a munition? This, this is why I love research.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-03 10:49:20	@papagena665 Last year I saw an advert for jean sweatpants. Seems someone took them to the next level. *sigh*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-08-03 10:48:31	@labellementeuse You know what they say about great minds... Seriously, though I've only had fairy bread once and i want to try againnn

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-31 04:58:41	@papagena665 I cannot, cannot wait to see Hank Azaria as Gargamel. If I recall correctly, I nearly fell off my chair with glee :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-30 10:47:04	I got to hang with @FIRE1830EMS tonight .Catchups make me so happy :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-29 08:27:45	@ljsgecko Ah, the perks of time zones. I was looking at dinosaur cakes at the grocery store while it happened though!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-29 08:24:22	I missed the Daisy cake, but fifteen people texted me to tell me about it. I love Sweet Briar.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-29 06:47:08	@dks2008 Thanks :) I'm pretty much looking in just the immediate georgetown area to minimize commute times.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-29 06:43:11	@dks2008 Working on that one. Every place I liked last weekend rented out before I could get back to people.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-29 06:40:47	Today, the robot my kids and I built flipped over the other robot in the competition. LEGO Robotics Smackdown? I think so.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-29 06:39:28	Scooooore gtown's email is gmail too. Now if only I could just import all my settings from sweet briar. Ohh this is most excellent
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-28 12:11:58	How many times has SNL done the Laurence Welk show? Watching them all, this is getting a bit excessive

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-28 10:37:09	@OutrageousFFans I got hooked on it when I was studying in Welly. My fave show, hands down :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-28 10:35:50	Tweeting from my new computer. It's so nice to have a computer that isn't on the very brink of death!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-28 06:56:58	I'm totally feeling this for my new laptop. http://is.gd/dNaWr
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-28 05:55:31	@labellementeuse More Cheryl? I want to know! No, I don't want to know. Yes. No. UGH why am I so far awayyyy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-27 10:01:29	@jasminemdjones @melissaeramos Me too. When did we become so old?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-27 06:34:30	Ughh apartments are going like candy. It's obviously go time now.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-26 10:05:17	Although, having @ABCScoundrels is better than getting no @OFWestside fix at all
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-26 09:49:19	Sparky all about classical music and not into snorting things? Failure, american TV. Failure. #outrageous #scoundrels
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-26 09:46:15	@labellementeuse I have my sources. Mostly emails with things nabbed from uni networks
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-26 09:45:37	@labellementeuse OH NO I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT! YOU CAN'T PASS UP THE FISH SPEECH!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-26 09:41:57	@labellementeuse I KNOW. Munter is crucial! Also, Sparky is not nuts and psychotic about fire, either. *le sigh*
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-26 09:41:03	@labellementeuse Also, I'm a few eps behind on last series of #outrageous so I can't see the new ones and that makes me a sad puppy
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-26 09:40:13	@labellementeuse There's less swearing, less sex, less booze, no drugs, no racism. Also no Muntz or Falani yet. So sad.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-26 09:16:20	OMG WHAT DID THEY DO TO SPARKY? This is so not okay. #outrageous #scoundrels
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-26 09:09:44	I really, really wanted to like @ABCScoundrels but cleaning up @OFWestside for American TV lost some of the awesomeness of the original
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-26 08:38:05	@chidorme87 Yes yes we need to get her on twitter so I can stalk her too
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-25 02:47:02	@papagena665 Interestingly enough, it's not so much on the white people. Nearly all the people I've seen are indian.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-25 02:46:04	@ljsgecko It's just the HSC crest with a giant "Hampden-Sydney College" underneath it, nothing too fancy.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-25 02:44:38	@lenamorrill Hahaha now you can vary between pita chips and hummus and cereal. Get some real diversity in your foods
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-25 01:10:35	It seems i'm going from one uni with vera in the bookstore to another uni with vera in the bookstore. Awesome.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-22 10:11:25	@behrlie makes my life: "malaria is temporary, but coffee is forever." Truer wrods have never been spoken.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-21 11:42:50	You can feel the floor moving. I love my life.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-20 10:34:41	So tired of looking at apartment listings. Can I just pitch a tent on campus? There's a nice little lawn by the med building...
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-19 10:56:43	@jasminemdjones How can you pass up a chance for some Waterstone? I want to live vicariously through your tweets about it
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-19 10:11:02	"Swing dancers have no personal space, blues dances have your personal space." Best thing I've heard in ages
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-18 09:26:22	Good company, old school drinks, and a lovely speak easy. My life is good :)

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-17 08:28:11	How did i work right next to glen echo for so long and not dance here? This place is awesome!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-17 07:12:13	Oh, DC rush. How I didn't miss you in the slightest.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-16 13:19:05	@ljsgecko I'm glad you have your priorities straight. Destruction first, romance later
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-16 09:28:54	@bezybee UGH they should have that in the bookstore for us
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-16 07:33:29	Who knows what grocery store carries funfetti icing? I have sweet briar friends, someone should know this :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-15 11:34:44	I don't know how the fuck the neighbor's cat got in the house but she just jumped in my bed, woke me, and scared me to pieces. whahowhuh?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-15 09:44:05	Every time I re-read And the Band Played On, I'm reminded of why research ethics are so damn important.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-13 07:24:44	My kids got some strange life advice today: "Don't do drugs. Not till you're in college and about to graduate. Then you can experiment."
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-13 07:16:19	@chidorme87 Get a pair of vibram five fingers, you'll never want to wear another pair of shoes
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-13 06:55:07	@ljsgecko Hahaha I have that effect on people :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-12 12:01:40	@ljsgecko Yes, that's the strange part. A good friend of mine, I didn't think he'd go for fishicide.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-12 11:23:46	Also, RIP Gustavus Adolphus Hector too. My poor fish are all dead :(
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-12 11:20:40	Two weeks in Maine, five mountains, a day trip to Canada, a parade appearance, a lot of creeping and two park rangers later, home at last.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-10 21:27:20	Marching in the flamingo parade with friends of acadia!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-10 03:38:51	1530 feet ago, i was at the bottom of the mountain. Boo yeah.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-09 06:23:46	This morning, there was pursuit of a 504.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-09 06:22:58	In case you're wondering, in acadia national park a 504 is ranger code for rock theft.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-08 05:38:56	My course listing for next year includes an entire class on programmed cell death. I love my life!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-08 04:56:16	@sk8tegr8 Yup, I'm in maine! I'm on Mt. Desert, mom loves it up here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-07 23:11:02	The woman just said "this trail makes me feel like Bella. I've been feeling like Bella a lot lately" UGH really? Stop hogging the trail.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-07 23:04:08	Yes, Im tweeting on the trail. That's how slow we're moving.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-07 23:01:34	There's an old fat woman taking up the trail ahead of us. Ugh let the faster people pass we're crawling here.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-07 09:27:04	At campobello today, the lowered the canadian flag to half mast to avoid offending anyone. How very canadian.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-05 06:28:05	Just took a science harbor cruise, and met an alum. I was her first alum on the boat!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-04 22:06:19	The people in the next campsite keep talking about an "uh-oh". All I can think of is @madelinead and her water fountain.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-04 00:26:41	There are five very drunk old men over there cheering on their lobsters with some very serious enthusiasm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-04 00:15:14	"and in lane 4, we have lobster special, sponsored by the Sea Catch! If you go there tonight, he may be the lobster special!"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-04 00:10:49	Yes! And we have a winner!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-04 00:08:34	I should note none of the other lobsters are moving.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-04 00:07:55	Go barbara bisque go! Man, that lobster can move.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-04 00:04:56	I bet on barbara bisque this heat.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-03 23:34:17	Lobster races at the fourth of july picnic. I wish i was kidding.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-03 05:30:26	The little kid over there is trying to say 'ocean', but it's coming out as 'oh, shit'. Poor kid.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-02 00:40:47	You know, I've never been much of the park ranger type, but damn. I've been converted.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-01 09:01:57	Playing uno by candle is far more difficult than one would imagine
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-07-01 05:30:20	Climbed a mountain, got flocked by seagulls, saw a bald eagle pick one out of the sky. nbd.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-29 18:50:49	Good morning, Freeport! Breakfast, LLBean, and then some more driving to Acadia.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-29 09:09:00	I love driving long distances at night. It feels like a whole different world.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-28 10:43:26	No lies, I'm rapidly becoming obsessed with Lie to me
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-28 10:23:51	I've finally managed to get my hulu queue down below 10 items. I feel so accomplished.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-27 18:03:30	Mornings like this make me wish I was a morning person. It's so lovely!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-27 16:30:23	Why yes, we are still dancing. I have never been sweatier in my life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-27 14:17:04	Fourth shirt of the night. This is good, good blues.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-27 07:11:52	Blues dancing all night long. Life is good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-26 13:15:58	That my have been my first game of UNO ever without any cheating at all.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-25 10:36:11	@ljsgecko Oh, neither do I! Just two years of "I'll be in this city till then and I'll apply there and if I get in...."
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-25 10:35:21	@dks2008 I'm going to maine in a week-ish. This, this is an excellent start to the pile
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-25 10:34:24	@sk8tegr8 Yup. SO GOOD. I did a little work with HeLas while I was in Wellington, and now I'm obsessed with their superpowers
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-25 10:29:59	@sk8tegr8 Which book?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-25 10:29:26	@dks2008 The intimate lives of founding fathers? Most of my nonfiction kick has been founding fathers books. I like this plan. WIN
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-25 10:28:16	@KBfromTN I read it right after it came out. I may or may not be obsessed with HeLa cells
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-25 10:22:56	I'm 95% sure I just planned out my next two years. SCORE.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-25 09:28:18	Watching said hyper kitty attempt to eat lightning bugs makes up for my lost ice cream.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-25 09:21:53	I came outside to eat my ice cream. I set it down and came back to no ice cream and a hyper kitty.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-24 12:13:48	Wanted: nonfiction recommendations. I've given up on John Irving. Must. Consume. More. Factual reading.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-24 12:12:07	@lenamorrill A weekend in celebration of our awesomeness is always called for
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-24 12:03:08	@jasminemdjones @melissaeramos Um, can we imagine the bachelorette party if we all got married around the same time? Just for a sec?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-24 12:02:07	@jasminemdjones @melissaeramos You two make my world. Want to find me one too?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-24 11:09:01	Today, I gleefully attacked the slug colony in the garden. As a side note, there is no longer any salt in the house. Oh the slugmanity!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-24 10:58:35	@ljsgecko I fully approve of that method of child rearing. I now plan to implement it myself someday.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-24 10:58:04	@lenamorrill Doing research and working a summer camp for g/t kids from NE maryland in alternating weeks. Not much, but it pays well! yay
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-24 09:58:14	@i_see_the_sea So did I. The ones on last night were ooooold school. I think I caught the first season.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-24 09:56:48	Now that I have a job with a long commute, I really have no life. Well, at least my kids are interesting
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-23 10:31:16	And with George Washington, Spymaster, I finish my longest streak yet of straight nonfiction. Up next: A Prayer for Owen Meany.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-21 10:30:03	@cnygreg Actually, it's a remake of a current show from New Zealand which was on before the Riches
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-21 10:29:06	For all my excitement about #Scoundrels , it's really only because I want something New Zealand to make it in the States
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-21 10:06:19	I loved @ABCScoundrels ! Completely awesome! but with source material as good as @OFWestside , it's hard to not bring the awesome.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-21 09:00:27	One minute to @abcscoundrels ! Such excitement for the American @ofwestside . Woopwoop!

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-19 22:25:53	My grandma is visiting and the porch is bathed in a thick cloud of cigarette smoke. No pond yoga today, methinks.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-19 22:24:38	@jasminemdjones Give it over to fate and good things will come along. Everything happens for a reason!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-19 21:22:53	YES! The flash for my Diana Mini is working again! Now all I need to do is unpack my film...

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-18 07:15:01	I fell asleep with a cat on my lap, and woke up with a cat on my face. Napping on the deck may not be such a bright idea.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-16 10:25:53	@dks2008 I have to decide between a so-so immunology masters (my academic LOVE) and an awesome biotechnology one with connections. Hmm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-16 10:22:33	So I guess now I'm a hoya and not a vixen anymore. I got into both masters programs at georgetown. Now comes the decisions.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-13 06:30:57	After a day in the sun, my ring tan is ridiculous. Sweet briar, you rock.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-11 10:53:25	Can you get in trouble for kittynapping? What if the kitty just climbs in your car anyway and you forget to return it? Hmmmm.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-11 09:12:23	@i_see_the_sea I am so on that. When I move to DC, Lilly's gonna be a stowaway
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-11 07:46:58	New day, same place, same kitty. http://twitpic.com/1vnrfi
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-11 07:19:50	Watching the sunset with a very warm and sleepy kitty in my lap. Life is good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-11 06:38:16	Android Karenina. This exisits. Is nothing sacred?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-11 05:14:24	If you're in York, swing by YTI and donate blood with me! Give blood. Give life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-11 04:23:16	@bezybee Now that's the kind of entertainment I'd pay to see
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-10 23:06:17	@i_see_the_sea Friday in york, 8pm five dolla. Sunday at Hot Z's in Lancaster (SO FUN) 7:30, no dolla. Free is good!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-10 22:15:35	@i_see_the_sea You should come with me sometime! Next week there's dancing friday and then the sunday afterward.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-10 13:08:19	@i_see_the_sea I am too danced out to care. This is both lovely and momentous.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-10 04:45:35	Dipping my toes into tumblr. http://redfive86.tumblr.com/
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-10 03:40:57	@melissaeramos Your face. There is tremendous amounts of missage.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-10 02:35:49	@UUish13 Yay for resourcefulness! Y'know what's funny? I can't remember why we couldn't leave the room and had to resort to such measures hm
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-10 02:30:13	@UUish13 If I recall correctly, we made crystal light in a nalgene and added it to the cereal. That was a weird night.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-10 02:02:39	@UUish13 Eat them with lemonade! We did one night when we couldn't leave the room to get to the milk. It's super super tasty!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-10 00:06:56	I think the most shocking thing about the new Lady Gaga isn't the nun bondage, it's the bit where she's wearing normal clothes.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 12:05:45	@chidorme87 Gustavus just kept getting names, and the more he got the more I wanted to call him Agadore Spartacus. When I got another, I did
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 12:04:50	@fredwig Rachael. Well, the first one, anyway.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 11:15:32	@dks2008 I am to surprise. hey, its a sad moment when Ash gets turned to stone and all the Pokemon start crying.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 11:09:56	Just to clarify, both Agadore Spartacus and Gustavus Adolphus Hector are alive and well and trying to kill the other through glass. Typical.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 11:04:44	Then I realized when that sad day comes its going to be very hard to get a dead fish our of a liquor handle.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 11:04:15	Just had a horrible moment where I thought Agadore Spartacus was dead.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 10:57:17	@dks2008 ...the first pokemon movie. I know, a shame which will haunt me forever. Although I did cry a bit to Once Were Warriors
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 10:52:58	@i_see_the_sea What do you approve of? Besides my awesomeness, of course, that's a given ;)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 10:51:48	@dks2008 I LOVED Up, but that wasn't it. Up is so awesome, though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 10:36:23	@dks2008 It must be a ginger thing, I've only cried at one movie myself
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 08:05:03	This is what i'm doing right now. http://twitpic.com/1v4wz1
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 06:38:25	True story: one of the top suggestions to spell-correct feijoa is fellatio. I am slain by the lulz.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 06:37:27	Why yes, I am eating a feijoa. It's winter down south, they're in season. Num num num.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 03:22:45	@papagena665 And that's humanitarian like a vegetarian to veggies.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 03:22:06	@papagena665 I'll keep that in mind when I finish the genome of these humanitarian dinosaurs. Hee hee hee
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-09 03:12:33	@papagena665 The thing that worries my mother the most about my career choice is the high likelihood that I'll engineer something evil.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-08 22:40:06	@papagena665 Ahahahahaha if you're spending that much you may as well have lightsabers
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-08 22:32:11	Went dancing the last three nights running, forgot how brutal that can be on the thighs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-08 22:25:24	@ljsgecko The beauty of moving home, mom's pond, neighbor's kitty, all the lovely things in life and none of the responsibility :D
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-08 04:11:12	Yoga by the pond, blues clinic tonight. Life is good. So so good.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-08 00:15:02	"You want to tempt the wrath of the whatever from high atop the thing?" Love it when west wing quote pop up in everyday life
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-07 23:07:30	having a hard time going into Wal-Mart and remembering I no longer need to puff paint things.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-07 11:07:58	Life is good when you've got the blues :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-07 11:05:20	Invariably, every time I dance with an old black man Im told a version of "Girl, you must've been black in a past life, you've got the funk"
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-07 03:49:15	Flippin' awesome. Gay? Whatever, Dude - http://nyti.ms/aC7a8L

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-05 01:21:32	@fredwig I just finished Dewey, a book about a library cat. Surprisingly, very very good
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-04 11:49:00	Playing a drinking game with a friend over skype while we both watch a movie on hulu. That counts as not drinking alone, yes?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-04 10:54:17	@i_see_the_sea I was hoping it involved mini vans and duct tape
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-04 06:40:38	@i_see_the_sea Town and country surfing? Say wiggity what?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-04 06:09:51	@papagena665 Ahahaha also apparently I absolutely need to buy a webcam with it, even though I opted for the built-in one. Really, dell?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-04 06:08:11	@papagena665 They want me to buy a sony e-reader to "amplify my using experience". Because no experience is complete without an e-reader
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-04 05:39:53	@papagena665 That was meant to be decipherable. I like to see things before I get them, I'm not an online shopper at all
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-04 05:37:32	@papagena665 The only problem is I was a loot at it in person, and the ones I like aren't available in stores
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-04 05:29:52	@papagena665 I'm looking primarily at dell, I've always loved them (although it seems I'm the only one who does). There are so many options!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-04 05:24:37	Why is laptop shopping so stressful? It was so much easier to just let the parents buy the school package freshman year.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-04 01:55:26	Went to best buy to really start the laptop shopping process. Guy who helped talked down to me then gave me his number. Not helpful.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-03 23:03:35	Someone loaded Cabaret with Alan Cumming on youtube. My afternoon is now planned.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-03 11:05:01	Surprisingly tasty combination: jack daniels and thin mints
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-03 10:43:45	I just realized I'm watching the new episode of @InPlainSightUSA by accident. I watch every week on @hulu , but had no idea when it aired.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-03 08:46:48	My lap has been taken over http://twitpic.com/1tepxw
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-03 08:44:22	The kitty ruined the moment by drooling all over and embarking on a vigorous washing session. I think I will still steal her. Maybs.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-03 07:13:02	I somehow managed to end up in an actual outfit today. Guess that means I need to go out and find something to do tonight

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-03 02:40:32	I think the reason I love @wipeout so much is the lovely combination of giant messes and schadenfreude.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-02 22:06:51	@maryrtaylor10 I know, my life is now complete.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-02 20:02:33	Going from watching morning political chat shows to the West Wing feels like areal improvement in life.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-02 11:42:05	@sk8tegr8 I've come to expect awkward from my mother. It's a fact of life :)
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-02 11:23:51	@sk8tegr8 @LALxo Even my mother wanted a quick cold shower after it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-02 11:04:08	I'm thinking this summer I'm gonna marathon all of Frank Oz's movies. The ones he directed, and then the ones he was in.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-02 10:47:23	@Wellington_NZ Why must you remind me of the things I'm missing out on? Also, you're making me hungry.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-02 10:02:37	@sk8tegr8 I KNOW but tonight was so so good I might just be okay with that
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-02 09:31:30	Why yes, I would like a Will Schuster lap dance, thanks for asking @gleeonfox .
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-02 09:17:54	What I wouldn't give to be @suesylvester_glee right now.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-02 06:05:07	Watching the previews for tonight's @gleeonfox . I believe I may melt while watching it.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-06-02 05:54:34	@papagena665 Well at least they're finally, finally making a new movie

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-31 03:19:36	@GALadmiss Take a read of And the Band Played On. Such a good book, but I just kept crying the whole time.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-30 04:31:47	@i_see_the_sea Free tonight?
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-30 04:20:04	Yard sale: roaring success.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-28 22:44:06	A woman just came through my yard sale and started touching my hair. And then expounded about how much she wants to mess with it. whaaaa

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-28 20:36:29	This crazy old hippie man just came by my yard sale and hugged me. He was happy to see a young hippie. Guess tye-dye and bare feet count?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-23 11:51:03	@chidorme87 I just finished Dewey, about a library cat, and my dad just came home from a trip with Little Women and werewolves. Excitement!
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-23 09:56:29	Is it bad that one of the highlights of my day was chasing chipmunks on the hike i took?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-22 12:15:28	That was easily the dirtiest game of minigolf I have ever played. Also, retrieving my ball from the fake lake turned me blue.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-22 06:06:55	@papagena665 We always wondered if Mary even had sex organs or if babies just magically appeared, since other things happened magically
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-22 00:29:37	Well the lake is pretty even if the rental stand doesn't open till tomorrow. I drove out, so may as well enjoy the sun.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-21 23:45:30	I'm thinking it's a good day to hit the lake. Now if only I could remember when the kayak rentals opens.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-21 23:42:08	@chidorme87 so heather sent us all the email you sent her about creeping. I am obvs always the last person to find out things. Que pasa?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-20 02:00:10	@dks2008 @melissaeramos that thought always makes me shudder a little.

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-19 08:30:52	@lenamorrill I know. Granted, besides a few houses and a bowling alley the only things for miles from the polling place are corn fields.
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-19 07:55:17	@lenamorrill It's so weird, actually going in to vote. I'm a little concerned that I was not asked for ID at any point, though

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-18 09:10:14	@lenamorrill finally unplugged the phone it got so bad. Also, we're avoiding my grandmother. That's a side fact though
86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-18 09:09:36	@lenamorrill This I know. I'm planning on voting tomorrow. Still, this is nuts. The calls stopped for 2 hours during dinner and we

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-18 07:29:14	Just got a campaign call from @CorbettforGov at the exact same time an ad for him came on tv. WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?

86232435	funkasarusrex	2010-05-15 09:39:22	I knew the was a reason I do things at the last minute. This whole being packed ahead of time thing means the room is crazy-inducing.
