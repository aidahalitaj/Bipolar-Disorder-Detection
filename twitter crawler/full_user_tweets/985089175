985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-07-02 21:56:22	If you back the coup. You don't believe in democracy. It's that simple.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-07-02 21:54:53	Amazes me the labour members backing MPs that obviously don't believe in democracy. Neither do you
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-07-02 08:49:11	@w47id just jealous dickheads always saying shit. Nothing to worry about. Lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-07-02 08:35:30	But the Quran strictly forbids any fasting if it directly effects, organs. I have blood tests monthly to check. So I qualify. Ok
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-07-02 08:33:51	Incase it's really hard for people to understand. I have bipolar. Which means I take serious meds. Now I wish I could fast through Ramadan..

985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-06-27 07:23:13	@_Tristan_Max don't engage with him. At all. He's just a loser that hides who he is. Cos he has no balls.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-06-27 07:17:53	"No emotions here" while making 45 fakes to Harass me . Stat makes sense.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-06-27 07:15:54	@_Tristan_Max he started by wanting my girlfriend. Now he wants me. I'm that hot

985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-06-26 18:48:45	If you can't say something as who you really are. Who are you? Nobody. And nothing at all.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-06-26 18:46:41	The irony of being attacked for my life. By someone that hides behind fake accounts stalking. fuck sake
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-06-26 05:51:07	Do you ever just wish some people would crawl back under their rock and stay there.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-06-26 02:15:09	@maariyakhalifa_ I'm that good you see.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-06-26 02:09:46	I get being angry at the 67% of the older generations that voted out. But what about the 70% or the younger generations that didn't bother?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-04-21 06:21:55	The sun didn't know how beautiful it was until it cast its first shadow.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-02-29 01:33:34	Positive thoughts give you a positive outlook and experiences. Negative thoughts give you a negative outlook and experiences. Simple life
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-02-29 01:32:03	What's crazy is. I'm the one the "normal" deem "crazy".
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-02-29 01:31:07	Who doesn't have a hard life? But you can still be happy writhing the hardness of it. By changing your outlook
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-02-29 01:30:15	People say. "Life's not easy". And I always reply with. "It's as easy as you want it to be". If you keep saying it's not easy. It won't be.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-02-29 01:26:19	Some people get so used to the feeling of loss and pain, that when they're happy, they have to destroy it all. To feel comfortable again
985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-02-29 01:23:51	I've never been a Lucas fan. But. His commitment to the club. And willingness to try any position and be good doing it. Is second to none

985089175	ArchiJAK	2016-02-27 03:49:37	Questioning is surly the piety of thought.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-12-10 05:11:51	When you see me at uni. In the street and I'm smiling and laughing. Understand. That is so much effort and so tiring. #bipolar
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-12-10 05:10:24	Thank you to anyone that has helped me forget the fight for a while. No matter how temporary they were.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-12-10 03:48:25	So Santas coming soon. I'm hoping this year he'll bring me a life.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-12-10 03:32:46	So. This weather huh?

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 06:27:02	Believe it or not. I got distracted and I'm not sure if Ive taken extra Quitiapine or not. At least this isn't life or death. It's
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 06:15:06	Final goodnight promise .
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 06:14:35	Fuck why not. What's the worst that can happen.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 06:13:25	This must be the extra pills it has to be. Maybe if I take extra Quitiapine tonight it'll straighten me out.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 06:11:27	I have that. My brain feels too heavy for me to carry anymore feeling. Im just so tired of it #bipolar
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 06:01:19	I'm still going to hold on to the fact. I did realise what was happening eventually and I tried to stop it. Something for me to work with
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 05:54:34	How tiring it is. Is the appropriate? Did I say something wrong? What did they mean? Etc etc. All the fucking time. Doubt doubt doubt
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 05:53:24	No matter what people say they just don't get what it actually means to be #bipolar . How much you have to work and question yourself and
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 05:51:30	I got to admit. I'm tired of getting in situations. And not realising what's fully happening until it's too late. #bipolar
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 05:49:09	Imagine what it feels like. To see a guy so worried for his safety to go towards the emergency button. Shit I was just chatting away. Lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 05:47:57	Urgh. I can't believe we have the same tweet. That's cute and repulsive all at the same time
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 05:46:29	I actually saw a guy go towards the emergency button.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 05:45:47	This extra pill business still hasn't wore off. I've felt really weird for days. I was talking complete no sense in a lift today. Freak
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 05:42:20	@ilyas_khan8 he probably saw the dark BLONDE hair and thought. That kids a German @aliyahkhanxo
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 05:40:01	@ilyas_khan8 hahaha. I'm sure he just meant he expected you to be dark. Rather than sooooo White. @aliyahkhanxo

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 00:43:39	My mate offered me a place to stay if I wanna go out in Plymouth. Heelllloooo old me. Party time.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-24 00:26:01	Lesson on context: "dick" bad! "My friend Richards nickname is dick" good! you can't pick and choose unless retarded. Everything has context

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-23 19:00:32	@ThatSilasKid lmao. Cheers dude. At least someone gets me.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-23 18:57:49	Lessons learned. Don't assume people will see the best in you, expect them to see what they need to see
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-23 18:56:17	Maybe when typing from now on I should do it simpler. Obviously my use of language is hard for some to understand.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-22 05:58:29	@golf_wxng what's wrong with how I say it like!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-22 05:43:59	People think knowing someone can be quantified by information passed, knowing someone is more than that. It's feeling as well
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-22 05:36:58	When they think you don't know them, because no one else pays attention.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-22 05:33:37	When they always go on a tweet fest to show they're not pissed off, when really they are
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-22 05:29:39	I should be less honest and be like everyone else
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-22 05:27:56	Can't sleep yet. Have to make sure I haven't taken to many meds, bring on the sickness.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-19 22:43:13	@boringfileclerk I'm just quoting the law. Look it up maybe @SkyNews
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-19 22:36:50	@boringfileclerk as soon as she said "fuck off back to your own country" it became a race crime rather than a hate crime. @SkyNews

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-18 02:57:59	I can't explain the fear I have about people's reactions when I tell them I'm bipolar. Most run. True story.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-18 00:18:23	I'm taking a break.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 23:09:01	Do you think the fact I seem to fall for emotionally unavailable people, says more about me or them?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 22:30:14	Got so much uni work to do.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 21:37:36	Sakho or Migs my MOTM

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 21:06:58	I had high hopes for Milner. He's not the player I'd seen playing for other teams at all. What's that about.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 20:34:11	I asked Cameron a question this week. Through hopefully the next PM @jeremycorbyn .

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 19:23:50	. @btsportfootball sort your mics out
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 19:19:47	I used to like Harry. But he's a bit of a dick isn't he. Let it go mate! The fans got their first choice. Fuck your sources #LFC
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 19:16:43	It's weird not thinking we'll win because of the situation. But being excited anyway. #LFC
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 19:14:56	I'll batter Klopps dad! #LFC

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 06:25:23	The things youngens don't understand about unknown calling is. At my age. You know who does and who doesn't have your number
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 06:21:51	Please please Unknown. Talk to me. Don't call and say nothing. It's boring as fuck. I'm bored entertain me
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 06:04:41	Pretending you're ok. Takes a toll.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 05:02:08	Probably my favourite line. "Life's a prison, when you're in love alone"
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 04:52:07	I'm not say the 1975 song being like Duran Duran is a bad thing. But I kinda liked their uniqueness, if ya get me
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 04:40:42	I was gonna go sleep. But I'm sharing with my son tonight. No sleep for me. With his snoring and twitching.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 04:39:08	The new 1975 song. It's a bit Duran Duran no?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 04:17:42	Think I'll go to bed. Night all
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 04:07:24	When you share everything with someone. And you realise they shared nothing with you - how little you must mean
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 03:45:08	@adamwaheed197 to let Adam. @maariyakhalifa_

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 01:55:50	Is it just me or do you also find it creepy when people comment or favourite posts from more than a day ago?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-17 01:06:51	@emmamogg97

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 05:07:02	Goodnight everyone.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 04:23:50	Shit just realised I had a Twitter beef. With no squad back up. Between Aliyah and Ilyas. .
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 04:18:49	@blackmore_cat after your last party that's his goals . #IKnowEverything
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 04:17:58	My kids friends do make me smile though. It's nice that they have good people around them.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 04:13:53	@ThatSilasKid hahaha . So true.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 04:13:14	It's weird. So many people expect me to be the picture of control and reason. When my illness by it's very nature is the opposite.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 04:09:06	I apologise to Aliyah's friends. But if you say stuff to her and she shouts the house down at Ilyas. It effects my Zen, then I get pissed.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 04:07:04	@ThatSilasKid hot gay though!! Hot gay. @asap_sam
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 04:04:01	@asap_sam he correct my spellings earlier. Like normal. Just paying it forward. @ThatSilasKid he knows I love him.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 03:52:47	@asap_sam haha. I just say it 3 times in my head first. To make sure it's right
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 03:51:44	@blackmore_cat lol. I'm in trouble
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 03:49:53	Logic lessons over #ihateilyas
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 03:48:27	Plus.The person he actually pissed off should bring it up to him. Not someone not effected. Because that would be the same as me saying this
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 03:46:11	If you have a problem with Ilyas. Please go to Ilyas. One has a dick the other doesn't. Not the same person
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-16 03:43:24	Don't we all. https:// twitter.com/blackmore_cat/ status/654741713391480833 …

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 10:07:04	@maariyakhalifa_ I came back to set a lie straight. We've been through this, are you ok? @mamoonax @golf_wxng
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 10:06:30	@maariyakhalifa_ Jameel makes a valid point. Maariya can't take it. Shock!! @mamoonax @golf_wxng

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:56:25	@mamoonax yeah. But he'll still want a nicer cunt.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:54:52	@maariyakhalifa_ Oi Oi. @mamoonax

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:51:04	@golf_wxng it's entertaining. she's a bit rubbish at insults tho. @maariyakhalifa_ @mamoonax
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:50:07	@mamoonax wow. He must be uglier that you.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:47:58	@mamoonax sad times that it's till he finds someone fitter. Which is basically anyone
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:47:13	@golf_wxng well the question is about a guy. So she. Means your adding who she is. Lol. @mamoonax
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:46:29	@golf_wxng but I guess it's my bad given the lack of that she would comprehend the nuance of it @mamoonax
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:46:29	@golf_wxng if you actually read it. It does say mental. But in the context of lack of comprehension. @mamoonax
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:44:04	@golf_wxng @mamoonax I'm sorry I tried to set you straight when maariya was acting like its my fault. Happy.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:42:23	@golf_wxng that doesn't answer the question lol. @mamoonax
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:41:54	@mamoonax at least I got to choose my failure. You'll be arranged a guy who always wants someone prettier.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:39:02	@golf_wxng I did. TBH. Maariya said something I set it straight. Then @mamoonax started lying for her mate. Which I get.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:37:47	@mamoonax what actually are you. I've been trying to work it out. But nah. I can't. @maariyakhalifa_
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:35:46	@mamoonax love. You don't pull anyone. Arranged marriage is all you'll get. Look at you
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-10-11 09:35:06	@golf_wxng @mamoonax because your comprehension is obviously shit.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-06 23:00:28	If you can name the lion and not the boy. Maybe you should look at your lives and priorities.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-06 22:59:25	Test: what was the name of the lion? What was the killers job/name? What was the name of the boy burned alive? What was the killers name?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-06 22:47:33	Did we become the 51st state while I was sleeping? Because @SkyNews gives us a lot of American news. Not even worldwide US news.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-06 20:23:40	Don't think my daughter should get her surprise

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-03 23:25:12	@Kerri_Prince normally yes. But when the gov has 22% of possible votes. That's no excuse anymore.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 22:21:01	@Shoegasmic hahaha. Good job we're on the same mental page
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 22:18:59	@Shoegasmic would have struggled to help them find their balls though.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 22:02:44	I love lyrics that resonate with you.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 20:56:34	With who you actually share beliefs with. Don't be a sheep. Listen to what they want to do with the country.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 20:55:27	My point in relativity is. We are so right wing, that the old centre is left. So it's all political talk to try and get you not to vote 1/2
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 20:53:22	My ideology is socialism. Not left wing or right wing because that's relative to a centre point. #jeremy4leader
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 20:50:52	Left wing. Ring wing. It's all bollocks. There is only politics. This is what I stand for. If you agree stand with me. #jeremy4leader
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 20:39:08	@ilyas_khan8 then there is something wrong with you.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 20:34:33	I know my worth. Simple as that. It'll always be your loss
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 20:33:22	I hate girls that when you give them a chance with you, they don't take it. Then get in a mood because you lack interest after. 1 chance
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 20:17:27	I'm gonna by a van. Just so someone can take their shoes off in the back and I can say "this is how it starts"
985089175	ArchiJAK	2015-08-02 19:46:02	@SophieHucker haha suppose. ;-).

985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-06 05:45:26	@HENDOOOOO I like Lallana in a 10 role. Rooney should bench warm. IMO.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-06 05:44:39	The Manc England fans actually complaining about the dance. Try complaining about being 7th you fucktards #moyesin
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-06 05:42:40	Does Roy have the balls to bench Rooney? - No. But Lallana and Sturridge should start for England
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-06 05:39:43	That's correct. Not one Manc involved!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-06 05:37:05	Prefer Lalana and Sturidge starting for us the Rooney.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-06 05:36:06	@jonmarran hahahaha.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-06 05:17:10	Fuck off Rooney.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-06 05:15:58	@jonmarran he's been on and off this season. Same as coutinho. But I'd say watching every game he's on more than off. But I see your point
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-06 05:09:25	@jonmarran I like him. Works hard.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 08:17:21	@georgegalloway what are the chances of being an unpaid aid or something, for you to teach me the politics game? Real question.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 08:14:44	@georgegalloway @ElDiabloRogo just another war to throw the poor and unemployed young at. The people that would vote this government out
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 08:13:14	@georgegalloway @ElDiabloRogo and also in my opinion. The dictators are our unelected government and it's allies.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 08:12:00	@georgegalloway @ElDiabloRogo used propaganda in an illegal coo of the elected government for one more malleable to the USA
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 08:09:51	@georgegalloway I agree with GG @ElDiabloRogo this is not an invasion of a sovereign state. This is the fight against bullies. That have ..
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 07:51:16	IF Howard Webb is refereeing Liverpool again. Then it's obvious the @FA are match fixing. Simple as that. Stop the corruption #fa #lfc
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 07:44:36	@DianaAlmallah so many things to say. But won't. :-P Tekkers
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 04:05:52	@thePRTY cheers buddy :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 03:46:54	@thePRTY no Muslim pun joke intended :-P lmao
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 03:46:25	@thePRTY I find it hard to control myself. I just need the right meds from my psychiatrist. 26th march. Until then I feel like a time bomb..
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 03:45:12	@thePRTY cheers mate. Problem is I'm Bipolar. And my daughter keeps getting bullied in school for being a Muslim. And then I get angry. And
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 02:39:00	New episode of the Vikings! Brilliant show.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 02:36:44	@victor8kuismin exactly. And that's why they need another war! Solves the unemployment issues. My sending more poor to die!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 02:30:48	@victor8kuismin lmao!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 02:27:49	@victor8kuismin especially by those that support it's funding of Israel. To them America is god. Who knew? Lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 02:25:56	@victor8kuismin I'm guessing we should just go along. And not question anything lol. Baaaa :-P
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 02:21:46	I really feel like handing myself into the psychiatric ward. I can't handle this manic aggressive phase I'm in. To fear myself is painful.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 02:19:27	@cosplayhassid @victor8kuismin i suppose I should blindly go with what an unelected government says and the media. By not siding with right
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 02:17:04	@cosplayhassid @victor8kuismin and point out the elitist agenda. That actually goes against the poor people war effects.. IS patriotism
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 02:15:43	@cosplayhassid @victor8kuismin exactly what Victor said. I fought for my country. I have the right and freedoms to point out its hypocrisy
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 01:54:57	@victor8kuismin you can't in the modern world invade a sovereign nation. Obvs our Foreign M has never heard. Of Iraq. Afghanistan. Pals etc
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 01:53:41	@victor8kuismin the IMF. The Global "west" interested Media. The UN. All ridiculous propaganda machines. Just saw William Hague saying ..
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 01:49:45	@victor8kuismin Same old same old. Trying to overthrow governments to get someone more west orientated. Russia bullying the bullies. :-D
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 01:13:58	Who side are you on? Russia's or The Wests?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-04 01:08:25	IMO It's about time political overthrows cause by "us" and the USA have consequences. They tried it in South America. They stood firm.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 09:26:42	@rickkenig @ElDiabloRogo I said the OT. Not the NT.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 09:26:09	Oh how I love being told what my book says by people who have never read it. Lmao. Cheers. Now fuck off.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 09:22:55	@rickkenig have you read it? Or just read a what it says book. Cos I think you're confused between hadiths and the Quran
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 09:21:23	@rickkenig the OT is an Islamic book as well. I have to treat it with the same respect as the Quran @ElDiabloRogo
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 09:19:52	@rickkenig @ElDiabloRogo @anjemchoudary the interpretation you've read from other books. Cheers. I'm off to bed now. Please umtag me :-) ta
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 09:18:55	@rickkenig @ElDiabloRogo @anjemchoudary thanks for your input. However. I like my interpretation of my book. Not your interpretation or
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 09:11:29	@rickkenig @ElDiabloRogo @anjemchoudary I don't need to Richard. I've read my Quran. I know what it says and what it doesn't.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:49:45	Final note. Tarring us all with the same brush, is like saying all EDL members are brainless.... Oh wait. That didn't work. :-P.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:44:13	@rickkenig @ElDiabloRogo @anjemchoudary not true. At all.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:41:18	Anyway. I better go for the night. Think I may only get worse if I stay on. Goodnight all.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:37:50	@cush42 goodnight buddy.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:37:00	You wanna live by Sharia law? Fuck of to country that has it. I wanna live in the sun, I will fuck off when I can. See how it works?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:35:40	How many of the Lying Bastards went to the European Court of H.R. to stop themselves being sent to the countries that live Sharia law? All?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:32:38	I think I'm on one! But tbh too many Muslims IMO stay quite about these Extremist Idiots! If you don't speak out. Then they speak for you!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:29:20	@cush42 and the cockroaches like Anjem Cuntface! They'd hide under a rock and survive.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:28:19	He says human rights are against Islam! Fine. Give him to me, he can be my bitch, I'd torture him till he begged for human rights!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:23:34	@anjemchoudary second chapter of the Quran was about these Quraish who worked from within Islam to destroy it. Take a bow, you are them.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:16:50	... From within. The people that pretended to the prophet as to what they were. I dedicate that chapter to you Anjem Choudary
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:15:16	The second chapter of the Quran are all about the Anjem Choudary's of the world. The people who preach hatred and lies. To destroy Islam ...
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:07:52	@anjemchoudary how were the Caliphs chosen?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 08:02:38	@anjemchoudary please follow this tweet with IMO it would save me saying. HORSE SHIT @WilnoPrince8
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 07:55:27	@cosplayhassid wow. Guess anti Semitic tweets are ok then?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 05:52:11	@ohopo maybe they need to concentrate on themselves and leave other people to Allah. Mountains and molehills lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 05:46:47	Hate days that feel as though you've been sat on your own all day.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 01:28:44	@Alice_LFC do it, then take your medicine :-P lol

985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-03-03 01:23:17	@jonmarran some fans think you can't say anything bad about managers or players, it's ridiculous! You are right on both!

985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 03:45:42	@PoppyKhan very very square! That is all lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 03:39:01	@RiseOfTheKop I wish someone would teach him to put his laces through the ball!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 03:18:05	Ok so. We finally won at Stoke. Kolo and Skrtel should never be allowed to play together. Suarez and Studge both scored. Good day
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:54:53	@TheRealHashimM maybe should stick to boxing and following #chinyKhan :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:51:31	@TheRealHashimM "most Liverpool players are from loan". 1/11 2/16. Not exactly most. Most meaning the majority. Maths classes for you :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:49:22	@TheRealHashimM Moses isn't in the 11 is he dude. So it's 1/11 or 2/16. Hardly "most".
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:47:16	@TheRealHashimM ah ok. Who are the two dude?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:45:01	@TheRealHashimM I can see how 1 out of 11 is most? Been punched in the head much bro?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:43:55	@aguyiusedtoknow so am I. My daughter isn't to please. I'm taking her to get her name changed. Lol

985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:37:33	It's actually #SaSaS just saying #lfc
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:33:29	Guess that wasn't a foul either! Adam you fat cunt.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:31:09	@ifuseekamy_ @ShadeMUFC Ashley Young?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:29:31	@ShadeMUFC @ifuseekamy_ no way. I breathed on Januzaj from Somerset. He falls over :-P
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:27:48	@ifuseekamy_ @ShadeMUFC no way. Anywhere else on the pitch that's a free kick. Didn't get the ball. Got the player. Penalty. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:26:35	@ShadeMUFC @ifuseekamy_ that's because if it was januzaj the stoke player would have been 5 feet away
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:24:38	If that was outside the box. It'd be a free kick. So it's a penalty. Simple really. Plus we scored so who cares.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-13 01:20:46	How was that a harsh decision? It was a nailed on penalty you cunts
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-12 22:57:41	KOL are playing over here this year! Just Saying. I'm fucking going! Alone if I must!

985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-11 21:25:45	@RobbieSavage8 how much would it cost for you to bitch slap Michael Owen or would the pleasure be payment enough?

985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-10 08:39:15	Watching 12 years a slave. Not sure I'll make it through the whole thing.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-09 07:51:41	@NicholasSHorne @Kopology helps. Surly that deserves some credit and is a good thing? Otherwise it'd be the usual EDL sort of shit. Which

985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-09 07:41:15	@NicholasSHorne @Kopology I think any step is worth celebrating, no?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2014-01-09 06:30:13	@simonshreeve @Kopology @Asiankopite I know. But it takes a special person to fight for right in the face of so much aggro.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:37:35	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani making you again. Look like a cunt :-D
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:37:21	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani I was a glory hunter. Surely. In recent times I could have picked a more successful clud, no?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:36:36	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani I understand the glory hunting thing can relate to most clubs compared to efc but really? Liverpool. If
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:34:50	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani either way. I owned you. And made you look like a cunt. Goodbye :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:33:18	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani that is balls!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:33:10	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani no but you suggest that people that can't make it to games aren't supporters. I pointed out reasons why
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:31:29	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani hahah. Yeah. Ok. Go join the conservatives. You'll fit right in with them views. ;-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:23:03	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani intellect. ;-). Pwhahahahahhahaha.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:22:48	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani you are basically clueless really aren't you, maybe you should stick to arguing with people on a level
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:22:04	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani and you said it's the only way. So sky don't pay TV rights to clubs? And if you subscribe to sky for eg?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:19:11	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani doesn't that make you a nazi fascist cunt :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:18:40	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani so so far. Poor, foreign, none Liverpudlians can't support Liverpool according to you.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:17:38	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani that can?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:17:31	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani the news. So obviously someone poor and can't afford to go to games. Is less of a supporter than so one
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:16:52	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani the answer is no. As it's obviously easier. And then we are in a time of austerity. Maybe you've seen it on
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:15:38	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani 1 games a year. Or two years. But a supporter that lives in the city goes to all the games. Are they a
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 23:14:52	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani as it goes. I do. But the question is irrelevant. Take a supporter from the states. Saves up and goes to
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 22:49:44	@hanidani I guess it got to him. He blocked me. :-P. That makes me the winners. Woooohoooo. Lmao.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 22:46:46	@hanidani @gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 I know. I just wanted to finish off making him look a complete dick
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 22:46:07	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani any foreign players. Or are all efc players from Liverpool?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 22:45:37	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani I know a mediocre team like Everton doesn't get global support. But are you a xenophobe? Do you kick out
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 22:44:35	@gmorgan9efc @REDNILE7 @hanidani selective reading syndrome? But even if not. What does that matter? Is it not a global sport now? I mean

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 06:53:59	@cosplayhassid I do. It's a different kind of lonely.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 06:29:39	@cosplayhassid haha. I like both games. But all sport has way to much gambling. That's all you here about even on the news channels
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 06:24:31	“ @BBCNews : Is Britain the NFL's 51st state? http:// bbc.in/16Bnt0X ” No, Britain is just the 51st state, green card please :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 06:06:20	I hope one day people will see that I'm a good person and maybe I'll find someone to love. Tired of loneliness. Goodnight all.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 05:20:31	@aliceSHERlocked but don't feel silly. It's better to have tried and failed than to not tried at all. You can move on now knowing you did
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 05:18:50	@aliceSHERlocked to me it sounds like his loss. I know you can't see it now. But one day you will. You're better than him. Worth more.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-27 03:19:07	@aliceSHERlocked you'll do it. You're a smart lass. :-) and you have people that listen :-).

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 21:34:31	@EvelinaGrezak yeah. It's gonna be right between us I think ;-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 21:32:25	@EvelinaGrezak haha. We're not looking good that good. Got to much pressure on Bradey. But that's the jets saved twice with last kick FG

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:34:23	Ok I'm going. My children need entertaining. Haha. Be back at match time. Come on #LFC . #ynwa
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:31:32	@Theboredcorpse @DrHallaDiyab I'm sorry for getting it wrong :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:30:40	@SulimanNuran yeah definitely, and cool. Twitter is a wonderful thing. :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:28:57	@Theboredcorpse ah so when you said @DrHallaDiyab wAs not wearing a hijab, you meant on the body? Not on her head. I apologise :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:25:47	@Theboredcorpse brother. I'd still like to know when the bosom became the head Brit policemen have this problem@SulimanNuran @DrHallaDiyab
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:23:24	@SulimanNuran Pathan pak/afghan borders. Via Kenya lol. You?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:22:20	I really hope and pray my daughter @AliyahKhan17 grows up to know she is not equal to any man, she is far more superior! Strong, intelligent
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:19:53	@SulimanNuran salaam. Thank you brother. :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:19:27	I really do find inspiration from people on twitter.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:11:12	@DrHallaDiyab exactly making hijab Sunnah not fard. IMO.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:09:30	@Theboredcorpse me biology must be fuzzy. Or women's bisons have moved. Shrugs.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:08:51	@Theboredcorpse bosoms on the head then?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:08:12	It amazes me the amount of people (Muslims included) that quote the Quran that have never read it at all or in a language they understand
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:05:57	@Theboredcorpse @DrHallaDiyab the page no. Will do
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 19:01:28	@Theboredcorpse @DrHallaDiyab please give me the passage it says this.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 18:58:14	I hope my daughter @AliyahKhan17 can learn from @DrHallaDiyab please follow her Aliyah. :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 18:57:03	@Theboredcorpse @DrHallaDiyab why should she?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 18:00:26	Even if they didn't want it.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 18:00:06	If we ban things. What makes us different from the Taliban. For example. If you take away choice. People will fight for what was taken.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 17:58:31	We should be teaching people the true Islam with the right and freedom of choice on our side. not banning things.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 17:57:10	My point is banning things is the mentality of the #islamists we are fighting. Banning women driving etc etc.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 17:52:59	@DrHallaDiyab not sure that made any sense. Lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 17:51:01	@DrHallaDiyab to wearing it because it's banned and saying FU you won't ban me! If you know what I mean.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 17:50:24	@DrHallaDiyab I agree. But this has to be a choice not forced by banning. As IMO if it's banned it puts peoples backs up and pushes people
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 17:47:20	@OckhamsShotgun it's numbers. But it starts with 1 and grows exponentially. I think social networks are helping spread the word. I hope :-/
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 17:43:34	@aliceSHERlocked anytime. You seem really bright. So you know what's the right path. You're on it! :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 17:41:10	@OckhamsShotgun plays into the hands of the elite. To say we the people have no power. We do. We just forgot how to use it!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 17:37:57	@aliceSHERlocked don't do it Alice. From what I've read your telling yourself the right things. Stay strong. :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 17:10:06	@cosplayhassid haha. Brilliant! Thanks.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 03:11:10	@zoneifangled yeah I find Fergie boring too.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 02:56:00	@ifuseekamy_ I get ya
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 02:41:39	@ifuseekamy_ if this was any other manager you'd accept Fergie looks a dick IMO. :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 02:40:58	@ifuseekamy_ talk about Fergie.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 02:40:37	@ifuseekamy_ he was asked direct questions he answered and made him look a bitter old fool. It's not like he called a press conference to
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 02:39:34	Thing is. They still need Fergie to do the "winding up" because Moyes is shit. But Fergie just looks a bitter old man
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 02:37:15	Man United fans are delusional. If another manager got owned like Rodgers owned Fergie they'd accept the owning. But no no it's all planned
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-26 02:21:21	@ifuseekamy_ haha. Are you joking. He made SAF look like a complete twat. Lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 23:22:53	@TheDavidka haha. Yeah.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 23:20:30	@TheDavidka @ohopo I get it, don't think he had to use that word to set the base line.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 23:14:43	@TheDavidka cool. I don't like it. I get the message. I honestly do. And I like the message. I just don't like the song.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:41:22	@Kopology I will try to. Haha. Thanks dude. :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:32:20	@Kopology dude. I'd love your input on my last hours worth of convos. Starting with a retweet of someone quoting a song. When you have time
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:30:54	@cosplayhassid I guess I'm overly PC then :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:30:00	In a derogatory way. Lennon in that song does use the N word in a derogatory way to show how bad women are treated.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:28:54	Yes I can call a paki a paki and a non paki can't, why? Because I know that Paki means pure for pure~country paki~Stan. I don't mean it
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:27:03	I am an ethnic. It's still not ok!! And come on. On what basis is that even a good song. Lyrically shit, musically shit, just. Shit
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:25:48	Because he married an ethnic. I'm guessing that's his get out of jail free card. Lmao.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:25:02	My point is. What made it ok for Lennon. But not ok for me?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:23:58	Women are the Yids of the world. Women are the chinks of the world. Women are the Pakis of the world.You let me know when I cross the line
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:19:22	Guess what. It's not racist if John Lennon said it! Well I'm sorry but it is
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:16:29	@EvelinaGrezak haha. I think they deserved it too. @cosplayhassid
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:15:55	@cosplayhassid airplay anymore. Maybe I'm just to sensitive Idk lol. Just my opinion :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:15:23	@cosplayhassid so to show how badly women are treated the bar has been set at Blacks N and slaves. Wow. Just wow. I'm glad it doesn't get
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:13:55	@cosplayhassid I think it's a crap song sorry. :-/. In one paragraph it has women are the N of the world Women are the slaves of the slaves
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 22:06:51	@ohopo I didn't say you were a racist. I said it's disgusting use of the N word. IMO. There is a difference. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 21:36:44	@EvelinaGrezak @cosplayhassid how embarrassing. My mum just shouted at me in the shop. For being on my phone. Smh. Ttyl x
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 21:36:03	@EvelinaGrezak @cosplayhassid lmao!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 21:35:40	@ohopo ok maybe I should have asked first. I just hate that word. Sorry.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 21:23:31	@cosplayhassid I will have a look. I'm out shopping again ATM. And pissing everyone of by tweeting lol as soon as I get home. Haha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 21:22:20	@cosplayhassid and also. Do you think. No matter the message. A non black could sing a song with that word in now? Not in the 60's
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 21:18:00	@cosplayhassid did she post the song? Did she add context? If you think it's fine to use that word that's up to you. I don't. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 21:05:40	@cosplayhassid so it's a free for all because Lenny wrote about it? Does the word cause offence? Yes. Is it racist? Yes. Simple really.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 21:03:37	@cosplayhassid yeah ok. But that doesn't change the use of the word. IMO. Unless she wrote this song?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 21:01:25	@cosplayhassid which quote?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 21:00:38	@cosplayhassid even the black people I've seen use it. Misspell it.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 21:00:04	@cosplayhassid yeah I have. And if a black person wants to use it then it's up to them. But if you ain't black you get unfollowed
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 20:56:46	There is no and never will be an excuse to use the N word. I unfollow anyone that uses it.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 20:53:26	@ohopo I get the point. Disgusting use of that word IMO.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 20:49:04	@FootyHumour that brilliant.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 06:56:30	@cosplayhassid haha. True! Hopefully one day we will have peace anyway. As soon as we see similarities and not differences
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 06:46:00	Goodnight everyone. I hope we all can find someone that makes us smile at the screen :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 06:44:42	Let hope for another amazing night for the #RedSox tonight.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 06:05:05	@cosplayhassid nice. That's really good. Keep it up :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 06:02:12	@RedSoxLife 8
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 06:01:40	@cosplayhassid crazy system. I hope you're well now
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 05:54:02	@cosplayhassid yeah. My problem is with the drs that wanna just give you drugs instead of dealing with the issues.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 05:51:07	@cosplayhassid nope it's not. It's tough.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 05:42:29	@sallyidwedar lol. I agree with you. :-). @EvelinaGrezak @cosplayhassid @UNRWA
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 05:40:34	@cosplayhassid lmao! It's always that way. Haha.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 05:38:48	@sallyidwedar @EvelinaGrezak @cosplayhassid @UNRWA I know. But in reading what Evelina wrote. I don't think she was with the others IMO.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 05:35:18	@sallyidwedar @EvelinaGrezak @cosplayhassid @UNRWA I would hate it if I'd be laughed at because I had no control over certain things.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 05:34:36	@sallyidwedar @EvelinaGrezak @cosplayhassid @UNRWA tell you though. I've had the embarrassment of losing a job and going on state benefits
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 05:29:51	@sallyidwedar @EvelinaGrezak never mind Sally. It's passed lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 05:28:41	@sallyidwedar @EvelinaGrezak I was hoping the other jokers were in. Lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-25 05:26:06	@sallyidwedar @EvelinaGrezak can I ask you all a question

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-24 09:14:44	@richards1052 @jacobinism @sallyidwedar @ikhras ie. Hamas and Israel.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-24 09:14:19	@richards1052 @jacobinism @sallyidwedar @ikhras Very telling that she choses to talk to people with other views. And not blow them up ;-)

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-24 03:33:45	@8Fact_Footballl is this actually true. Because I hate him. This would change that
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-24 03:29:41	@NateGuildea I read your bio and felt guilty for mine. So I have added my home town too :-).

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 20:19:49	Got to say @Ed_Miliband did really well shutting up that criminal PM, Well done. The abstaining on the immigration amendment was weak though
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 20:14:50	@georgegalloway loving the profile pic :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 20:11:13	@sallyidwedar @gazaboatconvoy I'm guessing they never heard of sung zu. And divide and conquer
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 20:07:33	@sallyidwedar @gazaboatconvoy the way of. One solid movement for a free Palestine. It's this disharmony that the Zionist love. IMO
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 20:06:46	@sallyidwedar @gazaboatconvoy stupid thing is. We are all on the same side. It's ridiculous. Political party beliefs should be getting in
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 20:04:30	@sallyidwedar crazy @gazaboatconvoy complain about "agenda" while promoting her own In the same tweet. #epicfailure . Rotfl
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 20:02:08	@gazaboatconvoy @sallyidwedar LOL. No agenda there then ;-) and when you read this tweet al should bow to GBC she owns Palestine and twitter
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:57:55	I don't understand people that support death and killing.. Hamas and the Israeli government are the same. Promoting death.The people suffer
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:55:00	@sallyidwedar thank you, @gazaboatconvoy
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:52:09	@gazaboatconvoy and what is your relevance? To all this. God of twitter.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:51:01	@sallyidwedar @gazaboatconvoy @richards1052 @shekissesfrogs no they want people you to support terrorists Sally.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:49:25	@gazaboatconvoy hahaha. No because you haven't got a clue.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:49:00	@sallyidwedar @gazaboatconvoy @richards1052 @shekissesfrogs my opinion. Like theirs make no difference. As they are not there.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:48:31	@sallyidwedar @gazaboatconvoy @richards1052 @shekissesfrogs and like I said to both. IMO Hamas are part of the problem not a solution but.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:47:52	@sallyidwedar @gazaboatconvoy @richards1052 @shekissesfrogs they won't. GBC just came on the attack. Didn't answer one of my questions I put
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:47:12	@sallyidwedar @gazaboatconvoy @richards1052 @shekissesfrogs Hamas won the election. Don't get there support either. Or are not pals either
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:46:35	@sallyidwedar @gazaboatconvoy @richards1052 @shekissesfrogs I guess that means all the pals that left to go to the WB from Gaza because
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:45:57	@sallyidwedar @gazaboatconvoy @richards1052 @shekissesfrogs Sally don't worry about it. They both attack you for not supporting Hamas..
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:40:15	@gazaboatconvoy @richards1052 @shekissesfrogs @sallyidwedar and remember GBC knows all and sees all. I bow to you. LMAO
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:38:23	@richards1052 @gazaboatconvoy not blowing shit up, fixing votes and polluting the teaching of the Quran. = Hamas. IMO. :-) have a nice day.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:37:20	@richards1052 @gazaboatconvoy terrorism. Or government terrorism. So include AQ. The IRA. Israel. USA. UK. Etc etc I believe in dialogue
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:36:10	@richards1052 @gazaboatconvoy however my view is this. Hamas are terrorists. I don't not support terrorists. Or countries that support
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:34:51	@richards1052 @gazaboatconvoy is. She can not assume to know every pals view. Unless she talks to all of them. That's fair I believe!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 19:33:08	@richards1052 I personally can't comment on the misinformation. I'm not there! I like to see a pals view on pal my point to @gazaboatconvoy
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 03:46:20	@EvelinaGrezak lol. Yeah them too :-P. From what I've seen I'm playing the usual women's role in this. She's playing the man lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 03:35:30	@EvelinaGrezak lmao. To true. Bloody Germans! :-P. Haha.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 03:31:47	And she wonders why they chose to live with me. Says I manipulated them. Trust me she did all the work for me :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 03:30:27	It's endless. Last weekend I went to London. So I asked my ex wife can you swap and not have them for the day.... http:// fb.me/1wv2vqb7j

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 03:09:48	@Skobochlobo lmao!! I did whine to them on twitter. :-).

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-23 01:52:30	@Izvolsky ahh. That old chestnut. Just helped that they were on top at the time. We understand ;-) @hanidani

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 22:06:34	IMO Hamas need to be removed from power for peace to work. As do the right wing of Israel. This is just sense :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 22:05:03	@sallyidwedar @gazaboatconvoy yes yes I does become clear. That if Palestinians don't support Hamas. You don't support them. :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 22:03:00	@MitchamBelle67 lmao. :-).

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 21:55:17	@sallyidwedar honestly. Anyone with a brain can see you have a refreshing and real view of Palestine, they are ridiculous. They should feel
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 21:52:12	I have realised I would actually be quite a good troll. ;-). Lmao.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 21:51:18	@sallyidwedar the thing is. That was me being reserved. :-). I am trying to control my language :-P lol @gazaboatconvoy

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 21:49:57	@sallyidwedar I have realised @gazaboatconvoy is an Israeli in disguise. He thinks twitter is his. Like Israel and Palestine lmao. #failure
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 21:47:36	@gazaboatconvoy @sallyidwedar btw that response is the definition of trolling. Trololollllollll. Lmao.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 21:45:33	@gazaboatconvoy do you actually understand twitter is a public forum? Or do your delusions of grandeur extend to think you own it? ;-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 21:43:42	@gazaboatconvoy lol @sallyidwedar I see your point I am a troll for showing short comings. What a dick head.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 21:33:19	@TransferSources or because the manager thought he thought he was bigger than him. Lol

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-10-22 00:21:03	I'm guessing the guy that planted bombs in mosques doesn't have a religion, if it was a Muslim with churches religion would be in the byline

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-05 07:20:27	@ALeigh_Red that's what you say to become a Muslim. So there is no god but Allah and prophet Mohammad is his messenger.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-05 07:19:32	@ConorHadley international managers that change the style for int games. That's what I think is up any way. Tbh what the fuck do I know lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-05 07:18:28	@ConorHadley aye that's true. But surely the players that are English that play week in week out.. That is their way of playing. It's the >

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-05 07:10:04	@ConorHadley country v country should be brazil style vs English style which is the prem, fast football, good skill and passing. >

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-05 07:00:37	@ConorHadley is fast. International football isn't. We should play int games like premier games. Again just my opinion
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-05 06:59:53	@ConorHadley league. So how is the league to blame? We've got great players that don't play the same for the national team IMO our league >
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-05 06:58:45	@ConorHadley I get what he's saying I just don't believe it's true. We haven't won since 66. It's a long way between then and the premier >

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:57:14	Goodnight all :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:38:38	@NeilJIrving24 I just can't look at him without wanting to smash something he's an arrogant little cunt. Urghhh you've found my kryptonite
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:37:45	@NeilJIrving24 no that's what I'm saying. It has nothing to do with it. I've praised MU players. RVP is in my fantasy team. I hate him!!!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:36:48	@augieameruso best business you done: getting rid of Moyes lmao.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:34:45	@NeilJIrving24 like I'm even gonna press play!! He's a slimy, prissy cunt. The way he stands before taking a FK I want to shit in his face!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:30:10	@NeilJIrving24 I'm not even saying his name. I hate him so much. I stopped watching real play..Coentrao is a good loan signing though! Smile
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:28:08	@NeilJIrving24 aye but I'm not one of them. Their is only one player I will never praise. The rest I say it as it is. IMO :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:26:30	@carleenfitzi that's it I'm going to get a cuppa!! Lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:23:44	@augieameruso you did great business in the end mate!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:22:08	@NeilJIrving24 has nothing to do with it. He's shit IMO. Everyone have done really well this transfer window. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:15:55	I think #efc did some great business. Good signing, brilliant. Getting rid of Moyes. Genius #mufc #lfc
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:12:49	@dom_campbell is take 4 of ours. We've strengthen the whole team. They've strengthen one spot
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:09:04	@Shahid_LFC on a fucking free!!! Awesome :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:06:17	I think all transfers that ain't in should be stopped now. Surely. Deadline passed = man united get fuck all. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:05:16	@Umar_Wilshere19 @NeilJIrving24 not a prayer of regaining that title.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:03:35	@DanAvesLFC4 even that bid has been turned down. Hahahaha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 06:00:04	I wonder what Fergie is thinking right now - actually I couldn't give a fuck. Hahahahhahahahahhahahahhahaha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:55:21	@Colly622 the player your getting from #lfc @borinifabio29 is awesome mate. Has a huge future ahead. I'm sorry to see him leave. #ynwa
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:49:55	@d_cory09 @jonesjt01 I'm loving Moyes. I hope he stays at united. Forever!!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:49:24	@jonesjt01 @d_cory09 Laughing stock of the league, oh I feel bad for them... Fuck no I don't Mwahahhahahhaha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:48:05	With #efc these three. They got better players in than United. I love it. Best transfer window ever. UNITED SUCK ASS
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:44:06	Calm: that is how business is done. #lfc . Thank you @John_W_Henry and #fsg professionalism
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:41:53	@aliceSHERlocked needed more than one player. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:40:25	@jonesjt01 @d_cory09 he is though. He's getting Fellaini from Everton :-P hahahaha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:37:29	@NeilJIrving24 no no. I just hope they give him time to fuck things up more. Sir Alex did ask for him to be given time after all :-P
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:34:35	It's not jealousy at all. But #afc needed more than one awesome player to contend, keeper. Defence IMO #lfc business #Dons
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:32:16	@NeilJIrving24 yeah for sure. As a Liverpool fan. I hope he is given years lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:31:11	@NeilJIrving24 and it's not even the club. It's him people are laughing at. That's just not man united!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:30:26	@NeilJIrving24 honestly mate if you don't Moyes is in trouble. Man United aren't used to being the club people are laughing at.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:29:18	@iLivForPool @indykaila I'm gonna wee. I shit you not. I'm gonna wee. It's brilliant!! Fuck MUFC
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:28:28	#AFC have pulled off the 1 transfer of the season, congrats. But #LFC have done the best business we got 8 top quality players.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:26:20	@NeilJIrving24 if I'm reacting like this for a team I despise I have no idea how you are staying calm!.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:25:27	@NeilJIrving24 lol. But he got none. Your Manchester fucking united!!!!!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:24:49	@NeilJIrving24 yeah I know. But I didn't have room to put fake rumour lmao.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:23:57	@ThoseScouseLads lmao!!!!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:23:03	Hey the Ngog rumour isn't looking so bad now is it #MUFC . #lfc lmao. Hahahahhahaha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:22:15	@NeilJIrving24 it's ridiculous. So Fellaini that's his only target. Crazy. Maybe Ngog was a good idea? Lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:21:02	@iLivForPool @indykaila it's just brilliant. I actually keep laughing everytime I think about it. Mwhahahahahah

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:13:18	Who's up for being fake Man United agents? We can fuck them up every transfer market. Hahahahhaha.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:11:25	But that means MU didn't bid for herera at all! They are pinning their championship hope on getting Fellaini. Hahahahhahahahhahahaha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:09:27	@TitaniumToe @indykaila that's what they just said on sky sports.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-03 05:08:04	MUFC fans are so sick off Moyes already. There pretending to be him to sign players. ROFL.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 05:08:24	Spurs gave Arsenal Ozil. Which help arsenal #fail . Everton gave Man United Moyes which helps us #fail they say keep you enemies close
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 05:06:17	@NeilJIrving24 @Umar_Wilshere19 this is the home of witty banter. Time stayed at the door.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 05:02:57	@Umar_Wilshere19 exactly. What a bunch of fuck ups. Lol. Haha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:59:46	Technically Spurs have strengthened Arsenal and they say spurs are good at business. #fail . @Umar_Wilshere19 lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:57:30	2 Ozils = 1 Bales and I am the Pope. I bless you all my children!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:56:33	In what world is Ozil worth 42 mil and bale is worth 85 mil.. Oh this one. #fuckedupshit !
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:47:03	@FoyzulAlam defo. Next year lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:45:55	@Umar_Wilshere19 @NeilJIrving24 united should be connected to the big named players. That's all I'm saying. They are the champs :-) #sick
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:44:05	@NeilJIrving24 what he said :-P lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:43:25	@FoyzulAlam it's have to be a huge name. And we ain't in a position with no CL. I'd just tell real to fuck off! Lmao.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:41:27	We #LFC fans need to take a breath. We are not in the UCL we are one season away from big names. This season is to soon. We will fight!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:37:08	@FoyzulAlam yeah that would work. But only if we get a player + cash It's to close to the dead line
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:33:41	@MrScripto @Abdul_a95 he can't Pat he's too busy on your mum :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:32:23	@NeilJIrving24 summing up all teams need to sign even the champions. To strengthen. If not they stood still. Even by getting Fellaini
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:30:59	Not enough notice IMO. Suarez is not for sale. At all. Come back with £100mil end of the season cos he's better than Bale
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:28:40	@NeilJIrving24 the point I made was if that's all you get compared to Ozil for arsenal.. That's a failure. So yes you did :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:26:04	@NeilJIrving24 bitter? Haha your comparing Fellaini to Ozil. They're not even on the same planet. Lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:23:49	@NeilJIrving24 any player from there is a reject #factoflife
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:20:14	@NeilJIrving24 phahaha. Everton reject. LOL. Moyes has show how much he rates him by not bidding higher. If he does now its only panic!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:17:06	@Umar_Wilshere19 yes mate. He's special man. But if/ when you pull this off.. We can all LOL at United. Fellaini hahahahha.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:15:24	@Umar_Wilshere19 Ozil is a Don.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 04:14:14	@TheDanielEKing especially when they got it from the broke banks. Lol. Smh

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 01:06:08	@NeilJIrving24 he thinks man united had a good game? Will be fine with no signings? He's on drugs.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 01:04:28	Moyes has been smoking weed.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 00:53:28	Nice win. Getting the scores wrong but results right. :-). Spurs: player stealing wannabes that will never be. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-02 00:50:26	@tancredipalmeri 3 countries? Are they buying half a player from one country and half from another smh.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 23:41:29	@LFC_Mark96 I think they're the only club he would leave for. But at least they pay silly money.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 23:39:37	@themichaelowen for which team though?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 23:37:52	@LFC_Mark96 I think so. Gerrard said its defo not about money. So if its about the football why leave. Genius using Torres as an example

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 22:42:04	@NeilJIrving24 the pressure on him is gonna be immense. Not fair really.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 08:12:58	@2school4cool (c) every race b or w receives racism. Obviously if your an ethnic minority you will feel it more. But it exists for all :-)

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 08:08:33	@2school4cool as a mixed race person I would say growing up I got far more racism for being too white from my Asian school friends than (c)

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 06:56:34	@ShibbyLFC aye I agree

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 06:10:29	@ElPratto_ yeah I suppose. It's just after seeing him trash his players after the match today. Doesn't fill me with confidence lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 06:08:52	@Chris_OByrne 5 mil. Wow!! Lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 06:07:37	@ElPratto_ I wouldn't like one of our players under Di Canio if I'm honest.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 06:05:58	IMO #LFC transfers have been superb this window and I love people are still underestimating us. WE ARE LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 06:03:04	@aliceSHERlocked aye. It's the only way to watch football :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 05:59:22	@Umar_Wilshere19 @NeilJIrving24 sweet. Aye man. Think the Gooners have it in the bag tbh. And I Give united 1 goal cos we don't have toure
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 05:57:04	@NeilJIrving24 @Umar_Wilshere19 Liverpool 2-1 Gooners 4-2 classic
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 05:41:56	@NeilJIrving24 just joking, calm down lad :-P. haha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 05:40:57	@MichaelVaughan second. Moyes first haha. :-P
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 05:38:48	@NeilJIrving24 he'd have got away with it if he was still wearing a man united shirt! :-P lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 05:14:47	@cleggzta lmao! Yeah it's one of them pains.. It stops hurting so you put more salt on. Then you get disappointed cos it doesn't hurt lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 05:12:10	@cleggzta salt it.. It hurts more for a sec. But it's a nice hurt ;-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 05:07:48	@Abdul_a95 lmfao. Brilliant. Don't retweet me though!!! Haha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:37:29	@NeilJIrving24 no. Because I'm saying what I saw with my own eyes at the time from my experience and job. So I'm just sharing lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:36:33	@ElPratto_ my house is like the UN. With more fights :-P haha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:36:14	@ElPratto_ yeah me too. Maybe after we bread out race altogether in a few more generations lol. I did my part I married a German Jew. Cont
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:35:04	@NeilJIrving24 and in my experience. Not like that. It was huge. And the sell off of airlines was second to none.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:34:18	@NeilJIrving24 three days before? Enough to start the collapse of markets? Nope my whole family are traders it's our business. Cont
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:33:15	@ElPratto_ now*
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:33:02	@ElPratto_ I get far more not for being a Muslim than I ever did for being "too" white. Lol. Times are changing lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:32:11	@ElPratto_ also. Im mixed race and I have to say growing up I got more racism for being white from other races then the other way.. However
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:30:13	@NeilJIrving24 it's fact. Not conspiracy. And to move the markets in any direction without external influence (just money) takes billions
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:28:57	@ElPratto_ I think all people and all races are racist to some degree and all have suffered from it in different forms. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:25:05	@LFC_Mark96 it would for ever be known as Everton day. Lmao.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:24:12	@NeilJIrving24 so someone knew enough to bet on a disaster :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:23:50	@NeilJIrving24 cont did start to collapse a few days before. The money all traced becak to Israel and American in the investigation. Cont
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 04:22:58	@NeilJIrving24 although I don't agree with an inside job. The stock markets don't lie. I traded back then on the FOREX. And the markets cont
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 03:23:27	I'm gonna say FUCK OFF FILL the bin up. Cheers
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 03:21:57	@Umar_Wilshere19 @NeilJIrving24 aye man.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 03:19:55	@Umar_Wilshere19 @NeilJIrving24 that's cos the manager (shit) wants him but the board probably don't rate him. IMO.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 03:15:23	@NeilJIrving24 cool man. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 03:13:52	@Bennn_Marshall @NicoleScherzy she is. WOW! Lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 03:13:03	My winner is on right now!!! WTF!!!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 03:12:39	@NeilJIrving24 really? I'm amazed. I'd be kicking right off.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 03:10:12	@Bennn_Marshall @NicoleScherzy there is a compliment in there somewhere hahaha.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 03:09:08	@NeilJIrving24 is be praying for some players to be brought in. And not Everton players. What do you think? Will you be happy just them?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 03:04:35	@NeilJIrving24 awesome. He's brilliant then, you have no worries at all. Moyes is great :-). LOL
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 02:58:35	@NeilJIrving24 but I'm more confident about #lfc winning than I have been in years. United look average IMO. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 02:57:54	@NeilJIrving24 what 2 seasons out of how many at #lfc . And that was us not being good rather than him being good. Anyway we'll see.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 02:54:54	@NeilJIrving24 3 times in 22 he beat us. So are you saying the manager doesn't count? So you could have won so much without SAF then? Lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 02:52:28	@NeilJIrving24 steady? Moyes is gonna be the down fall of united dude. You've got to see that He doesn't have any record against top teams
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 02:50:05	@NeilJIrving24 I'm going for 2-1. #lfc win.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 02:47:17	@NeilJIrving24 haha. Like that happens often. Smh!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 02:45:11	@NeilJIrving24 you?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 02:45:05	@NeilJIrving24 I am. I'm looking forward to a great result for #lfc
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-09-01 02:30:17	@KoloKolotoure28 In Sha Allah You'll get well soon. The rock in our defence. I'm doing Duas for you. #ynwa #lfc

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:35:34	@MediaLFC what are you on about?:-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:35:00	@OckhamsShotgun @Mike_Fabricant WTF is wrong with people
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:32:31	@tRuthbytweet goodnight gorgeous. Sweet dreams.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:31:17	@ALeigh_Red that's just fucking disgusting. People like that have no morals and no honour
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:30:18	I think any people chanting about Munich to United fans are sick and not #LFC fans. So they need to stfu giving true fans a bad name #MUFC
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:27:07	@ALeigh_Red that's disgusting!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:25:54	@NeilJIrving24 if I agree with a statement I will retweet it
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:23:22	@NeilJIrving24 and as usual you give a devils advocate response without actually solving the problem. Fence sitting not an option :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:21:54	@NeilJIrving24 it stands by the word of our leaders... Which equals nothing. Therefore you have seen NO evidence that is not propaganda. Ct
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:20:04	@Kerri_Prince war what is it good for.....(8). Lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:17:52	@NeilJIrving24 you either believe our government or you don't. I have seen no evidence and neither have you. (Top secret).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:17:04	@NeilJIrving24 plenty of evidence? Like Iraq? Like atos telling disabled people they need to work, like that austerity measures work? Cont:
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:14:20	@NeilJIrving24 it would look a lot better than blowing people up. With no evidence. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:12:06	@NeilJIrving24 diplomacy.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 06:10:50	Today was finally democracy at its finest in our nation! No we see we have power it's time to remove the ConDems it's to late
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 05:09:19	@OckhamsShotgun I'm worried. But I don't think the government will get it through. Maybe this first vote. But not the second
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-30 04:31:34	In all fairness. Torres' touch is shit and he's lost a yard of pace, which made up for the shit touch In the past. #lfc

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 23:07:03	@carldean3 @Jerry_Osman it's shows the mentality of some. How quick they go from discussion to abuse just because you disagree. He's blocked
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:58:31	Can any of the Labour Party actually speak!!

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:45:12	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 why because I don't agree with you? Have you read the second chapter of the Quran. It's all about you ;-) Stfu cunt

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:43:07	@Umar_Wilshere19 Shane warne blocked me because of my Aussie sledging :-(. It's fine for him though!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:42:09	@carldean3 and you see this is also why nothing ever gets sorted. Because they want to argue about shit instead of the crisis at hand!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:41:11	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 looks like Britain is the cause of the "Arab spring" now. Lol. Amazing.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:39:47	@carldean3 @Jerry_Osman absolutely!! Cheers Carl. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:38:16	@carldean3 @Jerry_Osman There will be no convo here. He just blames the world for our in fighting as a religion and backwards thinking
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:37:02	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 I'd appreciate It if you wouldn't tweet me again. I did ask for discussion only. No name calling.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:36:15	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 lmao. Ridiculous. It amazes me the no logic approach of extremist idiots everything is a conspiracy. :-D good one
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:34:53	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 lol. Oh you don't need evidence of who used the chemical weapons. You just know. And my heads up my arse lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:31:11	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 answer the question please. Should we as a nation stand by and watch chemical weapons being used?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:27:57	@carldean3 @Jerry_Osman I agree. Iraq is one thing 9-11. Get a grip
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:26:31	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 it's judgment isn't it. Because we as people get propaganda from both sides, fact.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:25:51	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 where is YOUR evidence. You ask for his evidence. Where is yours?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:24:56	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 where*
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:24:47	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 share is your evidence?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:24:18	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 names. Stfu and go away. Chill the fuck out.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:23:46	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 and like wise. Propaganda is on both sides! So who's the sheep. If you want to discuss great if you want to call >
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:20:58	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 regardless. Should we as a nation standby and watch chemical weapons being used?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:15:19	@Jerry_Osman @carldean3 I think with 80,000 - 100,000 dead both sides are killing.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:14:01	@carldean3 for sure man. Scary times ahead I fear
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:02:20	@carldean3 I agree, however that would mean. Uniting Islamic countries, Russia and china. This will spark out of control. That's my concern
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 22:00:15	Do you know what gave us pride from WW1 and WW2. we as a British nation did not stand by and watch atrocities. This is what being British is
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 21:55:03	@CarolineLucas Israel as well.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 21:53:43	@carldean3 it's a crazy situation. I'm confused completely at the right thing to do :-/.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 21:52:15	The problem we have is the nation do not believe anything the government says because off Iraq. Flips side: other nations know that! IMO
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 21:50:51	I don't understand how the country is not watching the news right now. This can determine the lives if millions. #syria
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-29 21:49:33	No military action! End off. It will start world war 3. #fact . #syria #theendisneigh

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-28 02:11:12	Looking for a good result tonight. #lfc
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-28 02:08:53	All I'm sure of is.. It's wrong to sit and watch people die in #Syria . War is not the answer, but neither is bystander apathy.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:56:29	@OckhamsShotgun @CarolineLucas yeah man. I hear you too. It's so difficult.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:47:31	@OckhamsShotgun @CarolineLucas easy to say what won't work but tell me what will. You know. :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:46:38	@OckhamsShotgun @CarolineLucas yeah man for sure. I'm not pro war in any way shape or form. I'm just at a loss of what we can do and it's >
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:43:53	@iheartcoutinho @koptalking will still get experience being in the setup and environment. Not to mention the lift in spirits.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:42:34	Don't have any idea who to vote for. This is not good.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:30:14	@HusseinAlsulami @HashMares fair enough.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:29:01	@HusseinAlsulami @HashMares no. I didn't mean that at all. I think sky and our news are propaganda machines for the west. That's not racist
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:26:06	@HusseinAlsulami @HashMares Hussein. Can you explain how saying a news channel does propaganda is being racist please, If you can apologise
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:24:34	@HashMares @HusseinAlsulami he won't answer dude. He know how ridiculous calling me racist was
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:19:09	@WLWASIOH @CarolineLucas I know. And all the different sides saying different things. And you know everyone is lying lol.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:18:19	@HusseinAlsulami aye man. I'd love a cuppa. Bit I'm obviously to racist to have a cuppa with Arabs smh. What a ridiculous thing to say. Lmao
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:17:24	@HusseinAlsulami my point is! I me ruined a news channel. Not a race of people. So how was I racist?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:16:45	@HashMares @HusseinAlsulami hello mate
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:16:02	@OckhamsShotgun @CarolineLucas yeah I agree. but We've been doing that for two years. 80,000 - 100,000 people dead.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:13:22	@CarolineLucas but what do we do. Nothing? I'm confused. It's hard to sit and watch. People are dying
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:09:20	@HusseinAlsulami you see the facts are. Al quaeda only give their press releases to aljazeera. Weird that?!?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:08:04	Is it racist for me to express my opinion that Aljazeera spread propaganda for Alquaeda? Opinions please
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:06:51	@olanihuntunde @LFC_news_YNWA_ @WayneRooney yeah he did completely. Neither side looked great though.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:06:05	@HusseinAlsulami so why don't you go fuck yourself.. Your obviously to dumb to read properly (not because your arab) but because your dumb
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:04:59	@HusseinAlsulami did I say every Arabic guy is working for al Qaeda?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:04:33	@HusseinAlsulami no just aljazeera IMO.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 23:03:37	@HusseinAlsulami @indykaila how is that racism? Explain?
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:59:21	@olanihuntunde @LFC_news_YNWA_ @WayneRooney I think he went on to that after. He was actually on about the game it self. LOL
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:57:24	@paulwilsongnm @m_christenson that's cos he looked out And saw half the room asleep lol
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:54:25	@HusseinAlsulami @indykaila lol. A racist paki Muslim. Good one :-P. dick head
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:52:40	@marniLFC I slept through that period like I'm sleeping through this press zzzz
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:51:47	@iheartcoutinho @koptalking who cares the experience he'll get playing at that level is great for LFC
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:50:40	@indykaila aljazeera? They know loads about football. Smh. They should stick to propaganda for al quaeda
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:48:54	Sorry for the length of answer. Sorry I zoned out halfway through.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:46:45	Gareth southgate = shit coach. Shit manager. Simples. Got the job on name alone not qualifications. This needs to change in football!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:43:52	@niamtears @georgegalloway how can anyone take you serious when your begging 1D.. Smh. Hahahahahahaha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:41:09	@jccouso @Torres haha. Yeah. Good point lmao. I was just reminiscing haha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:35:06	Maybe I'm just sad. But I miss @Torres in #lfc red!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 22:23:03	I wish I could sing. Nah nah, nah nah, nah nah, nah nah, T____s T____s. again. It was fun :-)

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 21:58:59	@indykaila if I'm honest I'd take him back. At say 10 mil. Then they've paid us 40 mil to have him. Sorted :-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 21:57:12	@indykaila yeah. Look out for next tweet? #LFC . This is not #lfc
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 21:49:11	@wordonthepitch @indykaila that's not news. It's like saying if I sell a player someone has bought a player. No shit sherlock
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 21:45:58	@indykaila still waiting!!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 20:45:28	@AshResistance he's also a racist. That why I blocked him. He was racist to me
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 20:37:56	@AshResistance @georgegalloway @AhmadAbuhadi and I was talking about ahmadabuhadi
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 20:36:55	@AshResistance @georgegalloway @AhmadAbuhadi IMO
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 20:34:27	@georgegalloway @AhmadAbuhadi @AshResistance even I have him blocked George. He's an extremist. #fact
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 20:27:48	@georgegalloway they'll probably get money for voting the wrong way!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 20:08:44	@indykaila funniest tweet ever!!! Lmao
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 20:02:25	Looks like @warne888 can give it but can't take it. Failure!! #igotblocked :-(
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 19:57:27	@NeilJIrving24 nice one dude. :-).
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 19:52:25	I think people calling for #FSG out are stupid, we need a strong squad, we are not in a position to get 'marquee' players. UCL next season.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 19:06:24	@dom_campbell please no more throwing up ones :-P haha

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 04:40:38	Vidic and his elbows. That was a red card ref :-P
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 04:26:09	I know it's better for us to get a draw. But I can't help but want Man United to lose!
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 04:21:44	Is there any better site than a lady in a Liverpool shirt. .. Nice!! ;-)
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 04:20:28	@DietmarHamann ball to hand. Bloody hell. Lol.

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 03:57:35	I have no doubt that United fans are secretly worried about Moyes. Chelsea are playing with no forward. Attack attack attack

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 03:41:08	To state the obvious. Chelski are lacking someone upfront :-P haha
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 03:40:19	@GaryLineker zzzzzzzzzx

985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 02:17:26	@DietmarHamann @Johnariise3 don't you think sports and betting are to closely linked anyway? Turn on sports news half of its odds.
985089175	ArchiJAK	2013-08-27 02:15:37	@Bennn_Marshall exactly. If we could get him for a steal. We need depth. Why not! Lol
