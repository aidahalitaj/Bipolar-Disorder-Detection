1588305354	BIPOLARNUMBER1	2013-12-02 00:15:20	@SolaFilm you have gone very quiet on me now what's is wrong only voicing my opinion
1588305354	BIPOLARNUMBER1	2013-12-02 00:06:14	@SolaFilm But alas my bipolar and its creativity made me able to live the life I live now it gave me wealth but not a life
1588305354	BIPOLARNUMBER1	2013-12-02 00:03:30	@SolaFilm been in front of those bright lights many times had cameras close to my face walked the boards served my time but I had to hide
1588305354	BIPOLARNUMBER1	2013-12-01 23:57:10	@SolaFilm nothing is as good than a person upon a stage that as lived the part they play I disagree with actors who do not know how I feel
1588305354	BIPOLARNUMBER1	2013-12-01 23:51:48	@SolaFilm you know how it feels you have felt it and lived it but why sing about a broken heart if your heart has never been broken
1588305354	BIPOLARNUMBER1	2013-12-01 23:50:16	@SolaFilm unless your actors have been where I have been its just not the same
1588305354	BIPOLARNUMBER1	2013-12-01 23:49:02	@SolaFilm they are lots of actors with bipoar why not use them
1588305354	BIPOLARNUMBER1	2013-12-01 23:47:59	@SolaFilm actors can not seriously feel how I feel they have never been suicidal never been high therefore can not portray mental illness
1588305354	BIPOLARNUMBER1	2013-12-01 23:45:27	@SolaFilm but that us wrong in order to act the part you must haved lived the part
1588305354	BIPOLARNUMBER1	2013-12-01 23:43:30	@SolaFilm do you choose people to portraythe have a mental illness or do you use those whom have a mental illness we can all act
1588305354	BIPOLARNUMBER1	2013-12-01 23:41:56	@SolaFilm your replies state that you don't. really care as long as you make your film with all that money do your actors have bipolar
