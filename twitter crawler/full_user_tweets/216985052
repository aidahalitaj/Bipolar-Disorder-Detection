216985052	pinguinokx	2015-07-23 17:01:57	When will I learn watching "dogs reunited with owners" videos only ends in tears #StoopidFeels
216985052	pinguinokx	2015-07-20 11:09:35	@Doesnt_matter84 thanks for the chat though, much appreciated, it helped, goodnight (or day or whatever it is?!) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2015-07-20 11:08:32	@Doesnt_matter84 More of an ironic observation really! Probs just lack of sleep, worked nightshift last night & not slept yet
216985052	pinguinokx	2015-07-20 11:05:30	@Doesnt_matter84 "practicing what you preach" and all that! My clients know me well too so it just feels a bit weird sometimes but all good
216985052	pinguinokx	2015-07-20 11:02:36	@Doesnt_matter84 yeah, luckily my coworkers & managers are supportive and understand which is great, it's just a weird peer support thing
216985052	pinguinokx	2015-07-20 10:57:42	@Doesnt_matter84 Same here
216985052	pinguinokx	2015-07-20 10:54:39	@Doesnt_matter84 If timed right they're great, if not, I'm either too doped up or bordering on hypo mania...have good support though :) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2015-07-20 10:51:48	@Doesnt_matter84 the meds I'm on are working well, just hard to be consistent taking them when I'm on shift work
216985052	pinguinokx	2015-07-20 10:50:38	@Doesnt_matter84 As a MH worker part of my job is prompting my clients to take their meds @the right time - feel like I need the same!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2015-07-20 10:39:14	Timing my own psych meds on 24/7 shift work is a bitch. Ironically my job involves prompting clients to take their meds at the right time
216985052	pinguinokx	2015-06-18 07:33:56	@Carregonnen Things be really good thanks :-) How be things with you? x

216985052	pinguinokx	2014-05-22 17:22:51	Shame if she had an unfortunate "accident" ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2014-05-22 17:22:03	I'm proud that I got so far (out of 110 applicants) she just had more experience. Gonna be a bit awkward working with her to start tho
216985052	pinguinokx	2014-05-22 17:20:20	I'm thinking hitman? Maybe pull a Nancy Kerrigan on her?
216985052	pinguinokx	2014-05-22 17:19:39	Found out today that altho recommended for the position I applied for I'm second disappointed. If other person turns it down its mine so

216985052	pinguinokx	2014-05-20 14:04:38	@TelevisionHound agreed, this has me perplexed also.
216985052	pinguinokx	2014-05-20 14:03:38	@TelevisionHound Opossums, mowed lawns, sore calves, burger alerts and now pudding and cookies? Wish my day was proving to be as eventful ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2014-05-19 18:43:34	I do however love a good blooper /outtake feature :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2014-05-19 18:42:16	Is it just me or does the "deleted scenes" feature on DVD's always disappoint? Out of context they lose any meaning / impact for me...
216985052	pinguinokx	2014-05-19 17:23:39	Have I mentioned what a kickass bunch of followers I have?? Y'all put up with my frequently nonsense tweets. Thanks for that eh?! ;) x

216985052	pinguinokx	2014-05-06 15:51:37	Did a Non Violent Crisis Intervention course today. De-escalating, non restrictive practice is such a step up from restraint & seclusion

216985052	pinguinokx	2013-04-20 12:39:46	@ReleasingLunacy You're just echoing my thoughts ;-) *hugs* x #ReadMyMind
216985052	pinguinokx	2013-04-20 12:38:31	@ReleasingLunacy is, there is still a lot if stigma out there and, although it shouldn't, it could affect the decision to employ me? :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2013-04-20 12:37:20	@ReleasingLunacy but I don't like the idea of them saying to potential employers, "oh btw he has Bipolar Disorder is that a problem?" Truth
216985052	pinguinokx	2013-04-20 12:35:48	@ReleasingLunacy Indeed! That's what I thought. It's no big deal atm cos the job assignment is in the mental health field and they know me
216985052	pinguinokx	2013-04-20 12:30:01	why does it matter? I see no reason to disclose this info if its not pertinent. Anyone know about this or any ideas? Cheers twitter folk x
216985052	pinguinokx	2013-04-20 12:28:39	that due to a "duty of care" they have to divulge this info to potential employers. I'm not sure that's right? If it doesn't affect my work
216985052	pinguinokx	2013-04-20 12:27:22	So the temp agency I signed with is aware of my MH diagnosis and medication. I was honest when I completed the medical forms. They told me

216985052	pinguinokx	2013-02-08 13:56:21	@schroddybach Her performance in Brokeback Mountain was chilling...so cold. I think the female performances in that film were not given
216985052	pinguinokx	2013-02-08 13:54:57	@schroddybach I've never made the Anne Hathaway comparison...mind you I've never heard her sing! I do think she's a good actress though..
216985052	pinguinokx	2013-02-08 13:53:28	@schroddybach Possibly my favourite movie!! :D it's a work of art...Bob Fosse was a fucking genius IMO and Liza?! *fan boying*

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 16:08:36	@Mich_568 Lol #DickPic
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:52:09	@swanners272 mind you after a couple years separation they started "dating" again and have been back together since so....
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:50:42	@swanners272 ...she waited another 6 years before doing it.....
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:49:59	@swanners272 I only ask as when I was his age I was very aware that my mum was unhappy. I actually told her to leave when I was 14..
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:42:21	Possibly sharing too much information about myself lol *apologizes to sensitive souls* #DirtyMarc
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:40:03	@Mich_568 there would be someone just metres away and it would be fuck, wonder which guy in my apartment building that is?? Lol #Convenient
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:38:45	@Mich_568 When I was living in inner city Sydney there were always many options within a 1km radius lol #DatingSite Of course occasionally
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:37:13	@Mich_568 As in "well hung top guy looking for fun...into S/M, fetish etc." 100 metres away :P lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:35:59	@Mich_568 Yep gay "dating" / hook up app. It's very convenient as it uses smart phone location thingy to show prospects by distance lol !!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:28:38	@swanners272 That does make it harder. How is your relationship with your son, can you talk to him? (tell me if I'm being too personal) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:24:34	@swanners272 Nice :) if you're really unhappy it's worth considering other possibilities *hugs* Not sure if I've asked b4, do u have kids? x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:18:02	@Mich_568 Have been toying with the idea of signing up with one too. Of course there's always Grindr ;-) #DatingSite

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-08 15:04:13	@swanners272 I know that feeling. I guess that's kinda what I'm doing just not by choice. I certainly haven't found a place worth being yet

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-05 20:38:42	Oh I should mention she does this mornings only. She squirts hot water only up her arse at night so it doesn't "keep me awake"
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-05 20:36:41	One lass gives herself regular coffee enemas and it doesn't occur to her that "cleaning the nozzle" regularly is a good idea *shudder*

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-09-04 15:50:40	Ok so, this is weird, but I seem to be developing a stutter. My fucked up brain throwing something new at me? Medication side effect?

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-08-10 13:45:35	"what plant is that?" "what fish is that?" etc. Publish a book of obscure, unidentifiable things and call it "What the fuck is THAT?"
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-08-10 13:43:32	Genius book idea by a friend of mine...those identification books for flora / fauna enthusiasts titled "what bird is that?"

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-31 21:57:25	@Mich_568 @itsjackok he wrote that on my form , literally, "last 12 months have sucked" eeeeergh :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-31 21:55:48	@Mich_568 @itsjackok ohhhhh, not so sure?! everyone had hilarious confident anecdotes. I was just "last 12 mths have sucked"...

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-31 21:36:50	Interviewer apologized for taking so long to move onto next contestant as apparently I spoke so fast he needed to catch up :/ oh dear :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-31 21:29:23	@ReleasingLunacy must admit I am proud for hanging in there for interview Truth is I wanted to run
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-31 21:27:39	@MrsCMonkey frankly I was shitting myself, not sure I came across as anything but "mad" !!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-31 21:26:08	@Soozy1965 that's what I hoped , think may have just come across as "mad" lol ?!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-31 21:24:24	@Dobbie19 who knows? The interview guy wrote in large letters on my form "last 12 months have sucked" lol , maybe sympathy vote??!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-31 20:51:00	Okay so I have just a) conquered a huge fear and b) outed myself as mentally ill on camera and to 100 strangers...um...yay??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-31 15:49:57	@MrsCMonkey oh sorry, Who wants to be a Millionaire! Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-31 15:39:39	I say fuck it, what do I have to lose? Self respect went a long time ago, if I make a fool out of myself, so be it. At least I tried?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-31 15:24:35	Ok so this somewhat manic, medicated, possibly delusional fellow is now dragging himself out to a WWTBAM audition. This will end well right?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 19:35:28	Heard one scream too many. Hope not mine . Rolled up and shutting it out. Have to block it :( ffs why target me now ? :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 18:11:58	@ItsJackOk Thank you Jack I will, you're a good friend thank you
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 18:07:35	@ItsJackOk I can do that, my own stone might help. I'd like that
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 17:55:11	I wish they would stop yelling at me. I don't know the answer to that?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 17:54:00	@ItsJackOk I haven't , maybe tomorrow if they let me. I dont remember Jack :( what goal? Will it help?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 17:44:47	I think I need to get a tattoo I don't know how I've gone so long without ink. Piercings yes, more than a few, but tats #Want
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 17:40:03	@ItsJackOk Thank you , I hope so. Have strongest feeling people are spying on me though I haven't done anything? :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 16:16:51	@Mich_568 thank you xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 16:16:11	@ItsJackOk Thank you Jack. Something has broken in me and I don't know how to fix it :( why does this happen just when I'm feeling ok? :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 16:10:56	@Ditts thank you xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 16:10:37	@Mich_568 I love you too Mich. You're one of the few friends I have. I'm sorry I'm so fucked up right now :( xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 16:09:19	@Comfort_talks thank you
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 15:06:23	Sometimes I don't know where or who I am anymore. It's scary and I don't know how much longer I can deal with it. I hate myself :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 15:03:01	@Ditts and avoid hospital :( so I take it and try to find stability
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 15:01:48	@Ditts Id rather not say if that's ok, but I tend to get myself into trouble. It's not good :( always left ashamed. Meds is to drag me down
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 14:25:05	@Ditts feel like it's taken all my good energy away... I think they just do it to control me?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 14:22:58	@Ditts Not naive, I dont know, was pretty stable, Doc said "rapid cycling" not sure what that means but he quadrupled my antipsychotic :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 14:12:31	@Ditts tbh no im not so good :/ thats what im told anyway. oh well I enjoyed a bit of a good streak...xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 14:07:44	@Ditts Good morning :-) thank you for today's dose of cuteness. I needed it.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 14:05:55	means I am now very...heavily...medicated :( The term "tripping" comes to mind...this is just not right :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 14:04:04	Seen doc today. Manic switch and delusional thinking....fuck that...I'm not delusional...but then would I know if I was? All I know is it
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-30 11:07:54	Somethings broken in my head. Doc and maybe hospital not sure yet :( xxx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 20:38:12	@Mich_568 @carregonnen also think a lot of people are complete dicks too? I'd that as bad ?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 20:37:12	@Mich_568 @carregonnen Can't deny, one of my favourite words/insults too. Not remotely in relation to genitals though?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 18:34:31	That Playstation point you get to when you want to beat yourself with the controller or throw the whole lot out the window? Yep, that point
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 18:26:52	@ItsJackOk "comfortably sad" thats perfect Jack :) xx I could only think of happy/sad but that didn't seem right? #ComfortablySad
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 18:08:14	@ItsJackOk Thanks for posting that Jack :) I love it. Makes me inexplicably sad though xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 18:03:01	@ItsJackOk ahh ok, I'll give it a go :)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 17:28:41	@friedeggmash susejs!!! Lol ;) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 17:27:13	@ItsJackOk Otherwise the workout will only do you good hopefully :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 17:26:00	@ItsJackOk Risk of dehydration as your not retaining fluids if vomiting. At the very list if you do make sure you drink water. Stay hydrated
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 17:24:14	@ItsJackOk Not a good idea to work out or do any kind of strenuous activity if you're physically sick mate
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 16:33:11	@MistyEyezzz Not a bother at all! I'm pretty ignorant about tech stuff though ;) lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 16:18:46	@MistyEyezzz so shouldn't need a computer to set up, I never did
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 16:17:11	@MistyEyezzz I think so. I never synched my iPhone to my laptop because my laptop died. I've had no problems though...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 15:45:10	@ItsJackOk You're welcome Jacky Boy, stay strong mate, you have lots of support on here :) x

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 15:42:02	Morning Jack, go to the gym you'll feel better after, find calming things to occupy yourself. Light some candles, draw, make a doll *hugs*xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 14:53:38	@Mich_568 Good plan and btw, I secretly like CDWM ;) I've recently been watching the Greek version, no idea but entertaining as fuck!! xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 14:51:52	@MistyEyezzz Oh no, what have I done? ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 14:42:34	@Mich_568 Was gonna ask why you're awake so early. Clearly you never went to bed lol. Please don't tell me your still watching CDWM?? xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 14:33:58	@MistyEyezzz Me too!! xxx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 14:15:52	@MistyEyezzz OMG Am I going to jail?? I've seen "Oz", I'd never survive....I'm too pretty ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 14:11:44	@MistyEyezzz Have now eased my conscience by giving credit where credits due ;) Lol!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 14:10:25	@MistyEyezzz Lol. In my defense I did mention I was watching Family Guy in the tweet immediately before that! Can only wish I was as funny!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 14:04:49	The cutest guinea pigs on the front lawn of a house on my walk. Was gonna take a pic but thought might seem "weird" if the owners caught me
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 14:02:19	@MistyEyezzz lol Quack Whore!! That's a Family Guy reference, can't take credit for that one!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 13:09:39	@MistyEyezzz Lol, I'm not sure when I started using that phrase, it just seems to fit ;) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 12:59:34	@MistyEyezzz walk locally. Much more boring and not as nice as the beach though!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-22 12:58:59	@MistyEyezzz lol, I didn't think you meant me but I realised I hadn't spoken to you for a while :) xx Looks like rain today so probably just

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-12 15:16:36	@swanners272 We did discuss it, kinda glad we didn't now though. Would be way more complicated
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-12 15:14:57	@ItsJackOk I dragged myself out for a walk today, would rather have stayed in bed but I felt much better afterwards xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-12 15:14:08	@ItsJackOk this is a bit of a cliche but you will feel better for going even if you can't be arsed now ;) xx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-12 15:07:31	@swanners272 good grief no thank goodness. Not too easy for 2 dads to adopt here without a friendly lesbian surrogate lol ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-12 14:24:13	@swanners272 can't blame him really I guess? Anyway that's it in a nutshell lol ;) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-12 14:23:43	@swanners272 so I never went back. He couldn't deal with my bipolar anymore and the substance abuse that went with it thru self medicating
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-12 14:22:12	@swanners272 but he called me and said he didn't want me to come back. He wasn't happy , we weren't happy blah blah
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-12 14:21:23	@swanners272 didn't trust myself alone. Anyway when got back he was supposed to organize my flight back home...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-12 14:20:41	@swanners272 Nah you can ask me anything ;) long story short, he went o/s for work so I came over here to visit family while he was gone...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-12 14:04:33	@swanners272 No but after 14 years might as well have been ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-12 13:54:55	@swanners272 unfortunately it wasn't me that ended it. He did.... OVER THE PHONE!!!! Nice huh?! Lol xx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-05 18:28:40	@ItsJackOk Skipping meals not good, opposite result to what you're after. Body thinks it's starving so conserves fat instead of burning it x

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-03 14:14:32	No distractions, no triggers, just me. The wind and waves take all the bad stuff away leaving me calm but empty. Good or bad I don't know?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-07-03 14:10:55	Walked on the beach today. Sometimes I think it's the only time I feel remotely peaceful. Just me, the sand and waves and my music xx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-18 21:01:18	Good lord why do people promoting packaging material keep following me? It's bizarre, do I come across as having a bubble wrap fetish?

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-18 16:54:09	Good news is my new psychiatrist is lovely. Calm and reassuring and seemed genuinely concerned about me. I feel a bit safer now.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-18 15:58:17	@Dobbie19 thank you. It went okay. Good news is he was really nice and calming. Bad news he's significantly upped my med dosages :-/

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 23:41:32	Fuck that. It makes me more resilient.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 23:40:32	Ffs, I dont know what else to say? Punching me in the face might help to snap me out of it? Frankly it just hurts me more?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 23:37:44	Maybe while I'm stopping being "mentally ill" I should try and stop being "gay" too?? Huh? Stop indulging myself? Pull myself together?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 23:35:03	Yes ok I am pathetic, I'm not getting my shit together, I'm not up and out early making a living. I'm sorry :( I'll pull myself together.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 23:33:08	Ok, so this week I must get up everyday at 8am to show I'm not a loser wasting my life? Ok? Punching me in the face helps. Thanks :(

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 22:42:57	@jelliott299 I know right?! Someone promoting packaging materials is a weird person to be following?! Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 22:32:32	@ReleasingLunacy once flew Sydney to LA, arrived before I left ???? Ooooh, mind blown ?!!

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 21:25:00	Some can't cope and disappear, I understand, mental illness is hard to deal with. For those that stay and support I'll never forget it.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 21:23:07	So on the edge but thank you to any of you that gives me support. I'm forever grateful. Really. It keeps me going.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 20:54:09	@jelliott299 yes up and down, I know , tbh I think quite a few of my followers are just advertisers of weird products lol ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 20:03:10	@BaobabTherapy :) xx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 19:40:48	@MissJEDoe Made me proud of them :) They were never malicious , just a bit ignorant/thoughtless and I love that they realised that :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 19:36:19	@Drinking_Coffee @lemiwa7 @fangofox77 @kateonthego Thank you Pete :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 19:15:37	@MissJEDoe now THAT made me happy :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 19:15:17	@MissJEDoe they really hadn't thought about it. they never used it again (in fact I heard them setting their friends straight occasionally)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 19:12:35	@MissJEDoe Pisses me off too. I pulled up a few of my younger ex coworkers on it. To their credit they apologized
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 19:09:14	@Polarbear3127 Stay strong mate. We're here for you *hugs* xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 19:07:27	@MissJEDoe I truly don't think it's meant to be homophobic, but really? STOP IT!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 19:06:22	@MissJEDoe there is a disturbing trend here of young people using the word "gay" to mean "lame" as in "that is so gay"
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 17:50:35	@MissJEDoe I know thank you :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 17:49:52	@richbdd01 If I didn't walk away they would want to hold on tight to something for the barrage of rage heading their way ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 17:48:42	@richbdd01 I know right? Grrrr. It just puts me on the defensive and makes me angry and then I get more grief because I walk away
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 17:37:34	@MissJEDoe I know, I'm sure they mean well, but confrontation doesn't help, it just makes me defensive, angry and self destructive :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 17:32:37	@Mich_568 lol, thank you honey xxx #Booby -doos #MagicTits
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 17:30:46	@MissJEDoe I believe dad said "pull your finger out and get your fucking shit together, we're all sick of it" nice one :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 17:29:20	@MissJEDoe Thanks, it was of the "stop shutting yourself away, sleeping too much and being a little bitch" variety :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-17 17:23:02	Morning / Evening all. Just been given a right confrontational bollocking from my family. Yes that helps :-/ Hope everyones ok today xx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-10 22:11:46	@riverluss @iamreadyworld Um, I'd never actually keep a baby monkey. Not meant to be kept as pets. It would be both cruel and dangerous.

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-05 15:40:50	@sullengirl0 I'd do it, might be suspicious of the long distance beeps and Aussie accent though ;)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-04 13:07:40	@MistyEyezzz Ah I see you are familiar with the type of place. It is indeed warm and moist. Raining today so add wet dog smell to the mix.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-04 12:54:01	@MistyEyezzz On the plus side I've seen the Doc and all my blood tests came back normal so....yay?!

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 19:31:55	The fact that I recognize that I have behaved like a childish twat is a good sign right? Right? #ChildishTwat #HungryChildishTwat
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 19:27:47	And I lied. I'm fucking starving. Now have to prove my point *smuggles cheese and crackers back to room down pants*
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 19:26:15	Sooo, dramatic slamming of my door and the declaration "I'm not coming out for dinner I'm not hungry anyway" how old am I again? Oh yeah 
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 16:57:43	@Mich_568 But then what the fuck do I know honey?! :P *hugs* xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 16:52:54	@Mich_568 don't need to be pushy, make it clear it's not about him not being able to hang out but just having the courtesy to let you know
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 16:50:47	@Mich_568 Ok Gotcha. I say text him then. If it's a bit of a habit with him and you feel regularly let down he should know it bothers you.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 16:46:11	@MistyEyezzz Thank you xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 16:45:39	@Mich_568 I tend to get a little needy and it usually back fires on me (as with my most recent experience) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 16:44:16	@Mich_568 sometimes it's best to hold back and act cool :-/ easier said than done
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 16:43:11	@Mich_568 well a text would have been nice. A little rude. I would have already texted him but I'm not a very good role model ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 16:31:37	@Mich_568 Hmmm I see your point. Tricky. Had he indicated he intended to hang out?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 16:17:00	@Mich_568 Seems reasonable to me honey :)xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 16:15:01	Yep, should have stayed secluded . Slammed with accusations of self pity and anti-social behavior. What's wrong with wanting time alone ffs?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-06-03 15:44:42	Slept through another day :-/ Just seems easier at the moment *sighs* well I might try venturing out of the bedroom now, it's a start?!

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-24 00:56:19	But I guess something I have to accept and move on. Funny how even losing a stranger hurts ;-(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-24 00:54:31	Maybe some don't want to hear my thoughts / observations anymore? That makes me really sad :(

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-24 00:22:42	But *sigh* guess not :-(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-24 00:21:57	*sigh* clearly not worthy of pics and witty review thereof ...and more.... I actually have more to say ?!

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-23 19:57:04	I can only hope my motive was to bore people. The throat closing, heart wrenching, physical pain was worth it then ??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-23 19:52:37	So just had "either stop talking shit or go to bed" thrown at me. You're boring us....

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 20:23:44	@ItsJackOk Thank you Jack, that means a lot. Kinda freaked out tbh because very few (if any nowadays) people call me "Marcy Marc"
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 20:11:10	*crickets* guess ive proved my point. Again, sorry....:(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 19:53:10	I don't think I'm a bad person but sometimes I don't know and sometimes I might say things I shouldn't and I'm sorry
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 19:51:47	Have a feeling a lot of people don't like me today. If you don't or I'm too weird then unfollow/block me. At least I won't worry anymore
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 19:37:47	@MadmanNoMore oh that evil weed :( I've done the 3 hour thing daily for a week now, but I will get there dammit. Good luck mate :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 19:02:52	@Mich_568 I'm gonna be obsessed with this now :) and for the record "Lordy lordy look at all the freaks" is one of my favourite lines ever!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:57:34	@davesleney *snickers* #doubleentendres
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:54:43	@Mich_568 "what's that? Oh a Beaver! Sweet! Never thought I'd see one of those at a gay wedding?"
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:52:09	@davesleney That's awesome Dave, It really makes me happy to hear you had a good weekend! you deserve it :) we will get there mate ;) xx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:44:45	@Mich_568 Anastasia Beaverhausen ;)xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:44:05	@Mich_568 Oh too fucking funny so do I!! (there's a big gay surprise) I promise if ever we meet tummy touching is a done deal ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:38:39	@Mich_568 @davesleney Cake! For fucks sake.... what she said....Caaaaake!!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:36:30	@davesleney Hey Dave. Really nice to hear from you :) I'm ok, been a bit fucked up last day or so but ok. How are you my friend? xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:33:45	@Mich_568 but emailed him today (gulp). I promise that is the last time ;) really, i mean it *makes puppy dog eyes* really. Postcard? :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:31:54	@Mich_568 he said it was being disconnected anyway. He gave me his email address. I waited over a week.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:30:37	@Mich_568 ok so I've deleted all previous text history (I kept reading it over and over). That was hard. But not the number
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:24:42	@Mich_568 that's probably the best thing to do sweetheart *hugs* xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:22:58	@davesleney @mich_568 what he said Mich. xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:21:37	@Mich_568 dunno about best uncle but best nephew...no doubt about it :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:20:40	@sparklypixie72 I know right?! He literally is the reason I keep going. The one person I never doubt would be devastated if I was gone :-/ x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:17:06	@Mich_568 when I know I should let it go :-/ xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:16:32	@Mich_568 I'm kinda in nice boys position at the moment. I'm getting the hint but I get a bit needy and can't help texting / emailing...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:14:50	@Mich_568 give him time, he'll get the message and back off I'm sure. xx prob best not to reply though?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 18:13:36	@Mich_568 maybe just a teensy tinsy bit? ;) you've def done the right thing but he's clearly smitten (who wouldn't be *mmm hmmms* lol)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:58:57	Oh and he asked me how long it's been since I felt "hyperactive" , he thinks it's been too long ! #kidsaretooperceptivefortheirowngood
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:56:47	That kid kills me...the other day he told me I shouldn't stay in my room all the time "being sad" apparently it's "not good for me" :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:54:44	...but "dont worry if you can't afford them Uncle Marc because I can"....*sobs*
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:53:04	My 10 year old nephew just called to tell me he had seen DVD's on sale that he wants to watch with me...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:33:32	@Mich_568 that's the plan I think
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:32:38	@Mich_568 *snickers* ;) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:31:29	@Mich_568 thanks, sort of ok now but bit out of it :-/ xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:29:47	@Mich_568 I knew it...tricky devil you ;) *'accidentally' drops pen on floor in front of laptop and bends over suggestively to pick up*.oops
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:24:39	@Mich_568 Note: times are estimates only
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:24:14	@Mich_568 12pm: attempt eating but microwave poisoning food. 3pm: Dr called 4pm: doubled dose quetiapine 6pm:barely functionin but calmer :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:20:40	9am: bedroom invaded as apparently "talking to self" 10am: go for walk but unable to cross roads or train lines so just walk in a circle
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 16:18:46	@Mich_568 :) xx. My day: 5am: rips smoke alarm off bedroom ceiling and dismantles as convinced flashing light is recording device.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 15:59:49	@Mich_568 lol. Oh youuuu ;) thanks for my first laugh and *hug* of the day I needed it. One of each a day is compulsory I believe. xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 15:36:19	Bad day today. Bad bad day. Shaky and paranoid. Fuck it. Feel like I'm being watched :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 00:22:18	@SecretsNo_eVoL no fail :) you have done it ;) feel good about it :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 00:18:02	@SecretsNo_eVoL goodnight, and thank you also :) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 00:15:28	@SecretsNo_eVoL thought I had found someone who understood , seems I just push people away. I really don't know why?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 00:12:10	@SecretsNo_eVoL I take everything to heart too. I read too much into things. It's a nightmare isn't it? I understand.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-21 00:03:33	Thanks for keeping me company tonight :) goodnight wonderful twitter people, see you tomorrow I hope :) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 23:38:24	@Mich_568 @itsjackok lol! Love you guys ;)!!xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 23:36:16	@swanners272 not insulting per se. Just made me feel shit (might not have meant it but still)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 23:33:15	@Mich_568 @itsjackok *also strikes sexy pose*... um *tries again*...*sexy pose* ummm, oh fuck it...:(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 23:28:05	@SecretsNo_eVoL I don't think a friend would say that? But maybe he doesn't know what to say? I'm sure he cares?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 23:24:46	@ItsJackOk hah! Jack that really made me laugh! Trust you to make me see the funny side ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 23:22:23	@SecretsNo_eVoL that's a wonderful thing to say , thank you :)!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 23:15:33	Maybe I should get off twitter for now...some ugly people trying to pull me down :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 22:51:11	Sad, had to block a follower today for offensive comments. Never done that before but not tolerating homophobia anymore :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 22:41:31	@ItsJackOk state that "I'm not, but" or "if I was". There's no reason people cant relate equally . Don't we all deserve not to be labelled?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 22:36:50	@ItsJackOk I think sexuality is a fluid thing. It's not something that can be defined. I just get upset when someone feels they have to
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 22:31:30	That's all I was looking for :-/xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 22:30:53	So for future reference I dont need to hear "I'm there for u but..." like I asked to have my cock sucked instead of some support re my #MH
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 22:23:37	Your sexuality doesn't warrant a reference. I was just looking to offer/receive support. Male/female/gay/straight.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 22:19:37	*sighs* future reference 'I'm not gay but, don't play for your team but' etc. OFFENSIVE! If you are secure in your sexuality not an issue
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 22:01:01	@FANGOFOX77 if you're only there for people on 'your team' then say so. Don't make the rest of us feel shit cos another breeder cares
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 21:53:25	@FANGOFOX77 if you you can help people that 'play for your team' then that's fine.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 21:47:59	@FANGOFOX77 I just wanted to connect and make friends with people and find support.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 21:46:34	@FANGOFOX77 wasn't looking for someone to 'switch teams' or think I was after anything more
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 21:34:28	@Mich_568 you know it girrlll *frankly quite weird head sway* *snap snap* mmm.hmmm...( dont mess with me Mo-heesha)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 21:23:31	@Mich_568 Exact...fucking...ly ;)!! Uhhh huhhhh :P !
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 21:15:39	It makes me really sad when straight guys think gay guys want nothing from them but sex. Maybe I just want a mate /friend?? #likesomefriends
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 21:08:19	@Mich_568 oh that's me. That's soooo me ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 21:07:15	@Mich_568 nasty little wolverines. Lol ;) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 21:05:09	@FANGOFOX77 lol :)) !! Sorry?!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 21:01:47	@Mich_568 oh shit Mich, LMFAO!!!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 21:00:43	@Mich_568 spagatta nadle!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 20:59:39	@Mich_568 Aaaaahhhh :) Wooooolves :)!!!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 20:53:49	@FANGOFOX77 ha, that's making me feel better anyway :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 20:52:19	Maybe should just accept will be alone, thanks anyway :( xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 20:27:23	Going to sit in the backyard, smoke and just soak in star energy. It's cold but I need the warmth.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 20:11:22	@Mich_568 #oldladyrecommendation
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 20:09:59	@Mich_568 *snickers* :) my mum thinks it's very amusing that anyone under her age would be interested. I beg to differ :D
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 20:06:17	@CharFleri haha! Weird how these small towns have so much drama! ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 20:04:38	@Mich_568 it sounds like my kinda show lol :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 20:04:07	@Mich_568 I'm looking forward to watching. Mums been watching for a while but I've ignored her old lady recommendations. Lol ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 19:58:18	Just wanna curl up , cuddle and watch a movie while he strokes my head, and makes me feel safe and loved. Ffs is that too much to ask?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 19:54:23	Shoulda just watched a scary horror movie to take my mind off things :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 19:53:13	Typical of me to choose cheesy melodrama that makes me feel sad and unloved :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 19:31:38	Watched 'whitechapel' last night. Scared the shit out of me but loved it regardless. Lol :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 19:29:30	Am loving my Sunday night viewing thanks to y'all up there :) midsommer murders (whatever that is) also on, recording lol ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 19:14:53	Watching 1st episode of Season 2 Downton Abbey. Loving it ;) #guiltysundaynightpleasure
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 19:10:20	@davesleney morning Dave, hows it going? :)x

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 18:21:13	@ItsJackOk Am sure Malacus will give you time to breathe and create. Have a good day Jack. look forward to seeing results of your clay work
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 18:14:39	@ItsJackOk Thanks Jack. Just. Thanks :( xx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 15:15:17	@Mjab1616 Aww Secret Squirrel, I'd forgotten about him :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 11:41:15	@sparklypixie72 so I've been a bit quiet. Shaky (physically and mentally) today. Going for walk to see if that helps. How are you? xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-20 11:39:11	@sparklypixie72 I'm okay thanks. Sorry for late reply was really low last night. when I went to tweet I couldn't think of a thing to say :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-19 20:45:26	Got out of bed. Retrieved another KitKat. Returned to bed. In bed with KitKat.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-19 20:39:48	Got out of bed. Ate KitKat. Got back into bed.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-19 20:00:44	Major mood crash tonight. What a bitch :-/ lying in bed staring at the ceiling. Hello Saturday night.

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-17 12:46:38	I'm okay, no-one saw, but I'm afraid I may have startled a starfish or two. #StartledStarfish
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-17 12:44:49	As I am indeed not a mountain goat and seriously lack any real agility I of course slipped and fell into a tidal pool...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-17 12:43:24	So slightly more adventuresome walk today. Very high tide, had to do some serious mountain goat like rock climbing to avoid being swept out
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-17 09:49:59	@davesleney @per_spek_tiv I've always said he's a complete c.. um asshole ;)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-17 09:44:09	@per_spek_tiv @davesleney I don't know about Dave but I was asleep like a good boy at 1130 and got up an hour ago (it's 11am here) #lazy
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-17 09:42:28	@davesleney @per_spek_tiv I was going to ask about that?!! #TomHanks
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-17 09:41:38	@davesleney oh and weirdly clouds have gone and sun is out. Another beach walk me-thinks :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-17 09:40:29	@davesleney I'm doing ok so far hoping 2 in a row isn't too much to ask for?! ;) How are you going? Just finished work?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-17 09:34:16	Well good Morning. Another good sleep Yay. looks like a bit of a miserable day out though. #justgotupboredalready
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-17 08:47:51	@Carregonnen Haha! It does appear that way doesn't it?!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-17 08:46:39	@Mich_568 ha! You do have a point there ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 21:46:40	Wow, 11pm, I'm actually tired. Going to try to sleep and get up early (ish) tomorrow. I've had a pretty good day today. Thank you all.xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 21:07:31	And that tweet brought another weird employment offer #stopusingthewordsineedajobinfuturetweets
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 20:49:53	@MadmanNoMore ha! Is Eastenders still going? Really? Good grief
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 20:48:36	So I mention I need a job in a tweet and some company tweets me to say they saw it and have a position for me *shudders* spooky
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 20:43:45	@Polarbear3127 that's fantastic James :) I've been thinking about mental health work myself (when I'm well enough of course)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 20:42:04	@MadmanNoMore oh dear!! Sorry! yes, not sure could watch it again without turning into a blubbing "all byyy myyyself" saddo though lol ;)!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 20:27:42	@MadmanNoMore Get Out!! Lol! It was the first movie I watched with my ex the day after we met. It holds a very special place in my heart :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 20:23:08	@BaileysFarm oh dear, that is both troublesome and hilarious ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 20:20:12	@MadmanNoMore have you seen the film "beautiful thing"?? It's wonderful and almost entirely "mama cass" soundtrack :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 20:15:34	@MadmanNoMore I think that might have been my favourite ever :) weird that I had Mamas and the Papas cranked up on my iPod walking today :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 20:05:48	@Mich_568 well that's just not right. I like you and I need a job, I'll come work beside you ;) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 19:55:18	@Polarbear3127 what would you like to do?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 19:54:40	@Polarbear3127 and you will get well and a whole new world of opportunity will open up for you :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 19:52:25	@Polarbear3127 you didn't have a choice. You needed time out to recover and get well.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 19:50:49	@Polarbear3127 I'm forced to actively look for work even though right now if something came up I doubt if I'd cope with it...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 19:49:28	@Polarbear3127 I'm the same mate. I want to do something worthwhile but I don't know where to start?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 19:31:20	@davesleney Good for you mate! We are all there with you ;) x #BlackDogTriber
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 18:38:23	@davesleney yea it was a beautiful day. Hoping to get out and do it again tomorrow. Glad you're doing ok today :) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 18:30:20	@davesleney Seems reasonable to me Dave ;) how are you today mate?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 16:36:58	@sparklypixie72 oh I'm sorry, I'll be thinking of you. It must be a hard time for you. *hugs* take care of yourself sweetie. xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 16:29:50	@MadmanNoMore btw jiggery-pokery is a marvelous word
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 15:47:34	@iamtheeggman4 thank you! It was a beautiful day. I didn't realise how easy it is to tweet pics, not good with technology ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 15:45:58	@sparklypixie72 pretty good day for me thanks. Hope your ok. Glad your getting some sun ;) xx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 15:19:44	@MadmanNoMore done deal. I'll even throw in a couple of tasmanian devils
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 15:17:33	@ItsJackOk I'm doing ok today. One of those rare days for me. Check out my beach walk photos, I finally learnt how to show pics ;)!! Yay me!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 15:13:46	@ItsJackOk hope you have a good day Jack. Thinking of you mate. xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 15:12:41	@MadmanNoMore will do my best. Not sure vultures are native to Australia though? would a couple of angry looking emus do?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 14:38:09	@MadmanNoMore ....the general doom, gloom and isolation that is the land down under then? Duly noted
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 14:32:57	@MadmanNoMore righto...I'll see if I can squeeze in a human corpse and some road kill just to be safe
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 13:51:09	@MadmanNoMore okay I'll take that on board, from now on grey skies, gloom and dead fish only...gotcha ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 13:39:41	@MadmanNoMore Ha ha! Glad you like. I feel better after that walk than I have in a long time. Helped to quiet my head and calm me down :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 13:36:34	@MadmanNoMore *snickers* GOLD!! ;)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 11:02:44	@Polarbear3127 thanks James. I'll look into it. And once again thanks for your support my friend.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 10:10:32	@Mich_568 hope your first day back goes well. I'll be thinking of you. Maybe take a little pal with you for backup ;) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 09:40:07	@MadmanNoMore Oh you! My first lol of the day ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 09:25:08	@MadmanNoMore Once again a wonderful read :) and oh how I can relate :-/ xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 09:09:38	have decided today shall be a good day. Drinking tea in thesun. Go for beachwalk. Hopefully see somedolphins #onedayatatime #BlackDogTriber
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 08:50:36	@davesleney @mich_568 thank you both so much for your support. It means more than I can say. xxx #BlackDogTriber
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-16 08:49:21	@davesleney @mich_568 Slept for 10 hours straight. Best in months. Woke up feeling....OK...weird :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-15 20:36:07	@Mich_568 @davesleney You both rock in my opinion. That is all. xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-15 19:21:37	@Carregonnen thank you
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 23:21:55	Think I'm gonna try sleep (there's a novel idea). And thank you all twitter friends. xxx. Tomorrow is another (hopefully positive) day :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 23:16:22	End of day 1, sober but feel recently started meds are numbing me somewhat. Maybe that's good?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 23:08:55	@Polarbear3127 not nonsense. I understood every word ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:56:27	@Drinking_Coffee @mich_568 Yea you're right it does. It's a nightmare because it's so damn destructive :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:53:10	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok that's quite a personal decision though. I didnt mean that to seem rude or critical at all :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:51:19	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok I agree. You are putting up an amazing fight. I don't understand why meds as treatment hasn't been considered??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:47:35	@Polarbear3127 same. It seems to be getting worse for me and it really affects my thoughts and behavior .
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:44:21	@Mich_568 Exactly ;) *huuugggsss*
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:41:14	@sparklypixie72 haha. I will def post a pic once it's deemed worthy of such ;)!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:39:37	@Mich_568 I would imagine you are similar. I can't see it. And yes you're right. It will pass :)xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:38:28	@Mich_568 I hate that irrational feeling. Anger, hate etc. It's so removed from the 'real me'. Im so not like that.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:34:15	@Polarbear3127 I wonder the same thing. Since I've been started on anti-psychs I feel like I'm suddenly dictated by them. It's weird.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:31:29	@Polarbear3127 really glad you had a good time James :) I'm happy to hear it :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:29:50	@sparklypixie72 but you've just given me inspiration about what to do tomorrow ;) back to it ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:28:40	@sparklypixie72 oh actually I have let it slide. My concentration not so good at the moment.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:27:04	@Mich_568 I'm really struggling with some serious paranoia at the moment and I'm reading too much into everything I think.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:25:17	@Mich_568 think you might be right Mich. I am feeling a bit fragile today. Thanks for everything as usual :(xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:16:37	@sparklypixie72 better now ;) thank you sweetheart :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:15:11	@Mich_568 maybe I should take a break from twitter
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:14:46	@Mich_568 you're right, you're right, I know you're right. Think I might be a bit 'needy' and 'desperate'? Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:10:23	@Mich_568 lol ;)xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:09:00	Feel like I've lost some wonderful twitter friends recently? I hope I've done nothing to offend? #tryingtobethegoodpersonIknowIam
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:03:30	@Mich_568 my kinda workout ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 22:01:48	@ItsJackOk I feel the same.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:50:01	@Mich_568 @drinking_coffee Just spat some tea on myself. I really cannot argue that statement ;))
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:47:43	@davesleney ha! Lol! I'm a bit disappointed by that revelation to be honest ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:45:59	@ItsJackOk don't let them stop you from getting through this though. You have a lot of friends on here.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:43:28	@ItsJackOk Jack, you have a right to be angry. That kind of treatment is despicable. I've had experience with crisis teams.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:40:53	@Mich_568 @drinking_coffee surely law and order is 'there'... 'not there' , 'there'... 'not there'? With lifting and lowering of laptop??!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:35:23	@davesleney lol! Aww I would have hoped at least chocolate flavored would be worth the effort Dave?!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:32:31	@davesleney Cinnamon? *gags and shudders*
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:31:09	@Mich_568 @drinking_coffee See? Forget shake weight. You should promote lifting of typing apparatus... #dirtybird
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:28:22	@ItsJackOk and youre not losing it, I think I would have the same response.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:27:16	@ItsJackOk I think both those responses are valid. Any idea when you will hear from this 'bitch' once flu has subsided??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:24:37	@davesleney step away from the beans Dave...step away from the beans....
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:20:53	@ItsJackOk oh Jack. Thats both awful and 'bitch flu' hilarious...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:18:31	@Drinking_Coffee and I pityyy, any boy who isn't me toniiiite, la la la la la la la laaaaa.....(took some liberty with lyrics there) ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:13:41	@Drinking_Coffee thanks. I hope so. I'm really not a bad guy. I just struggle sometimes.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 21:00:22	Feel strangely like I've been threatened in some way. Not sure how. It's made me feel horrible anyway. Thought I was having an ok day.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 20:56:06	In bed with a cup of green tea and contemplating pretty much everything. Wish I knew how I felt :( #brainsoup
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 20:45:42	@Drinking_Coffee good point. I agree.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 20:38:38	@Drinking_Coffee you are right. It's not easy. think I'm doing a little better. Very aware of tweeting negatively. Trying to avoid it :)xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 20:25:56	@Drinking_Coffee meh...just..meh...but how are you mate? Sounds like you've been having a bit of a shit time right now? Hope youre ok? xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 19:29:26	@nurse_w_glasses @itsjackok exactly ;) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 19:28:34	@Polarbear3127 enjoy it mate, take some time for yourself and your wife :) look after yourself.xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 19:24:31	@MadmanNoMore @iamreadyworld don't worry. He will teach you what to say. And if I'm not mistaken he will also teach you what to do...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 19:06:55	@MadmanNoMore @iamreadyworld oo ee oo ah ah...;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 19:05:19	@IAmReadyWorld strange thing is I remembered that song a few days ago. My 10 year old nephew is now singing it over and over and over..!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 19:01:26	@ItsJackOk if you are worried then yes you need that appt. As I said likely nothing but will make you feel better and that's what matters
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:59:27	@ItsJackOk make it anyway and go, get yourself peace of mind, deal with your dad after (easier said than done I know)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:56:46	@ItsJackOk I'm not a Dr and would not want to give you advice on a physical complaint if it bothers you, if that makes sense?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:54:51	@ItsJackOk prob a combination of the attempt and stress. I'm sure it's nothing but as I said get it checked out if you're worried. Xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:51:36	@IAmReadyWorld thanks to you I have had that song stuck in my head all day :P !!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:50:30	@ItsJackOk but if your headache is really bothering you, see a doc. Get it checked out so you don't worry about it.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:49:10	@ItsJackOk you had a rough day yesterday mate. I would have a headache too I think.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:48:05	@ItsJackOk how did you go with the exam Jack? Do you feel good about it?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:47:01	@Mich_568 agree with theory completely. Practice I need to work on :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:19:01	It's left me feeling slightly uneasy :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:18:23	Just been reading through in depth assessment of my 'personality' Why do I feel I've just been read my horoscope?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:01:28	@davesleney I couldn't agree more mate :) #BlackDogTriber
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 18:00:23	Thinking of you mate. I hope it goes well. xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 17:59:49	@Polarbear3127 I'm sure you do. You might choose to go if you feel it's the best thing for you, otherwise im sure you can decline?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 17:57:01	@Mich_568 I love that smell! Even if it does sometimes make me itchy. Lol xx #booksniffing
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 17:33:48	@davesleney that it can my friend, that it can :( Thank goodness for Twitter friends is all I can say. #BlackDogTriber
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 17:28:33	@Mich_568 I do that ;) xx #booksniffing
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 17:25:16	@davesleney thanks Dave. You too mate. One day at a time eh? ;) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 16:38:36	Just realised I've applied for 52 jobs in the last 10 weeks. Nothing but rejections *sighs* #BlackDogTriber
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 15:59:53	@Mich_568 lol ;) You is funny.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 14:28:00	@ItsJackOk I'd watch it. Lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 14:27:24	@ItsJackOk damn those hidden milk-skins....it's just not right
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 14:21:22	@ItsJackOk dolphin herding dogs sounds fascinating though :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 14:20:07	@ItsJackOk ohhh dear *gags delicately* you have a way with words Jack ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 14:07:38	@ItsJackOk anytime . Good luck with your exam mate :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 13:54:07	@ItsJackOk I'm here if you need me. Take good care of yourself. *hugs* xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 13:53:13	@ItsJackOk catching up on tweets while I was asleep. Seems you had a really rough day yesterday Jack. hope you feel a little better today
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 13:07:34	My concentration span is shot to pieces at the moment. I've taken vague to a whooooole new level.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 13:05:10	Well that felt a bit of a waste of time. She talked, I sat and nodded and tried to look as though I understood what she was saying
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 11:45:22	Minsy should have course read Monday ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 11:44:35	Hey Dave, hope you have a good Minsy mate. Seems a few of us had not such great Sundays. x #BlackDogTriber
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 11:40:33	Now sitting in Drs waiting room. Any serenity I may have felt is now fading...fading :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 11:39:19	Had a walk through the botanic gardens. Was followed by some evil looking birds but other than that it was nice.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 10:17:41	@Mich_568 *Hugs* I can relate to pretty much everything you wrote there. Unfortunately :-/ xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-14 09:54:22	Monday morning. blergh. Another psych review today. Will be reviewing my 'results' *sighs heavily*
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 23:23:29	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 Lol ;) a penguin would rock my world :)))
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 23:16:15	@Polarbear3127 no it doesn't and it wouldn't.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 23:08:11	@Mich_568 I generally endorse that, but today.....too much cheesey goodness. #cheese
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 23:06:48	@Mich_568 the host feels that any 'meat replacement' for a vegetarian should involve cheese.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 23:05:17	@Mich_568 oh god, I have had sooo much cheese today I feel sick. Had one of those lunches today when
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 23:01:49	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 Awww yep *hugs* :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 22:58:04	@Polarbear3127 we are all good people. Our minds/voices just tell us otherwise sometimes. It's false and we can rise above that :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 22:54:27	@Polarbear3127 you are a good person mate. Don't let the negativity drag you down. I'm here for you as are so many others on here.xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 22:48:48	Oh shit, forgot to block 'tweet butlers' after making fun of them.... D'oh...whoever they are...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 22:45:28	@Mich_568 #cheese
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 22:43:10	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok it's awesome:) I never cease to be moved by how amazing all you twitter people are :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 22:39:21	@Mich_568 I think I might have literally broken something laughing then because frankly if I was going to #something it would be #cheese :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 22:33:14	@tweetbutlers always been fascinated by origin of the word 'raspberry'??? #tweetbutlersfuckoffwhoeveryouare
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 22:31:30	@tweetbutlers Tweet butlers?? Ummm NO *makesraspberrytyperudenoise*

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 22:15:07	@Mich_568 it does not make you fit. It makes you look a complete tosser. Seriously. Really. It does. I'm not just saying that. I care. xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 22:12:33	@Mich_568 Hands up, stand back from the shake weight. NOW. You do not need a weird vaguely phallic shaky thing to get fit. No one does.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 22:05:41	@Mich_568 shake weight? Oh no Mich...oh no??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 21:57:35	@ItsJackOk @it doesn't matter. That you created that little fella, and dedicated him to a friend is just amazing :)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 16:38:42	A long boozy mothers day lunch / dinner. Has kept me preoccupied at least. Even if my mental state has shifted to a slightly different plane
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 13:48:26	Well maybe a bit ;) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 13:48:11	I sadly have a string of criminal records. I'm not proud of it.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 13:47:33	@MadmanNoMore nothing like bananarama at 4.30 in the morning ;) Btw I was shocked to see your criminal record. I had no idea ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 10:51:52	@sparklypixie72 I'm so sorry for your loss sweetheart. My thoughts are with you and your family. Sending a massive *HUG* Take care xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 10:48:29	Happy Mothers Day to any Mums out there. I bought mine a fish. Odd.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 10:45:54	@davesleney Hey Dave, everything okay mate?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-13 10:17:03	*yawns* Morning world. Brrr cold and grey today. Love it.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 20:21:52	@Mich_568 Yum :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 20:20:28	Time to stop tweeting I think. I hate it when I get all depressy tweety. Harshin' peoples buzz and all :( sorry folks xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 20:18:24	Oh shit the tears have set in. don't want to be this person anymore. I've realised how much I really hate myself. Why would anyone love me?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 18:58:48	@Polarbear3127 Glad you're feeling a bit better James
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:50:15	@davesleney @itsjackok Yep, sometimes I think when I'm walking on the beach with my iPod is the only time I feel 'quiet'
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:48:34	@ItsJackOk dolphins quite often (saw a few the other day) Oh and my favourite was a seal playing just off the beach one morning :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:46:45	@ItsJackOk which reminds me, where did I put my knitting??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:46:19	@ItsJackOk Oh and your amazing drawings, dolls and often hilarious tweeted observations always make me smile ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:43:06	@davesleney Thanks Dave :) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:42:19	@ItsJackOk Walking helps me. Time out for myself. I went for a walk on the beach this afternoon. No wildlife to report this time sadly!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:38:29	@ItsJackOk Jack, you help by just being there mate :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:36:30	@ItsJackOk Thanks Jack. How are you holding up today?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:34:51	@Polarbear3127 How are you today mate? Everything ok?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:29:58	Will be keeping Twitter close by tonight me-thinks :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:29:13	Feeling very strange today. Something is definitely not right. I'd cry if I could but seems beyond me somehow? I don't like this at all.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:19:57	@Mich_568 mmm-hmm ;) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:16:37	@Carregonnen really? Is it helpful? It sounds scary. xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 17:07:58	@MadmanNoMore Just read it and :D
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 16:51:19	Why am I now being followed by Sullys Comedy Cellar? In Baltimore?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 16:36:57	@davesleney @mich_568 lol *hugs* xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 16:36:09	@Mich_568 @davesleney Meh indeed. But most likely true dammit. I want someone to help me get better. I know that's "unhealthy" probably.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 16:14:52	@Mich_568 @davesleney Amen sister ;) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 16:12:53	@davesleney @mich_568 Can't speak for the girls, know I'm just looking for a good bloke! That's probably of little comfort to you though ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 15:59:00	@davesleney Thanks Dave. You too mate :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 15:48:45	@davesleney yep, only three months out for me. Oh and after 14 years dumped OVER THE PHONE. Ain't that a kick I'm the head lol?!

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 15:40:56	@Mich_568 @davesleney Thanks Mich :) xxx congrats on your comp win btw. Go you :)!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 15:38:56	@davesleney I'm probably a fraction too desperate and needy atm ;) dating may not be a good choice for me right now?!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 15:36:50	@davesleney yeah, I've just come out of a 14 year relationship, I should be trying to heal myself really.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 15:34:19	@MadmanNoMore That is hilarious ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 13:50:56	But sheer loneliness is slowly fucking killing me :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 13:50:21	I think it might be best to not even consider a relationship until I get my self stable. I'm just setting myself up for more pain.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 13:23:44	Someone I really care about is being admitted to hospital for ECT as treatment for Bipolar. Has anyone had any experience of this?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 13:15:25	@Mich_568 :D
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 13:08:50	So it would seem that dating another Bipolar guy has not worked out for me :-/ #destinedtobealoneforever oh crap :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 01:06:09	I think I've just had my fucking heart broken :(

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 00:08:47	@ItsJackOk Jack, I'm having the worst day right now but whats helping me is trying to help others
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-12 00:02:56	Oh fuck it I think I've literally just had someone screw me over. Damn

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 23:35:55	@MadmanNoMore controversial but Jesus can kiss my ass!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 23:34:43	@MadmanNoMore I don't deal well with 'you're great I support you and I'm sure Jesus loves you' bullshit.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 23:23:41	@MadmanNoMore kinda makes me sad :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 23:23:11	@MadmanNoMore I guess so mate *inhales deeply* but when they fool u & u think they r genuine *exhales deeply*
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 23:07:37	Fuck.... If I get one more 'pray the gay away' tweet...keep your damn religion to yourself..
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 22:58:18	@swissfairy I will always block you and your fucking homophobic, racist, misogynistic ways.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 22:56:03	@swissfairy pray? I'm sorry, people like you only pray for people like me to 'get better' religion is fucking evil..
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 22:50:10	@Polarbear3127 yea people keep telling me too ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 22:48:45	@pinguinokx @swissfairy sorry, church groups scare the shit out of me, sorry

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 21:43:05	When one cannot describe what one is delicate beyond
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 21:34:58	@davesleney :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 20:44:51	@Polarbear3127 I wanted to do it for a long time but never pursued it
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 20:43:57	@Polarbear3127 maybe I do? It would certainly explain a lot. Makes me regret not taking up teaching kids as a career
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 20:07:06	@rickygervais @tilojung
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 18:59:18	@Polarbear3127 that's amazing. I did that, also books on animal science. Freaked a preschool teacher out with my correct use of 'arachnid':)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 18:48:51	@KateOnTheGo yea, I've read that the author has questioned peoples interpretation. Either way it's a brilliant read :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 18:46:39	@Polarbear3127 and I bet he's one amazing kid :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 18:30:11	Put my thoughts and behavior as a kid into words...it would be this book :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 18:28:42	It's been debated as to whether it depicts the mind of someone with Aspergers or autism. All I know is it resonates deeply with me.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 18:25:56	Just re-reading 'the curious incident of the dog in the night-time'. Cannot recommend it highly enough.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 17:58:54	@ItsJackOk *hugs* Jack..just...*hugs* ....with my track record I can't say much else. But I care, people care. I'm learning that. Be safe xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 15:47:07	@MadmanNoMore your blogs always make me cry and smile in equal measure (in a good way). Yet another inspiring twitter friend. Thank you xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 13:28:07	I love you all for your support xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 13:27:45	...if not sound. I will respond to you all individually when I can. I'm so ashamed and humiliated atm and struggling...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-10 13:24:52	To all my amazing Twitter friends. Words can't describe how grateful I am for your support. I'm so sorry for any worry I've caused. I'm safe
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 11:18:55	@KateOnTheGo I will DM you about the PTSD thing though. Not sure I'm ready to divulge that to all and sundry yet :-/ in time yes...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 11:16:18	@KateOnTheGo well now that did make me smile :) thanks for listening to me moan btw. I appreciate it. x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 11:09:10	@MadmanNoMore @itsjackok *groans* but lol all the same ;) sleep well guys :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 11:05:22	@KateOnTheGo and something that I've never talked about but I kinda blurted out without thinking
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 11:04:07	@KateOnTheGo The PTSD apparently relates to severe bullying at school etc etc (im pretty sure ive dealt with that??)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 10:58:46	@KateOnTheGo agreed. The multiple choice, tick the boxes, colour in the circles stuff drives me insane (no pun intended ;))
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 10:53:38	@KateOnTheGo I agree absolutely. I can see that completely on a good day. It's awful being "labelled" and I shouldn't let it define me.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 10:49:38	@KateOnTheGo but I can't get my head around these latest additions, I don't know what to make of it and it just makes me feel 'crazier'?!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 10:48:05	@KateOnTheGo for so long and focus on treatment (agreeing to anti-psychotics was tough though)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 10:46:59	@KateOnTheGo uh huh. Being Bipolar I have accepted. If anything it was a relief to make some sense out of my behavior and how I felt
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 10:42:16	@KateOnTheGo I just feel like saying next time let's have a happy session talking about what I can be grateful I don't have???!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 10:37:19	@KateOnTheGo I still don't fully comprehend these latest additions. Has just left me confused and upset :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 10:36:27	@KateOnTheGo Primary diagnosis Bipolar / psychotic depression. Have now added borderline personality disorder and PTSD
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 09:50:48	@KateOnTheGo Its still morning I'm afraid ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 09:49:29	I think he is now just making up new diagnosis's for the fun of it...pick one and stick with it for fucks sake...anger rising...rising...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 09:44:34	Been dictated my latest report from my psychiatrist, not ideally what I like to hear at 1030 on a Monday morning. Emotionally fragile now :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 07:49:07	@Carregonnen sleep well :)xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-07 07:21:19	Morning All. Another Monday. Yet another doc appointment. :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 17:09:35	Well hello excruciating loneliness my old friend. I knew you couldn't have gone far *sighs deeply* . Dammit.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 13:01:49	@Miss_Gibson91 Absolutely not. You come across as a smart, articulate, funny young woman. Banish those thoughts IMMEDIATELY :)x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 12:55:43	@ItsJackOk @madmannomore Cracking the Chavinci Code....that is fucking genius Jack :) lmao!!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 12:37:18	2pm. Just got up. Lazy lazy man :-/. Afternoon twitter world. cup of tea and back to the knitting for me. Another wild Sunday down under.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 01:08:39	@ItsJackOk lol :) nothing worse than a horde of psychotic smurfs with a taste for blood ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 01:03:55	Always amazed by how funny, kind caring and loving people
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 00:56:37	@ItsJackOk I don't think I've given them enough to be happy about?? They seem to be cranky Smurfs. Lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 00:36:53	@MyNocturnalSoul I know the feeling. 2am here, possibly worst time of night for me. I'm here if you need to talk though :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 00:32:40	@ItsJackOk Oh ok. don't laugh at me but I'm currently playing a Smurf game that seems similar?! I have a very messy smurf village though
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 00:23:35	@ItsJackOk oh I hate admitting my dim wittedness ;) but I don't understand Sims, or farming??! Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 00:16:23	@ItsJackOk especially those that care :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 00:15:50	@ItsJackOk I know. Sometimes time alone with no distractions is the best for me. But I think interaction with others really helps
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 00:09:48	@ItsJackOk that's such a good idea mate ;) relax, be calm and take care of yourself. You deserve it. We all do
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-06 00:03:40	@ItsJackOk I've felt that way. Reality is its very cold and lonely mate :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 23:09:13	@davesleney oh! I'm so dumb :-)!!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 23:08:16	That sounds awful I know :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 23:04:39	Oh damn. Think I'm gonna be physically sick. :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 22:56:08	@davesleney is this a sporty type thing I don't know about??!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 21:58:49	@ItsJackOk @madmannomore @insidementalhea who feel the same. They are there, we just need to find them...and we will :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 21:57:23	@ItsJackOk @madmannomore @insidementalhea I think we all feel like that. I try to believe there are people out there in the 'real world'...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 21:52:42	@sparklypixie72 heh :) that made me laugh :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 21:37:41	@sparklypixie72 cakes, cakes CAKES!! Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 21:36:53	@ItsJackOk @madmannomore @insidementalhea embrace 'different' mate :) can mean anything and frankly think is something to be proud of :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 21:34:11	@ItsJackOk @madmannomore @insidementalhea oh....catcher in the rye. so long since I've read it. Great book. Good choice :)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 21:17:51	@sparklypixie72 @madmannomore inch by exhausting inch ;))
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 21:16:29	@ItsJackOk aww jack, everyone thinks about that at some point. Of course it will happen, when your ready & find the right person (you will)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 21:06:12	@MadmanNoMore @sparklypixie72 is 2 inches of scarf a good start??!! ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 21:04:42	@sparklypixie72 It's definitely therapeutic. can't believe how much it switches me off and calms me. Pic of tragic result to look fwd to ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 20:56:11	@sparklypixie72 I have no idea! Lol. Only mastered the basics so assume if I just keep going I'll end up with a verrrrrry long scarf??!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 20:42:06	Oh fuck it , dropped a stitch, or did I gain one? Damn I either have one more or one less than when I started??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 20:39:32	@CharFleri @davesleney @itsjackok ;))
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 19:48:24	@Carregonnen Yes! xx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 19:46:00	@ItsJackOk same :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 19:45:33	@davesleney @itsjackok ummm ok, cross stitching also sounds awesome ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 19:44:10	@davesleney rock and roll sewing! I love it, that sounds like something I could totally get into ;)!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 19:42:38	@ItsJackOk I agree. I don't tend to be very hands on creative unfortunately, so I find repetitive things with instructions helpful :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 18:53:47	@ItsJackOk yep! Really wanted to try making some voodoo dolls but my concentration is fucked. Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 18:49:41	@MadmanNoMore ahhh now that's something I can work on ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 18:48:36	@ItsJackOk I don't know!! knitting for knittings sake. I find it repetitive and calming. Guess I'll end up with one bloody long scarf ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 18:37:28	8 pm. Saturday night. I'm knitting. What is wrong with me. Saturday night and I'm bloody KNITTING!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 17:40:35	@ItsJackOk your description of new demon as 'annoying'...sounds pretty damn scary. You're a brave guy mate :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 17:30:12	@ItsJackOk oh that's an awful way to wake up :-( You ok?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 17:28:04	@Mich_568 I also now feel so entitled ;) x hmm decisions...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 16:58:30	@Mich_568 finished, phew *wipes sweat from brow* three questionnaires in three days. Hand in on Monday when I see doc and wait for results..
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 16:31:43	@Mich_568 thanks babe :) xx. On question 257 now....it just goes on and on and on and on (and on...)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 16:19:15	@swanners272 you're right. Thank you voice of reason ;) xx halfway through now.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 15:56:31	@swanners272 feel like I'm being asked to sign, date and initial an official 'you're fucked up' form :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 15:53:35	@swanners272 I know. Thanks xx. Some of the questions are really tricky and I'm paranoid about how my answers will be interpreted...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 15:33:26	but so much I don't want to reveal.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 15:32:58	Sitting filling out questionnaires for my psych. finding them so confronting it's making me cry :( keep telling myself to be honest..
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 12:47:43	Afternoon world. Apologies if I disappeared mid conversation with anyone yesterday. awake to unconscious an easy transition atm :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 00:41:38	@ItsJackOk the word 'psychotic' is kinda knew for me since I got Dx. It both explains my behavior and scares the shit out of me too :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 00:38:06	@ItsJackOk actually trying that now. Headphones in and trying to block noise. Harder than I though
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 00:33:09	@ItsJackOk tired, slightly psychotic ,(as my doc puts it) but just looking to calm down and sleep
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 00:23:52	@ItsJackOk thx mate :))
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 00:23:14	@pinguinokx just meaning, i think it can make people feel left out, I'd hate that
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 00:18:44	@nurse_w_glasses @itsjackok @polarbear3127 @davesleney @friedeggmash @edanaming @mich_568 @5242230 @theotherdrpatel @alexandracurry thanks.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-05 00:15:58	@Mich_568 that's so wonderful. Wish I had a boss like that , you're very lucky

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 21:27:58	@sparklypixie72 it's weird. Everyone I meet here from there comes for the sun (but complains about the heat)! I just want to escape it! Lol

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 20:54:59	@sparklypixie72 I'm ok, a bit scared atm. been a bit paranoid and irrational trying to avoid upsetting anyone. But I'm still here :)?!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 20:50:36	@Polarbear3127 I'm okay, adjusting to slightly skewed reality atm but so grateful for support Apologize if sometimes don't make sense :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 20:44:32	@Mich_568 oh and hyperbole and a half is my new happy place :)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 18:20:58	@Mich_568 think I just wet my pants a little. Thank you for the best laugh I've had in days :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 18:15:45	@Polarbear3127 I'm so sorry I haven't replied. I can't begin to say how happy I am for you. I am :)) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 18:13:43	@Mich_568 send a giraffe picture to me. I'd like one ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 17:29:11	@MistyEyezzz I'm not sure. I'm just getting some kind of lucidity back. Always makes me feel a bit "oh what have I done" ?? :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 16:16:55	@MistyEyezzz umm, yea, exactly, how did you know that??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 15:42:15	@ItsJackOk it really means a lot to know people are thinking of me. xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 15:40:57	@ItsJackOk Thank you Jack. Have been in a bit of a fucked up paranoid place and avoided tweeting in case I don't make sense or scare people
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 15:27:01	@MistyEyezzz feeling incredibly scared and lonely. Thank you for thinking of me and caring. xxxxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-04 15:25:35	@MistyEyezzz Thank you. That really means a lot. really struggling at the moment. Been too afraid to tweet and think I've scared people away
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-03 07:22:21	Please look after each other. That's all I ask :) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-03 07:21:41	To my twitter friends. Thank you all for your previous support. I just wanted to help too but I think I failed badly. I'm so sorry :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-03 07:13:34	No one hears me and my grip is failing. I really fucking hate this. Need to stop caring and just let shit happen. It's probably for the best
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-03 06:59:05	Have the strongest sense people hate me today. I don't know why. 8.30 am and already considering handful of pills and alcohol for breakfast
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-03 06:50:51	@davesleney don't apologize . Really glad you're ok :)x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-03 06:46:59	Yet another damn day to face *pulls covers over head* good morning I guess :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 22:41:16	@Mich_568 "penguin biscuits"?? Are you serious ?? I would eat them just for the name lol?!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 22:26:12	@Mich_568 lol ;))
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 22:23:22	Just having the weirdest sense that I've lived through the last 30 mins or so of my life before, literally.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 22:16:08	@Mich_568 it is ridiculous how comforting i can find a text from across the world when I can hear the accent in which it's given :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 22:07:16	@Mich_568 that's so dumb I know. I can feel my sense of humor being dragged away from me and I hate it
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 22:03:14	@Mich_568 I hate dealing with my own crap. I'd rather help someone / anyone feel better before me
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 21:59:15	@Mich_568 do you really think so? I'd like to think I'm there to help people but I think sometimes I worry too much?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 21:38:55	Should just stick to trying to deal with my own fucking psychotic brain...? #toofuckedupmyselftohelpothers
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 21:36:38	Goal today was to help and support others and kick my own self pity to the gutter. Dumb idea as seems I really suck at it ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 21:12:19	@ItsJackOk no need to apologise
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 21:08:04	@ItsJackOk Walking is good. It works for me and helps me think things out. Please take care of yourself. I'm here if you want to talk.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 21:02:10	@Mich_568 @itsjackok Agreed :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 21:01:02	@ItsJackOk Damn right you're meant to be here mate! We are all meant to be here. We might not know why but we are ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:55:08	@ItsJackOk @sullengirl0 there are a lot of us here if you need us...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:53:53	@ItsJackOk I completely understand how you would feel like that. Frankly I think it's appalling that you have been given this run around
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:49:59	@ItsJackOk I care jack. I'm not going anywhere. I'm here as long as you need me to be and I know others are too.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:46:03	@Mich_568 @itsjackok Agreed, I'm beyond upset that you can be treated this way???
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:43:43	@sullengirl0 shit then what is determined an emergency??? Im so upset by that
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:36:09	EIT does stand for emergency intervention team right??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:35:19	@ItsJackOk Oh Jack, I'm so sorry. That is just so wrong. I can't believe how fucking angry I am on your behalf :( are you ok?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:17:47	@ItsJackOk it can only help. Let me know how you go. I'll be thinking of you and hope it goes well :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:16:43	@ItsJackOk my psych just looked at me today, sighed, and said I was difficult to read. I don't know how to open up? If you can, do it.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:14:59	@ItsJackOk definitely mate. It's hard I know but reveal as much as you are comfortable with and hopefully they can help you :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:12:06	@FANGOFOX77 sleep well mate :) #stopCRB
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:10:24	@KateOnTheGo Goodnight! Thanks for making me laugh tonight. I needed it. Sleep well :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:06:39	@KateOnTheGo good :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:04:36	Please please #STOPCRB2012 we can make a difference
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 20:02:04	@KateOnTheGo Phew. Would have been absolutely horrified if it was taken out of context. A dumb tweet intended as response to my own comment.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:54:10	@FANGOFOX77 @kateonthego lets do it #saynotoCRB
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:53:09	@KateOnTheGo mixed up tweets. Was referring to my previous tweet and was joking :-/ not being controversial :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:49:15	@KateOnTheGo @fangofox77 what can I say but #saynotoCRB
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:48:21	@FANGOFOX77 @kateonthego Ha! ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:47:33	@KateOnTheGo @fangofox77 ooooh racist???
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:46:45	@KateOnTheGo @fangofox77 Yes it is. And yes you could. I've always been suspicious of black licouricey type foods but turn em red and yay!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:43:48	@FANGOFOX77 @kateonthego now I feel terrible for candy related bullying :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:41:11	@FANGOFOX77 @kateonthego ohhhh yeahhh :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:39:27	@FANGOFOX77 @kateonthego but eat no longer due to vegetarianess ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:38:54	@FANGOFOX77 @kateonthego ha ha! I also have fondness for choc bullets. Red ones even better!! Like the nipply strawb & cream too ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:33:04	@KateOnTheGo @fangofox77 white chocolate *gags* that's not chocolate for christs sake?? Lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 19:05:12	@KateOnTheGo I know right?! ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 18:59:11	@KateOnTheGo even then I'll have a Tim tam in one hand and an epi pen in the other ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 18:58:26	@KateOnTheGo ha! I've gorged on so much chocolatey goodness lately I fear I'll develop an allergy :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 18:54:25	@KateOnTheGo Tim tam...mmm ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 18:53:54	@per_spek_tiv says he who is also shitting himself at the very idea! Xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 18:53:03	@per_spek_tiv I'm just now dealing with the whole dating thing and it is scary I agree. Go for it! Nothing ventured nothing gained??!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 18:49:13	@per_spek_tiv happy to be fairy godmother. Lost my damn wand somewhere though, so annoying ;-) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 18:22:55	@sparklypixie72 I'm ok, struggling a bit, fighting off some scary stuff but so far keeping them at bay. Glad your having a cozy safe day :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 18:02:50	@sparklypixie72 ohhhh perfect day :) is it raining ? ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 17:17:53	@Mich_568 well obviously I can never be 100% sure but it feels secure. Damn it can't get the mirror / camera angle right to prove ;))
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 16:48:51	@davesleney how are you doing today Dave? I'm a little worried , please let me know your ok? Even if you don't feel like talking. x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 16:45:07	@Mich_568 actually that's a little bit of a lie. As far as I know my ass is still on.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 16:44:05	@Mich_568 lmao, literally ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 16:06:52	@ItsJackOk have a good day mate :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 16:06:00	@Mich_568 lol! Sorry wasn't meant as a comment on your personal hygiene ;) I hope you have a good day sweetie xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 16:04:17	@ItsJackOk That's great. I really hope they listen to you and give you some help. I'll fly over and kick their ass if they don't ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 16:01:49	@per_spek_tiv Not yet, 5.30pm here! Still have a while til sleepy time ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 15:59:46	@Mich_568 Oh Odafin will be fine. He can cope with a smelly old gym bag ;) Odafin is a he??? Don't want to offend ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 15:57:39	@ItsJackOk morning jack, I really hope your day goes well. Thinking of u mate and sending my support. xx. do you see EIT today?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 15:16:44	@MistyEyezzz if I concentrate and focus I'll be okay. I hope so, not in the mood for the alternative :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 15:15:25	@MistyEyezzz thanks, I understand what you're saying. You're very perceptive. Having one of those days when I feel like I'm slipping but
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 15:05:51	@MistyEyezzz I always appreciate people responding it can help me focus my thoughts and it distracts me
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 15:01:51	If I ignore and keep tweeting I hope I can stay this side of it??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 15:00:35	like someone tears a hole in my perception of the world and tells me to come on over, it's better here?? Not sure I want to right now :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 14:53:25	I hate this feeling. It can go either way and I'm trying to stay on track. I'm both scared yet almost happy to go with it?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 14:50:25	Weird shimmering mental state today. Keep thinking everyone I see is someone I know. Faces keep shifting. Feel like everyones judging me.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 14:09:19	@Mjab1616 taking each day as it comes right now. Wavering but hanging on :) thanks
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 14:01:08	@Mjab1616 good morning! Hope today is good to you :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 13:30:50	@MistyEyezzz ohhh I see. That kinda makes sense I guess. Thank you, and thanks for the follow :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 13:20:26	Im afraid i have never put an arrow to a bow in my life, nor have I ever had any philatelic leanings. Wonder how I will rate?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 13:15:53	And if I did rate archery and stamp collecting as my main pleasure in life what alarm bells does that ring?? Would that be good or bad?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 13:12:34	I wonder how many state "True, my favorite hobbies are indeed archery and stamp collecting, how on earth did you know you clever devil you!"
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 13:08:39	One of the listed statements I have to answer is "my favorite hobbies are archery and stamp collecting"...um, WTF???
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 13:03:46	So been looking through these mental status / personality questionnaires. Mostly multiple choice, True or false type questions...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 11:45:19	She has sent me away with a shitload of questionnaires to fill out and take back next week *sighs*
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 11:43:32	Very strange appointment today. Psych spent a lot of time staring silently and quizzically at me then told me I was 'hard to read'??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 09:58:51	@MadmanNoMore why thank you sir ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 09:52:41	Also quite paranoid today. I feel other commuters are looking at me and talking about me.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 09:51:38	Couldn't be more disorganized today. Late for appt. Forgot coat & umbrella. at train station freezing & trying to ignore vile mystery odor
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 09:24:30	@davesleney let us know your okay. I hope today is kind to you. Take care Dave *hugs*
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 09:22:53	@davesleney Sorry you had such a bad night mate :( remember people here care and will listen and understand how you feel xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-02 08:40:04	Good Morning twitter world. Psych appt this morning. Feeling a bit emotional not really keen to have my head read today
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 23:14:48	@Mich_568 I should be asleep but now engrossed in snopes website. Desperately searching for green lighted 'true' stories lol ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 22:23:20	@sullengirl0 @mich_568 never drink on the one that begins with M. Unless you want to puke up a lung. #beentheredonethatnotpretty
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 22:18:32	@Mich_568 aw that made me smile :) thx babe ;) xxx so there's this guy with a hook who needs a kidney and...no wait? #urbanlegendconfusion
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 22:14:51	@jenandrew1990 aww thanks :) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 22:13:54	@sjksanders thank you :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 22:12:13	@Mich_568 ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 22:11:11	Lonely night. Very tired. Would give anything for cuddles and comfort :( hate being alone.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 21:32:18	@per_spek_tiv really?! Good for you ;)!! I hope it goes well xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 19:54:26	@davesleney @mich_568 @samsleney oh *wipes tears from eyes* I haven't laughed so hard in quite a while...thank you all ;) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 19:45:57	@davesleney @mich_568 @samsleney I can't begin to tell you how relieved I am I didn't click on the search result 'Cleveland steamer - pics'.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 19:31:16	@davesleney @mich_568 @samsleney heh heh ;) I'm afraid it did. I'm doing okay Dave, how are you?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 19:30:08	@davesleney @mich_568 @samsleney disgusted by such juvenile behavior. So disgusted not even going suggest anyone look up 'lefty cappuccino'
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 19:24:41	@Miss_Gibson91 it's a deal. Let's swap countries lol :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 19:13:09	@Miss_Gibson91 actually not bad. Has been raining all day. I love the rain. I'm much more suited to the climate in your hemisphere!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 19:11:41	@Mich_568 @davesleney @samsleney wikipedia has a surprisingly thoughtful and dead pan explanation ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 19:10:02	@Mich_568 @davesleney @samsleney *sigh* googling now...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 19:05:07	@Miss_Gibson91 Good morning (well evening here)! Hope you have a great day :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 19:00:57	@Mich_568 @davesleney @samsleney Of course I have now just googled 'salty pirate' and 'space docking'....ooooh dear god :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 18:52:58	@sparklypixie72 Doing okay. Hanging in there. It's been raining all day here ;) hope you have a good day :) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 18:50:01	@Mich_568 I'm still pulling myself together. Brilliant.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 17:09:16	@sparklypixie72 you too sweetheart :) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 17:03:04	@Mich_568 lol ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 16:59:47	@Polarbear3127 ha! I do the same. I spent a few perplexing minutes wondering what on earth you were talking about and then it clicked ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 16:23:31	@Polarbear3127 what is really weird is that I have successfully translated 'busy click' to 'body clock'. Am I right??!! ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 16:21:33	@Mich_568 I assume Odafin is present and accounted for? ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 16:14:05	@Polarbear3127 5.30pm here. just getting dark. I tend to live my life at night. Works for me ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 16:09:04	@Mich_568 *hugs* I hope your day goes well xx. It's so great your able to work from home sometimes. You must work for some good people.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 16:04:43	@Polarbear3127 Good morning. Hope you have a good day mate x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 15:19:32	@ItsJackOk that's great news. I hope it goes well :) and I hope your day goes okay today. Hang in there mate and take care of yourself.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 14:54:12	@MadmanNoMore Ducks swimming on surface should have tipped me off.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 14:53:24	@MadmanNoMore Puddles and the jumping therein we spoke of. I took your advice. Misjudged depth of one. Managed to swim safely to shore.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 14:39:36	@ItsJackOk I think we all feel privileged that you were willing to share them with us :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 14:38:29	@ItsJackOk Thanks for sharing your drawings Jack. They're amazing and really give me more insight into your demons.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 13:38:18	@MadmanNoMore lol ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 13:35:21	@MadmanNoMore As usual I'm looking forward to reading it :) btw do you ever sleep?!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 10:42:24	@MadmanNoMore I shall do that. And I will ignore all funny looks :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 10:31:31	Raining today. I will walk in it and it will make me happy. I hope.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:44:29	Thank you to all who have kept me company tonight :-)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:42:53	Is 4am here. Had no idea. Things are speeding up just when I need them to slow down :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:36:39	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 and I too have been muddling my words tonight I think ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:35:12	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 yes I agree. We are all stronger than we think and it is a damn heroic struggle. Well put my polar bear friend :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:29:13	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok absolutely. I like to believe we are all stronger than we think
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:27:06	@Carregonnen oh I love him, he's amazing, and thank you, it means a lot that you thought of me xxoo
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:14:51	@ItsJackOk Okay that literally made me laugh out loud for the first time in the last 2 days ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:12:27	@ItsJackOk @madmannomore Of course Jack. Not going anywhere :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:09:32	@MadmanNoMore @itsjackok As will I :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:06:39	@ItsJackOk oh god no Jack! I read that and even I didn't know what it meant??!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:03:12	@ItsJackOk that was confused rambling. Even I don't know what I meant by that??!! Ignore!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 02:01:23	@ItsJackOk doesnt mean you've let them down. makes people want to help more. We will not give up on you jack however many set backs you have
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:56:05	@pinguinokx @itsjackok no idea where I was going with recent tweets. Lol !!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:47:46	@ItsJackOk please lose 'weak and pathetic' It's so not true. O do it toughly though
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:44:35	@ItsJackOk what makes you think you're letting people down? And you are clearly nothing but appreciative of all the support you get
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:37:27	@ItsJackOk I really do understand . I've been there. I also get that at times no matter what other people say it seems to make no difference
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:33:58	@ItsJackOk people are here for you and really care. Sending hugs and positive energy your way. If you want to talk I'm here. Stay strong...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:30:25	@ItsJackOk I've been in the same place mate. It's the fucking worst, shittiest feeling and I completely understand.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:26:11	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok absolutely , your art is amazing :) we want to see more :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:24:01	@ItsJackOk I would rather you talk to me or any other twitter folk than hurt yourself Jack. We care and don't want to see you in pain.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:20:52	@ItsJackOk believe me. I know how hard it is and I understand how it makes you feel better. I have the scars to prove it.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:10:41	@ItsJackOk please don't hurt yourself anymore Jack. Talk to me mate. I'm here for you as are a lot of people on here. I care and I'll listen
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:04:48	@sjksanders no I'm ok. Thank you :) I'm just worried about another twitter friend. I'm very anxious that other people are okay
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 01:02:11	@Polarbear3127 thx I'm just so up and down atm. I'm exhausted and confused, don't know here to focus
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 00:53:33	@pinguinokx no idea why you're asking but I worry you've hurt yourself? Are you ok mate? Please let me know
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 00:50:56	@pinguinokx tissue not great. It sticks. Gauze and a clean bandage would be better I think.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 00:41:27	@ItsJackOk generally Sellotape is fine unless you're allergic I think. Depends what you're bandaging? You ok mate?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 00:15:12	@Mich_568 well I guess when it comes to vege pate one can't expect 'Fabulous!!' lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 00:04:59	@Mich_568 what makes vegan pate 'Brussels style' ? Lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-05-01 00:02:03	@Mich_568 @davesleney that's the problem. There are a lot of great meat substitutes but they are so expensive
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 23:59:49	@davesleney @mich_568 bacon...it's always the bacon .)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 23:58:35	@Mich_568 @davesleney oh god. I tried vegan cheese recently (I have been vegetarian for at least 15 years) it was. Well . Disgusting
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 23:53:26	@Polarbear3127 coping with new dx new meds. I'm both tired and really wired I don't know which way I should go?

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 20:00:32	@davesleney @followbdt I just read it mate. And you've completely echoed how I feel. Wonderful read :) xx look after yourself :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 19:53:44	@Polarbear3127 I'm glad you found that funny. I've always loved that comparison :) truly fucking Bipolar!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 19:40:47	@Polarbear3127 anytime. I feel weirdly protective of my twitter friends at the moment I don't know why. I just want you all to be safe.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 19:37:58	@Polarbear3127 @drinking_coffee specially trained polar bears in northern hemisphere. Specially trained penguins in the southern hemisphere
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 19:22:13	@MadmanNoMore sorry, I can see that now. I get confused so easily at the moment. I think I'm back on track
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 19:19:37	@Polarbear3127 mate I'm so sorry. I do know how you feel. sending hugs and positive fucking energy to you. I know you'll get thru it safely
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 19:14:30	@MadmanNoMore didn't get that directly? Not sure what you were replying to sorry? Only one p in my username??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 19:08:17	@Polarbear3127 oh are you alright mate? Violence of any kind really upsets me. I'm worried for you??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 19:02:12	@MadmanNoMore Mr. 'Voice of reason :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 19:01:32	@MadmanNoMore thanks. I'll do my best. I need to be kind to myself for a bit I think. I really need to feel calm.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 18:56:18	@Mich_568 @terryandrob oh I'll have to check them out. Thank you.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 18:45:49	@Mich_568 Agreed :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 18:44:42	Worst times for me are when I lose my sense of humor. It's what keeps me going. When I stop finding things funny I stop living. #sadbuttrue
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 18:37:14	@Mich_568 you are always so nice to me. Thank you for your twittery friendship. It really means a lot :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 18:35:54	@Mich_568 @drinking_coffee thank you. I feel a lot better. xx. I need to adopt a more 'think before you tweet' attitude maybe though
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 18:33:18	@MadmanNoMore It was horrible. Had lunch today and a good talk and I feel a bit better. I'm still incredibly sad but I need to move on
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 18:30:16	@Mich_568 @drinking_coffee without thinking
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 18:29:54	@Mich_568 @drinking_coffee yea I know. Thanks. I just get really paranoid of what people think of me when I tweet my immediate feelings
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 18:26:10	@Drinking_Coffee your right, your right, I know your right :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 18:25:01	@davesleney I will. And thank you xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 17:56:30	@Drinking_Coffee even i just want to slap me 'only tweet the good stuff, keep the rest to yourself' :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 17:53:58	@Drinking_Coffee I know. just don't want to bring people down with me. I want to support people on here. I hate when my tweets get negative
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 17:41:19	@jenandrew1990 thank you so much. It means a lot xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 17:39:56	@Drinking_Coffee be glad you did. And thank you mate :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 17:37:29	I understand if I'm too much to deal with
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 17:36:54	My moods are cycling really badly at the moment I'm a bit of a mess and easily upset and confused but I really do appreciate the support x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 17:30:38	Thank you all and I'm so sorry :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-30 17:30:13	I don't know what to say. I completely fell apart yesterday. So many of you sent such kind messages and I just couldn't respond then.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 22:15:06	@MadmanNoMore don't think I've ever felt so tired mate :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 21:55:12	Just retreated to safety of my room. Feel like I've been holding my breath all day. I'm tense, anxious, confused and close to tears :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 19:44:11	Waiting until I can be alone and breathe to share more. I hope you're all still there :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 19:42:38	Thank you all so much for your amazing support. I'm almost frozen right now with the emotions I've dealt with today.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 19:37:09	@ItsJackOk hey jack, I'm having a really twisted emotional day. I'm so happy knowing you guys are there :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 19:35:12	@MadmanNoMore really fucking weird fucking day...is still going on, will report back asap. I may well need some serious twitter support
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 15:38:35	@swanners272 I need a coffee to balance out the rather too many glasses of wine I have imbibed this afternoon ;) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 08:55:41	@ItsJackOk your drawings are amazing btw :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 08:54:21	@MadmanNoMore it is. Arrives in just over 2 hours. Anxiety rising :-/ hopefully will all go smoothly
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 07:53:11	@per_spek_tiv @davesleney I just got up! 9am here. Sleep well :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 07:10:32	My father has just told me I spend too much time 'twogging'....bless. Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 07:01:54	@Carregonnen night. Sleep well :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 07:01:25	@ItsJackOk thanks jack :) hope you get a good nights sleep
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 07:00:21	@Drinking_Coffee @kateonthego for breakfast....yes please. Heavy on the rum today methinks
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 06:52:46	@ItsJackOk it is precisely 8.22 am :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-29 06:47:10	Well good morning world *yawns*
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:46:37	Thank you all twitter folk. Your support overwhelms me sometimes. Love you all. I'm gonna curl up and cry for a bit but I'll be back xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:43:58	@ItsJackOk thank you. I really appreciate that :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:42:21	@Mich_568 jeebus, don't we all ;) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:28:42	@per_spek_tiv :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:26:47	@Mich_568 I make that wrong turn all the time. You ok hon?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:25:29	@ItsJackOk I think so too. I just have to hold myself together for 24 hours. Thats all. I'll fall apart when he's gone :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:23:22	@ItsJackOk @madmannomore oh that is genius. Who wouldn't want to spend a night virtual street cleaning? Not me. Hours of fun to be had.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:14:00	@MadmanNoMore can't wait to read it :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:13:05	@ItsJackOk @madmannomore Street Cleaning Simulator??? Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:11:34	@ItsJackOk yeah your right. Thanks. Will be a LOT of masking tomorrow I think ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:03:21	@ItsJackOk thanks jack , I do too. Want to come across as sane and coping
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 21:01:43	@pinguinokx not sure how I feel. Thoughts starting to get a bit shaky. I don't want him to see me like this. I couldn't stand that
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 20:51:53	Seeing ex tomorrow. First time since he broke up with me roughly 2 months ago :-/ suddenly feeling very fragile. I miss him :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 19:53:35	@ItsJackOk I'll keep that in mind should I get as far as hands or feet....or head lol ;)!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 19:47:14	@ItsJackOk I know I would totally be addicted once I got the hang of it though. Anything repetitive and calming I always get caught up in
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 19:44:59	@ItsJackOk oh shit really? I must have glossed over that important step! I would have been a frustrated mess of tangled string ;) lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 19:35:54	@Carregonnen I know. It's exhausting fighting it off everyday.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 19:30:58	@ItsJackOk so far so good. Was gonna attempt voodoo pet ( I decided to call em) a. No string. b.my Hand/eye coordination is fucked lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 19:25:24	@Mich_568 I love it too. Tori Amos does a fucking awesome live cover of it ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 19:24:20	@Mich_568 thank Jeebus ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 19:23:34	@Carregonnen I've had a good day for a change. I hope it lasts I really do. Thanks for caring, it means a lot :) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 19:19:51	@ItsJackOk morning mate, I hope you have a better day. Please do take care of yourself :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 17:22:09	@MadmanNoMore Oh, so that WAS wrong? I also rode a scooter down a steep hill with no helmet. That's wrong too? They were told not to do that
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 16:49:42	@MadmanNoMore apparently I'm setting a bad example. Tongue severing must be rampant amongst kids of today??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 16:46:25	@MadmanNoMore Ha! That's so funny. They do that don't they?! I committed one faux pas though...I licked a knife.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 16:27:00	@sparklypixie72 actually pretty good for me! My nephews 10th birthday party. Cupcakes not quite as attractive as yours ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 16:24:28	@Polarbear3127 oh that's wonderful! Enjoy the time with your wife and kids :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 16:23:12	@sparklypixie72 Good morning :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 16:22:43	@MadmanNoMore kept sensing weird sympathetic 'that's the uncle, he's a little *taps side of head*...you know' vibes from the adults. Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 16:19:52	@MadmanNoMore completely! was fun though. First outing ive been on in ages. Found it hard to interact with the parents but the kids love me!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 16:03:16	@MadmanNoMore spent the day at my nephews birthday party. 12 screaming 10 year olds ;)!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 16:01:54	@Polarbear3127 you're welcome my friend, and good morning to you :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-28 15:59:04	@MadmanNoMore Evening :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 22:43:07	Goodnight from Oz twitter friends. Been a hard/weird day but you have all helped me through it, I can never thank you all enough xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 22:12:30	@Drinking_Coffee Just someone to tell you that whatever decision you make, right or wrong, is supported, yes? We all want that :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 21:46:14	@Drinking_Coffee @mich_568 that's not what I meant. I just meant...oh never mind *digs self in deeper*
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 21:40:27	@Mich_568 @drinking_coffee ummm that didn't sound right somehow??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 21:39:50	@Mich_568 @drinking_coffee email dicks so much better than phone dicks
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 21:21:01	@Mich_568 @drinking_coffee I used to do in office dictaphone typing. I'd love to do it at home. Work in my pjs and not deal with any dicks.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 21:10:04	@Mich_568 @drinking_coffee working from home is my dream job :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 21:05:37	@Mich_568 @drinking_coffee So how is Odafin holding up? ;) xx

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 20:39:51	@FollowBDT Working - Monday (eeeergh predictable) otherwise Friday , makes me wonder what everyone else is doing :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 20:36:09	Watched "The Artist", not gonna lie, didn't get it, but loved it though, no dialogue! really calmed me. #willneverreviewoscarwinningmovie
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 20:22:47	@MadmanNoMore @leonoraot @reachout_aus :)) thanks mate :))

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 19:20:07	@swanners272 I know. They're out there. scary. But I'll be damned if I'll let them get to me (he says timidly). Thank u for your support xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 19:13:54	All racist, misogynistic, homophobes can KISS MY ASS....thank you. the end.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 19:11:39	@swanners272 there are so many bigoted assholes in the world. I forget sometimes. When they rear their heads it takes me by surprise
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 19:01:50	@sparklypixie72 thank you *sob* just thank you xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 19:00:48	@swanners272 I am, I'm getting angrier. But mostly angry at myself for not being brave enough to stand up to assholes like that.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:58:33	@Deano81_LUFC that is so damn cute :) you are very lucky
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:56:18	@swanners272 I know. this time it just made feel horrible. I get really angry with myself when shit like that still gets to me.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:52:39	@sparklypixie72 I know, it usually rolls off my back but sometimes...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:39:01	Just about to watch "the artist" figure it will either be great...or really really suck. Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:35:00	@sparklypixie72 oh thank you xx You would think I'd be used to it by now, but it still hurts :-/ and I hate that it still gets to me :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:15:46	@sullengirl0 in the name of PIZZA!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:13:42	@sullengirl0 *smiles broadly* you can do it!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:11:02	Beaten down again :( just when you think you've developed a thick skin :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:08:45	@sullengirl0 gym??! I'm impressed, lucky if I can make it out the door atm. Good on you!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:07:32	@Polarbear3127 just GP, omg how did you function on such high dose, can barely move since I started on it
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:05:12	Yes he actually said that to my face "sorry I wouldn't hire you, I don't want some fag scaring away my clients" look for a "mans job" WTF??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 18:00:17	@sullengirl0 morning :) :/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 17:59:03	My favourite rejection, the guy who said he wouldn't hire a guy on principle, cos it wouldn't look right. Meaning "too gay"....cunt
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 17:53:44	2 job rejections today. 7 applications sent off. Not even capable of working atm but I send em anyway.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 17:16:03	@Polarbear3127 I feel both scared and validated if that makes sense?? I just don't know where I go from here?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 17:10:14	@Polarbear3127 feel very weird, like I'm "labelled" now. And feel so tired
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 17:06:45	@Polarbear3127 bipolar and BPD, started me on new ad - Prozac and anti psychotic - Seroquel (queitapine) - not sure of spelling??!!

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 16:07:04	@Polarbear3127 I'm okay. Dealing with diagnosis and new meds but ok :) was v happy to hear u got to spend some time with your family :)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 15:05:24	@Detoxbtex congratulations. That's wonderful :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 15:04:45	@per_spek_tiv ha! You just gave me my first laugh of the day. Thank you ;) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 14:41:38	One of them loooonely days today. Talked to no one but myself and a rabbit (and she didn't say much) :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 14:33:39	@per_spek_tiv you'll make it, I'm willing you on ;) then you can sleeep (I hope)! xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 12:06:42	On a slightly more :/ note, my ex (his godfather) is coming over. First time seeing each other since we broke up. Feel sad and awkward :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 12:02:05	Nephews 10th birthday on Sunday. He means the world to me and I'm so proud of him :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-27 11:06:15	@sparklypixie72 nothing like lying in bed listening to the rain :) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 20:37:38	@Polarbear3127 Wonderful! Enjoy :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 18:00:32	@Satinsox1 no sorry, I meant due to new meds "out of it" , should have been more specific ;) not working at the moment unfortunately.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 16:25:38	@Satinsox1 hey there, I'm doing...okay...bit out of it atm. Thanks for asking. How are you? Nausea any better? x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 16:22:32	@ItsJackOk please don't do that :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 14:05:15	@swanners272 lol, well enjoy that then ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 13:50:47	@swanners272 I'm doing okay thx. Only been up an hour (it's 3pm, oops). Started new meds and they've knocked me around. How are you? Xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 13:49:07	@swanners272 yea, based on the tweets I would say is clearly very ill and needs help but we can't tolerate offensive/menacing behavior
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 13:42:04	@swanners272 goes by the name BipolarBabble, supposedly in The Hague, Netherlands.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 13:33:02	@Miss_Gibson91 That kind of behavior is revolting :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 13:31:26	@Miss_Gibson91 uncomfortable but I didn't know what to do. The asshole is now BLOCKED. Are you okay?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 13:29:42	@Miss_Gibson91 I've just seen that conversation. He started following me recently and sending me tweets that were making me very
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 13:23:26	@MadmanNoMore in one direction you arrive before you left. In the other a day just disappears. Makes my head hurt ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-26 13:22:21	@MadmanNoMore good morning :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 21:46:58	@ItsJackOk ha, thanks for the heads up. I'll avoid them for sure lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 21:35:19	@ItsJackOk I hate all that deep breathing "dolphin / whale song, rainforest sounds" shit. It just irritates me more. This stuff I like :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 21:33:37	@ItsJackOk was surprised by how they distracted me though in the end (in a good way). Completely new to me
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 21:26:41	@ItsJackOk briefly checked out some vids. Kinda freaked me out to start with tbh then realised they were distracting me from exterior noise
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 21:10:01	@ItsJackOk simple stuff like that works for me too. Loud noise does my head in, sometimes even just people talking at a normal level hurts
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 21:07:30	@ItsJackOk that sounds great. I just googled ASMR and got Australian Society for Medical Research! Possibly not so relaxing lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 21:04:07	@ItsJackOk oops ASMR!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 21:02:52	@ItsJackOk I don't know what AMSR is? Will have to google lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 21:01:34	@ItsJackOk draw...then fold?! Guess that still defeats the purpose?!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 20:59:52	@ItsJackOk thanks, I really appreciate that. And same goes mate.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 20:55:21	@Polarbear3127 yea it feels like that. Id like to think each time we get back on we're a little bit wiser? dunno, trying to think positively
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 20:38:32	@ItsJackOk was into origami for a while but...paper cuts....lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 20:37:42	@ItsJackOk my manual dexterity is not good atm but this is the kind of thing keeps me calm and occupied for hours
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 20:31:33	@Miss_Gibson91 I think it's late there but WTF do I know? Lol ;)!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 20:30:26	@ItsJackOk do your best mate. That's all any of us can do. I'm struggling gonna try distract myself with these voodoo dolls ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 20:27:27	@ItsJackOk thanks mate :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 19:43:47	@jenandrew1990 Just read your blog. Don't give up. I don't know what else to say *hugs* you write really well :) there are people who care x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 18:06:39	@Mich_568 heh ;) yep
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 18:04:06	@sparklypixie72 doing ok, bit drowsy today, but ok. Threw away a lot of shit from the past....cathartic...;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 17:05:14	@Mich_568 threw out my favourite stuffed penguin today. Found in box from my ex. Oh how I'll miss him but I must set him free and move on ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 16:59:09	@Mich_568 damn...I'm a sucker for cuddly toys. Pathetic at my age ;) hang in there babe
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 16:08:20	@ItsJackOk you too Jack. Stay strong.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 16:07:36	@ItsJackOk that would be great. Could use something to keep me occupied. Thanks mate :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 15:38:09	@ItsJackOk thanks mate. Doing my best. I must learn how to make them voodoo dolls you speak of, I think I would like that ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 15:35:08	@ItsJackOk @mich_568 take it ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 15:33:59	@Mich_568 take em ;) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 15:33:10	@ItsJackOk hope your day goes well mate. Call them if you can :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 15:01:47	@FollowBDT thank you so much for the follow. It means a lot. You guys are amazing :-) xx #BlackDogTriber

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 14:41:10	@Mjab1616 @kathypidgeon it just disappeared, must be heading your way :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 14:38:08	@KathyPidgeon @mjab1616 I'm doing okay today. No lambs, just a rabbit hopping round the garden. Post rain sun just came out :) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 14:13:47	@KathyPidgeon @mjab1616 oh that sounds wonderful :)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 09:51:35	@Drinking_Coffee sorry for any "abnormal" tweets that may have been sent on my part :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 09:48:09	@Drinking_Coffee I'm not sure what you meant by that but a bit nasty don't you think?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-25 09:43:09	@Drinking_Coffee pardon??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 20:52:43	@n8rbos thank you
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 19:52:34	@Drinking_Coffee I really want to see that. Joss Whedon was involved yes?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 19:41:27	@Drinking_Coffee @sparklypixie72 thank you both :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 19:40:21	@Mich_568 yea, that makes sense. I do tend to do that :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 19:27:54	Anyone had experience with Seroquel? I've just been started on it (along with a new antidepressant) and I don't know what to expect.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 18:59:30	@sparklypixie72 thank you. I nearly didn't leave the house this morning. I was terrified and physically sick but I did it and I'm glad
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 17:49:18	@Carregonnen thank you so much. I've been feeling really bad xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 17:40:06	Just going to have a bath. First one I've had in years. Hoping it will relax me a bit.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 17:30:40	@BipolarBabble I don't know what you mean?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 16:48:00	@sjksanders @followbdt I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 16:46:27	@MadmanNoMore thank you
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 16:45:41	@BipolarBabble very, yes. And scared.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 16:41:05	@BipolarBabble oh I see. Sorry. All of the above I guess
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 16:39:51	@Polarbear3127 I know. That's what scared me. Has happened to me in the past. Been given new meds. I hope they help me.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 16:37:54	@BipolarBabble not great. Start new meds today. First time on antipsychotics and I'm a bit freaked out.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 16:32:41	@BipolarBabble they wanted to admit me for "observation" today. I declined but am being closely watched I think.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 16:30:56	@Polarbear3127 hope your doing ok mate. I really do. Just avoided "voluntary" admission today. don't think I'd cope. I'm so inspired by you
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 16:25:04	@Mich_568 that makes me feel a lot better xx I'm just trying to deal with my diagnosis now and been given new meds. I hope they help.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 16:22:34	@sparklypixie72 it's been a very hard day. I had 2 psych reviews, a relatively final diagnosis and change of meds. Tiring.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-24 16:04:20	@MadmanNoMore thank u. It's been a hard, weird day. But my psych gave a more defined diagnosis and changed my meds. I really hope it helps

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 20:00:14	@ItsJackOk why can't people make me feel like that ? :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:59:44	@ItsJackOk they are the best. I don't think I could ever get angry around animals. They calm me and make me happy.

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:30:41	@swanners272 you too sweetie. I'm here anytime :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:29:10	@ItsJackOk it breaks my heart that people even more in need are fucked over too. It's not fucking right :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:28:07	@ItsJackOk fuck I'm sorry mate. That kind of thing just works me up. I have gotten so tired of waiting for any kind of treatment myself...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:24:39	@Miss_Gibson91 nearly 9pm. Long night ahead of me.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:22:52	@ItsJackOk parents wouldn't allow it. My next goal is a snake ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:22:17	@ItsJackOk I saw a guinea pig, rat and ferret today when I went to buy rabbit food. They were all so cute wanted to buy them all :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:19:34	@sparklypixie72 mine has been so lazy . I've been practically immobile all day. Now I'm so sad I want to get trashed to feel better :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:16:13	@Mich_568 oh wow, lovely :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:09:42	@ItsJackOk I'm sorry but i get really upset when people need help and are told to WAIT....until fucking when??!! Help them now.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:07:20	@ItsJackOk early intervention...and you have to wait? That fucking sucks mate. Makes me so fucking angry....
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:04:42	@Miss_Gibson91 forget fat , ill always feel too skinny and not buff enough..
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:03:35	@Miss_Gibson91 I hate comparing myself to other fit guys, always makes me insecure.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 19:02:28	@Miss_Gibson91 I'm the same, in fact today I did nothing, no walk or anything and I feel like shit. Fat and fucking ugly
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 17:59:02	@Miss_Gibson91 oh I have had the laziest afternoon, don't worry about it ;)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 16:29:27	@Mich_568 beautiful :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 16:28:34	@Mich_568 @miss_gibson91 @itsjackok @davesleney @polarbear3127 @scooby_who @sullengirl0 right back at you sweetheart :) thank you! Xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 16:26:20	@Polarbear3127 oh I'm so happy for you mate :) enjoy every minute
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 16:25:20	@swanners272 yeah, I understand. I'm just starting to explore that with my psychs now. I kinda don't want to go there :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 15:27:49	@swanners272 doesn't take drugs to fuck you up (although it helps ;) lol) some of us are just wired that way I think. I hope!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 15:25:46	@swanners272 wow , that must be incredibly hard
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 15:24:09	@swanners272 coping mechanism I guess, some cope, some just get fucked up...like me ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 15:22:12	@swanners272 definitely , as well as drug and alcohol problems...all the nurses I know drink, smoke and take way too many drugs.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 15:19:34	@swanners272 hope you got my subsequent tweets to explain ? :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 15:15:11	@swanners272 and they all need people like us eh?!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 15:14:25	@swanners272 our professions often cross...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 15:14:02	@swanners272 jeez, that must be a hard job. Funny thing though, prison officers, police, ambos, nurses...always have a connection..
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 15:06:43	@swanners272 you'll get there I don't doubt it for a minute :) it's hard though know I know, I just need to back to work myself :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 15:03:40	@swanners272 weren't bad times. I actually treasure them. Had a lot of fun believe it or not! I just often grieve for those beautiful guys
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:59:47	@swanners272 not at all, just makes me think more about what I want to do in the future. I need a goal and I think that's what I want to do
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:57:32	@swanners272 I got too close and felt too much. Id like to go back to it, work in mental health. I want to help others.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:55:19	@swanners272 I'm not sure, I burnt out I think. It was a long time ago. HIV AIDS was rampant and I saw too many young men die
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:47:04	@swanners272 oh agree completely! Dad particularly lame though! I'm an ex nurse and believe it or not we tend to be a bit intolerant! Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:28:03	@swanners272 that's so nice :) I've really been loving seeing my nephew regularly since I've been back here. He's an amazing kid :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:25:54	@swanners272 he's having a colonoscopy tomorrow, he's fine but you would think he was having major surgery...such a baby lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:24:33	@swanners272 weird day, went for a walk in the rain this morning (favorite thing ever!!) have been pandering to my dad this afternoon
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:22:32	@Mjab1616 no no 3PM here! Most of Sunday gone but I hope I'm up awhile yet! Not ready for 4pm pensioner tea yet I hope ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:19:21	@Mjab1616 heh ;) hope you have a great Sunday :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:17:42	@swanners272 :) lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:13:32	@swanners272 it's funny, most of my twitter friends are on your side of the world. I spend my day waiting for you all to wake up ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:04:13	@swanners272 good grief, you're up early ;) hope you have a good day!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:02:59	@Mjab1616 sounds lovely. Morning to you! 3pm here, beautiful day though!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 14:01:55	@swanners272 good morning! Oh this time zone thing is so confusing. 3pm here!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-22 11:44:39	@jenandrew1990 I have appt with psych this week re trying new meds. I'm very nervous about it.

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 22:51:58	@Polarbear3127 how can you be so nice when you are dealing with so much? Your situation breaks my heart mate. You have family and kids
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 22:46:21	@Mich_568 how did this happen so quickly? I feel so bad I can't stand it
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 22:42:27	@MadmanNoMore @itsjackok please don't ask , the more that do the worse it gets
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 22:39:35	@Polarbear3127 mate, I was doing so well, suddenly I feel so fucking bad, ignore me, you have so much more going on, please look after you
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 22:35:45	@ItsJackOk thank you
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 22:33:32	@Mich_568 why does it hit me when I think things are going so well,?! Fuck I hate how this feels
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 22:27:16	@ItsJackOk not now , I was going so well . I don't need this now , it's not fair
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 21:45:25	Oh shit, what's going on, I refuse to let it go bad, it can't , it just can't now
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 21:04:35	@ItsJackOk I just wanna go back to bed myself :(

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 19:00:53	@ItsJackOk I'm okay mate, weirdly, I think??!! I'm trying to enjoy feeling alright, I keep expecting it not too last. does that make sense?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 18:50:09	@ItsJackOk so glad your feeling rested and calmer :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 18:48:51	@ItsJackOk good morning and yay! ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 18:46:17	@Miss_Gibson91 ok, started off well, parents amused me for awhile then slowly became insufferable noise that I just wanted to shut out :/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 17:30:57	@Miss_Gibson91 usually when I need them most
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 17:30:35	@Miss_Gibson91 but it always feels good that when it's late or early hours of the morning here I know I'll have people to talk too :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 17:27:57	@Miss_Gibson91 I know the feeling :-/ good morning! It's so weird knowing you're all just starting your day and it's 7pm here
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 16:46:31	@per_spek_tiv oh, I'm sorry :( hugs coming your way. Twitter friends always here.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 16:19:40	@Deano81_LUFC Ha, that's cute :) Hope you have a good day mate
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 16:17:59	@Mich_568 thanks! xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 15:46:01	@sparklypixie72 ha ha! Well if it makes someone laugh I'll take it on the chin ;) have a great day xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 15:43:28	@Mich_568 I could do with a dream like that :) mine have been awful lately. Good morning btw, hope you have a good day :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 15:41:07	@sparklypixie72 I'm so glad you're amused by that. I'm now craving a penicillin shot ;) !!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 14:36:09	My mother has just informed me she found them ON THE FLOOR OF A BUS. Horrified *rinses out eyeballs with bleach*
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 14:33:20	Been thinking of taking up swimming again. Tried on an old pair of goggles I found lying about....
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 11:47:27	@psychosis2407 @miss_gibson91 I just snorted tea through my nose when I read that ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 11:44:22	@Drinking_Coffee :)) So glad to hear it! I had 2 reasonably good days in a row, I can't believe that ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 09:17:57	@MadmanNoMore good night, sleep well!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 09:07:46	@Drinking_Coffee Big Congrats :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-21 02:10:55	3.30 am, still awake. Knew I shouldn't have stayed in bed all day today :-/ can feel my head switching into a bad mode
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 23:57:06	@ItsJackOk Glad you made it home in one piece. Hope you feel a bit calmer soon mate.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 23:42:45	@MadmanNoMore Great bedtime reading. I love a happy ending :)!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 21:14:11	@MadmanNoMore I never mix nuts. Always regret it the next day.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 20:59:42	Staring at the tv and eating my body weight in pistachio nuts. These wild Friday nights have got to come to an end before I burn myself out.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 20:12:43	@sparklypixie72 @drinking_coffee genius
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 19:44:39	@Drinking_Coffee @sparklypixie72 Aaah yes, the old 'here's my resignation letter and a freshly baked loaf' trick...classic
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 19:34:58	@sparklypixie72 I love baking. It calms me down :) ask me to cook dinner though and I'm all over the place!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 19:29:41	@sparklypixie72 Oh...yes please!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 19:24:12	@Mich_568 ha ha, yes!! Especially when I've ordered way too much food to guiltily binge on alone ;) "keep it down guys foods here"!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 17:40:46	@per_spek_tiv thank you :) you too xxoo #BlackDogTriber
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 17:39:46	@Mich_568 ooooh spooky I just did the same thing ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 17:38:02	@sparklypixie72 sorry to hear that :( twitter friends are here ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 17:36:35	@LeonoraOT @tania55561299 Welcome Tania, nice to have you on board ;) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 17:34:14	@Polarbear3127 we miss you too mate. Thinking of you :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 16:37:11	@nurse_w_glasses thanks for the follow :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 14:41:01	....don't worry, I'm okay though, just had to run and wave my arms around a bit. Looked perfectly normal.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 14:39:57	Just got chased by a bee on the street....
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 14:27:37	@MadmanNoMore yup, havent slept more than 2-3 hours a night in weeks so not complaining really ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 14:09:09	@MadmanNoMore um no, no you're not...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 13:58:19	I just got up. It's 3pm. I have been in bed for 13 hours. Good grief.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-20 00:12:52	Gonna try sleep now, 2am here. Gotta be a record early night for me ;) good night wonderful twitter people and thanks for everything :) xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 23:56:51	@MadmanNoMore lol! You should.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 23:54:11	@MadmanNoMore I know right?! And your welcome. Ur an amazing writer (not that I'm a fucking expert :-/) do you have any writing aspirations?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 23:47:13	@MadmanNoMore ;) same time frame, different country! My mums from Yorkshire btw :) kinda think of it as my homeland lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 23:40:26	@MadmanNoMore :)))) wonderful, made my night, are you sure you weren't on my ward 
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 23:22:42	@jenandrew1990 but people care and are here to support you, just like you support them. We are all in this together :) *hugs* xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 23:21:12	@jenandrew1990 shit babe, I know how you feel. It'll get better. (i say that and I just want to slap me) doesn't feel like that does it :( x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 23:15:45	@Miss_Gibson91 it's cute. Kids so often take what adults say literally/seriously. I did. It's kinda both hilarious and a bit sad really lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 23:02:33	@Miss_Gibson91 I'm actually still laughing. I just see this picture of a little girl chewing and chewing on one little fucking peanut ;)))
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 22:59:44	@Miss_Gibson91 because that's definitely something I would have done ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 22:59:15	@Miss_Gibson91 Hilarious!! when I replied I thought, shit I hope she doesn't think I'm making fun of a tragic childhood affliction. Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 22:53:58	@BipolarSanity that's ok, last time I tried to do that I threw my phone at the wall in frustration :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 22:51:45	@Miss_Gibson91 wow, a packet of peanuts must last for years at that rate?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 22:45:03	@per_spek_tiv ha I know, I lost all my penguin pics ;) I'm hanging in there. How are you? Thanks for the follow btw :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 22:42:42	@BipolarSanity oh crap. Sorry man, I kinda suck at advice of this nature :( I have twitter on my iPhone only and make it up as I go along:)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 22:24:53	@BipolarSanity change it, save it and don't go back in. When you close twitter down and reopen it should be fixed (I hope ;))
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 22:23:15	@BipolarSanity that happened to me. Changed it, all looked good but when I went back into my profile it changed back again.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 21:34:47	@MadmanNoMore ha ha *snorts* I only just got the Dolly reference. I was kinda creeped out for a minute ;) LMFAO now!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 21:30:55	@jenandrew1990 lol. I know it's weird isn't it?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 21:29:19	Oh shit of course....horizontal stripes :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 21:27:16	Why do fitness gurus and personal trainers keep following me? How do they find me? Does my twitter profile make me look fat?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 21:24:18	@Polarbear3127 fund love eh? So I should be looking for a hooker?? ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 21:21:47	@Polarbear3127 thanks mate. I think I'm just an intolerable romantic??! One day my prince will come. Lol.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 21:05:17	@iamtheeggman4 I know, it was a rhetorical question really ;) and thanks xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 21:03:09	@Mich_568 lol :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 20:51:04	@jenandrew1990 thank you xx now sadness turning to anger...I think I prefer this actually ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 20:48:44	@iamtheeggman4 rotten, I feel like such a fucking twat. Why do all the men I'm attracted to turn out to be assholes :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 20:45:54	@jenandrew1990 I have now vowed to do the same :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 20:44:00	@jenandrew1990 I know right?! What an asshole. My therapist called him a coward.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 20:38:19	@MadmanNoMore I can't wait to read it :)) x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 20:37:22	Is that too much to ask? I'm fucking heart broken, it's pathetic :( I should have fucking known better.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 20:35:26	I'm just an average guy, I may not be perfect but I do have a lot of love to give and that's all I am looking for in return.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 20:33:36	So I have just issued an "if your not interested just tell me and we will end it here" ultimatum. I fear the worst. I'm so fucking stupid :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 20:31:15	(well why not) someone a month ago. It was going really well and I'm afraid I was getting in too deep. I don't think the feeling is mutual.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 20:29:15	So I may just have sent a text I'll regret. My partner of 14 years broke up with me OVER THE PHONE roughly 2 months ago. I started dating
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 20:22:03	Sitting in the backyard looking at the stars, smoking and crying. Shit I sound like a fucking country and western song :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 19:35:35	@Miss_Gibson91 go for it. That's what I do ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 19:34:37	@Drinking_Coffee @madmannomore hit a few things for me ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 19:31:02	@MadmanNoMore ba doom tisch...thank you, I'll be here all night ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 18:37:07	@MadmanNoMore lol ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 18:36:31	@Mich_568 did you decide to go home or did they send you home? (none of my business really) :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 18:35:26	@Mich_568 me in my last job several times. I just had to get away. Thought I was going to lose it on the train home but I made it.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 18:34:10	@Mich_568 your certainly not a failure. Sometimes things just get overwhelming. Get home and take care of yourself. Same thing happened to
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 18:13:05	@Mich_568 you okay?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 17:13:57	@Mich_568 fuck I don't miss that :-/ feel for you, I don't know how I'll cope when I go back to work. Prob go freakin postal ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 17:11:09	@MadmanNoMore @drinking_coffee Yeah, Sydneys alright. Give me London or New York anytime though :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 15:38:47	@ItsJackOk morning, hope your day goes well mate :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 15:37:32	@Mich_568 umm, that didn't sound right....;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 15:37:06	@Mich_568 hope your day goes well :) don't let the dicks get to you.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 15:34:16	@swanners272 what better way to let it out than twitter ;) no need to apologise x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 12:40:08	@BipolarBabble mornin (well afternoon here) ;) how goes it?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 12:12:42	Just got a package in the mail. Was briefly excited. Turns out its a box of my clothes from my ex :( Ouch
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 07:18:41	Good Morning. Up early. Going for a walk on the beach. I'm determined today will be a good day. It's been a long time :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 07:16:11	@jenandrew1990 lol ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 07:08:38	@MadmanNoMore @drinking_coffee It is! Probably my favourite city in the world (next to London).
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 06:51:10	@Drinking_Coffee @miss_gibson91 But the intention was just as appreciated ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 06:43:32	@KathyPidgeon was in Sydney, recently back in Adelaide :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 06:40:59	@MadmanNoMore oh dear god, you'll probably win ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 01:35:34	Thank you to all the wonderful twitter people who helped me tonight. I'm gonna try to get some sleep now (it's 3am here) :)xxx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 01:17:14	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok trying to avoid going back to hospital, how do I stop telling doc too much? It's fucking painful holding em back?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 01:04:26	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 James youve been there for me for a long time. Jack you have helped me so much. hang in there please both of you
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:57:10	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 we've all been dealt different hands. Mine fucking sucks. That's why people like us need to pull together
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:55:25	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 yeah but if you could fight them off and take control yourself? I think you could do it mate
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:53:08	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok then it became "critical" that I see someone. If they had seen me earlier maybe I wouldn't have been there :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:51:24	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok apparently they thought it was fine until I was pulled off the street at 3am talking to myself :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:46:49	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 doc I saw today wants to put me on multiple, kinda freaked out. How do you cope without any meds?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:44:33	@sjksanders @tanner2272 no hurry whatsoever and any kind is good, they are my "soul animal" along with otters. Lol must be a water baby ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:40:34	@MadmanNoMore @polarbear3127 @miss_gibson91 such healthy minded people :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:38:58	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 no meds, shit really?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:38:04	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok I know, was given that choice :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:28:20	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 I drove to my docs to get him to sign it...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:27:42	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 I've just had to get my doc to sign an "I'm not too fucking crazy to drive" form so I can get my license.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:25:24	@Polarbear3127 @miss_gibson91 understand that. When i was in hospital any distraction helped. pack of fags always beat gym though :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:21:14	@Deano81_LUFC @miss_gibson91 I love it. The other week a seal was playing just a few metres from the shore. Made me so happy :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:19:30	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 I told my old GP I was suicidal, that was 8 months ago. Did nothing. Upped my meds.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:16:50	@Deano81_LUFC I know ;) just being self deprecating I guess. I do that lol :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:15:33	@sjksanders @tanner2272 really? That would be amazing :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:14:13	@Miss_Gibson91 I don't have the energy, I force myself lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:13:08	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 was worried I'd self harm. 3 months is fucking ridiculous to wait for help
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:12:05	@ItsJackOk @polarbear3127 I know "times up see you next week" ? my official first appt was in July, only reason I got in sooner was my GP
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:08:41	@ItsJackOk it was weird. He kept pushing for me to reveal "traumatic events" I have to go back. Didn't want to tell him too much.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:06:10	@Deano81_LUFC nothing wrong with that! I'm just a little ignorant I guess ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:03:24	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok so full day of fucking with my head :( not that I need explain it to you both ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-19 00:01:46	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok apparently we ran out of time because my history is so fascinating? So have both psycho and psychi appts next tues
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:57:17	@Deano81_LUFC weird sport like stuff!! Confuses the shit out of me! Maybe just a dumb Aussie lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:55:31	@Polarbear3127 @itsjackok thanks mate, you too. Had a psych appt today. I'm still processing. 1.30 am here, wide awake as usual
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:52:10	@Miss_Gibson91 ha! Well that makes me feel a bit better lol! Walking clears my head though. I like walking on the beach early morning
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:49:32	@Deano81_LUFC even if I have no damn idea what your saying!! #ignorantaussie
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:42:28	@Miss_Gibson91 I'm not good at weights or anything!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:41:50	@Miss_Gibson91 me too, I try to walk everyday, sounds lame I know, but I'm talking 3 hours on a good day lol!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:29:24	@ItsJackOk it's not, shut them out. They will let go.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:24:11	@Mich_568 Ohhhh, well I'm with you. I could smack a Ned or too myself! God knows enough of them have given me and my friends a hard time
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:19:46	@FollowBDT Hello! #BlackDogTriber
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:15:23	@Mich_568 lol, but please, for someone in oz, what's a Ned??!' ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:13:50	@Miss_Gibson91 I keep meaning to get to the gym but dunno if I'd be doing it for me or for how I want people to see me #lowselfimage
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:08:13	@Miss_Gibson91 I'm impressed. I'm so lazy. Personal training sounds like torture to me ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:07:03	@ItsJackOk ewww, no it's not milky at all, i hate that, its clear, kinda like green tea but less bitter. It relaxes me
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 23:00:07	@ItsJackOk "forbidden" is not what I want to hear when someone asks me to follow...
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 22:58:18	@ItsJackOk yep, I've blocked though, it made me really paranoid to have them anywhere near me
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 22:57:02	@ItsJackOk I like green tea, particularly with jasmine. And brown rice tea, takes me back to my Yoga days!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 22:54:55	@sjksanders the stripes are temporary I hope. Reflects my current mood. The rabbit was too cute. I need a good penguin pic!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 22:48:33	What does it mean when you hit follow and you get "forbidden"?? Sounds scary? Should I block?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 22:44:40	@ItsJackOk weird how soothing tea is ain't it? Lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 22:43:03	@sjksanders I know, if only we could turn the love and support we all have for those suffering back on ourselves
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 22:40:13	@Miss_Gibson91 it would be awesome wouldn't it :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 22:29:54	@Miss_Gibson91 hmm, maybe fashion stylist could be the way to go? ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 22:21:07	@ItsJackOk while I'm strong, I want to use it positively, I'm a kind of "don't mess with my friends" kind of guy. Lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 22:18:07	Why can we be so amazingly supportive, yet we are so fucking hard on ourselves? I don't give a shit about me but I worry so much for others
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 22:04:23	@ItsJackOk anytime. So many of you have helped me on here, I'm on a mission tonight to help my twitter friends in return :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 21:59:06	@Miss_Gibson91 typical...just me..how am I to maintain an accurate timeline of my conversations? Lol!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 21:56:24	@ItsJackOk he's fucking with you. Your fine mate. Don't let him get to you. Stay strong. I know you can.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 21:52:52	@ItsJackOk ha! :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 21:50:35	@Miss_Gibson91 is it just me or are tweets coming in randomly? No particular order? It's confusing
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 21:49:20	@Miss_Gibson91 if I can make someone else smile right now my job is done :) so many have done the same for me tonight :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 21:35:58	@ItsJackOk first thing that made me literally express laughter vocally all day (lol so overused) Show yourself as much love as you can ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 21:08:56	@Mich_568 agreed :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 21:08:00	@ItsJackOk anytime mate. Keep fighting :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 21:02:19	@Mich_568 I've been off work since august :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 21:01:54	@Mich_568 I so relate to your work. When will people accept cust serv people really don't give a shit no matter how nice they are?!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 20:58:27	@ItsJackOk I don't know how you do it. It's amazing you get up and go to school everyday. Fucking respect mate
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 20:57:07	@ItsJackOk actually I'm not sorry. I just want to kick that head of year in the...I can't believe you have to deal with that kind of shit
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 20:48:42	@Mich_568 lol, same (when I was working)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 20:44:26	@ItsJackOk excuse my language but I'm sorry....what a cunt
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 19:31:38	@jenandrew1990 I didn't clean bunnies cage soon enough. Think that's why she bit through my phone charger cord ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 19:29:41	@Satinsox1 right back at ya sweetheart :) xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 19:28:57	@Satinsox1 I know, my insecurities showing aren't they ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 19:26:53	@Satinsox1 I've noticed the same thing. Thats why I'm trying not take it personallynow, they just get lost, it's not that people don't care
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 18:56:47	@Polarbear3127 I knew what you meant :) thank you, means a lot, especially knowing what you're going through. You're an inspiration mate :)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 18:03:35	@KathyPidgeon @miss_gibson91 @drinking_coffee thank you :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 18:02:18	@Mjab1616 @miss_gibson91 Thank you and hello :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 17:51:50	@Miss_Gibson91 thank you, that was incredibly sweet, I've gotten all teary now xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 17:50:05	@Miss_Gibson91 @drinking_coffee like to think usually I'm a funny, articulate, friendly guy who loves to chat, just sometimes I get a bit 
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 17:39:10	@Miss_Gibson91 @drinking_coffee yea and when I don't get a reply I take it personally. Pathetic aren't I ? Makes me feel a bit desperate
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 17:34:35	@MadmanNoMore and I do want to hear the last part. I love stories with a happy ending :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 17:32:06	@Drinking_Coffee like being back in high school ;) cliques everywhere
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 17:31:21	@Drinking_Coffee then I see others tweeting back and forth and I feel out of the loop
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 17:30:30	@Drinking_Coffee I know, and I'm not looking to be inundated with followers, I just sometimes feel my tweets go into an empty void
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 17:02:35	@MadmanNoMore @drinking_coffee well I don't know if will get better, but certainly not worse. Made it to psych appt at least
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 16:39:54	@Satinsox1 takes me back to high school I guess...silly I know, I should be past that ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 16:38:51	@Satinsox1 I thought I'd done something wrong. I love the support I get on twitter but sometimes it feels a bit cliquey and I feel left out
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 16:36:35	@Satinsox1 really bad night last night. Was confused and agitated then paranoid cos no one replied to my tweets or texts
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 16:21:05	@Drinking_Coffee but I cant take it personally, twitter is a fickle thing ;) I see that now.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 16:19:56	@Drinking_Coffee no one did say hello .........................,,,,#..................... (tumble weed indeed)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 16:07:02	@Satinsox1 I so hope your feeling better? I'm sorry I haven't checked in, I've been in a bit of a bad place but I'm thinking of you :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 15:52:38	@Drinking_Coffee @madmannomore It means a lot. I couldn't take it in then and I had to get off twitter. I'm a little better today :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 15:50:59	@Drinking_Coffee @madmannomore I'm so sorry about last night :( thank you both so much. I can't express how grateful I am for your support x
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 01:36:23	@MadmanNoMore maybe I just don't want or deserve help anymore
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 01:34:46	@MadmanNoMore @drinking_coffee I'm scared tired and I need it to end
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 01:33:40	@MadmanNoMore @drinking_coffee have psych appt in afternoon if I make it till then not sure I can go on
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 01:30:48	@MadmanNoMore I could call the crisis team but I'm too scared
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 01:23:52	@MadmanNoMore took more medication and tried to sleep but keep hearing noises and feeling things
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-18 01:22:31	@MadmanNoMore checked all my tweets and texts in case I said anything wrong and that's why know one was speaking tome

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-17 19:38:34	@Satinsox1 Eeeergh, oh no, that's awful :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-17 15:40:04	@Satinsox1 I know right? Thanks I do too! How are you? Any morning sickness yet ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-17 00:15:04	@MadmanNoMore anytime ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 23:30:51	@MadmanNoMore The similarities to my own experiences on previous admissions to a psych ward are uncanny. That was 15 years ago, I was 24.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 23:26:41	@MadmanNoMore loving your blog posts mate, beautifully written :) keep it up :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 20:22:54	@Miss_Gibson91 I'm so sorry. Don't give up. The next one could be the one xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 20:20:46	@Satinsox1 I'm Bipolar and not getting the right treatment :( Thank you so much for asking xx
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 20:18:20	@Satinsox1 concerns I might "self harm" at the moment and wants my medication reviewed and a more defined diagnosis. She seems convinced
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 20:16:15	@Satinsox1 Very confronting and frankly I was all over the place but she was very nice. wants me to see psychiatrist on Wednesday as she has
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 19:19:27	@Polarbear3127 sorry that was a bit of a flurry of tweets ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 19:18:47	@Polarbear3127 this staff member shouldn't be working in this field. Definitely make a formal complaint.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 19:17:45	@Polarbear3127 and use the resources that are there to help people like yourself. There's nothing to feel guilty about
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 19:14:23	@Polarbear3127 and in that time I worked constantly, also often while barely coping..accept that you need time to get well,
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 19:12:39	@Polarbear3127 you are definitely not a scrounger. I've recently gone back on benefits for the first time in 15 years.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 19:08:48	@Polarbear3127 That is absolutely disgusting behavior from a mental health worker. Benefits are there to help people in just your situation
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-16 07:01:07	Have psych. appt. in an hour. I'm so anxious. I feel like crying already :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-15 22:25:46	@MadmanNoMore Ha. I didn't really partake. Just looking at it made me nauseous !
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-15 22:21:23	@MadmanNoMore It wasn't bad actually ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-15 21:27:15	@MadmanNoMore I did exactly the same thing an hour ago. Milk in my green tea :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-15 20:02:04	@Miss_Gibson91 I know that feeling. Are you okay?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-15 19:58:36	@ItsJackOk I'm so sorry to hear your not doing so well today. I'm thinking of you mate. Take good care of yourself.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-15 17:56:47	@Drinking_Coffee yea I know. Kick in the head ain't it? :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-15 12:23:16	I'm amazed at how hardcore the feeling of loneliness can be. It fills every cell in my body at times it seems.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-15 10:55:48	Ok so feel sick today. sweaty and shaky, head is filled with noise and there may well be an alien in my stomach. Other than that I'm fine ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-15 10:52:01	@Drinking_Coffee Hello Pete, thanks for the follow :)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-15 07:56:16	@MadmanNoMore OMG how can anyone get away with writing something like that. What a fucking asshole.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-15 07:51:37	@ItsJackOk ha ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:48:31	@ItsJackOk please ?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:45:13	@ItsJackOk why do they have to make me feel so bad ? I'm not a bad person
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:40:59	@ItsJackOk yea it would
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:27:50	@ItsJackOk I can't believe how vile they have been to me...I've never felt so degraded. I can't help how I am
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:23:28	@ItsJackOk I don't know what to do. I've never been aggressively confronted like that before :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:21:18	@lindyloohughes I need to, my parents just told me I'm a drunk, drugged out loser. I'm not?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:19:00	My parents have just told me I'm a loser. They say I'm a drunk, and a drug addict. Where do I go from here?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:14:08	@Miss_Gibson91 yep , I do now, they are so angry with me. I don't know what to say.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:11:09	@lindyloohughes I just want it to end.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:10:00	@pinguinokx why does it hurt much? I just want to die
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:06:54	@lindyloohughes it's all fallen apart
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:06:13	@Miss_Gibson91 awesome ;)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 23:04:13	@Miss_Gibson91 my parents just found me losing it, they think I'm an alcoholic, drug addict , I want them to go away

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 22:21:01	@ItsJackOk write something about stigma mate, get it out, I'd read it :) in fact anything to get me worked up now would be good!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 22:14:37	@Polarbear3127 how are you going mate? Wow I love twitter folk, they've been amazing :)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 21:56:13	@ItsJackOk I think so too. I just feel pushed right now. How can I make a decision when people keep forcing me?

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 21:42:12	@ItsJackOk I'm so scared of being put back in hospital :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 21:41:40	@ItsJackOk haven't seen psych. in about 15 years. Since I was about 25. I've avoided it since because I don't want to be labelled
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 21:37:28	@lindyloohughes good morning :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 21:36:43	@ItsJackOk I have first appointment with psych. on Monday . I'm kinda freaked out about it.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 21:16:38	@pinguinokx peck me and tell me you love me ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 21:09:07	Are eggs "over easy" just slutty eggs??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 21:00:57	@MadmanNoMore I'm okay. Hanging in there....just :-/
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 20:59:07	@Polarbear3127 @bored_ghost @mrsnickyclark I've often thought the same thing . Weird eh??!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 20:55:24	@MadmanNoMore good morning. How are you?!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 20:43:13	@Miss_Gibson91 that's great, I'm really happy for you :) My ex broke up with me end of feb. Still fresh and still hurts :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 20:40:40	@Polarbear3127 oh wow, that's scary mate, are you okay?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 20:39:47	@ItsJackOk oh dear, I could be in big trouble now ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 20:39:08	@ItsJackOk ha! I couldn't agree more!! #diejustinbeiber

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 20:36:16	@BipolarSanity good luck :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 20:34:00	@Miss_Gibson91 hmmm indeed, my parents accused me the other night of being "0n something" "I know your on something"??!! Seriously?
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 18:05:06	My nephew (9 years old) just told me he has a crush on someone called Harry ! His words...how cute is that?!!!
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 18:03:01	@ItsJackOk good thought ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 17:14:24	@ItsJackOk oh shit it is green WTF ??!!

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 17:03:28	@ItsJackOk morning. I feel kind of the same . Don't think I can go without sleep much longer though.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 17:01:32	@Satinsox1 I'm ok, feeling very weird though. Psych appointment Monday morning.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 17:00:16	@Satinsox1 I'm Adelaide now, was in Sydney
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 15:37:33	@Satinsox1 and your in Melbourne ! Someone in the same time zone ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 15:36:49	@Satinsox1 maybe half an hour? I've heard of that. Maybe I should try it. Always a bit nervous about mixing herbal with pharmacy though
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 15:28:52	@iamtheeggman4 I should get involved just to stir things up :) lol
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 15:28:16	@iamtheeggman4 wow, thats hilarious. So passionate that they resort to nasty name calling. All over an annoying overated little shit ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 14:19:14	@sjksanders have gone with my rabbit for now, until true inspiration strikes me ;) The egg is gone ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 14:10:24	@sjksanders then it clicked ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 14:09:57	@sjksanders you know for a second there I had absolutely no idea what you meant by "changing my egg" . Was very perplexed :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 13:59:09	Just been listening to the B52s "With the Wild Crowd" live in Athens GA. Possibly one of the best live bands ever IMO :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 13:56:40	I have 17 followers. That's a pathetic number but makes me feel good anyway :) can only hope I don't bore them all away ;)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 13:49:10	@sjksanders good grief your up early then ;) 3pm here though and I'm almost ready for bed!

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 13:40:32	@iamtheeggman4 about half an hour I think. Is 3pm here now. I'm so physically tired I feel sick but just can't switch off.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 11:22:46	@Miss_Gibson91 I know that feeling.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 11:19:47	@ItsJackOk sleep well :)
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 11:14:56	@MadmanNoMore sat afternoon. It's really warm and sunny today. I don't like the heat.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 06:33:23	If I don't look. and I don't talk. he can't see me and will leave me alone. Yes?

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 06:07:11	@Miss_Gibson91 no but a virtual hug is better than none ;) thank you :) xxoo
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 06:01:32	Sometimes all I want is a big strong hug :-/ they're not given freely enough methinks.
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-14 05:52:23	@Miss_Gibson91 anytime :)

216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-13 22:56:24	It seems people come and people go but few of them stay. Those that do...xxoo
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-13 22:53:04	Is it possible to be incredibly tired , yet wide awake at the same time??
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-13 22:49:05	@sjksanders I think things are going really wrong :(
216985052	pinguinokx	2012-04-13 22:47:23	@Polarbear3127 how you going mate? Sounds awful to say when your in hospital but I think I've lost it
