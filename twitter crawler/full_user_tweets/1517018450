1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 21:03:50	@LadyFOHF Oh yes, Mrs "Louise Surname" is on some weird lists.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 21:03:24	@LadyFOHF Think yourself lucky, I apparently have been in many accidents, have tonnes of debt, used to have PPI, and am worryingly pregnant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 20:53:08	Can I just make it clear that Farage's comment is not just vile, it's untrue. That's key. Farage et al lie as well as vomit hate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 20:46:29	@garwboy @noodlemaz I'm rewiring my brain right now AND I'm rewiring yours. How do you like them rewired apples? What? Normal you say? BAH!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 20:43:18	@noodlemaz I think we should take the German route of compounding words. Hateful awful disgusting = Infinihorrifucked.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 18:27:27	@detailtofollow @aloofloofah @stavvers I thought you were very convincing. I'm going to rebel against my parents. Ok i'm 42, bit late.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 18:23:21	@MayaGoodfellow @hopenothate Might be? I'm going with "dead on certainly is".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 18:20:02	@noodlemaz @stavvers In reality, I am very upset with millenials. They all appear to be charming and lovely. Better than I was. DISAPPOINT!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 18:18:27	@noodlemaz @stavvers Finally a criticism of millenials I can get behind. Those kids, on my lawn, with their music, and their rough fabrics!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 18:15:16	@stavvers Fuck Trump, Farage AND FABRIC SOFTENER! Is that what anti-fa stands for?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 18:14:35	I see a fascist ideologue is criticising the husband of a woman murdered by a fascist ideologue for opposing fascist ideology.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 18:13:12	@chiller The Lord (my mate's dog) knows I am not a violent man. Farage frequently makes me think I should rethink this policy. Frequently.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-20 04:09:09	@prodnose @robinince So this wasn’t staged? I got the impression this was deliberate. The endless bad questions seemed planned to me.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 16:30:42	@DMReporter You know you want me to kill millions based on their ethnicity, baby. Mhmm does genocide make you horny, baby?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:37:04	@SofieHagen I need this gif in my life
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:36:38	@TiredFairy Space Aliens. Good explanation!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:36:19	@Julie_B92 We're bad people. I can live with this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:36:04	@garwboy Not sure where I heard it (The Bugle?) but the 3 nations that won WWII are in the grip of the forces they beat. The loser isn't.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:34:48	@TiredFairy I'm an evangelical atheist, and to be fair, even I'm beginning to believe there's a deity, and said deity is messing with us.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:33:42	@Julie_B92 I can cope with sad fascists. Really. My coping is good in this area. Amazingly. Bigly good. I have the best coping here.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:32:13	@TiredFairy I have taken some drugs in my time but this... Even that batch of bad acid a friend knocked up in lab can't touch this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:31:10	@TiredFairy Really? Teen Vogue is the vanguard of progressive pushback against the rising far right tide?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:28:49	@TiredFairy I'm waiting for Just Seventeen (if it still exists. HEY! I'm with it) to publish articles on how to attract your nazi crush.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:26:05	@TiredFairy I know, trivialise the enormity of their ideology by focussing on their shirts.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:25:25	@TiredFairy If they are relevant to the news and political cycle, literally the least interesting thing about them is who they're wearing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:23:31	@TiredFairy Who doesn't enjoy a good tweed? But a gentleman doesn't use Oswald fucking Moseley to model the pissing thing!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:22:27	@TiredFairy It is the most bonkers phenomenon. "This week Mr Hitler is sporting a jaunty cap as he orders the extermination of millions!"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:20:22	It's the marriage of three of the worst human traits: superficiality, bigotry, and missing the point.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:19:45	Can I just ask what the fuck is going on with these puff pieces about the fashion of various fascists please.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-05 02:18:01	@TiredFairy "He {haha} hates black people and openly advocates for genocide, but also has cute lashes and an expense account for Gucci"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 17:28:40	@Julie_B92 Mancakes you mean. Misandry!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 17:26:39	@Julie_B92 I wish to present the radical notion unto sexists that we can care for women's needs and childcare. WoooOOOOoooOOOOoooo scary
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 17:24:33	@Julie_B92 Stop having your Ladypinions about Ladymatters you you you.....Lady! Go and do Ladythings instead. Like erm science and babies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 15:45:03	@TechnicallyRon @BaroqueChic Worryingly true. Well known fact that bed monsters only want one foot.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 15:44:05	@mrchrisnewton whatever makes you happy. Have fun.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 08:14:53	@FluffCustard @SamAmbreen_ Ah yes, the style bible. Wise move.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 08:14:22	@SamAmbreen_ @FluffCustard I shall use my most disapproving of faces The one where it looks like I've had a particularly tart lemon inserted
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 08:13:10	@FluffCustard @SamAmbreen_ The Elders demand full spangly bits with extra froofroo. Or so I've heard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 08:12:23	@SamAmbreen_ @FluffCustard They will die in pain as such heretics deserve. {serious nod}. Unfollowers are wicked. Not in the good way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 08:09:46	@SamAmbreen_ @FluffCustard Seconded. Can we take this to the Council of Elders now?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 08:05:38	@bechillcomedian Typical men. Always hooting about something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 08:03:01	@Chemjobber @Doctor_Galactic @MSalt69 If she gets the chemistry right I will forgive nearly anything. There's no chance but I live in hope
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:54:31	@mrchrisnewton deary me the point has whoshed spectacularly over your head hasn't it? Don't translate. You're bad at it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:51:27	@ImprobableJoe I am, as ever, in awe. DO IT!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:50:31	@WomenDefyUKIP Pft you can't get PhDs in climate change it's not real! As any fool knows gays cause bad weather.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:49:03	@ImprobableJoe Is it visible from space? Will it dim lights on other houses via power drain?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:47:19	@ImprobableJoe Why? Did you buy a chainsaw? Those things are fun for all the family.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:44:07	@michaellegge her views on Rage Against the Machine, if positive, could bring me round though And if she's a Zappa fan Tory me up my friend
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:42:17	@VanguardVivian but car makes up for penis. Does this mean it's dick pic o'clock? {actual car does not do this, nor will dick pics happen}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:39:12	@youngvulgarian @AbiWilks after tweeting that I did think "yes a joke, but please also be true. Please"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:37:24	@youngvulgarian @AbiWilks Whoa whoa whoa! Even Trump knows that Milo is a pointless irrelevance best scraped off the bottom of a shoe.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:33:13	@telescoper @WomenDefyUKIP Seems fair. I'll have a second PhD please. Can I have this one in something fun like astronomy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:31:49	@telescoper @martynpeel just occasionally the parliamentary democracy that prevents govt by plebiscite is a good thing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:30:50	@telescoper @martynpeel illiberal though it is, if the "people" want the death penalty, maybe the "people" should not get what they want
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:08:38	I have forgotten to bring my new iPhone headphones that fit the new iPhone thingy socket. Stupid: I feels it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 07:06:20	@mrchrisnewton Do you tend to find repeatedly missing the point works for you? Do you believe if you repeat something enough it becomes true
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 04:40:34	@mrchrisnewton Deary me those goalposts visibly redshifted they moved into the distance so fast.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 03:42:18	@mrchrisnewton does it help you understand that my comment aboutbheir seriousness would still apply if I agreed with them?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 03:41:46	@mrchrisnewton The dishonest elision you are trying to make is that how an idea accords to reality is reducible to mere disagreement.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 03:13:48	@mrchrisnewton {sigh} nope. But if you can't understand the difference I'm not sure I can be bothered to explain it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 03:08:12	@mrchrisnewton @MSmithsonPB Nope. Whether or not the moon is made of green cheese (to use prev example) does not depend on agreement.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 03:06:08	@mrchrisnewton @MSmithsonPB ..voting for a player. But there are more definitions of "serious" than "contender" or "of current significance"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 03:05:06	@mrchrisnewton @MSmithsonPB Put it this way, if 4m people voted for a group that thought the moon was made of green cheese, they might be...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 03:03:58	@mrchrisnewton @MSmithsonPB Definitely not about agreement. More about grounded in reality. But as I said I agree they've had results.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-04 02:58:51	@mrchrisnewton @MSmithsonPB Hinges on interpretation of the word "serious" If you want to consider them a player I'd agree. More's the pity
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-03 22:24:14	@mistressmatisse Impressive. Most impressive. [\Darth Vader]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-03 22:20:24	@mistressmatisse now that looks like it might hurt. Does the chap in question have to pee using skills better suited to a flute player?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-03 21:54:12	@mistressmatisse {Puts chin on hands. Flutters eyelashes. Does fascinated face} (Says a man capable of tweeting about paint drying! )
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-03 21:40:42	@MSmithsonPB @LabourLeft But then I'm not as sympathetic as the BBC to furthering the agenda of bigots.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-03 21:39:59	@MSmithsonPB @LabourLeft They have never been a serious player. They have always been a splenetic outlet for vomit flecked xenophobes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-03 21:31:50	@LadyFOHF To which the only correct answer is "Yes. yes she is a lady ninja." Because messing with children is good parenting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 23:20:47	@stavvers But never Mensch. That's a kink too far
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 23:20:08	@stavvers We anti war protesters are polyamorous and bi. We'll invite the soldier to join the ongoing orgy. Doesn't Mensch know anything?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 22:00:35	@stavvers Some of this may be exaggerated for comedy purposes. Sinks mean we are allowed to oppress anyone. Definitely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 21:59:44	@stavvers Whatever the issue we men all pee in the sink, all sinks always. Forever. Sink peeing is a divine male right or something. #Trufax
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:38:28	@PeteLlewelyn Also, unsurprisingly, how to be a man 101.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:36:49	@PeteLlewelyn ...all my best ideas get vetoed at the planning stage.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:36:27	@PeteLlewelyn The judge said that strapping the infant to a motorised rotating table with a series of timed hoses was child cruelty...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:35:19	@PeteLlewelyn Oh yes, I am a great parent. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:35:00	@PeteLlewelyn It's easy. Feed the cleaner of the 2 noisy dribbly ends. Clean the smellier of the 2 noisy dribbly ends Do not get this wrong
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:33:03	@stavvers Not by you, I mean as a normalising, mainstreaming of his odious "comedy" and entitlement.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:32:30	@stavvers I am Jack's complete lack of shock. V frustrating that this publicity seeking pustule is in any way afforded attention.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:30:56	@ronanlyons @bigmouthedwoman I'm a fan of how the politics of oppression leads to irregular langauge constructs. By "fan" I mean I'm scared
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:27:48	It's another irregular verb: I'm ok You will suffer first He/She/It deserves it We're all in it together You are the problem They will pay
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:25:53	It's always easy when someone else does the suffering first. It never happens to me now does it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:25:11	So "we" are going to suffer as "we" deserve? Great. GO FIRST. No volunteers? I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:24:20	...but the Brexiteer on the Clapham Omnishambles will not. They might get a short respite whilst the "undesirables" are cleared.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:23:27	...actions means that they surely will suffer. Make no mistake. A few insulated mouthpieces at the top might benefit (the Trumps/Farages)...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:21:51	...it take to get me on the streets. I don't want the Brexiteers or Trumpistas to suffer either. And thwe consequences of their views and...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:20:03	Privileged people like me are not going to suffer first (or maybe even ever). We can hide behind our privilege. Hence why I ask what will...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 20:19:02	Wholeheartedly, full throatedly agreed. "We" deserve this? Ok you submit yourself first. Show me the power of your "we". Endure the worst. https:// twitter.com/BrandyLJensen/ status/804542857482735616 …

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 19:52:06	What a panoply of fuckwits From top to bottom side to side, what a sorry excuse for a political movement Makes me ashamed we share a clade

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 19:42:01	@prolucy2 @PennyRed No worries. I wasn't aware I asked you to believe me. Many people don't believe things that happen to be true. {shrug}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 19:40:30	@Julie_B92 Boom chicka wow... {frozen for years. Revived} ...wow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 19:37:06	@Psythor Works for me. Although I've always thought Rees-Mogg was more of a "Shagger". I am sure he'd be pleased to be addressed that way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 19:24:02	@BipolarBlogger You fear my Grateness. Wise. Wise. Although I am willing to make peace and share my smoked paprika.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 19:21:24	@AllyFogg Too small. You'd need a few to make a proper casserole.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 19:20:41	@BipolarBlogger I have a miniature grater. I have a big grater with a special nutmeg section, and I have a electric blade grater. Come at me

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 19:06:59	@laurenlaverne To be fair, who doesn't want to get spangled in a wood of a Friday?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 19:05:16	@BipolarBlogger Fair point. You may pick anything up to and including a radish. I will also permit random cauliflower. But no rocket.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 19:04:24	@BipolarBlogger Your aromatic spices do not scare me, I have nutmeg and I know how to use it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 19:03:43	@BipolarBlogger And I shall not be inserting any root vegetables. It's not Thursday and I am not that kind of boy on a first date.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 18:36:21	Hmmmm maybe, juuuuuuust maybe, I am in a bit of a mood about messages in the media at the moment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 18:35:06	Let's see them attack something they can't easily palm off as a "liberal elite".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 18:34:23	...that they believe are favoured by their readership. (Note I said "they believe are favoured", not "are favoured")
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 18:33:43	...just like that Catholic church did. Paid cover ups and such. Let's see the same vitriol from the scum press when it's institutions...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-12-02 18:30:46	Oh yeah, and whilst I'm on a tear, I would love to see the usual suspects get on one about the FA/clubs paying for silence on child abuse.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-30 05:24:25	@garwboy The problem I now have is to work out if you are joking. Assuming yes: It's no less than I deserve. Assuming no: Sorry. Bad joke.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-29 23:20:49	@S_Plissken_ @GeorgeTakei Explicit appeals to bigotry in order to secure populist vote have been made. That will take generational repair.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-29 23:19:33	@S_Plissken_ @GeorgeTakei More than that, I think recount is a distraction. Even if it unseated Trump (unlikely) it doesn't put genie back.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-29 23:17:18	@S_Plissken_ @GeorgeTakei nope. Happy for recount to be conducted if miscount suspected. Would be happy if Trump did it. Mocking hypocrisy.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-26 00:09:06	@chiller it certainly explains why we're fucked!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-26 00:07:42	@chiller not all winkles. {laughs self silly} {starts crying uncontrollably}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-26 00:06:38	@chiller incidentally my winkle theory of politics makes a worrying amount of sense.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-26 00:06:04	@chiller I mean, what sort of person would be caught without a winkle? The very idea!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-26 00:05:11	@chiller Sorry. I do not understand. Non winkle person? But but surely winkle possession = person. It is what all the men in my life told me

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-25 23:56:35	@chiller it will make people's winkles bigger Must be, the way Farage is going on about it. No other answer. It's bigger winkles for all

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-24 08:10:47	It does not help that a) I have been exposed to Trumpist Farage Twats, b) I am super busy at work, c) I am up to my eyeballs in OU work.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-24 08:09:14	But getting someone to write something for me? WHAT IS THE POINT?! I don't want the damn degree for boasting rights (I have several!).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-24 08:08:21	I mean, I'm working full time, and doing a degree, I reckon I can cut myself a little slack when it comes to being a knobhead with timings.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-24 08:07:23	I can forgive me my occasional indiscipline and casual attitude to the timing of OU assignment work. But plagiarism? I'd rather die.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-24 08:01:58	Fuck it, it will get me a solid 2:1 for that essay, 1st for the rest of the assignment. Nothing like last minute. I am a naughty slag.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-24 08:00:33	1000 word essay tossed off, with diagrams and referencing, in 1 hour. Helps that I had a plan and knew the topic backwards. WIN! BED!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-24 02:07:15	@AdamRutherford @realDonaldTrump But the wee hands make his tiny cock look massive. Which in turn explains his unwarranted arrogance.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-22 03:20:05	@ProfMike_M @sarahkendrew Presumably then you'd have Anjem Choudary (or similar) present at his ex-school under similar circs.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-22 03:15:50	@ProfMike_M @sarahkendrew Possibly. I'm of the "let a thousand flowers bloom" mentality, I don't claim there is One Right Way, however...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-22 03:12:37	@sarahkendrew @ProfMike_M He needs no one to provide him with a platform. It also unnecessarily, and undeservingly, elevates him.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-22 03:11:45	@sarahkendrew @ProfMike_M It's the difference between letting him speak and giving him a platform from which to speak. The former is fine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-21 21:50:20	Apparently Trump will be president and we're brexiting. Hahahahahahahahahahaha {sobs} So, anything happening globally?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-16 23:57:03	@Darriach Doesn't mean you don't either. The reverse snobbery is still snobbery. Better to judge on results.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-16 23:55:24	@Darriach Ah but that's not the Atkinson use. The Atkinson use is about not being able to rely upon incompetent people.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-16 23:22:04	@Darriach I wonder if Fry wrote it or Atkinson wrote it (or they did it together). Who did it first I wonder. Probably never know.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-16 19:38:31	@Darriach Ah so not a book. I'd like to see that interview. Any idea where it is?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-16 17:11:33	@Darriach interesting. I don't remember it from the books. Any idea which one?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-16 16:53:16	@Darriach I saw it on a Rowan Atkinson show from many moons ago. Still have the tape. It's the one where he does speeches at a wedding.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-16 06:07:46	@WilliamShatner If we'd just elected the burned bellend man as PM I'd agree.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-16 03:37:03	@saspist Fair, I suppose. But the grounds make it all crunchy in my amygdala.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-16 03:25:27	@saspist I have found intraocular surgical insertion of caffeine crystals is the way forward. I say "forward". Not sure, blind, but awake!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-16 02:10:16	@sarandipt @JohnCleese 1) that was brilliant. 2) Benedict was still sitting the right way on that toilet. My point stands!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-11 01:15:06	@belledejour_uk @TaraFlynn Absolutely. And even more it is not a ban on criticising what they are saying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-11 01:03:32	Sorry. I'm clearly broken. I am considering the idea that Trump is a monster based only on his trousers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-11 01:03:00	Can we have a militant aestheticism and asserts the wrongness of Trump and Farage et al on the basis of their vulgar sartorial choices?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-10 21:36:30	The dehumanising by Farage et al is precisely due to their own inadequacy. They fear the other because they themselves are weak.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-10 20:42:12	@GaryLineker @RATR2016 Racist? Farage? Why the very idea!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-10 20:22:16	Which does not excuse the dehumanisation by the left (or whoever), that is still undeniably and categorically wrong.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-10 20:21:26	It is the foundational ideology derived from inadequacy on the part of the promoters and inadequacy of their ideas Not merely a side effect
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-10 20:20:08	It is explicit. It is desired. It is part of the foundation. It is not merely the consequence of the inadequacy of some supporters.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-10 20:19:08	Dehumanisation of "the other" is a core message, a central tenet, in the ideology and change espouses by Farage, Trump et al.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-10 20:18:12	I don't say that to exculpate Corbyn or his fans but to point out a key difference. The dehumanisation is baked into the things Farage wants
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-10 20:17:20	It wasn't (for example) Corbyn himself calling people "red Tory scum" or dehumanising his opponents. It IS Farage and Trump et al doing this
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-10 20:16:22	Quite true. Occurs in all groups. Interesting though that this is coming from the heart, the people at the top of the process. Not fringes. https:// twitter.com/arobertwebb/st atus/796682860866453504 …

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-10 19:13:01	We're not talking about the naked racism or schadenfreude of a coterie of supporters or internet crotchets. This is the heart and head.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-10 19:12:06	It's naked racism. Laughing through bared teeth. I begrudge no one a celebration of their victory, but surely this is lifting the veil.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-09 21:18:42	@nataliereed84 they knew about forced repatriations. They knew about the state surveillance of various "undesirables". Be no one did a thing
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-09 21:17:29	@nataliereed84 no hope at all. They KNEW in 1933. They knew about the internment camps that would later become death camps. They knew.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-11-09 20:14:14	@teambrady Might be. Might not be. History has a horrible way of repeating itself. And some rather stark similarities exist.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-10-03 20:38:39	@stavvers It's confusing. I mean one is not treating women like people, and the other is suspiciously invasive and obsessed with bottoms...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-10-03 20:37:26	@stavvers God fucking dammit, I am always getting those mixed up. Structural misogyny and the policing of female self expression and aliens.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-09-17 22:36:16	I am given to understand that the Russians have blocked some porn sites. Wankers. This is at least the 1092336th iteration of this joke.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-09-17 17:48:23	I could also be moved to loudly saying the word “clitoris” repeatedly in a crowded shopping centre. 13 year olds still do that right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-09-17 17:47:39	I mean, I know a really good street corner where I could drink Diamond White and swear at adults. Is that still a thing?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-09-17 17:46:51	I am, today, unamused by being a grown up. I may have to do something significantly juvenile to compensate. Do the youth still drink cider?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-09-16 19:35:45	@Tola_o I fear the word “mind” grossly inflates what he uses to generate concepts for speech.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-09-16 19:32:19	@SLATUKIP I despair for us as a species. Autocorrect tried to make that “despise”. In this context… …pretty fucking accurate.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-09-16 19:25:51	@TrippyPip But you’re really harsh. You wouldn’t tell a chap if he had spinach in his teeth just to watch him burn. Or something.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-08-17 15:53:26	@bengoldacre @lecanardnoir The only surprise for me is that it did not mention Trump’s hands as being “uge”, along with something else.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-08-16 01:54:35	@sturdyAlex educational. I approve. The sea, however, is very full of racists and needs a good clean. We have available volcanos.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-08-16 01:52:08	@Kevin_Church @belledejour_uk I see a plan with no drawbacks. Apart from, you know, the high chance of death, liver failure…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-08-14 04:12:06	@TheRickWilson @docfreeride I object profusely. He was already all of these things. There was no becoming. Only permashitness.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-08-13 03:05:39	@JosieLong Which is, of course, the important thing. Don’t get me wrong, the encouraging rabid xenophobia is bad. But top horse = vital.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-08-11 11:16:54	@chriscfrench I have a similar problem. I have to stop using windows in fat bastards’ houses as mirrors. According to the so called judge.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-08-11 06:00:31	@chriscfrench @fiona_gabbert I have always used this excuse. Unfortunately I am also actually a fat bastard. Thus lessening its power.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-08-10 04:48:10	Maybe Trump meant that those people who are keen to modify the 2nd amendment to reduce gun numbers in the US could vote for Clinton…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-08-10 04:41:05	@EssiViding @guardian Tragically, it’s really just this one. Which makes it so, so much worse.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-27 02:19:40	@StuEkins You’ll have work to do to be more explicit than that website. Totally faked of course. Honest guv. I never went near that convent
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-27 02:18:31	@StuEkins You’ll be saying Katie Hopkins next… … Oh I am so so sorry. And I’ve also just been sick in my mouth a bit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-27 02:17:30	@StuEkins how many times have I told you not to use language like that in my presence? How dare you say Piers Morgan near me? Outrage!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-27 02:10:32	This and other intemperate tweets have been brought to you by the letter Q, the number 9, and the delight that is alcohol.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-27 02:09:39	Ppl seem to be realising again that Kelvin McKenzie’s moral equiv. of slime you get between your fingers after fisting a dead pig. News how?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-27 01:31:48	@UnseenPerfidy Ohhhh. He’s an MRA. That’s not acid. That’s just bigotry and stupidity. A heady mix to be sure, but no fun.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-27 01:19:59	@UnseenPerfidy who is this person and where does he buy his acid? That’s clearly the good shit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-26 17:17:52	@TrippyPip One apologerisates most humbliciously
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-26 17:14:51	@TrippyPip A fair point. Which would make more sense if I read the preceding tweets. But sill very fair.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-26 17:10:13	@TrippyPip look I’ve only just looked at Twitter there is no need to call me names. What do you mean the world doesn’t revolve around me?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-26 17:08:37	@questingvole And so applicable to a great number of public figures.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-25 04:02:39	@TrippyPip I’m not here, I am working. Honest. Okay I’m here a bit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-25 03:57:47	Has anyone done a Tweety McTweetface joke yet? If not, it’s mine. Hell, if they have its still mine. I’ve got a flag and everything.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-25 03:36:33	Moral dilemma: stay up, watch GoT live. Be tired for work. Or get up early watch GoT at 5am. Be tired for work. Never said it was a toughie
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-24 20:23:08	@gracepetrie I am beginning to see the problem. Granted, through the bottom of my beer glass, but that shouldn’t disqualify me!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-24 20:21:39	…about the NHS plays well with the rubes (their view, clearly, not mine). This crap doesn’t even pass a cursory sniff test. BAH!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-24 20:20:59	…are not the champions of any aspect of the welfare state, including health care. It totemic wanking because they know saying NICE THING…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-24 20:20:14	…largely hell bent on the destruction of the welfare state. Oh I know there are left wing brexiteers, but pull the other one. Farage et al…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-24 20:19:20	Just 1 example, the Pro-Brexit leaflet mentioned the NHS and supporting it. Now wait who are the Brexit fans again? Small govt capitalists…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-24 20:17:27	@gracepetrie At the time, yes definitely. Afterwards…less so. Maybe. Depends who you fall in love with in drunken stupor.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-24 20:16:24	I had hoped that the importance of the subject would have improved the seriousness of the discussion. Look, I’m an optimist, okay.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-24 20:14:59	I am passionately bored of this horseshit. Sorry, politicos, I know it’s important, but the “debate” is more painfully shallow than normal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-24 20:13:48	Just had a “positive” leaflet through the door from pro Brexit people It was positive all right. Positively full of bullshit and xenophobia
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-22 23:20:17	@MittenDAmour Friends do not let friends Dellingpole. I am truly sorry you had to endure it. Would gin help? Intraocular administration.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-19 05:05:20	@garwboy Told you it worked.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-19 05:04:14	@garwboy Limitations of Twitter. It's very hard to add FACT to every tweet because sometimes I might accidentally waflle on for too long FAC
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-19 04:59:51	@garwboy Can't sing a lick either. He has a troop of people from Llanelli in the wings. FACT. (All things are truthier with FACT appended)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-19 04:56:32	@garwboy You're probably not even Welsh. You're just taffing it up for the clicks, fame, and sexual favours.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-19 04:53:34	Nobody enjoys my statistical rant on the misuse of p values. Well, I say nobody. Of course I mean 0 people enjoy it (p=0.05)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-10 14:57:30	@lecanardnoir @EdzardErnst But surely the tsunami of scepticism dilutes the sales pitch making it more powerful?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-07 14:10:51	@VicMetcalf_NZ Ahh the “Welcome to ~95%* of life in research” article from the Onion. I remember it well. ~94% = Nobel Prize.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-07 00:55:07	I want to have time for Twitter etc at the moment, but I don’t. I am blaming you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-04 19:55:46	@SallyStrange You silly goose, surely you know by now that other people’s bodies are public property. When convenient of course.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-03 21:29:05	@Enceladosaurus I don't know, I'll tell you when the habit attenuates! (Admittedly I've recently left research, not academia, but similar)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-03 21:22:32	@star_curl @Delaware_Dolfan Phew. I was worried there for a minute.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-03 21:21:47	@Delaware_Dolfan @star_curl It does in my case. Didn't you all get the memo? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-03 17:31:30	@Esteleth All true.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-03 17:31:11	@Esteleth Give them all really badly tied bandages on purpose?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-03 17:27:40	@Esteleth
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-03 17:25:45	@Esteleth Bastards. I’d sue, or shoot it. That’s the American way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-03 17:24:36	@Esteleth I am trying to avoid doing the PILE of work I have. I better stop avoiding it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-03 17:22:36	@Esteleth Night Shift, Nurse?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-03 17:21:38	@Esteleth Mornin’. Must be offensive o’clock there for you
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-03 16:54:37	I quite like Twitter, I’ve been able to talk to some lovely people. I’m struggling to find the time for conversation here at the moment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-04-01 01:08:27	@nataliereed84 It’s political correctness gone mad. Probably. I’m never really sure.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-30 18:25:35	@TechnicallyRon I AM NOT ANXIOUS! WHAT IS THAT NOISE? OMG I CAN HEAR THE CANCER GROWING AND I AM NAKED IN PUBLIC! Coffee dose = Correct.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-29 02:13:40	@joemacare @infurioustoo No, I say, no shit. (/Foghorn Leghorn)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-29 02:12:06	@NeilDenham1978 Plus at least an Easter Thursday where they all shuffled their feet and bashfully said “what are we like?”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-29 02:06:58	It is the end of the weekend. I demand a recount.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-28 23:20:26	@seelix Whoa! You mean, like treat other Twitterists like PEOPLE? It’ll never catch on.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-28 02:45:51	@hopenothate He seems deeply full of joy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-28 02:10:10	@rebeccawatson THAT is brilliant
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-28 02:08:35	@NeilDenham1978 well obviously that’s ideal, in my day they’d have been horsewhipped up The Mall.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-28 02:05:53	@telescoper you better put it forward just in case. This will help you to remember to put it back next time. #Helpful

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-28 01:58:36	@vmcdofficiel @Bonn1eGreer But but but but what if they are WRONG!!?? {faints}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-28 01:57:50	@NeilDenham1978 pay women double. If only because it will irritate people who irritate me. Equality via schadenfreude!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-27 23:28:59	@Redone68 How dare you bring that up? Those priests fucked those kids out of the kindness of their hearts or something. It was Jesuserrific.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-27 23:26:10	@LouiseRawAuthor Some miracles are beyond the powers of mere deities and/or talk show hosts/daytime legends.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-27 23:23:28	@LouiseRawAuthor @RevRichardColes I may have misunderstood Marx. Politics is not the struggle between the Undergarment and the Lingerie.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-27 22:49:22	@noodlemaz You clearly need to take yourself aside and give yourself a ruddy good tálking to.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-27 17:46:55	@paulsinha Does this make La Hopkins the Giant of the Beansealk of bringing stupidity?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-25 19:28:20	@leecronin I see it as a systemic issue. How and what are we (well, in my case, past tense) rewarded for?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-03-25 18:47:24	@leecronin To be fair it's ALWAYS been that time. I am not entirely optimistic.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-02-22 03:07:17	@OnlyInWaitrose @PaleoGould But of course! Quinoa and 4x4 salad is terribly dry without parmesan.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2016-02-15 06:57:04	@garwboy The “Saw” principle in action. But Oscar worthy? There is no room for “sensitive portrayal” let alone adversity to overcome…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-11 19:43:07	@Giliell thanks Giliell. I have. Even successfully not dead for another year. GIVE ME THINGS!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-11 17:36:39	@anandamide granted this is very unlikely to be what the study says, but I am damned if I am not going to dedicate myself to this regimen!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-11 17:35:24	@VicMetcalf_NZ OMG We’re married? I am so sorry I hadn’t noticed. I can has present?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-11 17:17:24	It am mah birfday. Am auld. Not amused. Coffee needed to reduce chances of wanton office stapler rampage.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 23:15:14	To be fair I’m so habituated to caffeine right now it’s probably nothing more than a placebo all over. But I shall make expensive wee my way
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 23:14:21	I am administering The Defibrillator (level one). I.e a double double espresso and a drink with B vits in it. Accompanied by sugary nosh.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 23:13:04	@bengoldacre I don’t know. Who have you surveyed and how did you select the cohort?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 23:12:27	I have decided two consecutive nights of less than two hours sleep is insufficient. Mind you, the hallucinations are really interesting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 21:55:23	@gdavies But your legs are getting better, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 17:52:10	@noodlemaz I shall be old. Again. There’s going to be gin and regret.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 16:46:34	@noodlemaz Happy Birthday! Only one day before mine. All the best people are born this time of year! I am not biased. I did a survey.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 16:29:19	@mmbtox if I can’t be flown 1st class to my environment conference in the Maldives and chauffeured in a Hummer no one will take me seriously
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 15:03:53	@mmbtox I’m glad someone else wonders this
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 15:01:53	@VanguardVivian We are evil. In a just universe we would be punished. BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY OF US! Mwah ha ha haaaaa
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 15:00:15	@VanguardVivian Yes. Yes we do. Some of us even light them, or have given up so entirely we just accost random strangers with our arses.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 08:20:31	@zaranosaur Or we could skip it, fire up the innuendo cannon and make feeble knob jokes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 00:02:26	@belledejour_uk @Joannechocolat get, even.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 00:01:57	@belledejour_uk @Joannechocolat …fun, useful, enjoyable, a source of great experience. Occasionally tricky to git into a standard work day
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-10 00:00:53	@belledejour_uk @Joannechocolat I definitely agree there. I would never say Twitter was low value. It’s like booze and sexual deviancy…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-09 23:58:20	@Joannechocolat @belledejour_uk although it might be a terrible sign that my cynicism gland has kicked in so early this week.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-09 23:57:41	@Joannechocolat @belledejour_uk I know. It’s actually great fun and v useful. I was amused as Twitter can be a little procrastinatory for me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-09 23:56:15	@Joannechocolat @belledejour_uk although I suspect that is the point. Cunning.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-09 23:55:29	@Joannechocolat @belledejour_uk if they do not all start with “get off Twitter it is a colossal time Hoover” then I want to know why.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 20:19:04	@bechillcomedian Jeremy Corbyn’s real name is Dolores?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 20:15:29	@DumpyStig @star_curl I am. The rumours of me being a vile tempered foul mouthed monster are lies spread by the inadequate. Bless them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 20:09:23	@DumpyStig @star_curl But but you must love who I love and hate who I hate because otherwise you are not a Good Person ™
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 20:06:40	@gravbeast Why that is an impressive halo!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 20:04:34	@star_curl A) I can't Because B) I don't In fact C) I love them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 20:03:40	@gravbeast 5 times! FIVE!!!! You are clearly either a) a saint, or b) not encountering the wanton shitlordery I am! I belive it's a).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 20:02:35	@gravbeast Satan gives better presents than Santa. Ok, the lake of eternal fire is bad, but hey, you have to take the rough with the smooth
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 20:00:12	Last Tweet: Sad face my arse. I'm proud I tell you, proud!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 19:59:37	I've sworn 86 times on Twitter, so I'm on Santa's naughty list. Sad face. Find out if you've been naughty or nice at http:// socialsanta.co/user/LouisRedux
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 19:56:31	@smithbarryc @sophiescott @TomManly1 I'm not sure what the concern is about. Which, worryingly, has caused me to make the same expression.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 19:53:07	@sophiescott @TomManly1 Concerned constipation
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:28:07	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan I now want to know how this works. Do posh cocktails get involved in the process? I loves me a posh cocktail.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:14:40	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Multitweetups! This is grand stuff.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:11:56	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Standing invitation exists, Julie. It is is known.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:10:49	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 TWEETUP! {Falls over in glee} (I do always need a pint...weird huh!? ;-) )
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:08:47	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Yeah, but he used an unmatched T-Test to get the p-value. Total joker.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:08:03	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 I am deeply sorry and can only apologise for artificially inflating the possible joy extract from abject muppets.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:07:15	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 ...are considered sufficently pulchritudinous by a statistically valid sample of men to warrant comment. p<0.001"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:06:01	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 Imagine having to give references and quote statistically meaningful data? "Oi! Oi Darling! Your mammary glands...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:04:11	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 ..."Sorry Barry, the third reviewer said that the Trevor group over the road had prior art in the area."
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:03:37	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 Street harassers would have to ask: "Dave, Dave, I was thinking of shouting at this woman about her tits..."...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:02:38	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 Exactly. Also, peer review would hold up "publication" of sexism. After all we would want to lower standards
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:01:18	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Everything, and I do mean everything, has to end with "AM DISAPPOINT! Would not bang".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:00:29	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Oh SHIT! I think I have accidentally started a movement.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 18:00:03	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan I mean, benefiting from the patriarchy and patronising women with "chill your nips" etc, it's just not good enough.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 17:59:19	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Don't get me wrong, sexism is bad, this we all know, but godammit fellow men, have some pride, be inventive at least!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 17:56:39	@Julie_B92 ...."Ooooh girl, I'd like the opportunity to disappoint you and make you question why on earth some men are total dorks".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 17:56:09	@Julie_B92 I have often thought of starting "The Campaign For Better and More Accurate Sexism" For example, street harassers could shout...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-08 17:54:52	@Julie_B92 Poor quality sexism. Would not bang. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-06 21:04:24	@Twitflup This is acceptable. Modern or 1980s version?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-06 21:00:39	@femangeI @clinteas is it bad that on first sight my instinct was to say “Aww bless your misogynist little socks” and ruffle their hair?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-06 20:58:45	@Twitflup I thought the same thing. What do I win?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-06 04:15:39	Okay which one of you made it Thursday? It was only January a week ago and I still have things to do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-04 09:37:13	I am tucking fired.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-03 15:03:29	@guardianscience without @GrrlScientist is like a fish without a…well, thing that defines fish. Look, “fish“ isn’t monophyletic okay!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-03 15:00:03	@LadyFOHF I am very sorry. It is all my fault.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-03 14:53:06	@pratt_ed @reneewebs Appropriate? In a well ordered universe: mandatory!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-02 03:20:07	I am very tired. I have work to do. I’m skipping it and sleeping to be more effective later. Why does this make me feel guilty?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-02 01:43:33	@MittenDAmour HEY! I am really offended... ...what are we talking about?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-01 20:28:38	@tessakendall At a minimum. This could revolutionise the rules.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-01 19:45:03	. @tmawsm @BBCRadio4 @gingerdisco99 Well do you want casual anal? Hmm? I thought not. Too much sloppy anal around nowadays. I blame the youth
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-01 19:33:28	@belledejour_uk I will have you know that I was morally correct about something at least a nanosecond before everyone once. I am now Jesus.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-11-01 19:32:24	@tessakendall Ah that means you need to take a Northern Approach via Bank. Stovald is clear on the matter. (ISIHAC has a lot to answer for)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-27 20:59:00	@Esteleth Very reasonable. Dangerously adult. I recommend a complete drunken bender resulting in an arrest. i.e. My standard recommendation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-27 18:01:10	@upulie I find anything statistical, or anything where there is no concrete simple cause and effect meets occasional stiff resistance.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-27 17:59:52	When did I agree to adulting? I signed no contract. I am bloody suing. (I am in coffee deficit. This is inhumane. Get me a top QC STAT)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-27 17:58:14	@belledejour_uk Read that tweet, thought "From Hell with Johnny Depp wasn't bad" realised I need coffee. Skipping coffee, moving to crack.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-25 15:03:08	Please explain why, given I have had an extra hour’s sleep, IT IS STILL TOO EARLY! I am off to get coffee and possibly swear at strangers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-25 04:20:16	@there_runsMary @Cain_Unable Only if I'm good. Oh you meant...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-25 04:18:50	@there_runsMary @Cain_Unable Lump of coal every year.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-25 04:16:35	@there_runsMary @Cain_Unable I will, frankly, take either. I am a sucker for nutmeg and pilfering.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-25 04:12:44	@Cain_Unable @there_runsMary Oh dear, I have just experienced an intimate personal moment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-25 04:11:25	@tessakendall I am afraid we can no longer be friends. Puns are the foundation of Dad Skills.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-25 02:52:35	@belledejour_uk ...hard work and good science. No Skinner Box like rituals because shit got scary.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-25 02:52:13	@belledejour_uk Ah the tales I could tell of metirc (BIZNIZ and "science"), the scale of the self delusion when all that was needed was...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-25 02:49:37	@belledejour_uk Speaking as one of the scientists lost from (that bit of) pharma (to a different bit), that is a depressingly accurate read.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-24 17:58:11	@Scientits Seems reasonable. We are pricks.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-22 06:23:36	@lgamon @reneewebs @forensictoxguy Everything else is just foreplay.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-22 06:23:18	@lgamon @reneewebs @forensictoxguy Only two tests anyone needs: X ray structure and elemental analysis. A Photo and a Purity Test! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-22 06:22:45	@forensictoxguy @reneewebs Any halfway competent synthetic chemist knows this too. How this got published as "news" is beyond me!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-22 06:17:50	@TheOnlyGuru @TrippyPip Not, technically, that that is a bad thing per se, you understand.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-22 06:17:33	@TheOnlyGuru @TrippyPip Pffft I was obviously kidding. I'd never waste time horse whipping Tory Scum (TM)... ....they'd only enjoy it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-22 06:13:56	@TheOnlyGuru We'll get to him, but there is a horde of Tory Scum (TM) to deal with first. {Narrows Eyes}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-22 02:16:28	Oh cock. I am a total work slut with the inability to say "no" and now over subscribed. That coupled with ProcrastiMagic makes things fun..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-20 19:48:32	@Sectioned_ Wait... ...objectification is GOOD? {falls over} I hope you're okay btw, that's vastly more important than web drivellers
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-20 19:47:03	Because as sure as shit it is not a "disagreement" over "humour" I don't remember the last time I harassed a comedian because I prefer puns
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-20 19:45:47	I wonder what it is that prompts folk to harass people asking not to be negatively and harmfully stereotyped regarding their mental illness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-20 19:43:14	@Sectioned_ No you are a thing on the Internet, or worse a woman, who is saying something that shrinks my peepee and hurts my ManFeeFees!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-20 17:00:10	@gravbeast That is a great idea. I may output a medium sized trilogy. With appendices!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-20 13:00:57	I am awake. Have been for two hours. Am simmering with anger (ongoing thing). Not sure how to channel it. This does not bode well.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-20 02:12:59	@tkingdoll BBBZZZZT What are "Three people I would have a foursome with that would be more funny than erotic"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-19 23:23:38	@darrylayo @lousycanuck NOOOOOOO! Oh no wait, it's actually a good thing. Phew I was worried there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-19 02:12:09	@robinince You can't say "you can't say that" on the internet! What about free speech? ;-) (And so ad infinitum)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-19 02:02:42	@Fearnecotton Wait...you're NOT the Scotland rugby union coach? But I admired you so much! {cries} ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-17 03:43:12	@there_runsMary Excelsior! (Get well soon)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-17 03:35:40	@there_runsMary Well to be fair, I've never actually cancer, ebola or AIDS despite having cancerebolaaids about twice a week for years.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-17 03:33:34	@there_runsMary Speaking as a man, and therefore a hypochondriac infant in a big meat sack, that will be the double cancerebolaaids. Always.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-16 06:19:43	@Trishie_D @robinince @ProfBrianCox Agreed. I am of the opinion that it is why The Baby Jesus invented sound Which is how that works right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-16 05:05:31	@belledejour_uk Is it wrong to have a wee man crush on him in new ripped form?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-16 05:04:49	@belledejour_uk He went from Weedy Russell to Muscle Russell overnight on my telly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 02:14:18	@david_colquhoun How long have you got to read the list?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 02:01:15	@lousycanuck That tweet needed a trigger warning for the word “bullshit”. I spoke to marketing people today and just got a flashback.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 01:59:52	@BipolarBlogger …not you. Obv. But we’re a step away from performance CBT for cash.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 01:59:18	@BipolarBlogger Someone here once told me I was paranoid for imagining a future in which govt would make welfare dependant on app adherence…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 01:57:37	@wildwalkerwoman There is no step two
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 01:57:24	@wildwalkerwoman It’s worryingly easy. Step 1) think like a selfish turd who is ideologically opposed to recognising their impact on others
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 01:51:12	@wildwalkerwoman Admirable cost saving exercise Saves govt having to do it Shit I just accidentally channelled actual Tory policy didn’t I?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 01:46:48	@the_author_ Hey! You’re criticising one of my best talents!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 01:45:20	@ProfFrancesca It’s true. Needs changing. But am I alone in finding it hilarious that the article is written by A. Gentleman? Bloody men!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 01:43:00	@LiberalIsland Come on, we both know the kippers heard “aliens” and thought “illegal aliens coming over here… must be true”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 01:41:23	@DaveDogFacedBoy @Herring1967 okay so it’s pretty much how cults can start, but it’ll be a good ride whilst it lasts.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 01:40:24	@DaveDogFacedBoy Is @Herring1967 Cheddar’s most famous son? I think, if not, he should be made so via a campaign of re-educating the public.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-14 01:31:59	@GeorgeTakei Some days, George? Actually I suppose one must rise for cocktails. It’s so wearisome!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-13 20:33:59	@Julie_B92 I have always wanted to have my research confronted by an angry mob with torches and pitchforks. You know you've made it then.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-13 19:56:10	@Julie_B92 if the experiment is not some Frankenstein thing to make you someone to look after you I will has disappoint.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-13 19:26:46	@Julie_B92 OMG!! Man Flu (TM) is the worst thing in the world. Get home immediately and expect everyone to wait on you hand and foot!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-13 19:23:35	@Julie_B92 ...persisting in the face of adversity like a proper human (I.e. Not like me with a minor sniffle)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-13 19:23:02	@Julie_B92 You have my sympathy. Does your cold manifest itself as Man Flu (TM) even though you are of the Lady Persuasion? Or are you...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-13 18:39:00	I am sufficiently tired that I think some blood has accidentally entered my caffeine stream.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-13 17:46:51	@tessakendall Cue outraged men saying they only read it for the {ahem} articles.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-13 17:08:42	@stavvers @BipolarBlogger we've all slept with someone and regretted it, then carried on doing it because it seemed rude not to. Allegedly
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-13 16:58:08	@BipolarBlogger @stavvers Hahahaha! I'd never thought of it that way. Women:marry the first man you meet. Wait, people actually say that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-13 16:56:56	@MCeeP @alisonatkin This is nonsense. I could have been bollocked by my martinet of a supervisor any day I liked during my PhD. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-13 16:55:52	@stavvers "I changed my mind on the basis of evidence" "You utter bastard" "Erm. What now?"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-12 17:06:00	@EmmaKennedy Say it ain't so!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-12 17:01:05	@tauriqmoosa Fuck elves. They're the REAL privileged ones. What about orcs? Ugly, smelly. No elf will date them. That's REAL oppression.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-12 09:07:50	@WhySharksMatter Mu…mum? Is that you? Phew! It’s just sexism and excusing sexual harassment you’re referring to. I thought mum had got me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-12 09:04:49	@niais A-and I mean this with some venom-fucking-men! This bullshit gets in the way of the science in every aspect.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-12 05:33:52	@helenzaltzman Clearly a conspiracy at work. Space Lizards, Bilderberg or both?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-12 05:29:43	@HorzaEdeo @FluffCustard @sodslawyer ZOMG U GUISE! Your ears are like… {sound of gunshot} …ok that was mean but my ear is totally… {BANG}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-12 05:26:02	@RevRichardColes Since I lack context for this tweet I can only assume your local WI has knocked up more of their LSD jam. #MoreTeaVicar
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-12 05:21:55	@DrHughHarvey @KarenJBateson Pfft doctors aren’t caring. Not like that nice Ian Duncan Smith… …wait…oh poo it’s the other way around again.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-12 05:19:55	@robinince Dirty lefty BBC. I bet if we find space aliens they’ll be nice to them and campaign to let them in. With their alien ways.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 21:10:45	Dear Twitter, my name is Louis and I am a Procrastinator. But I still love you. We can still be friends, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 21:09:21	@AmandaMarcotte I have the same mantra with books. Both mantras are lies! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 21:08:49	@TrippyPip I'm off to cook the dinner before I start enjoying myself. #OneKnowsOnesPlace
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 21:06:01	@TrippyPip Now really, did you expect that to discourage me? You know my answer is "Go for it, just call me a very naughty boy during"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 21:03:12	@TrippyPip Don't be silly. When I am Glorious Leader, I won't put Tories in camps I will have already killed you all. MWA HA HAAA! Whoops
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 17:47:29	@matt9dawson Good choice. Also Josh Lewsey?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 17:33:51	@Julie_B92 Well the first three are definitely true. "Modest" needs modifying with "Undoubted future Nobel Laureate".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 17:31:03	@Julie_B92 Well speaking as a fashion icon... ...which I am not qualified to do, both!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 17:30:07	@Julie_B92 Big fan of your work. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 17:25:56	@WelshDalaiLama ...cometh the tan? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 17:20:52	@TrippyPip Crucifixion's too good for 'em.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-11 17:17:59	@MittenDAmour We've all been that high on a Sunday morning. Don't bring his buzz down. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 06:21:57	@Julie_B92 Shhhh don't let on but neither do I.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 03:47:58	Speaking of biscuits, I'm off to get into that bikini.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 03:46:20	@chemstructbio They are called "undergraduates" and I have met them. ;-) (Old joke is old)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 03:45:01	Okay, mostly biscuits. I'm not a monster.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 03:44:38	More as in "a greater number of" not "folk who are more interesting" I follow v interesting people Except you. I follow you for biscuits
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 03:42:01	Granted they are not related, but both are true. The only beneift of fame and fortune is Twitter would let me follow more interesting folk.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 03:40:31	I have performed a Twitter purge. I feel awful but I have learned something valuable: I look terrible in a bikini.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 01:21:38	@fuzz_walk @debecca He put his winkle in a pig you know. Just thought I'd remind everyone
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 01:19:53	@fuzz_walk I'm not sure I DO keep up!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 01:19:35	@debecca @fuzz_walk And Bex, if you think I could EVER forget you, you're so wrong it's nearly the wrongest thing ever!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 01:18:59	@debecca @fuzz_walk Bloody lies! I am just on here about 1% of the time I used to be. Changed jobs in Feb/Mar, no hiding place! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 01:16:32	@fuzz_walk The annoying part is that I know I followed every single person for a very good reason. I can't remember them all, but still
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 00:53:12	@LadyFOHF You're a monster I barely recognise you...etc ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 00:52:25	@LadyFOHF Oh good, well now I have permission... ...is it okay to unfollow Stephen Fry? Not that I would, it's just a moral conundrum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 00:47:13	Is it wrong that I need a Twitter clean up and feel colossally guilty about it in advance?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 00:38:02	@DanielSandison They just look deeply flatulent.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-10 00:36:32	@AllAboutTrans @bbceastenders @ParisLees Bloody trans people coming over here stealing trans jobs from cis people.. ..wait..oh CONGRATS!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-08 23:13:44	KNICKERS!!! (There exists a subset of days that really only can be improved by shouting "knickers". I am in an office and thus not allowed)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-08 21:19:15	@bengoldacre There is only one solution: Develop The Fear. Drugs can only get one so far.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-07 19:38:25	@drugmonkeyblog I will have you know that seeing a lecture by EJ that one time practically makes me a Nobellist myself, sirrah! {harrumph}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-07 19:22:46	@LadyFOHF Holy shit! I take it you are getting drivel from unpleasant persons.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-07 18:36:33	@ChrisMaslanka @SellaTheChemist @AdamRutherford @stuartcantrill We must propitiate them lest they inflict us with X factor style funding.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-07 18:34:45	@SellaTheChemist @AdamRutherford @stuartcantrill I see the umpteenth annual Nobel Ruck is on again I approve. Should have gone to Sharpless!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 07:14:03	@srhbutts It’s only speaking when they do it. Because Disagree-O-Noise cancels Freedom or something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 07:03:06	@IronMaiden @Anthrax @mggtTaylor Christ, haven’t you shifted all those cases of Trooper yet? I’ve been doing my best

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 06:36:31	@david_colquhoun @LabourEoin Call me a cynical old conspiratorialist, but I wonder where many Tory votes originate and where they don't.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 06:34:11	.."Fucking Interesting" (That is a scholarly, academic description) 3) I discovered a kid I was at school with is a humanties prof. Legend!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 06:29:05	Okay I won't. But I may give you funny looks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 06:28:46	I have decided being an adult is hard. I blame all of you for making it look easy. I'll sue, I'll bloody sue. Don't think I won't.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 06:28:07	I wonder when I am going to stop being so fucking tired that I can actually enjoy things I normally enjoy and be productive in a normal way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 06:21:58	@WhySharksMatter I torture puppies to vent my rage too... ...oh you meant...whoops! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 05:49:44	@AbiWilks Noticied? They're positively encouraging it! It's the plan.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 05:08:05	@belledejour_uk There are a lot of very highly motivated utter scum bags who want to believe this particular scum bag is innocent. Hmmm.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 04:42:24	@TheQuinnspiracy No. Sign, then start counter petition to suppress the 1st one as infringing free speech. Then start another to counter that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 03:33:04	I see by perusing Twitter that the shitlords of the internet are defending Ched "Convicted Rapist" Evans again. Well I'm suprised.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 03:28:53	@anandamide Laugh? I've just been divorced by my wife for bellowing during her teleconference. THAT, my friend, is laughter! :-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 03:23:25	@pzmyers It's been done. It's also massively discriminatory. (But I imagine you are making of the joke no? I have heard of this "Hugh Moor")

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 03:17:56	@cpeedell Call me old fashioned but I rather prefer for someone's broken leg to be healed BEFORE I kick the crutches out. Apply to economy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-06 03:14:36	I see Tory policy re: social security is still the same as that of a quack who believes a solid kick in the bollocks is a cure for ball pain

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-04 18:50:25	@sarahditum I know! Someone should have mentioned this. Possibly in a special Guardian supplement.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-04 18:48:09	@sarahditum I am actually genuinely afraid my son might one day grow up and decide to vote Tory.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-04 18:10:39	@Scientits I'm seeing only option 1 as a possible save on the boyfriend dice roll!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-04 18:10:19	@Scientits Protestations? "No! You're too good looking!" or "No! You're a minger!" or "No! I somehow have a say in your actions!"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-04 18:06:27	@AdamRutherford And yes, that wasn't a good description of Hamilton's rule, but it fit in 140.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-04 18:06:02	@AdamRutherford Is the cost of this photo sufficiently outweighed by benefit of us seeing it to be altruistic given we're not related?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-04 05:36:48	@Julie_B92 That’s not nice. I would not cheer an NZ loss. Tsk.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-04 05:34:40	@Julie_B92 That is less than a bruise. I refuse to apologise. You were beastly about England losing. Beastly.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-10-04 05:00:35	@Julie_B92 Mild discomfort, nothing more. A momentary feeling of unease, that passes.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-21 16:09:22	@arobertwebb Truth in pigfuckery is an important and well historied journalistic imperative
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-21 15:56:18	@star_curl Phrasing is similar to that of source. David Hameron fucked a dead pig, the swine, is much more common! :-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-21 15:39:35	@Esteleth They have roles where a player directs the game, but I think armchair qb-img really captures something. A know nothing self…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-21 15:36:59	@Herring1967 @NoWayOfSnowing Very true. But it is much weirder if it was a bollock.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-21 15:31:30	@RossMcCaff @youngvulgarian There are many serious points to #baeofpigs . To be fair they are all overshadowed by the hilarity. Rightly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-21 15:28:55	@Xanthe_Cat That’s very much my view. One, or hopefully both, of them are going to have a rough week.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-21 15:03:16	@auntysarah To be fair “I stuck my tadger in a dead pig’s mouth” is going to be a tough confession.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-21 08:42:25	@MitchBenn I mean, honour amongst thieves, sure. But honour among pig fuckers? There’s a reason that’s not an aphorism.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-21 08:41:38	@MitchBenn To be fair, if you’re a member of a club dedicated to pig fucking rules aren’t the problem. Even though I get the reference.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 19:03:27	@kcldav43 @RealNatalieRowe {Sigh} Evidence of past drug use etc is not evidence of current drug use.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 19:00:51	@kcldav43 I don't need to make things up about the Tories to criticise them. What they demonstrably do and their policies are enough.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 18:59:39	@kcldav43 I'm not defending him (or myself). I'm just not taking your assertions and condemnation at face value. There's a difference.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 18:51:01	@kcldav43 If there is evidence he is taking cocaine NOW, that's a different ball game.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 18:50:42	@kcldav43 I'm generally not a fan of serious investigations into people's pasts unless deeply needed. This doesn't pass that test in my view
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 18:48:10	@kcldav43 Anyway, this is getting me dangerously close to defending Osbourne...which is making me feel dirty!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 18:47:07	@kcldav43 No. I am saying that dose and frequency determines effect. Pretty basic pharmacology.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 18:39:44	@kcldav43 And given that I worked in drug discovery for twenty years, I don't need a lecture on cocaine pharmacology. Thanks though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 18:39:05	@kcldav43 I think a chancellor that has the views he has is a probem. His drug taking is almost irrelevant. I have no evidence it's current

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 17:45:37	Is it big and clever if, after ~1 hr reading news stories on Twitter, the desire to drink heavily and swear at passers by is overwhelming?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 17:41:30	@ThePoke @LouiseRawAuthor Word.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-20 17:41:08	@gravbeast Agreed. The flying pigs, talking dogs, Dali-esque landscapes did nothing. I'm a verteran Working iTunes? Too far, acid. Too far

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-19 17:58:02	@stevyncolgan That is remarkably diplomatic and polite.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-19 17:57:42	@chiller I try very very hard to be. I am an infrequently lapsed pacifist. Just occasionally I believe people would enjoy a mass uprising.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-19 17:31:39	@chiller Okay, I'll see you a Boris and raise you an IDS?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-19 17:29:55	@stevyncolgan It is possible I have plumped for The Comic Untruth. One does not read the Daily Mail. Nor permit decent folk nearby to do so
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-19 17:26:21	@chiller Coffee: yes. Bacon: working on it, there isn't any and am currently sulking about potential shop visit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-19 17:25:22	@chiller They're a great idea... ...wait BORIS gets to use them? I thought it was "Use them on Boris". Oh no no no. Not having THAT.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-14 03:40:49	@bengoldacre I've heard Jeremy Corbyn is after our kids and pets. He plans to sacrifice them to bring about the reign of The Old Ones.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-10 04:12:27	@Julie_B92 As in “non-vagina joke making generally speaking”, there’s another meaning?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-10 04:11:10	@Julie_B92 I have genuinely no idea. It did amuse me that this was trending amongst otherwise sane people
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-10 04:10:06	@Julie_B92 I’m not entirely sure. I’m guessing it’s great British bake off joke tag because some TV person said something accidentally funny
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-10 03:49:30	That is an enormous cherry! #VaginaOrCake
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-10 03:48:10	I appear to have accidentally filled it with batter. #vaginaorcake
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-10 03:42:30	@DannyJohnJules I’m pretty sure the racists are clear on their point that all lives matter only when someone mentions black lives matter.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-10 03:39:19	@ThatSabineGirl FLEEEE! You’re only two clicks from the really bad country and western section. You know, the bad kind.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-10 03:31:01	@stevyncolgan First tweet I see today and I’m confused and impressed. I mean, that’s a hell of a shop if nothing else.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-09 12:44:55	Good News: My first year of OU study is finished Bad News: I'm not up early, I'm up late, and due in work in a couple of hours #allnighter
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 17:36:22	@MooseAllain You arty types with your...your...your work...and output and stuff. How dare you try and enrich the culture!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 17:15:02	@AdamRutherford @edyong209 @matthewcobb @johnhawks @aoifemcl Oh I hope it works. The word is deeply underused.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 15:58:56	@TheMichaelRock @g3reth OMG NO THERE ISN'T WHAT ARE YOU A PAEDO!?! {Obvious joke is obvious}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 15:58:29	@g3reth Ha! In lieu of anything practical or, you know, actually helpful.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 15:56:26	@g3reth The very best of luck! I don't know what to say, the situation is so bloody awful that remote solidarity is all I can offer.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 15:52:19	@TomChivers It should be hounded across the land without relent until it is heartily sorry.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 15:51:19	@endless_psych Yeah. We unfamous scientists need paying gigs too... ...I've missed the point haven't I? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 15:49:50	@g3reth They're trying pretty flipping hard (and with some success) to cause a number of us to die. The law will not be needed with this DWP
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 15:48:38	@biotweeps This is Twitter. Be afraid...be very afraid! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 15:47:42	@biotweeps We're going to read about jizz aren't we? There will be jokes. Not from me. I am way to mature. Honest. Okay maybe some jokes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 15:46:29	@TomChivers I approve of this vest.... ...as long as the vest won the episode. I have no time for loser vests. #Standards

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 15:43:56	@OUstudents There was a time when days were free, when I played weekends, and had no assignments, I dreamed a dream of another degree...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 15:10:10	@ehdannyboy Luxury! In my day we had to call them from the hall phone, woo them with The Two Ronnies, and all we had to drink was Advocaat.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 05:14:29	@tkingdoll @JonathanHaynes Quite. I mean reading and retweeting Daily Mail articles is just stupid. The other things is too, obviously. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-08 05:11:14	@VanguardVivian For fuck’s sake, you’re always going off at tangents… {gets coat}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-07 18:06:44	@belledejour_uk Can it come after Thursday? I have a Pilates class paid for and the Johnsons are coming for dinner, Ocado is already booked
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-05 18:00:34	@robinince But keeping the arsenic, belladonna, aflatoxin laden peanut butter, and Daily Mail articles? I mean, one must have some toxins.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-05 17:57:25	@Mark_Cassell @orzelc This is the 2nd time this morning this has appeared in my TL. Okay okay, I'm taking the hint and getting on with work!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-05 17:54:17	@CCriadoPerez {Use of the words "leotard" and "studio" in the previous tweet demonstrate I am up on the lingo and down with the kids.}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-05 17:53:25	@CCriadoPerez How does one do this "accidentally"? Were you walking along in a leotard and tripped into an open yoga studio?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-05 17:50:27	@marcuschown "Doubts" doesn't quite cover it! Outright disbelief is pretty mild too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-05 17:35:36	@almurray Being anti-smoking makes one a Nazi? Well I never. That and vegetarianism. I better lay off the shit watercolours whilst I'm at it

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-05 16:14:19	@MikeBenchCapon @gravbeast This makes me wonder if there is one on "gullible" though... {Looks at the Stanford Enclopedia anyway!}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-05 15:14:10	@Mark_Cassell @AcademiaObscura It worries me that the tactics used by this lady are pretty much the only way to get me going some days.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-05 13:58:35	@MittenDAmour Boxy, attached to a mattress and potentially capable of providing covenient and impressive storage?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-03 20:38:36	@anandamide well to be fair it does if you take enough of it. You and I would call that death by toxic psilocybin dose, but, well... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-03 20:34:01	@belledejour_uk I'm presuming this refers to refugees and not an enthusiastic call for sexual excess. Obviously either is right and proper.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-03 03:44:05	@TheAngryFangirl I have seen, erm, some {ahem} "documentary videos" on the internet. THEY ARE REAL! THEY ARE! THEY ARE! Ok they're not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-03 03:43:50	@bloodonthedice @BestoftheMail When you set the bar THAT low...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-03 03:42:26	@BestoftheMail Point of Order: Assumes Mailicious Dailytwit can use words to start with. Mostly they just mash their faces on the screen.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-03 03:16:50	@LadyFOHF Could the value of my shares increase as well as decrease? #TrenchantAnalysis
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-03 03:13:06	@paulcoxon You are an inhumane monster. How I envy you. I shall sit on this spike and be subjected to the sound of Hanson/Jedward fusion
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-02 15:56:08	I don't struggle to find humanity in a refugee. I must confess I struggle to find humanity in xenophobes who think this crisis is palatable.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-02 15:52:54	I saw photos of the bodies of drowned children. Their only "crime" was to hope for a life of less oppression and horror. We must help.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-02 15:49:23	@carlgardner that is impressive lunacy. And not the good kind!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-02 03:37:34	@katebevan @mjrobbins Insert jokes about making money hand over fist, no extra-curricular activity, and citing previous job as a wanker.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-01 22:11:38	@kmeisner @scalzi I've always felt that the best response is "you catch even more with shit. What's your point?"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-01 22:11:03	I want to say "Riker? I hardly knew her!" In the office and then laugh. It's not the best compulsion I've had. The monotony is killing me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-01 20:26:57	@Kaessa The fee is pretty much just the crisps, a space to watch the TV from, and incidental hearing loss from guttural sobbing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-01 17:59:36	@Kaessa I offer a Procrastinatory Desk Service. I come and look at your desk, cry inside, and eat crisps whilst watching TV box sets.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-01 01:36:57	I'm not kidding. My desk is clean and clear and the books on it are neatly arranged and I looked at them for over a second. Without crying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-09-01 01:36:18	I have made a steak and Stilton pie. I have achieved mild to moderate adulting on a day of Procrastination. I have also looked at some work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 22:26:32	@noodlemaz It's definitely not helping. I may have a shave to boost motivation. Stubble length is correlated with slacking for me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 22:21:35	@debecca Holy shit! Snap that one up immediately, he's a keeper! Or, you know, the total opposite.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 22:19:01	@stevyncolgan But I'll do that wearing a smoking jacket. In the classical tradition.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 22:18:38	@stevyncolgan In honour of today's piece in the Graun I shall not watch it, declare it shite, and bemoan the foolishness of all who love it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 22:13:53	@noodlemaz Pffft, I wish I'd achieved THAT much today.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 22:13:08	@scalzi I am so with you. I'm really trying not to be with you on this, but I am failing like a beast.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 21:13:10	@drg1985 Wait. Little Englanders are surely going to be reinforced by this. After all opposing what Germans do is second nature.... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 20:42:46	@tkingdoll Self proclaimed or touted by Guardian columnist as a contrast to other popular skeptics/game devs/columnists etc?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 20:27:00	@AdamRutherford You monster! Please accept this cheque for your controversial opinions that you have to schedule in a national publication.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 20:25:30	@ChessPiano @AdamRutherford @Skepticat_UK Is that what your homoeopathic overlords told you to say? Are you in the pay of Big Spine?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 20:24:28	@jennycolgan Oh bugger, now that is sadly very, very true. In all the comic mockery of Jones, that note is painfully accurate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 20:22:51	@LondonSkeptics I KNEW you were going to tweet that. #OldJokesAreStillOld .
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 20:20:59	@AdamRutherford @Skepticat_UK Pffff it's not a Jewish lie. That's what the Space Lizards WANT you to think.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 20:11:23	. @perayahmet @LabourLeft Reading? If it's not good enough for Pratchett books, why is it good enough for political opinions? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 20:04:04	@quantick Terry Pratchett was best mates with Osama Bin Laden apparently.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 20:02:02	Del Boy falling through the bar is as over rated as the joke in A Comedy of Errors. I mean, two people looking like each other? Pft!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 19:51:39	I've realised my nerd rage at some muppet wanking on about his view of Pratchett's work is distracting me from raging about major issue X.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 19:50:06	@gimpyblog All of them. Clearly. I mean I've never read them*, but why does that have any bearing on the matter? *I have really. Shhh.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 19:48:44	@tauriqmoosa It is SO clearly all your fault. Bad Tauriq! BAD! Go and think about the articles you've never read. Or even written.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 19:47:26	@mePadraigReidy I've got a fiver for a multipage spread on the virtues of my 6 year old son's pottery as compared to that of Jennifer Lee.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 19:42:27	@mjrobbins Would you mind not undermining the basis for my incoming multi-tweet nerd rage quite so accurately before the event? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 19:41:52	@somegreybloke I rendered Jones' surname incorrectly as "Johnson" It's just I am unused to something so stupid not coming out of a Johnson.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 19:33:26	@somegreybloke I know. I was paraphrasing my skim of your quote! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 19:31:42	@tauriqmoosa I disagree and I find your views reprehensible on several issues. Issues that for some reason I cannot quite specify right now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 19:29:30	@Missskitttin @LadyFOHF I mean, me? Not picking nits on the Twinternet? I must be ill. I blame the Guardian.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 19:28:40	@Missskitttin @LadyFOHF Good point, thought something similar but wasn't in the mood to pick that sizeable nit...WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-31 19:24:54	@somegreybloke @LadyFOHF I didn't bother to read it. I just know that Johnathon Jones can't even aspire to mediocrity.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-30 22:08:33	@gorskon "I've written many studies" = worthy, if a bit willy waving, boast. "I've read..." = silly, but still credible. "I tweet..." = no

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-29 20:10:13	@SkyHelpTeam The end riff is definitely not from The Who. It's reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's "Since I've Been Lovin' You", but not quite...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-29 19:41:25	@SkyHelpTeam Brilliant! Thanks, that's definitely the first part. The end of the ad features a high pitched guitar riff which also eludes me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-29 04:30:30	@tauriqmoosa I actually want to be a woman just so I can get pleasure from not dating this person. Curse my vague heterosexuality.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-23 18:50:39	@BipolarBlogger I think it's serious. a) It's the Speccie, and b) Tories of a certain kidney have been fantasising about Mrs T for a while.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-23 18:46:50	@TrippyPip @TheOnlyGuru I could balance things up a tad by making remarks that could cause dropping of sausage sandwich. I live to serve.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-23 18:09:44	@LadyFOHF What worries me is I think that (if you reverse the sexes) that was Tory economic policy under Thatcher.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-16 20:56:18	@Redone68 I know! But do I get rewards, recognition, just one small parade? Nope. Nothing. Not even a Nobel Peace Prize. It's discrimination
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-16 20:24:52	@Redone68 You even follow me and I'm so liberal I even have conservative friends. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-16 06:52:26	@pzmyers Okay, I've never actually tried it. I avoid reunions like the plague. But I reckon it's solid.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-15 18:13:28	@leftoutside @LadyFOHF I see our chums at the Mail are abandoning all pretence they are not racist scum. Oh wait, they did that a while ago
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-15 17:59:50	@stavvers Perfectly reasonable. I'm out £2000 in public disorder fines. Cheques are okay. That bit with the souffle was risky

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-08-07 18:52:41	@andy_nortcliffe @Stevium @RealTimeChem Although the cerium stain does it too.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-10 16:35:04	@sophiescott Twitter is our unrelenting Mistress, Queen of our psyches and Empress of our Ids. That or a computer crack habit. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-10 15:12:16	Those last RTs? This. So many times this. As if class or verbal fluency indicate mental well being.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-10 06:11:40	@Dr_PaulC Very generous. Surely anyone under 450 erred in voting for Tories. Policies last considered progressive in the late 1500s.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-10 06:07:14	@FluffCustard Why waste good eggs? Or for that matter good shit? One large bloke with a medium sized hammer could do all that was needed.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-06 00:48:38	@Julie_B92 I do need a few spares.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-06 00:47:15	@Julie_B92 I would speculate but I have used up this week's ration of the word "fuck".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-06 00:46:11	@MarkCollyerReal @TheOnlyGuru @fantasticpru Modesty prevents me from disclosing.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-06 00:38:25	@TheOnlyGuru @MarkCollyerReal @fantasticpru Depends, if you heard requests for #NorkPix it happened. It was the Vicar though.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-06 00:16:25	@TheOnlyGuru @fantasticpru @MarkCollyerReal An gril? With huge #norks ? Of course I would never approve. Erm, out of curiosity, where?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-06 00:13:05	@TheOnlyGuru @fantasticpru @MarkCollyerReal I have never tweeted. I only occasionally bark.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-05 22:16:25	@TheOnlyGuru @MarkCollyerReal I’m terribly sorry. It was the malign influence of nearby vicars what done it. Mind you, it was a cracker.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-05 20:08:54	@TheOnlyGuru @MarkCollyerReal @TrippyPip I did time there. A camping weekend. I do not speak of it in polite company.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-05 19:49:11	@TheOnlyGuru @MarkCollyerReal @TrippyPip I have nothing against a woman displaying her charms. Unfortunately I know nothing else about her.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-05 19:47:34	@TheOnlyGuru @MarkCollyerReal @TrippyPip Sotring up credit. There's a terribly nice brewery weekender on the horizon.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-05 19:46:52	@MarkCollyerReal @TheOnlyGuru @TrippyPip Tragically the wrong kind of slack. She never appeared. Hoping for moral slackness, I got profesh.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-05 19:45:57	@TheOnlyGuru @MarkCollyerReal This reminds me, an earlier tweet of yours and @TrippyPip made me look up this Danczuk woman. Deary me!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-07-01 05:01:29	@Julie_B92 This is true but you have to admit a well regulated, validated human production process would help. Possibly involving clipboards

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:28:55	@Shermertron @CarlieP …apparently agin you in some matter. Which is what I guess I am. Although fucked if I know, you’re a rando to me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:27:43	@Shermertron @CarlieP …the case. What you seem to be incapable of grasping is any nuance, any context or the fact that even those who are…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:27:02	@Shermertron @CarlieP …support that. Just like it’s {gasp} pretty decent of people to support an innocent man clear his name. If that’s…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:26:21	@Shermertron @CarlieP ….they believed was on the wrong end of (what appeared to be) further harassment. It’s pretty decent of people to…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:25:45	@Shermertron @CarlieP …claimed harassed them. At worst, this means that the claims wee false. People were still supporting someone…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:25:08	@Shermertron @CarlieP …message about people supporting a person who was trying to defend themselves from a litigant, a litigant who they…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:24:22	@Shermertron @CarlieP …isn’t (because I have yet to do any due diligence I admit) it means I replied to a friend’s tweet with a positive…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:23:41	@Shermertron @CarlieP Either way, if your interpretation (and it is an interpretation) is valid, and honestly I see little reason why it…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:22:58	@Shermertron @CarlieP Might matter more to me if I retweeted the accusations don’t you think?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:21:22	@Shermertron @CarlieP …and used to comment there. If he’s a shit, he’s a shit, if he’s a saint, he’s a saint. It’s utterly irrelevant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:20:37	@Shermertron @CarlieP What acknowledgement? talk to PZ! I couldn’t give less of a shit what he does. I read the bloke’s blog occasionally…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:19:29	@Shermertron @CarlieP …rifts and inter blog wars all you like. you’re nothing more than tiresomely irrelevant. I’ve got sleep to do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:18:32	@Shermertron @CarlieP …even operating in a reality I recognise. And to be blunt, you’re projecting wildly. You fuck ups can have you…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:17:56	@Shermertron @CarlieP …seriously at the best of times, but when you wank on about things like “enemies” you’re just shot away. You’re not…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:17:12	@Shermertron @CarlieP …flailing about trying to demonstrate something that isn’t happening. I mean, it’s pretty hard to take you clowns…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:16:12	@Shermertron @CarlieP The problem you have is, at least speaking purely for myself, you don’t know what I “believed” or didn’t and are …
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:14:58	@Shermertron @CarlieP Actually yes it does. I’ve always hated the “page 17, bottom paragraph retraction”.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:07:14	@Shermertron @CarlieP Did I say I know she lied? Or did you? Context seems to elude you. You’re not good at gotcha.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:05:09	@Shermertron @CarlieP …should be taken seriously now. Both require investigation, and in both cases the truth may never be known.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:04:10	@Shermertron @CarlieP Equivocating on belief again I see. I believed her accusations should be taken seriously then, I believe her words…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:01:08	@CarlieP @Shermertron accuser provisionally and encourage a full investigation of the accusations. Some distant blogger? Pff same every time
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 08:00:25	@CarlieP @Shermertron If someone accused even a beloved and close family member of rape/assault/harassment I would indeed believe the…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:59:41	@CarlieP @Shermertron Which is the second point that needs making. We’re not comparing like with like. But if it helps you Shermertron:
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:58:49	@Shermertron @CarlieP Not sure that’s true. I know nothing about Jason’s case, but if memory serves PZ’s case was investigated by his uni.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:57:48	@Shermertron @CarlieP After a civil suit. Not the same thing as a criminal case. It means they settled and that was the agreed wording.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:57:07	@Shermertron @CarlieP Good point. I’ll pick a better word.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:56:48	@Shermertron @CarlieP Nope. I’m not saying anything of the kind. Just following your…erm…”logic”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:55:56	@Shermertron @CarlieP Incidentally, I hope he *IS* exonerated, because of obvious reasons.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:54:28	@Shermertron @CarlieP Hmmm were police involved in the Radford case? Not that I remember. These were civil suits. So BR is not exonerated?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:49:56	@Shermertron @CarlieP Haha. Well done.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:48:47	@CarlieP @Shermertron It’s the standard game of gotcha, Carlie. There’s neither wit nor good faith from this tit to make a dialogue.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:47:13	@Shermertron @CarlieP …were already demonstrated as being false by the time I ever heard about them. So the situation is not the same.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:46:47	@Shermertron @CarlieP I didn’t say that. I’m saying that I found out about them after both men were exonerated. I.e. Both accusations…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:43:27	@Shermertron @CarlieP Haha no! I’m saying that when I found out about these incidents they were long over.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:41:57	@Shermertron @CarlieP Had the cases come to light at the time (and not after they were well over) then YES! Is that hard to imagine?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:41:15	@CarlieP @Shermertron And I’ll second that entirely. Bayes. Balance of probability. What are these things?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:40:15	@Shermertron @CarlieP I’m… {takes off sunglasses} …sceptical of this version of events.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:38:18	@Shermertron @CarlieP …who she claimed to be her harasser/assaulted. That’s a big difference.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:37:51	@Shermertron @CarlieP No. I was saying it was decent of people to donate to a fund for a woman defending herself from being sued by someone…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:37:08	@Shermertron @CarlieP The sun shines on every dog's arse one day. And that's if I credit your interpretation (hint: not entirely sure I do)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:35:43	@Shermertron @CarlieP Replying to a tweet is spreading accusations? Gosh.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:35:09	@Shermertron @CarlieP Physician heal thyself.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:33:01	@CarlieP @Shermertron I was wondering exactly this. I’m guessing a certain group of people have found people yet to have blocked them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:31:59	@Shermertron @CarlieP The thing you and your chums miss, is that that has been the situation all along, straw aside of course.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:31:30	@Shermertron @CarlieP …yes, that accusers need support and that involves prima facie “belief”. But not uncritically so. Trust but verify.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:30:37	@Shermertron @CarlieP Nope. Mainly because you’re equivocating about what is meant by “believe”in this case. Given the context I think…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:29:06	@Shermertron @CarlieP One swallow does not a summer make, one falsity does not a systemic, statistically demonstrable prejudice overturn.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:27:43	@Shermertron @CarlieP …And yes, if KS lied this would be a great example of a false accusation. And false accusations demonstrably happen.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:26:51	@Shermertron @CarlieP …such as it is (if memory serves there were a few unambiguously slimy things done in service of his pursuit of KS)…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:25:20	@Shermertron @CarlieP BTW I’ve got no problem with being wrong. If Stolznow has lied (rather than been browbeaten into a statement via…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:09:13	@Shermertron @CarlieP …that’s a pretty serious injustice isn’t it? One that would need addressing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:08:37	@Shermertron @CarlieP …always clear at first glance. It’s not beyond the realm of possibility that it is as it appears, in which case…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:07:10	@Shermertron @CarlieP Nope. I don’t believe *any* accusation. Oh balls, why am I bothering with an obvious game of gotcha? Thanks for…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:05:38	@Shermertron @CarlieP Also, didn’t the final bit of the statement say something about knocking all this crap off? Why @people in? Odd.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:04:33	@Shermertron @CarlieP @BTRadford No. I’m saying I would need to go away, read around, find my own sources etc. Not believe unsolicited rando
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:03:43	@Shermertron @CarlieP Ah I see. So this *IS* a point scoring exercise. Interesting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:02:04	@Shermertron @CarlieP Not clamming up, just not taking your word. Different.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 07:01:02	@Shermertron @CarlieP Very pleased for you. As I said, I’ll do my own work thanks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 06:58:59	@Shermertron @CarlieP And yet curiously you didn’t read or acknowledge the last paragraph of it. Let me guess, point scoring? Not interested
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 06:56:57	@Shermertron @CarlieP …I follow the directions of randoms trawling old tweets.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 06:56:23	@Shermertron @CarlieP …then shame on her etc. My cynicism around all this knows no bounds though. I’ll hunt my own sources out before…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-29 06:55:18	@Shermertron @CarlieP I confess I haven’t seen much of this stuff recently, the little I have seen doesn’t say what you claim. If it does…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 07:11:09	@ArianeSherine @BDStanley Minimum. I suggest demonstrations with finger puppets and shadows. Sound effects okay too. No Pythonesque demos.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 07:07:14	@ArianeSherine Quick! The Diagrams! The Embarrassing Talk! The Mental Scarring of a Child!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 07:03:54	@Jo_Caulfield the bride of Chucky is a) nicer, and b) eminently more reasonable intellectually. Rally once again trumps horror.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 07:01:55	@JohnFinnemore no longer plagued by l’esprit d’escalier, our top comedians are now hammered by l’prior art de Twitter. I sympathise.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:56:07	@pzmyers I very rarely bother to dislike someone, let alone someone I have never met. Milo is the holotype of people I despise at a distance
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:53:48	@LadyFOHF I AM INNOCENT!!! Oh. You meant someone else. As you were. {nonchalant whistle}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:52:47	@andiosho ah yes, the ratchet of progress three steps forward,two frustrating ones back.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:52:08	@ImprobableJoe Well, I’m not a racist. I have some standards. Some of my best friends are Martians
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:51:37	@ThrupennyBit I will, of course return the favour by updating the universe via #ScrotPimple Shit, I said that out loud didn’t I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:50:35	@ImprobableJoe PC Nazi leftist Stalinist fascist misandrists if you please. Why pick the lesser of two evils after all?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:49:52	@andiosho not the most erudite answer, for which I can only logistics. But true.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:49:29	@andiosho because when it comes to dealing with women as people, we as a species have gone fucking backwards and it make me want to puke.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:48:26	@ImprobableJoe Ahhhh but men cooked them. Women served them. Well, women and men, it’s political correctness gorn mad I tells ya
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:47:38	@ThrupennyBit To be fair, I could have gone without knowing that. However, despite that, I feel my life has been suspiciously enriched. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:44:46	@ImprobableJoe I have eaten pickled quails’ eggs today. Coincidence? I think not. intelligent design!!!!! Eleventy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:44:00	I have just been reminded I ate pickled quail’s eggs as part of those cocktails… …it’s been an odd day.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:43:03	Things I have done today: 1) Been recruited to consult for government department (be afraid) 2) Drunk many cocktails 3) Re-read Candide
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:41:31	Precisely what is the mass of infant excreted bogey that is acceptable to find on the screen of one’s iPad when returning from a night out?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:38:19	@frtheWhiteHouse @GeorgeMonbiot @AdamRutherford well sure, yes, if one has to be serious and factual and correct. Which is a good thing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 06:35:53	@PaleoGould Agreed. Interdisciplinary wrangles always seem to create the bitterest noise for less reason than any substantive difference.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:39:46	@PaleoGould Surely every internet argument ever
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:32:50	Hey. Think yourself lucky. It could have been Erato.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:31:38	I have decided to be strongly taken by the Terpsichorian muse on my way to the tube. I anticipate a thorough mugging.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:29:18	@RadishFeminist @Jsoosty @Suffragentleman @ThrupennyBit oh shit. A little bit of pee came out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:28:25	I shall only have 10% phone battery for my journey home at best. You have been spared.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:24:59	I salute you, structure, function and olfactophore.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:24:15	I can smell the long chain citrus oils, my palate registers the zap of the polycyclic terpenoids. Truly better living though chemistry.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:22:03	Holy shit this is a good martini. I may wax lyrical about the terpenoid flavour components that render this bitter and beautiful.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:17:32	… Helmet on the way home to complete the set. My last was in 1988.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:17:04	Time for a martini then home. I am a Jermyn street shirt and an intellectual valet short of a Wodehouse novel. I may pinch a copper’s…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:13:42	@bengoldacre @tkingdoll learning should be worn lightly. Hannibal is trying a little too hard. Deeply insecure. Should see a psychiatrist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:12:14	@garwboy InB4 all of Twitter sends you pictures of their bottoms. Is it concerning I thought of that?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:10:46	@AdamRutherford @GeorgeMonbiot is there a context in which “toughens your nipples” sounds good? Inquiring minds etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:06:38	@bengoldacre @tkingdoll … What’s not to like… … Oh…oh… It’s all so clear. Shit!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 04:05:58	@bengoldacre @tkingdoll ah come on, he’s a fictional character who gets to assert his superiority and kill people that irritate him…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 03:45:16	@there_runsMary never do anything by halves.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 03:43:51	@RevRichardColes you see? I may have been joking in a feeble manner, but well, rem acu tetugisto
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 03:40:11	@RevRichardColes the use of such terminology has a an erotic frisson for them? Oh dear I’m projecting again aren’t I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 03:37:21	@FluffCustard one does one’s best. I know ALL THE CoMPLIMENTS that amuse the ladies. #SMOOTH #NOT

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 03:33:45	@FluffCustard your internet evil is legend throughout these lands. I bow in appreciation of the distressing images you can muster
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 03:26:31	@FluffCustard MY EYES! I CANNOT UNSEE WHAT I HAVE SEEN!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 02:47:52	@hullodave or nuke it from orbit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 02:47:40	@hullodave Salt everything.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 02:40:51	@FGW Don’t be sorry! A) not your fault. B) I feel bad for the driver and persons hit by train, not me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 02:37:00	@FGW cheers. I’ll stay in the bar for a bit. Perhaps this is the best course of action!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 02:29:36	@RikNerdgasm @DannyJohnJules those are different things?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 02:28:59	@RoryJL2014 @WomenDefyUKIP I am Jack’s lack of shock. As the Overton Window shifts towards the reactionary right, so we all feel the hate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 02:26:33	@FGW are services from Paddington to maidenhead running okay?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 02:19:53	@DannyJohnJules in not sure there is a more stark image of the structural racism in he US than this. There probably is. Don’t want to see it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 02:03:50	@RevRichardColes If I may: InB4 “sounds like my sex life!” I am deeply sorry.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-24 01:13:41	Had a conference in London , it’s okay to treat myself to a very posh cocktail isn’t it? Yes it is. I thought so. Well done me. Hurrah!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-23 14:35:42	@AstroKatie “what are we going to do, Brain?” “The same thing we do every night, Pinky. Try to finish the *^%+#$^% project!”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-23 01:58:11	@RugbyPodcast Seems odd he would be in the squad (everyone knowing in advance he was off to France, I think) then suddenly out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-22 23:30:20	@Julie_B92 YAY! Eternal youth for the win!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-22 03:59:09	@LadyFOHF But I'm a proper grown up with proper grown up stuff to do and everything. So sleepy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-22 03:58:01	Am I allowed to go to bed? It's 9pm and I'm allegedly a grown up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-22 03:51:10	@BipolarBlogger I was luckily on the scene!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-22 03:43:46	@BipolarBlogger {SOBS}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-22 03:27:37	@hullodave I just snorted soup out of my nose because of you. Thank you!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 21:11:48	@RealTimeChem @leecronin Yes. Yes. A thousand times YES!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 20:48:50	@BipolarBlogger @BipolarWedding OH MY GAWRSH! A pangender hen party! With.....rum drinks?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 20:37:46	@girlonetrack I would like to take this opportunity to apologise for my gender and then shut the fuck up!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 20:34:04	@MarkCollyerReal @Lostinlife @TheOnlyGuru @TrippyPip @melindiscott @SimonScottuk Smart. I am pre divorced just to make doubly sure.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 20:33:34	@mfherrador @zeno001 It is the obvious joke. I was merely fortunate to be placed to make it. I take no credit, it was all your set up! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 20:31:44	@MarkCollyerReal @Lostinlife @TheOnlyGuru @TrippyPip @melindiscott @SimonScottuk Burden? My wife is starting to ask questions.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 20:31:04	@mfherrador @zeno001 OH MY LORD IT'S GETTING MORE POWERFUL!!!! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 20:29:48	@MarkCollyerReal @Lostinlife @TheOnlyGuru @TrippyPip @melindiscott @SimonScottuk Not again. I'm more on the hook than her ex husbands.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 20:29:26	I am working. I AM! NO YOU! Shut up. I'm telling. (Incidentally, immunology has been promoted to FUCKING INTERESTING)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 20:10:41	@BipolarBlogger I smell wedding cake. My psychic vibes reveal that you are getting married. But but I thought we... ;-) CONGRATULATIONS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 20:08:21	@TheOnlyGuru @TrippyPip @melindiscott @MarkCollyerReal @SimonScottuk @Lostinlife Gawrsh! One is deeply flattered. I shall celebrate with gin
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-19 02:36:52	@SpokesGay BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT STRAIGHT PEOPLE! ARE YOU A RACIST???
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-17 15:46:09	@OUstudents You know "Dances With Wolves"? I'm "Procrastinates With TMAs".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-17 15:45:10	It seems that every time someone, even a lovely someone, says something utterly stupid in public we need this reminder.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-17 15:44:15	I think a periodical reminder that criticism (even nasty and crap criticism) =/= censorship is due. Again.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-17 15:41:57	@tauriqmoosa ...broke myself. I am unamused by this. Luckily not all men are unamused by this.* *They are. I'll just argue amongst myself
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-17 15:41:08	@tauriqmoosa Not all men say "Not all men"! Not all men who don't say "Not all men" say "Not all men say "Not all men""... ...I just...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-12 08:04:27	@docfreeride And yes, you are correct about that "reasoning", but you didn't need me to tell you that. Of course, since we've just...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-12 08:03:29	@docfreeride You may be forgiven. Next time links to Spiked (even do not linked ones) need to be buried in a cellar marked "BEWARE! GITS!".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-12 08:00:47	@biochembelle @modernscientist @NMRJess Ouch. I can feel that from here.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-12 07:58:16	@docfreeride ARGH MY EYES! I CLICKED!!!! I'm suing due to insufficient Spiked warnings. That or retaliating with Daily Mail articles.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-11 17:29:49	I may also fall in love with myself. DYAC
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-11 17:29:10	@clinteas Go out with a grin as the impending apocalypse hits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-11 17:28:27	However I may fall worryingly in live with myself, distract myself, then have a stern word with myself followed by a proper good blub.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-11 17:27:28	Incidentally, re the fatuous sexist crap from Prof Sir Tim Hunt FRS (feet of clay award 2015), I have banned women from my desk. I’m crying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-11 17:24:40	@MrVaudrey @RSC_EiC no reaction? I have found the appropriate notation is to be found crying in a corner questioning my life! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-11 17:22:38	@clinteas Oddly this is not pill based. My coffee hasn’t even had time to hit my bloodstream. I’m suspicious. I think the world might end.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-11 17:20:01	I may be…erm…well…sorry…positive about something. I can only apologise.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-11 17:18:56	I am experiencing all these things like feeling pleasant. Awareness. A distinct lack of desire to kill fellow humans for breathing near me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-11 17:18:08	The world should be aware I have had sleep and therefore am possibly a danger due to actually being efficient. Things will get done.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 03:27:37	@BipolarBlogger Ah. Well that makes a lot more sense. Good that you had that insight and relative mood stability (I do mean "relative"!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 03:21:14	@BipolarBlogger Psychosis is a sodding good reason to go to hospital. I'm surprised you managed to stay out. Glad though. Very very glad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 03:07:50	@BipolarBlogger Holy moley! That sounds awful!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 03:07:16	@there_runsMary Cheers, Mary. Shitstorms are a pest. Good word for it though! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 03:02:51	@BipolarBlogger Oh crikey, that's shocking. Psychosis? Terrifying. You've mentioned disconnection with reality before did it take that form?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 02:58:52	@BipolarBlogger Please do! And thank you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 02:54:11	@Neuro_Skeptic Ahhhh I love the smell of that particular brand of irony in the morning.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 02:53:24	@BipolarBlog Are you on an up at the moment?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 02:52:03	@BipolarBlogger Mind awfully if I hold onto your (Twitter) ankle and don't let go? I may have a bad dose of being crap!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 02:51:02	@BipolarBlogger Been coming on for a while. I have tried to pretend the bugger isn't there, but it's crept up and taken over a bit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 02:50:33	@WarwickHunt4 @zeno001 I've seen this. I've seen this a lot. I still don't believe it. How can this be true? Don't answer...I know.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 02:48:46	@LadyFOHF But but what will the troll eat? Will no one think of the trolls? Are you a trollist?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 02:48:20	I am: 1) Bordering on dangerously depressed 2) Very busy 3) Terrified of letting people down 4) Unable to concentrate 5) All the above
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 02:41:29	@markthomasinfo That was either the most true or the most cynical thing I have ever thought. Probably both.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-10 02:40:57	@markthomasinfo We're in a dom/sub relationship with the banks. We love a good fisting by our corporate masters like the dirty proles we are
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-09 15:30:36	@AdamRutherford @RogerHighfield Already? But I haven’t put up my Ed Balls tree and decorations yet!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-09 03:17:10	@daraobriain Your restraint is, as ever, admirable. I shall set the recording device accordingly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-09 02:42:25	@SpokesGay Oh I am very sorry. I appear to have just come.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-09 01:54:03	@JohnFinnemore @MitchBenn I wonder if you can use a photo of the great Frenchman in meetings with your doctor "...yes but It could be worse"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-09 01:52:25	@MitchBenn @JohnFinnemore I have written to Messrs Macchio and Madeiros but sadly have yet to receive anything other than restraining orders
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-09 01:47:55	@MitchBenn @JohnFinnemore I have been reliably described as either a "Fat Glen Madeiros" or a "Portly Ralph Macchio" for ages. Unamused.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-09 01:27:10	@gravbeast But for added irony, the robots will have been designed and built by women.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-09 01:12:09	@marcuschown I've seen Facebook. He was right. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-08 02:14:21	@ArthurHWinter And the only reason I use a PC

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-07 17:28:52	@ThrupennyBit I HAS AN AMAZED!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-07 17:28:25	@infurioustoo Minimum. There will also be moody gentlemen with large, greasy dogs, keeping the place free of energy vampires like in laws.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-07 17:24:54	@infurioustoo We need a club. Probably with a bar.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-07 17:20:34	@BipolarBlogger …incredibly destructive. I see it quite often. Lots of involvement and awareness, little real help, leads to loss of hope.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-06-07 17:19:32	@BipolarBlogger I’m with you on this. These awareness campaigns are brilliant, but the lack of second level support (not their fault) is…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-15 18:16:00	@BipolarBlogger ha! I know THAT feeling! I am glad you are (whispers) stable. I don’t think it heard me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-15 18:11:44	@hullodave Stunning! A triumph! Five stars!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-15 18:10:49	@alexvtunzelmann I agree, however my inner cynic is thinking terrible things. I won’t listen to him. Again. Well, not all day.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-15 18:09:48	@BipolarBlogger and we all know Moomins are the best.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-15 18:09:28	@BipolarBlogger I’ve been unfortunately busy and avoiding the Internet as the terrifying time sink of joy and wonder it is!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-15 18:06:31	@ken4london …tragically I see more Blair style “middle ground” ahead, and concomitant shifting of the Overton Window ever rightward.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-15 18:05:24	@ken4london Labour needs to move leftwards, to be more progressive, to be a counter to the dominant “conservative” narrative of regression…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-15 18:03:19	@BipolarBlogger Yes! This must be done. That or the Banana Splits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-15 18:01:26	Call me a cynic, but who got to Chukka about his leadership bid? The shenanigans over party leaderships seem to be catching.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-08 17:43:20	@Giliell …in a manner and degree that people are generally not informed enough about to meaningfully consent to.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-08 17:42:50	@Giliell If there was as much consent as is even present in that woeful tome I’d be happy. We’re going to get destruction of welfare state…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-08 17:40:35	@DocHackenbush I am also very much of the opinion he should fuck most directly off and then keep fucking off for a goodly time.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-08 15:05:04	A not unexpected result given the last five years of violent rhetoric regarding the welfare state. We humans are depressingly shallow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-08 15:02:39	@JosieLong @AdamRutherford Brilliant. Depressingly needed, but brilliant.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-06 06:23:49	@lecanardnoir Impressively polite response.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-06 06:17:27	We need an actual left wing, progressive party that stands up against these vulgarities, not meekly echoes them to appease ignorance.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-06 06:15:50	I want to vote Labour, I can't. I cannot bring myself to vote for the party of that racist mug (and the UKIP pandering that engendered it).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-06 06:10:02	@OwenHurrell Many, many times. Or I'd stagger there from The Cage/Zoo (Showing my age)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-05-06 06:07:52	Is it in any way wrong or unserious that my election ennui has risen to the point that I will vote for whomever gives me the best humjob?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-27 01:37:25	@FluffCustard That’s not bad. I smell like hangover, stale beer, regret and a vague sense of sexual shame. Normal Sunday pong.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-27 00:52:37	@BipolarBlogger Birthday? Today?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-25 22:02:28	@belledejour_uk I'd have gone an got my list of informal fallacies and looked it up, but, you know, they are SO not worth it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-25 22:00:29	@belledejour_uk Argumentum ad utterfuckwit?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-25 22:00:10	@littlejason @iainlee I would. And I'd let them shit on the carpet and punch my 5 year old...because free speech. Oh no wait. I wouldn't

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-25 21:57:24	@belledejour_uk I tend to find these people can't actually "logic" very well. They usually fail at "yes racist thing X is free speech...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-25 18:50:48	@Ishfery @mistressmatisse Oh hell yes!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-25 15:59:39	@mistressmatisse …respond with everything to that request. “Ok. Directness? Well those are sex offender shoes for starters and that hair…!”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-25 15:58:14	@mistressmatisse True. But you’re right, directness =/= full disclosure brain dump. People do need to more specific. It can be fun to…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-25 15:54:54	@mistressmatisse Counter: I actually mean it broadly. I enjoy directness. I never get it… …wait…I’m about to get it aren’t I? Oh poo!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-25 15:46:46	@MittenDAmour Was madam liberally refreshed?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-24 22:52:42	@pzmyers @mjrobbins InB4 rather obvious wanker joke.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-24 22:51:35	@mjrobbins Have you really got one? Are they going to be upgradable?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-24 21:13:39	...no one has said anything nasty about immigrants. Am I correct?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-24 21:13:19	I haven't tweeted properly in a bit. Has anything happened? I bet in my absence everyone's been really nice to women on the internet and...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-17 20:24:11	@SaintsFanApp I'm honoured by the follow. Especially as I'm a Tigers fan! Trying to scare up a few extras from the wrong end of the A50? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-17 20:20:42	@ShappiKhorsandi Worryingly the same could have been said if you omitted the word "property" from that tweet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-16 02:03:57	@ChrisJBenton @OpheliaBenson @aratina @MAMelby @KimRippere Pathetic. I donate £50k from every £50k to secular causes. My barman's an atheist

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-15 19:44:13	Is it a bad sign when your current state is best described by the phrase “I think the last leap Swiss cheesed your brain, Sam”?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-15 19:27:38	I am what can only be described as obscenely tired. I blame you, Twitter. I know that’s not rational, but just indulge me on this one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-15 19:25:38	@fleetstreetfox It’s political correctness gorn mad I tell you!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-15 17:27:46	@ChrisJBenton @aratina @MAMelby @KimRippere SPLITTERS!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-15 14:33:01	@MAMelby @KimRippere But seriously, that was a great read… …oh no. I’ve tweeted praise and thus can’t be an atheist in Ireland or something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-15 14:30:15	@MAMelby @KimRippere Curses! Foiled prior to coffee! You’re too wily for me, Melby! {shakes clenched fainting couch}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-15 14:28:51	@KimRippere @MAMelby …that way I can distance myself from everyone at all times everywhere. And be better than everyone. Mwah ha haaa!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-15 14:28:04	@KimRippere @MAMelby I say, isn’t the rhetoric of that Melby Foundation a bit strong? I’m creating the Redux Reform Institute For Niceness..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-15 14:24:15	Morning has broken like… …me. Never in the field of human conflict has one man needed coffee quite so much.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-15 14:23:15	@KimRippere @MAMelby The Melby Foundation? I’d raise a toast but… …look it’s early here. That’s the best joke I can do on short notice. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-15 04:36:45	@Crommunist I'm not sure they're that coherent. More like brought to you by the makers of "I'm not racist I have a gay friend". ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-11 02:43:27	@MittenDAmour Nipple tassels, pony tail butt plug, lipstick slogan on chest reading “Sex Monkey”? Or what I wore to my Nan’s funeral.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-09 07:35:15	@IamJadehawk I’m not sure I can be bothered to read them. I’m nicely distant at them moment. It’s all a bit depressing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-09 07:29:17	@IamJadehawk No way! Really? That’s…special.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-09 07:23:04	@UnseenPerfidy HOW DARE YOU! {does proper huff}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-08 02:35:08	@tauriqmoosa Pfff zombie are such betas. It’s vampires that get all the hot chicks. It’s livingist is what it is. Here I am, alive and shit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-07 07:12:11	@SteveDavies01 @zeno001 @gorskon Are you totally deranged? That stuff is only safe in the hands of a tenth level Hydromancer. Billing hourly
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-07 07:08:49	@zeno001 @gorskon You fool! Have you no idea how dangerous everything around it is? After all, no water is infinitely more dilute than water

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-06 19:25:40	@christheneck @FstoneSkeptics 'S true. Unfortunately I'm an athorist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-06 19:22:46	@RevRichardColes Quite, quite. I find that local variance in botanical taxonomy is very confusing. Or convenient. Or both.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-06 19:20:51	@RichardDawkins @RevRichardColes I hate it when mummy and daddy fight. Botany diss. It's the worst. In some cultures that would be abuse.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-05 02:56:52	@FluffCustard ZOMG! I poop this while singing. It’s a talent really. {buffs nails}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-04 21:49:27	@MsJackMonroe English chilli, English paprika and English saffron? ;-) {Shhh don't tell them}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-04 21:26:28	@Psythor Wait....You're SAT!? On a TRAIN!? Are you Most Favoured Amongst Mortals?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-03 22:14:11	Last RT: best thing I have ever seen. * * only mildly hyperbolic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-01 19:47:53	Ween’s “Help me scrape the mucus off my brain” is playing in my head. Always does after a long night of study. Or booze. Or both.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-01 19:46:27	Sarcasm and caffeine. The two things powering me after last night’s/this morning’s TMA submission. #OUstudents
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-01 11:49:23	Woohoo! 4:48am, Open Uni assignment submitted! Now for one hour’s fitful sleep before I have to get up for work. Erm…yay?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-01 02:25:44	@ChrisJBenton @oolon ...thanks for answering it! I'm going to get better things to pop into my head in showers from now on! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-04-01 02:25:17	@ChrisJBenton @oolon I'm not saying I wonder about some weird things, but that question popped into my head when I was having a shower...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-31 13:55:39	@rob_bieber @mistressmatisse That would be all of them. It’s subtext. Apparently. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-31 13:54:18	@oolon I wonder, as Blockfather (or is it Oberblockenfuhrer?), amongst the complaints you get does anyone complain about locked accounts? ;)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-31 02:58:05	@LeeDowney @pzmyers A rabbit bringing choccy eggs is pretty damned miraculous. Better than bad corpse management in a cave based cemetary.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-30 21:57:25	@garwboy Well disagreement is the worst thing ever. Someone disagreed with me once and it made me reference a tired old joke.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-30 21:56:27	@LadyFOHF I knew you were all making this shit up. Canoes? Pmarca? It's just nonsense. Just give me the cash, I'll sort it out. ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-30 21:00:50	@DawnHFoster ...they seem to appreciate my understanding of the topics immensely, and my appreciation for their situation goes down well...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-30 21:00:18	@DawnHFoster Strangely, as a scientifically/medically educated chap, I have never had the slightest trouble with health care professionals..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-30 20:55:45	@DocHackenbush I don't blame you. I made a complete farage of myself.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-29 17:14:01	@BipolarBlogger I have to say that, despite personal inability to manage it often, the idea that in crisis we should be quiet and ...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-29 17:10:21	@BipolarBlogger Oh? I never knew that. I should have done! {facepalm}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-29 17:08:22	Okay, which one of you utter bastards changed all the clocks?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-29 17:07:41	@BipolarBlogger Have a lovely time. I'm not religious, but if I were, I reckon Quakerism would make me pretty happy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-29 04:49:25	@SpokesGay I wouldn't insult the plastic.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-29 04:48:05	@Julie_B92 @SpokesGay @docfreeride Yes. Yes you can. You'll need an aiirship.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-29 01:49:31	@NicLyndhurstUK @stevyncolgan Not you because of a) cross dressing, b) poor likeness, or c) proximity to UKIPists?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-28 04:16:48	@HalfTangible @pzmyers Nope, a strawman is a mischaracterisation of an argument in an attempt to dispose of it. You don't have an argument.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-28 04:15:42	@crarym @pzmyers @HalfTangible I was blocked once. I didn't get better and my FeeFees were hurt.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-28 04:14:09	@HalfTangible @pzmyers Sweetums, I'm not strawmanning you, I'm mocking you. You aren't worth my time arguing with.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-28 04:11:41	@pzmyers @HalfTangible No no PZ you must understand, your attention and time is his to dictate the use of, not yours. OBEY THE MANCHILDREN!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-28 03:52:04	@RugbyPodcast I had to read the last hastag very carefully.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-28 03:49:58	@Julie_B92 This is the hidden subtext. I have decided that my new name in the house is Sex Tiger. My wife laughed and disagreed.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 20:50:54	@MarkCollyerReal @TheOnlyGuru It's political correctness gone mad. They probably got time off to mourn Clarkson's lack of contract renewal
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 20:50:02	@TheOnlyGuru @MarkCollyerReal It's enough to make a man dangerously amused.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 20:49:46	@TheOnlyGuru @MarkCollyerReal Just think of the imaginary children. Their faux tears Their little dreams crushed beneath a torrent of filth
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 20:47:44	@ChrisHallbeck To be fair, the bra thing is a big concern. I mean, the physics alone... ...wait...wait...big green radioactive man...sorry!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 20:46:49	@MarkCollyerReal @TheOnlyGuru Jesus fucking Christ on a banana! That's a bit bloody strong isn't it?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 20:43:32	@GinSodaLime Ayerf: Name backwards or inappropriate noise made during Conjugal Unplesantness as Piers Morgan appears on the telly? Discuss.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 20:41:28	@TheOnlyGuru I was once mildly rude to someone. Surely that warrants my family being hounded to death?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 20:35:14	@metoffice I have googled and got a black and white analysis chart from ~07:00 I was wondering if I could find a 00:00 colour analysis chart

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 20:18:00	2)... I mean the Daily Mail is well known for being only ever accidentally correct, but the ad is as accurate as the headline is misleading.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 19:19:38	@Sectioned_ @Neuro_Skeptic Basically, that is literally the worst thing ever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 19:05:01	@noodlemaz @gimpyblog Ah the siren song of Twitter debate. I blame the {insert oppressed group here}. [Internet sets on fire]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 19:03:37	@garwboy I'd disagree but I fear it would make things awkward. And I think you'd object. Profoundly. With good reason. As would I.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 18:55:09	@BipolarBlogger {Hugs} I get this all the time. All of the pain, none of the fun. It's....yeah, well, you described it better than I could

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 18:23:13	@stevyncolgan They're taking credit for something they didn't create. It's the last refuge of the terminally inadequate.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 17:44:50	So has anything happened this last week? Any prominent dickheads been sacked? Political wrangling? Stupid headliines about mental health?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-27 17:33:28	@MentalHealthCop @Sectioned_ Ahhh the Mail. Only ever accidentally right, typically deliberately wrong.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-25 00:29:22	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola Today not possible, but a visit to London’s watering holes could be arranged. Also, with me in the up…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-24 21:41:27	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola they will happen. We need a bipolar rum based tweet up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-24 21:40:58	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola That makes two of us. But only if I wear a skirt. Dear lord that is a bad mental image.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-24 21:40:32	@BipolarBlogger okay true.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-24 21:13:21	@BipolarBlogger coincidence. I’m at work and I picked up my phone for a check of something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-24 21:12:51	@BipolarBlogger A feeling I know very very well. Currently a bit euthymic myself and watching out for A Wobble. Should be okay though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-24 21:05:52	@BipolarBlogger which is my way of being sympathetic re: hypomania. Not fun…or rather too much. {hugs}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-24 15:28:26	@rhapsodhy @upulie @bengreenman @gravbeast Figuratively speaking, that is.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-21 22:02:15	Did The ref discover his partner had had an affair with a brace of Italians in the break? The decisions have been very harsh #ITALvWAL
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-21 00:25:49	@MeganPaige269 @EnglandRugby Oh hell yes! Faith and £20 on England in my case.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-21 00:25:17	@MeganPaige269 @EnglandRugby It's nervy stuff relying on someone else to get the job done for you to an extent
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-21 00:24:47	@MeganPaige269 @EnglandRugby Worth a go! I'm a huge rugby fan :-) Bit scared of what Wales might do though. Points difference worries me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-21 00:21:10	@MeganPaige269 @EnglandRugby So...erm is that second ticket spare? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-21 00:16:05	@RugbyBanterPag3 ...but not a big enough score difference to over come what Wales will do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-21 00:15:46	@RugbyBanterPag3 I think Ireland will win, I reckon Scotland have been the most improved team on from last year and will trouble them a bit.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 18:16:46	@Millicent110647 Smart (short sleeved, natch) shirt, and trousers. Standard uniform
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 18:16:25	@Millicent110647 I'm not a dress down Firday person anyway. To be fair, as a scientist it's nigh on impossible to get me in a suit to start
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 18:15:21	@TheOnlyGuru It's a marketing disaster. I've written to my MP
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 18:14:46	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 Wait...we're meant to progress emotionally BEYOND 16? Ooh controversial! (According to a lot of people I see that is)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 18:13:59	To be fair, I hate working from home, so I might as well have fun!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 18:11:59	@Millicent110647 I REALLY want a proper onesi. There's a tiger one I have my eye on. It might "amuse" my wife all the way to divorce though!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 18:10:41	@Millicent110647 I'm doing this right.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 18:10:30	@Millicent110647 Dressed, and the sleeping bag is one of those army issue sniper bags with a hood, sleeves and a zip to get legs out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 18:05:00	@Millicent110647 I’m working from home today, so yes. I reckon I may have taken it a bit far. Is a sleeping bag a little trop? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 18:04:13	@susie_dent It’s a contender to take my favourite of that class off the top spot: crepuscular. It just sounds so nice.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 17:56:01	@mjrobbins @JonathanHaynes I heard you push your glasses up your nose as you said it. Impressive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 17:51:49	@zeno001 Same here. It’s like trying to find it through a duvet of disappointment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 17:47:42	@RevRachelMann Worryingly that would be less nonsensical than many if not most of their pronouncements.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 17:45:55	@LadyFOHF And it’s all over in minutes. Bloody disgrace. I’m writing to my MP. We’ve got 8 oktas of stratus. What do I pay my taxes for?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 17:43:49	@frankieboyle Just the moment of maximum coverage or the whole time the moon moves across the sun? Because that’s tougher to maintain.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 17:39:29	@Baddiel They didn’t but due to EU regulations they now have those soft lighting bulbs to save energy. Suns cost money you know.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 17:37:04	@BillBailey Isn’t that a bit gauche? I thought it was satsumas for lunar eclipses, nectarine stones used like a monocle for solar?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-20 17:35:28	@OpenUniCareers Thanks, Robin. Experiments are welcome distraction from paperwork. Always!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-10 02:20:41	@ProfFrancesca Seconded in toto. I want procrastination to be an Olympic sport, but I'd slack off, come in second, turn up late and get 3rd

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-09 18:33:50	@MittenDAmour Did you have lingerie on and a mattress leaning against the wall? Was there badly written innuendo? If not, give the poor man…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-09 17:50:14	@BipolarBlogger Oh that…yes that…of course. I knew what you meant all along. My brain had not gone anywhere comedy. That’s right out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-09 17:49:23	@BipolarBlogger Ha! “morning doc how are you today? These are my breasts.” “Very nice, Ms Walker. Would you mind putting your clothes on?”

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-09 16:37:28	@LadyFOHF That was the most financial sounding thing I could think of too. Probably incoherent.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-06 19:57:52	There, the universe such as it is now know all it needs to know. You can relax, safe in that knowledge.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-06 19:57:24	Also, apropos of nothing, I am bloody hungry and could cheerfully eat the hinder postions of a scabby dog. Or I'll just make a sandwich.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-06 19:55:51	It's been a brutal week, Twitter. I am a bit tired to say the least. Maybe, just maybe I shouldn't volunteer quite so much of my time. Hmmm.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-03 10:19:23	Ahhhh finally, the tweet that convinces me that there is a level of mathematics that makes me weird. Weirder. More weird.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-03 10:18:14	If, at any point, I decide to alleviate the mathematical joy in my brain by inflating my ballbag and using it as a space hopper, stop me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-03 10:15:31	Are stats like gremlins? Is that question going to get pedants tell me I mean mogwai? What the fuck is in this coffee?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-03 10:14:51	I wonder are statistics fun at times other than 2am? BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW! I never do stats before midnight.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-03-03 10:11:42	It's (just gone) 2 o'clock and all's well...still busy. Remind me, when I take on a couple of major projects, that sleep is optional.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-27 17:54:25	@BipolarBlogger @gravbeast I've been watching Game of Thrones again. It is known.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-27 17:52:39	@BipolarBlogger @gravbeast Well obviously. You are authoritative. It is known.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-27 17:52:11	@gravbeast It is all good. Now please tithe me 50% of your net worth and encourage others to follow my teachings. There may be gin.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-25 08:05:41	@Markgatiss Surely a wicker man is the traditional, and more appropriate method? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-25 08:01:32	@bengoldacre It seems I was psychic, it is Tredinnick and I can’t spell. I blame my aura.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-25 08:00:53	@bengoldacre do I need to read this? I ask because it already smells like I’ve stepped in Tredennick. I need to sleep, rage isn’t conducive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-25 07:31:07	@Yippieeeeee I’ve been drinking. At this point I’ll take either, but yes I think I meant scones. I blame autocorrect.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-25 07:29:31	@Yippieeeeee Dammit. Did the scores go in before the baps?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-25 07:28:36	@Yippieeeeee Oooh you don’t want to bake cheese scones in an oven that’s just had baps in. Far too hot. Have I missed the point?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-24 18:11:14	@stavvers ...over cynical indifference and callous disregard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-24 18:10:58	@stavvers I bet it's even worse than that. I bet Hunt etc don't even care. It's just political shennanigans. I'd take honest opposition...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-24 00:18:58	@FuzzCookies Might I suggest an onion and some thyme? Takes the edge off the shit.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:46:27	Following on from terpenoid biosynthesis we have a paper on C-Selective and Diastereoselective Alkyl Addition to β,γ-Alkynyl-α-imino Esters.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:43:51	@Julie_B92 @HereBeNabila "Where are my fucking lab specs? Which one of you utter pricks took them? I'll burn you all!... ...oh...oh sorry."

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:39:52	@BipolarBlogger I entirely take your serious (and obviously correct) points. But I do now want a magic diagnosis portal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:38:55	@HereBeNabila @Julie_B92 ZOMG YOU'RE HUMAN! Wait, I must gather kindling to burn you at the stake.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:38:15	@tauriqmoosa Homoeopaths. There is nothing worse.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:36:16	@Julie_B92 @HereBeNabila Plling rank like that over trivia (esp with an obviously considerate refiller of stuff) is rampagingly insecure.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:35:40	@HereBeNabila @Julie_B92 Is she this much of a wazzark to everyone? Or is it a power trip beause you are more "junior"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:34:45	@HereBeNabila @Julie_B92 I'm normally the cheery sort, but some things annoy me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:34:32	@HereBeNabila @Julie_B92 Thisis how I know you are a better human than me. I'd have told her to fuck off without looking up from my work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:33:14	@HereBeNabila @Julie_B92 ...I'm sorry, I believe in the power of Wish. My magic rainbow farting unicorn was going to poof it into existence"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:32:13	@HereBeNabila @Julie_B92 Yup. It is passive aggressive bullshit from this angle as far as I can see. Sarcasm? "Oh remake the buffer? ...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:30:17	@HereBeNabila @Julie_B92 I stress that I am not serious about that!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:30:04	@HereBeNabila @Julie_B92 I remember the feeling. Thre's always cornering her in a stairwell, administering a kicking then deny everything!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:29:17	@HereBeNabila @Julie_B92 You could hint at what Julie said re:professionalism. But it depends on your dept/lab culture (no pun intended).

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:26:49	@Julie_B92 @HereBeNabila Are you the lab tech? A postdoc?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:25:13	Still, this article on terpenoid biosynthesis in Angewandte is nice, and somehow managing to keep me relatively sane.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:15:27	@HereBeNabila @Julie_B92 It's Friday. My tolerance for humanity is at a low ebb. There will be sarcasm. Possibly Norty Werdz(TM)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:12:26	Reading journals, which is nice, but there is no object in the house unsworn at. I have been individually creating epithets for all things.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 18:09:01	Once in a while working from home is lovely. Again, I repeat my admiration for those disposed to manage it with greater frequency.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-20 00:48:25	@bobbyllew Never. UKIP are an endless source of hot air. And as any science geek worth their salt knows, hot air causes wind to blow.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 23:41:14	As an aside, all of you who work from home and find it easy when you do: I applaud you. You are better humans than I could ever hope to be.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 23:17:19	@docfreeride I, on the other hand, will not. Time for a spree of sarcasm! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 23:16:40	If I wanted to hurt myself as much as this training I would jam a Tabasco covered glass shard down my pee hole.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 20:20:33	@tauriqmoosa No seriously. I'm asking for beauty tips. This could be a big thing on YouTube.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 20:16:32	@tauriqmoosa Do you bathe in MRA/douchebro tears? I've heard they are good for the complexion.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 18:55:57	@stavvers however, as a wind up, it is top drawer.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 18:55:46	@stavvers whilst I’m male, I’m not sure I count as a bro, but definitely enough of a scientist to look askance at that claim!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 18:53:55	@stavvers Okay I think you just killed me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 18:47:00	@ProfFrancesca Reading? Taking time? Not immediately emoting? I am sorry, what are these new fangled things of which you speak?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 18:39:26	@RevRichardColes …I mean, that way they could buy a few houses, let some, and live of the income. I think they don’t even want to own houses
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 18:38:34	@RevRichardColes The poor? A shocking shower. I cannot understand for the life of me why they don’t just ask daddy to release the trust fund
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 18:15:57	@noodlemaz or sandals…look I can’t follow this crap without getting a headache. Can someone translate from sexist douchebag for me?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 17:50:12	@Julie_B92 I am deeply worried about the type of sword. I’m guessing scimitar, but it’s probably a cocklass…I mean cutlass. Whoops.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-19 17:47:55	@Julie_B92 Pin the {ahem} “sword” on the pirate?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 23:05:20	@docfreeride Definitely. However, have you fallen foul of "she who said the rhyme did the crime"? Ooooh it just got recursive! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 22:23:35	@mmbtox @HereBeNabila Yeah because there's not enough disease out there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 22:22:55	@HereBeNabila @mmbtox Always the best way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 22:22:17	@mmbtox @HereBeNabila THat is current approach. I am tempted by Nuclear! Have been good so far, avoided temptation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 22:20:33	@HereBeNabila @mmbtox I'm at the same point. I'm just deciding on tactics.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 22:18:34	@mmbtox @HereBeNabila THAT is the correct answer!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 22:16:55	@noodlemaz @tauriqmoosa I have just been a little bit sick in my mouth. Thanks for that mental image! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 22:16:26	@mmbtox @dorolfe @HereBeNabila It must be true The Baby Jesus told me in a magic Jesus dream. Unassailable that.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 21:37:05	@mmbtox @HereBeNabila @tehpet I may go as far as tutting audibly.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 21:21:12	@mmbtox @HereBeNabila ...that is so perniciously harmful I feel a deep need to rise up and slay things. Better to go for a lie down though!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 20:58:19	@mmbtox Actually quite liked the nuns. They used to get very angry at my wanting to sing about Captain Beaky and his Band and not Jesus...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 20:57:24	@mmbtox Ah okay. I got nuns at an early age, but they were nuns of convenience, not nuns of parental religion.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:16:36	@BipolarBlogger Getting a regime working for mood/anxiety etc though is a big win, you must be really pleased.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:16:12	@BipolarBlogger I'd go along with that! :-) I've just missed a few weeks/months of tweets so wasn't sure of progression etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:15:21	@AdamRutherford @gimpyblog Anything short of chasing them down the street with big sticks is liberal wishy washy PC gorn mad I tells ya.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:11:52	@gravbeast @debecca @fuzz_walk Oh they pay me for my shilling dammit. Granted not much...but hey, them's the breaks!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:11:23	@BipolarBlogger Or do you think this is the "new normal"? Or what have you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:11:09	@BipolarBlogger I am v glad it is working for you. Are you in a "heavy dose" phase intending to change doses later to reduce side effects?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:10:29	@BipolarBlogger Wow! That is a tasty cocktail!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:08:38	@AdamRutherford I think I mentally did a clenched Galapagos Finch salute by accident there
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:08:06	@AdamRutherford Whilst I wish you no trouble: Good. An unhappy creationist is the best kind. False balance is no balance as you know.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:07:07	@gravbeast @debecca @fuzz_walk ...conspiracy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:06:58	@gravbeast @debecca @fuzz_walk ZOMG Me TOO! ;-) Also, "the stomach is acidic in part precisely to control gut pH" is evil and a big pharma
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:05:32	@BipolarBlogger I did see a couple of tweets in passing. Mood is good but side effect profile is a git by the sounds of it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:05:02	@gravbeast @debecca @fuzz_walk The sentence "there's a really narrowly maintained safe range of pH in the blood" is nasty bigotry apparently

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 18:00:40	@debecca @fuzz_walk The other annoying thing is there enough sciency words and ideas mixed into the shit to convince people and make showing
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:59:53	@debecca @fuzz_walk I bet. Yeah the alkaline diet is well know horseshit. Why it's like homeostasis doesn't even exist...{sigh}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:58:36	@debecca @fuzz_walk I understand that acidic bodies eat through the restraints... {mind boggles}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:54:21	@gravbeast Thanks Beast! I'll be fine...well...unless I'm up on a murder by sarcasm charge. It's dad I'm worried about.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:53:44	@debecca @fuzz_walk It's concentrated bullshit in a bullshit sauce!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:53:31	@debecca @fuzz_walk I WISH it was minor bullshit like "eat X". It's serious diet interventions (like "alkaline diets") and homoeopathy etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:52:22	@debecca "Y U DO EVERYTHING RONG? Here, do this New Fad Bullshit Only Diet, and you'll be better...what? It didn't work? Must be your fault"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:51:17	@gravbeast Thanks. I have an array of woo peddlers before me. I am feeling "moderately sarcastic", which is scary! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:48:43	@debecca Which reminds me, how are you? I haven't been about much of late.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:47:03	@debecca ...about being unchallenged in their bullshit than actually helping.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:46:47	@debecca Yeah, I am at a loss what to do to be fair. No reasonable avenue is open, the people involved are DEEPLY dishonest and care more...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:43:50	@g3reth The irony is that, whilst I am huge advocate of medics etc, they're still human and well, to err is human...very very very human!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:40:42	@g3reth Ha! I can imagine that conversation. "You know the things I came here because I was worried about them. Yeah, I need them back"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:39:24	@christheneck ...blaming. "Oh your cancer came back? You didn't do the magic right." kind of thing. Seen it a few times.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:38:35	@christheneck Yeah it's a "doing something" thing to some extent. But as with most of these things it's actually disempowering and victim...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:37:51	@Giliell I am....."remarkably unsympathetic".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:34:11	@g3reth {Hugs} my friend. That's bloody irresponsible of the docs, surely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:32:54	@Giliell ...rampant and unchecked dishonesty and it's a huge fight just speaking politely and calmly.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:31:19	@Giliell ...so they undermine treatment little by little, starting with peddling woo diet/homoeopathy etc as an addition then gradually an..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:30:34	@Giliell The situation here is not that Dad won't go to doc, he's already receiving care, it's that certain family members have quack agenda

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:24:50	@christheneck Thanks! (Since major protagonist is my mum, fuck off is not an option.)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:24:14	@Giliell Sadly nope. He's extremely tired and conflict avoidant. Also any attempt to discuss this with him is viewed as Hostile Action.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:21:52	@Giliell Tried that. Nearly got burned at the stake. Evidence is witchcraft in my family.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:21:28	@christheneck So completely skip being polite and gentle. Gotcha.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:18:01	@christheneck The emphasis there is on "occasionally"! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:17:34	@christheneck I am....unamused. I am occasionally good at polite and gentle, I tried and have been treated to spectacular dishonesty.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:15:15	@mmbtox That is tanamount to witchcraft in my family! ;-) I nearly got burned at the stake for suggesting evidence might be useful!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-18 17:10:32	Advocating (politely) for this being a bad idea, and actually harmful and disempowering got me attacked. Some people you just can't reach.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 21:08:38	@gregladen The physics or the TV show? And either way, I have missed this. SOmething interesting come up?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 19:59:37	@mjrobbins I don't know about an article, but I am convinced they're closet Tories. That or giant space lizards. Only explanation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 19:51:49	@ChemistryWorld An undergrad student in a lab I once worked in left organoselenium reagents on the bench. That made the lab "interesting".

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 19:12:03	@garwboy I was thinking along these lines. It is, and I do not say this lightly, another crass PR cock up from people who should know better

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 18:26:46	Has any Labour SpokesOrganism appeared on the bus nonsense yet? Has any Tory Oleaginist oozed into view to vomit anything coherent on HSBC?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:48:55	@Jo_Caulfield To be fair I think that’s the only way they could top this crassness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:48:37	@Jo_Caulfield will it be followed by Sun sponsored Tits Bus for the lads and another more patronising Calm Down Love It’s Only a Laugh Bus?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:39:08	@brianmoore666 I am increasingly convinced that all labour advisers are closet Tories.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:33:14	@evilfelicity @ThrupennyBit Then the science isn't the problem (which we agree on).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:32:16	@evilfelicity @ThrupennyBit That govts misuse science or treat it as something they claim supports their ideals is not criticism of science

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:31:00	@evilfelicity @ThrupennyBit I'm not sure ANY policy is based on science. We don't live under an evidence based govt, or one that is willing
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:28:57	@evilfelicity @ThrupennyBit ...it's a multifactorial problem that benefits from effort at many levels, including GMOs as one tiny part.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:28:19	@evilfelicity @ThrupennyBit I hate to say it but the relevant scientists (not me I confess) DO consideall you've just mentioned. Of course..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:27:21	@evilfelicity @ThrupennyBit Lucjky that isn't being ignored then isn't it? Look up (to name but one) the work of the lateNorman Borlaug.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:19:45	@evilfelicity @ThrupennyBit Yup, absolutely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:18:56	@evilfelicity @ThrupennyBit That sounded way more aggressive than I meant it! Apologies
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:18:17	@evilfelicity @ThrupennyBit Good thing the best science and best understanding of energy management says nothing of the sort then.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:17:27	@ThrupennyBit Seems reasonable to me!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:16:06	@ametonym The writers of The Thick Of It would have discarded it as too bloody daft even for a satire/parody.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:15:35	@ThrupennyBit Anti the science behind/safety of GMOs and utility of fission as bridging tech (one of many, not only)? No.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:14:21	Why is Labour using a pink bus? Seriously? It's beyond merely fucking stupid. Given ineptitude of opposition I suspect advisers are plants.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-11 17:07:16	@ThrupennyBit It's a shame when the (largely anti-science in many key ways) Greens are the only ones saying anything left-ish @UKLabour

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 21:27:46	@chiller For your sake I hope it's not my solidarity-via-sarcasm! ;-) That would be truly harsh!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 21:26:43	@chiller I think I'm adding this to the list of Shit I Don't Get Because Male Privilege. It's kind of a massive list.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 21:24:51	@chiller Sorry, but I think I may have tapped a rich vein of sarcasm on this one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 21:24:08	@chiller I read a book on it, I'm sure Obviously I read the book on my own in my study whilst my wife silently brought me cocktails. Natch
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 21:23:06	@chiller I did eat all my kibble and actually use the sandbox correctly. I reckon I deserve it.. ..mind you my wife hates it when I do that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 21:21:41	@chiller Granted sexual intimacy is also ace, but seriously, when did demonstrations of affection that don't end in orgasm become bad?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 21:20:52	@chiller The noise I just made when I read that was the same noise a very confused Scooby Doo makes. WTAF!? Nonsexual intimacy is ace.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 20:32:21	@nazihunteralan Impressive vigilance. Do you know of any punchable Nazis in the Berkshire/Buckinghamshire area? I feel like doing my part.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 20:31:05	@DavidAllenGreen @cpsuk And on that day Stalin will rise from his grave and espouse the virtues of global capitalism before enjoying a latte
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 20:29:22	@DrRubidium Ahhh I remember when I believed things like that. I was seven. That was a good week.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 19:54:56	@ProfFrancesca @KerryDungay I'll do it. Do you have them in a size 12?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 19:53:35	@Hayleystevens ...only to be told "We don't serve upcountrymen". The guy had known me all my life!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 19:52:42	@Hayleystevens Oh that's amazing! I went back to Dorset once, 3 months after I'd gone to uni (all those years ago) and went into my...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 19:49:47	@Hayleystevens I say this as a West Country boy, born and raised (now elsewhere). I know the Auld Ways. The Dark Ways.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 19:49:15	@Hayleystevens Ooo that's an impressive opening gambit. Did they gum their few teeth and shake the rope attatched to their large greasy dog?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 19:47:14	@rabbitsoup_zola They might tell you to go for a walk or have a cup of tea with increased urgency though. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 19:45:28	@Hayleystevens Did you get the full "We don't like your type round 'ere" treatment?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 00:39:58	@NaomiGreen Pretty much sums it up for me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 00:39:50	@NaomiGreen It really is. ”I don't know anything, but I do know that everything is interesting if you go into it deeply enough.” R Feynman
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 00:37:50	@NaomiGreen Yes. Yes I do. I am a colossal nerd! Actually that's a good thing. I feel okay now. {False existential crisis, don't worry}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 00:36:25	@NaomiGreen For me the really sad thing is I can taste the difference in a properly blinded... ....oh god! What have I become!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 00:35:16	@NaomiGreen I am not ashamed to admit I have read proper papers on coffee. I am a step away from writing them though! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 00:32:25	You have been warned. Come the Revolution those people who Did Coffee Wrong will be punished. Possibly up to the Homoeopath level.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-05 00:31:20	Re: last RT. Coffee (like any form of cooking or brewing or food prep) is chemistry. And therefore SRS BSNS. Never get it wrong. Never.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 23:14:45	@DrMRFrancis @joshwitten Oh well that's all right then.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 23:12:07	@joshwitten @DrMRFrancis Actually given that my last tweet was a) a joke and b) this is the internet, I really hope that it doesn't backfire

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 22:41:30	@mmbtox And not the good kind!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 22:40:14	@mmbtox Both. If I see telomeres overhyped one more time I'm instigating a global species reset on humans. Minimum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 22:38:21	@fleetstreetfox Oh now THAT I can really get behind. I mean I'm keen on sex ed to help reduce abuse, but fucknuckles? Too many of them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 22:04:43	@CCriadoPerez OMG! ME TOO! We have the BEST products! Wait...wait...something is bothering me about that...nope...it's gone!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 22:02:29	@CCriadoPerez Yeah but why do you feminists not complain about Saudi Arab... ...oh. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 21:24:44	@MattBowdler @DocHackenbush I have told people before not to use language like that on the internet. A "Dellingpole" really? Disgusting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 21:07:17	@TheRealNickKay @debecca Dark... ...but very very good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 21:02:29	@fleetstreetfox Not me (sadly). Got "traditional" (and useless) birds and bees type talk. I knew more bilology than they did at the time!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 20:30:14	@cdaargh Impressive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 20:28:39	@cdaargh We can do something about crucifiction, it's so very last couple of millenia.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 20:25:28	@cdaargh Could it be...? We do need a feminist messiah. Think of the outrage by MRAs etc. For that alone it's worth it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 20:23:20	@cdaargh Ahhh but you can probably market overhyped water to rake in profits to buy wine...which is as good I reckon.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 20:13:17	@cdaargh I know! It's like you're a modern day Jesus. Except a woman. And real.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 20:10:46	@cdaargh Retweeted for truth, favourited for novel swears. Your work, it is good. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 20:09:03	@CCriadoPerez All big CEOs etc should be forced to use Outlook. If only to make these things funnier.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 20:05:27	@FGoria @Peston Seems legit. Probably is legit. Isn't this how Madoff did it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 20:04:24	@AllyFogg @stavvers "We entirely dissociate ourselves from anything ever said or done by UKIPpists ever, especially "policies"." FTFY ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-04 18:59:21	@sophie_gadd "We will close the school when carbon dioxide crystallises from the air and not before" (Ok not 100% accurate...but funny!)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 18:05:09	@david_colquhoun I suppose I am being nostalgic for my own UG experience where contact with research profs etc was inspirational.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 18:04:21	@garwboy You can always sue. If the woo peddlers have taught us anything it is that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 18:02:00	@david_colquhoun ...and vice versa. I do like the idea though, more relevant training is essential for non-research bound students.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 18:01:27	@david_colquhoun True. I suppose I was thinking more of the ordinary level where developing undergrads benefit from contact with researchers
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 17:58:02	@david_colquhoun I'm not necessarily disagreeing, but would this proposal run the risk of (greater) decoupling of teaching and research?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 17:50:45	@Julie_B92 @biotweeps True. But given that I got a bit drunk whilst watching rugby this weekend, it's a permanent state according to my wife
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 17:45:25	@Julie_B92 @biotweeps I gastrulated once. Life changing! Mind you, it took neurulation for me to be able to tell my arse from my head! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 17:31:51	@LadyFOHF Ah I see. I figured piss taking featured but was unaware of context.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 17:29:16	@MitchBenn I for one am outraged. Outraged and shocked. Shocked and…oh no wait, just got it. Very funny.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 17:26:59	@LadyFOHF Is this a bad thing? He strikes me as remarkably oleaginous. But then I am very mean.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 17:07:39	@tauriqmoosa Because, you know, Historical Realism. It's like Orcs and Wizards. I'd explain, but there's maths.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 17:05:43	@laurajane0103 I remain unamused by the pace of this year. I will be speaking to someone about it. Frankly it's an outrage! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 17:00:13	@TaraFlynn Didn't you say that yesterday? Isn't it Feb the 3rd today? Oh no...oh no no no!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-02-02 16:47:46	@RevRichardColes I feel our American cousins do this same act of prognostication well. All weather predictions require a large rodent.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-31 22:23:04	Need to win big today. Get the momentum for the end of the season. Let’s knock the halos off some Saints. #tigerschat

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:29:51	This leads me to think that snark is an evolved energy dump for coping with tedious knobheads. I need to harness that energy somehow...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:29:03	...only manifests itself for relatively trivial bits of news (not trivial subjects perhaps). Actual horrors demand effort, not mere snark.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:28:27	If people can get paid $40 for a (clinically approved) poo, I feel that I should somehow monetise snark. Also, I have noticed that snark...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:27:22	I think I need UKIP to do something spectacularly fatuous today, just so I can pour out this deep well of piss taking that is about to burst

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:25:01	I'm concerned I've reached peak eyeroll. Possibly even peak tut.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:24:26	But seriously...even with an impressive sarcasm base level, I am ready to mock the unbelievable bejeesus out of something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:23:31	Why is it certain news stories inspire deep sarcasm? Okay for reasons unrelated to news I am feeling eleventy times more sarcy than normal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:22:28	@chiller Admittedly mainly because it would be hilarious. Especially at the upcoming (men's) rugby world cup "Nice try, sweetie, now dance"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:21:20	@chiller They should do. I demand sexual objectification and general undermining of the talent and effort of male sports stars with trivia.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:20:43	@chiller It's like there's a series of intersecting social forces and cultural ideas that lead to women being viewed as non-default humans.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:19:01	@chiller I know! It's...well, yes...ARGH! Also Amal Clooney asked what she was wearing. Seriously? SERIOUSLY? (Good answer though)...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:07:10	@BigDumbChimp I'm wodering if we should encourage other users of Twitter to "give it a few minutes". Mind you, coffee seems to help tweeting
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-29 20:05:43	@BigDumbChimp Mind you, a lingering sense of shame about how much I enjoyed it remains. A miasma of minor guilt.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-24 18:49:51	@JeanHatchet I have heard about "banter" I was quite a fan when it was about clever wordplay and fun. It seems to be about hating women now.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-24 03:13:57	@RevRichardColes They need better friends and lessons in tolerance and empathy. That or more wine so they can get to the really juicy stuff

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 05:03:34	@SLATUKIP 1) I am Jack’s utter lack of surprise (NF is an opportunistic hack) 2) friends don’t link friends to the Daily Mail ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 04:58:17	@SLATUKIP Because plain packaging might be brown paper and UKIP oppose anything brown Like leftie Guardian wholegrain rice or foreigners ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 02:55:06	@bdogrunner Impressive!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 02:53:54	@Herring1967 Good point. Wait...I haven't even taken mushrooms today...oh dear.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 02:50:22	@Herring1967 The important question is: Did Charlie Boorman choose to advertise that brand purely to mess with you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 02:48:12	@bdogrunner Mind you, if one did go for a nice brisk walk with crushing chest pains the feeling WOULD pass. Not in the good way though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 02:45:59	@Herring1967 I confess it made me laugh though, given your comments in RHLSTP etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 02:45:40	@Herring1967 I doubted I'd be the first to draw your attention to it, or that you hadn't seen it. Apologies for being the nth in line.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 02:44:41	@Herring1967 Also, I think they have your year of birth wrong. That or you should have written "Oh Fuck, I'm 41!" Frankly this is a scandal
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 02:41:00	@bdogrunner Maybe go for a walk, the feeling will pass.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 02:40:27	@Herring1967 Your own shoe brand? Surely this is taking the piss now (Yes I know that's Ewan McGregor. Or Brad Pitt) pic.twitter.com/pc82T6gRfa
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 01:40:42	@there_runsMary There are so few non news outlets that feature skimpily clad/topless women. Oh wait no, there’s loads.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-22 00:35:05	@DNLee5 I don’t know the ans, but anecdotally I always give refs that explicitly reference collegiality, of which respectfulness is key part
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-21 23:32:50	@Yippieeeeee Although I am still giggling about the idea of Frank Zappa and the Mothers as an answer
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-21 23:32:18	@Yippieeeeee Cannibal Corpse or Slipknot featured in the “WRONG!” pile.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-21 23:29:48	@Yippieeeeee I’ve failed there, but keep having deeply inappropriate metal bands pop into my head

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-21 21:16:18	@TigersFansChat @Chris_Hemsley Agree totally. Salvi's a monster in the ruck. Worht his weight in turnover ball. A real scavenger.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-21 21:14:44	@RugbyTigers Totally gutted. Gibson's been one of the best players Tigers have had.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-21 21:13:11	@Chris_Hemsley @TigersFansChat It's on the Tigers forum as a v v likely move (confirmed by Bayonne IIRC)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-21 21:12:00	@TigersFansChat @Chris_Hemsley I know Tait's off to France and Salvi was possibly off to the same place but probably retained
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-21 21:10:13	@Chris_Hemsley @TigersFansChat I've heard the same rumour but not had confirmation. "Talks ongoing" was last I heard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-21 21:08:44	@Chris_Hemsley @TigersFansChat Have Parling and Salvi definitely gone too? I know Parling was spoken of, but the Salvi thing was less sur.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-21 21:03:23	@TigersFansChat Oh that is a big loss. I'd heard tell it might happen, but WOW that is awful!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-21 21:02:26	@MitchBenn It's entitled tittery across the board.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-19 02:05:36	@FuzzCookies I occasionally think, against my better nature, that entrants to the various BB houses should be quietly "disappeared".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-19 02:01:43	@FuzzCookies This is a show which features La Hopkins, am I right? The Satan cursed offspring of Hitler and Pol Pot would be too good for it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-19 01:56:29	@FuzzCookies The Yorkshire Ripper? Nah. His views on women, ethnic minorities and health and safety are too good for CBB.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:41:47	@Eleeza31 @ProfFrancesca Another Greek. I was v amused on many counts, not least that any of my relatives would be up for murder after that!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:39:41	@ProfFrancesca Choked on coffee when he went on about proto-Hebrew. I’ve read near nothing by comparison on the subject, even I was amused.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:32:35	Okay…somehow I have to stop enjoying being annoyed by (probably lovely) people spouting inane crap on my telly machine and doing some stats.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:28:23	@TrollULike Troll or not? Hmmmm are there any clues…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:25:38	Oh I haven’t been this annoyed by patronising creationist dullardry in ages. It’s a refreshingly nostalgic feeling. I usually avoid them now
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:24:48	It’s projection on their part. They know fuck all outside their self referential drivel sphere, so they assume everyone else does too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:23:46	Also, being told to be more humble by an arrogantly sappy creationist with no answers? Please? At that point my shit would have been lost!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:23:00	Oh look, more rant… …Fine tuning arguments and the anthropic principle. PUDDLES! Douglas Adams nailed those fuckers to the wall.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:20:57	Oh look there was a little more rant left in me. I think @ProfFrancesca @AdamRutherford were too goddamn nice! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:19:36	…that fact that some people think there is is a COLOSSAL FAILURE of our education, media and political systems. And it happens everywhere.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:18:44	Rant over. I get annoyed by fuckwittery being unduly elevated in “debates”. There’s no debate about (for ex) the fact that humans evolved…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-18 19:07:40	@DrEvanHarris @ProfFrancesca @ProfLisaJardine Indeed but also being patronised hugely by some chap who is simply making stuff up. Restraint!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 18:16:32	@CCriadoPerez @sianushka @willbrooker @boodleoops I was staggered by his ripostes. "You're lying" when confronted with facts. Powerful! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 08:23:03	@Cilvrnum And Scots vote in the UK general election, so like it or not they are relevant to this election.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 08:19:57	@Cilvrnum Are the SNP not a majority party in Scotland? Whether I like it or not, they are players in this election.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 08:17:53	@Nowtsabother I am really trying not to. My skin is crawling.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 08:15:37	@Cilvrnum So not for party leaders then? Why include Farage then?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 08:15:01	@Nowtsabother It’s an idea that has actually managed to ale me feel sorry for Cameron. I mean, Farage might try to form a “coalition”…YUCK!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 07:57:56	@DawsePaul @stevyncolgan it’s pleasurable self harm. Like slightly rotating a loose tooth with your tongue and enjoying it too much

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:45:23	@wa7trel @CCriadoPerez I know! I was using a small degree of comic licence. Play along!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:44:42	@CCriadoPerez I have been amusing myself with "fighty Pope" mental images.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:41:48	@CCriadoPerez 1) Pope is infallible 2) Christian dogma is no longer "turn the other cheek" but "come and have a go if you think you're hard"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:33:12	@MittenDAmour Too late for the kicking of kitten or... ...I don't want to know do I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:22:12	@JaneyGodley I confess to being *slightly* too amused by this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:21:59	@JaneyGodley Actual Pope quote: "SEE YOU YA FUCKIN'...FUCKIN'...YOU!" Proof positive Stella is on tap in the Popemobile.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:13:33	"The Pope is back on the streets, swaying slightly, and he's encountered the police and he seems to be objecting to their hats."
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:12:43	"Thankfully, the kebab shop staff have viewed the Pope's obvious aggression with good humoured tolerance, very decent of them. And he's out"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:11:40	"Oh now that's beyond the pale, His Holiness is making racist remarks at the kebab shop staff, there's no excuse for that in modern poping"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:10:44	"And now His Holiness is going for a kebab. He's gone for the extra chilli sauce, as one would expect from a fighting pope of his stature"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:10:04	"Oh and now the Pope has decided a lamppost is his best friend...no...he's asking if it is looking at his nun, oh dear, this got ugly fast"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:08:35	@christheneck Quite. I feel he was terribly restrained really.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:08:08	"And His Holiness has just necked his third pint of Stella...oh in a strong move he's bitten the ear off a penitent and made a lewd gesture"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:04:41	I am having a series of impressively comic mental images about the Pope taking on all comers in a Stella fueled car park Battle Royale.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 03:03:26	@christheneck I believe he ended his remarks with "WHERE ARE ALL THE FIGHTERS IN COLOMBO?" before nutting a cardinal and necking his pint.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 02:58:09	@MittenDAmour Remember to swing from the hip and always follow through With your foot, follow through with your foot. Important distinction
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 02:53:48	@chiara84 I believe there to be a direct correlation between my team's performance and the volume I shout at the television.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 02:37:53	Also, reading around, I see the Pope has changed Christian dogma from "turn the other cheek" to "COME ON YOU FUCKING WANT SOME!" Impressive

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 00:18:27	@CCriadoPerez I do wonder at the intent/effect of the media's love of highlighting "controversial" (read: bigoted) parties/personalities....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-16 00:05:35	@MrEdByrne I noticed. You went an interesting colour.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:40:02	@BipolarBlogger @cdaargh Yeah but no one would vote for him because he told everyone not to vote.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:39:31	@HorzaEdeo @cdaargh Good point, well made!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:39:21	@cdaargh Minimum! I'm a fan of heavy taxation of the right people. The right people being anyone who annoys me. Hey, I'm fair. No. Really.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:38:27	@cdaargh Hmmmm maybe it's my science bias, but Dawkins did once have redeeming features.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:37:52	@Esteleth Yay no cancer! Boo bills! Fingers crossed for sucessful doc intervention.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:37:08	@Esteleth Remind me, once again, why, as I am changing careers, I am not going to move to the USA. (sadly. I like it for many reasons)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:35:33	@Esteleth No. You win.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:35:26	@cdaargh On a planet that stil has Ian Duncan Smith, Piers Morgan, Katie Hopkins, and Clakson I fear you are wasting valuable rocket fuel
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:34:20	@Esteleth Go for it. You won't have long, our govt is trying to fuck the NHS. Hard. From behind. And not in the good way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:30:40	@BigDumbChimp @clinteas Don't ruin it! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:29:46	@BigDumbChimp @clinteas ...fake outrage as a feeble distraction from enduring this tutorial.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:29:29	@BigDumbChimp @clinteas I am assuming you favourited that as a means of letting me know I should grow up. I am choosing this so I can...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:28:23	I'm 40, 2015 has to be the year I grow up. It has to be. Please let these thoughts stop. I can't help it, my brain is now making stats puns.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:26:37	Does it show I am struggling to maintain seriousness?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:26:25	But it is dull. And it is causing a deep need for gin and a slight pain in the dong. OOOH NULL HYPOTHESES! I have just come.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 04:24:44	I am tempted to live tweet my stats tutorial. Anything to liven it up. I suppose it's a bit unfair because I actually have done the work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 02:07:46	@MrMMarsh @alicebell Surely people who design and install urinals write the best slash fiction? My coat. I will be getting it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 01:26:13	@hrtbps @somegreybloke The ethics of the Ched Evans thing are tough. If only he was an unrepentant, convicted rapist... ...wait...Oh.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 00:55:31	When it comes to Twitter I feel like Michael Corleone in The Godfather III. Just when I think I am out, it pulls me back in.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 00:53:51	@AbiWilks DAMN YOU! I clicked. You win. And I was really interested in stealing lettuce correctly too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 00:28:47	@tauriqmoosa Just for the record, I'm not the kind of man who says "not all men". #NotAllMenSayNotAllMen . (Time for recursive old jokes!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 00:18:28	@PatrickStrud @CCriadoPerez New year. Old misogyny.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-07 00:08:03	@almurray @MrsStephenFry The wife is always the last to know.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 22:36:54	Dear Twitter, I am not allowed on you right now. You are my PC’s prime window to interesting and distracting articles. I will be strong.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 22:34:55	@MooseAllain Ah the verb ferro keeps on giving.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 20:25:13	@paulcoxon There is always a lab jackdaw, it is almost always a man, look first for locked cupboards
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 18:42:54	@stephenfry I’ve always felt that a body double, under a blanket, rushing to a car and screeching away pursued by journos is the way forward
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 18:41:15	@garwboy So the headline should be “Unreasonably alarmist headline disguises surprisingly sensible article”?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 18:39:19	@stephenfry Oh congratulations! Wonderful news. May you be exceedingly, rapturously happy together.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 18:37:09	@garwboy On a scale of one to lots how many Greenfields does the article score?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 06:05:11	If I don’t get off this iPad and do some stats work I’ll be unprepared for my tutorial tomorrow! No it doesn’t sound terrible to me either
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 06:01:33	@DrMRFrancis @doctorow Nightwatch. Anyone who says different will be shot come the Revolution.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 06:00:33	@garwboy I never understood what the problem was with name dropping until the Queen explained it to me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 05:58:20	@Stephen_Curry Basic error. Dirac never made methamphetamine in New Mexico. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-06 05:39:13	@laurenlaverne The Force is strong with this one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-05 22:45:40	@daraobriain Has anyone answered "only if done correctly", yet?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 22:56:26	@RugbyPodcast We could see a series of quite impressive batterings. There are some very large, moody slabs of rugby lad out there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 22:51:34	@Exposing_UKIP I do a drinking game based on drinking every time Farage mentions immigration. I get my third liver transplant next week.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 18:48:34	@RugbyTigers Quite right. Although today I’ll have to help the 16th Man from 100 miles away unfortunately. I will make up for it in volume!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 05:04:03	@Doubting_Tom @pzmyers @rebeccawatson I'm not sure, am I PZ's sockpuppet this week or not? And can I have a couple of weeks off in June?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 05:03:06	@MittenDAmour They mostly come out at night. Mostly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 05:01:26	@pzmyers @rebeccawatson We all know so called Rebecca Watson is really a so called PZ Myers so called sockpuppet. So called makes it truthy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 03:22:34	@b_magnanti I really liked chaper two, the one with the dragon and the rainbow farting unicorn.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 01:34:48	@LadyFOHF Oh I am all about the science.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 01:34:22	@LadyFOHF HA! I am loving the evidence. Important!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 01:32:59	@LadyFOHF Is it on your non-dominant hand?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 01:26:26	@LadyFOHF Hey, I've been efficient today. I was just saving time and continuing the pattern.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 01:25:00	@LadyFOHF {Insert philosophical disquisition re your contrasting respectability and controversy} There, that's done! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-04 01:23:24	@LadyFOHF Have you been stirring controversy again?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 22:26:16	@bookcunt Oh yeah, and it's an island run by powerful women. It's so not even subtle. Annoyed I missed it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 22:22:51	@bookcunt I'm a huge RJ fan, have read that book a couple of times and was erm clearly too absorbed by the story. That's it. Yeah. Absorbed!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 22:19:14	@bookcunt HAHAHA! I have genuinely never noticed that before. Damn I must be getting slow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 22:02:58	@b_magnanti I mean, just so we're clear and all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 22:02:49	@b_magnanti It was in no way 4 irrepsonsible stoned teenagers in a hot hatch thrashing it around the streets of E London. That's right out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 22:00:45	@b_magnanti That or the amazingly healthful exotic smoke that was filling the car as a safety precaution...obviously.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 21:59:31	@b_magnanti Or in other words, there are none so blind as those that are REALLY trying not to see.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 21:59:11	@b_magnanti A friend of my mum in law believes her teenage son's tale that he and his friends flipped their car on the way to the library.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 21:58:05	@b_magnanti Reminds me of the Calvin and Hobbes cartoon where Calvin "loses a shoe" (buy chucking it beghind a bush) to avoid bedtime.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 21:41:19	@Pundamentalism And degrees in chemical and mechanical engineering. Plus she came from a deprived background. Major success story, really.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 10:47:46	@there_runsMary Oooooh good one! Impressive French burn there. With the six nations coming up, I approve! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 10:45:49	@AskMissMadison I know. It makes me want to have another few lives tacked on to the end of this one to see how it all pans out!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 10:44:24	@there_runsMary That’s about all it deserves. But still, it is the universe giving us a little wink.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 10:43:58	@ImprobableJoe One of the greatest stand up routines of all time IMO.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 10:43:20	@AskMissMadison It’s a genuinely lovely bit of technology isn’t it? I don’t get the haters. ITunesU is awesome too. Glad you found it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 10:42:11	@ImprobableJoe Your wife, Gus. She’s a Bigfoot, Gus.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 10:41:44	I hereby demand that you people deliver a far more childish and willy based series of jokes. Honestly. (No…not serious. {sigh})
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 10:40:28	I mean, nominative determinism, people! It’s genuinely funny that is. Naturist. Lecocq. It’s not hard… …huh…huh…oh come on!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-03 10:39:08	Seriously people I follow on Twitter, seriously, is no one even going to remark on the fact that there was a French Naturist called Lecocq.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 09:40:27	@gravbeast @chenghlee ...and then listed on Buzzfeed
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 09:29:51	@robinince Horse, snake, ox, Bieber, One Direction... ...not a good trend.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 09:28:48	@chenghlee If I spend 30 mins on Twitter in the morning, I am unproductive for hours just reading what articles float by. It's evil!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 09:18:30	@chenghlee Finally! A New Year's Resolution I a) need, b) can support and c) have zero hope of accomplishing!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 07:00:27	@Esteleth There you go! Makes sense
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 06:40:13	@Esteleth Hmmm, it’s a puzzler. I take it Google offers no clues.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 06:23:09	@garwboy …mind you, I’m always impressed by anyone with the Middle name The. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 06:22:41	@garwboy That was inspirational. I have a Greek relative known only as Maria The Communist. Not sure she's as impressive as your great gran
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 06:18:19	@Esteleth Quod is Latin for which or because, and it’s not a UK slang term I know of. Sounds lawyery to me, ask Walton
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 05:38:58	@Esteleth Also: Merry New Thing!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 05:38:39	@Esteleth Go!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 04:07:08	@Julie_B92 Very true!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 04:05:51	@Julie_B92 V true. My mindful state is perhaps not well maintained. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 03:52:17	@Julie_B92 I did too many years of that purely by accident! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 03:50:57	@Julie_B92 But but but awwwww... ...okay. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 03:50:00	@Julie_B92 Because research never ends EVER! And I am doing a number of other things. No rest for the wicked ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 03:49:10	A very intelligent person has brought to my attention the fact I meant Cuba Libre, and not it's zodiacal alternative. First fuck up of 2015
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 03:48:28	@Giliell I think I meant cuba libre! Whoops!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-02 03:38:41	Tonight's drink: A very large Cuba Libra with additional Angostura Bitters. Today's work achievements: Mostly nothing. Car: Buggered
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 18:58:08	@stephenfry Most kind, Mr Fry. And may your 2015 be splendid in all directions.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 18:43:56	@stevyncolgan which is my way of saying Happy New Year!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 18:43:39	@stevyncolgan I’ve done the same. We are colossal let downs. I think this is the first time I haven’t skidded into the NY sideways.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 18:13:29	@LadyFOHF They are not outlaws. Outlaws are wanted. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 07:01:49	@Julie_B92 Happy New Year Julie. Nice coffee! I’ll have one when it’s 2015 properly here ;-) Have a great 2015!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:24:34	@AzaPrins Happy New Year, Freda. I hope it is a spectacular one for you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:19:52	@tkingdoll Well I would, but I want one with an L on it. Happy New Year by the way!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:16:23	@BipolarBlogger You know the days I don’t tell you you make a massive difference to me? You make a massive difference! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:15:15	@garwboy I bet both will be gone before 10. Happy New Year, Dr B.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:13:56	@paulcoxon Have a good one Dr C, it’s been good twittering with you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:12:18	@noodlemaz Merry New Thing, Dr M. I hope the headache vanishes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:10:48	I shall first wish everyone a Happy New Year, and now, before I get tipsy, I shall reveal the shecret… …oh ballsh. Better luck next year.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:09:43	@BipolarBlogger It has to be done. I’ll pre-alert rum stockists when the date is finalised. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:08:45	Dear Twitter, I have discovered the Secret To Eternal Happiness and will tell you as part of my New Year’s Wish to you all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:06:34	@BipolarBlogger We can we can. Is 2015 to be the year of our much lauded Tweetup Platonic Bipolar Date I wonder?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:04:09	@BipolarBlogger …a Happy New Year. I hope things stabilise nicely for you. For starters.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 05:03:35	@BipolarBlogger I don’t understand why you get the grief you do. You’re grand! Anyway, just thought I’d drop in and wish my Twitter Guru…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2015-01-01 00:33:32	@LadyFOHF Oh thanks very much! Most kind. @_aylesbury @StuEkins @sturdyAlex
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-31 20:34:05	@b_magnanti Another unfortunate truth.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-31 20:32:54	@b_magnanti ...you to have every damn thing nailed down.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-31 20:32:43	@b_magnanti I suppose the important question is are you confident of victory? I can imagine you're trepidatious, but also I would expect...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-31 20:30:29	@b_magnanti That's the truth.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-31 20:29:16	@b_magnanti That's, forgive any pun implications, criminal!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-31 20:27:58	@b_magnanti I'll bet you are! Will it really leave you bankrupt win or lose?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-31 20:24:58	@b_magnanti Is it soon? I wish you the best of luck with it...not that I think you'll need it if I'm honest!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-31 05:11:29	@srhbutts @szvan You 3D women. With your Sexuality Powers! {Shakes fist} ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 20:42:46	@caitlinmoran "Your chutneys" is surely some sort of code/euphemism. I demand an enquiry.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 20:00:27	@Exposing_UKIP Must. Try. Harder. Excelsior!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 19:50:41	@RevRichardColes Don't risk it. The modern equivalent of peanut butter and banana topped bacon sandwiches are healthier. Just.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 18:45:06	@garwboy I've chased Mormons with my thesis. Does that count?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 17:58:51	@infurioustoo I don't blame you. I'll work with anyone who'll work with me, but the second they violate basic ethics/social justice...GONE!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 17:52:38	@infurioustoo I prefer the term "Super Magic Hateful Wish Pixie" ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 16:49:27	@LadyFOHF Morn…zzzzzz…Whu? Coffee!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 09:16:38	@robinince Funny. I often end up with a Relevation. I'll get my coat.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 08:05:26	@FuzzCookies I will only nod surreptiously. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 08:03:54	@FuzzCookies If you are willing to tolerate a quick one line book spoiler I'll tell you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 07:40:33	@FuzzCookies @HorzaEdeo Our Australian brethren do favour the Auld Ways in some spheres of human endeavour.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 07:39:28	@HorzaEdeo @FuzzCookies That deserves a round of applause. (My Aussie mate's phrase is "going down like mum on father's day)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 07:33:58	@RevRichardColes I did write to the Museo Reina Sofia regarding a loan, but I fear my creative use of crayons put them off.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 07:29:57	@RevRichardColes It falls in achievable though. My favourite paiting is Guernica. I think I'm in trouble!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 07:13:22	@FuzzCookies Or you're enterprising and adaptive. I'm going with a positive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-30 00:23:11	@untimelygamer @srhbutts @tauriqmoosa Point and laugh?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 10:00:23	@ImprobableJoe I only do that when I'm in real trouble!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 09:59:12	@ImprobableJoe I think I just realised I've thought about this too much.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 09:58:56	@ImprobableJoe Ah but do you have a bedpan in your kitchen? There's more than one way to skin a cat. Or indeed shit whilst making an omlette
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 09:58:08	@JaneyGodley Nah, but I will take a charcoal sketch of you making a five card trick in gin rummy if you've got one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 09:34:22	@FuzzCookies ...the drawer of the night counter, you'll have done us all proud.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 09:34:01	@FuzzCookies Like a boss! Truly you have the style of the professional. If you can accidentally breathe huge clouds of weed smoke through...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 09:32:09	@FuzzCookies Impressive. Are you wearing slippers and what are obviously pajamas under a duffle coat?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 09:30:25	@FuzzCookies All night garage FTW!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 09:30:08	@ImprobableJoe Really don't do those at the same time. Bad things happen. Erm. Allegedly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 08:08:06	@SusanCalman {Sound of chainsaw} {Bloddcurdling scream} Falalalala lah lah lah LAH!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 06:19:28	@OpheliaBenson It is, but at least I trust you to get the jokes!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 05:33:13	@Chemtacular Never believe that conversation was anything other than pure filth from the most innocent origins. I'm deeply ashamed. Or not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 05:31:31	@OpheliaBenson I think under this specific set of circumstances it would be...okay.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 03:06:51	@OpheliaBenson Oh shit I am deeply guilty of that. Admittedly it's only when ranting. I should use Twitlonger (or something else) but forget
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 03:04:05	It is at this point I need to point out the conversation between us was about someone else and was entirely innocent. Mostly. Ish.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 03:03:14	Due to a conversation with my wife, I have an idea that FitBit/other fitness monitors should include a setting for "furious wanking".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:53:00	@OpheliaBenson I'm really good at Twitter. I never go on too long and generally run out of room before I get to the finish of what I am sayi
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:51:02	@OpheliaBenson Well yes, I ran out of characters before I could described the full symptoms!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:50:33	@mistressmatisse Undoubtedly it was necessary. It's odd, here in the UK we (largely) sit about being Very Embarassed by that sort of thing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:11:48	@mistressmatisse Deary me! That's....impressive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:11:29	@ingdamnit Wait, this guy thinks that if I smoke weed I will bake my kid in an oven? But but surely that's inferior vintage red wine?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:10:41	@mistressmatisse Oh dear. Those tend to be funny from people you don't work for. I was hoping for Smooth Appeal coupled to Quiet Authority.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:07:45	@OpheliaBenson For those supercillious folks that think unsolicited advice is a) good and b) needed, I guess that amuses. Dull for me though
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:06:59	@OpheliaBenson Making a fool of myself? In hindsight, rarely. At the time, depends on specific foolishness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:05:09	@OpheliaBenson Oh dear. I have extensive experience in that area!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:04:34	@mistressmatisse I was wondering when that would happen. As a professional, what's your assessment of the CEO's Stare?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:03:54	@OpheliaBenson Those are the fun bits... ...well according to the people who do that kind of thing. I guess.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:02:39	@MiggyMoonbeam My 5 year old son is the same. I'm concerned. I don't want to end every sentence with "...in the world" or casual bigotry. ;)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 02:01:02	@OpheliaBenson Oh now where's the fun in that!? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 01:38:40	@mistressmatisse Great! That always goes well. Better than in-flight movie?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 00:29:25	@jSchwabacher @RealTimeChem Families these days! Tchoh! (and yes, I am kidding, obviously!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 00:20:31	@BenjyNtheMonkey @LiberalIsland But then mocking them up and down is an excellent counter to that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 00:20:08	@BenjyNtheMonkey @LiberalIsland True. I am slightly concerned they've shifted with window of permissable public discourse in a bad direction
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 00:19:40	@jSchwabacher @RealTimeChem Whoa whoa whoa...you LEFT the lab? [/PhD Supervisor] ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 00:16:51	@BenjyNtheMonkey @LiberalIsland ...as far as I'm concerned they are fractally wrong. A collection of OmniMuppets.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 00:16:31	@BenjyNtheMonkey @LiberalIsland Perhaps worryingly I am not sufficiently invested to look too hard for things UKIP are getting right...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 00:10:17	@stavvers He is a colossal arse...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-29 00:08:16	@BenjyNtheMonkey @LiberalIsland Oooh Oooh I know! Being colossal, xenophobic bell-ends. They're really, REALLY good at that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 22:21:42	@LadyFOHF Yeah yeah, you've just left a 19 year old ina puddle of tears and urine, quaking in fear, and you expect me to believe that. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 22:19:20	@LadyFOHF Hurrah! Let no 19 year old go un-bollocked! And there was much rejoicing... albeit quietly and at a reasonable time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 22:10:14	@WomenDefyUKIP Surely you mean "a year of sluts who are destroying marriage and causing economic chaos with uncleaned fridge recesses"? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 22:05:32	@LadyFOHF Sounds like a plan!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 22:04:28	@LadyFOHF ^much ammo. Dagnabit I am truly illiterate today. I blame, erm, sobriety...Santa...something!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 22:03:53	@LadyFOHF ...ammunition to procure their immediate and rapid downfall.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 22:03:36	@LadyFOHF Oooh weed...erm...I mean {does disapproving look} It's a shame when someone does something obnoxious and gives one quite so...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 22:02:30	@LadyFOHF ...a campaign of bombing. I am something of a diplomat. {Buffs medals}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 22:02:12	@LadyFOHF Is it a smoke free area? If not, set them on fire. It is the reasonable response. I tend to start at conflagraton and work up...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 22:01:23	@LadyFOHF DAMMIT! How did I miss that? Oh dear it's going to be one of THOSE days again isn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 22:00:57	@LiberalIsland Wow! I think that wins today's "{Wink and gun} Stay Classy" award!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 21:59:41	@LadyFOHF Borrowing something or annoucing an all night party with dubstep and jungle* to be played at 100dB? *I don't know what these are
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 21:31:50	@Herring1967 Your only hope is to repeatedly tweet "You're fired!" at him until he blocks you. (Or even better: "Your fired!")
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 21:29:46	@Herring1967 That is a potentially unsanitary urinal practise. Perhaps look into changing that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 05:09:45	@koenig_jakob @MitchBenn Ah good, it seems we as a society have our values about right… …Wait a minute! It’s April Fools, surely?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 05:07:44	@IamJadehawk I know. Well it was nice knowing you. Think we’ll if me, I died doing what I loved, being cheeky at inappropriate times.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 05:06:44	@DrNerdLove that would have been so much funnier if I could spell wing
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 05:06:22	@DrNerdLove But how shall we sing it, O Lord? /Monty Python
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 05:05:26	@IamJadehawk I feel brave for even typing that. Tomorrow is my day to provide coffee. I am proposing a Change to the System.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 05:03:00	@IamJadehawk but but but awwww. Okay. Can he have a word with my wife? I’d like a coffee tomorrow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 05:02:14	@VanguardVivian Q: how do you know your friend has an iPhone? A: they tell you. I think that sums the issue up. He says on his iPhone.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-28 05:00:16	@IamJadehawk that’s good boyfriend. Have him scrubbed and sent to my quarters.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-27 04:01:42	@MittenDAmour Ah good. It’s so hard to maintain good old fashioned standards in the modern age.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-27 03:47:29	@LadyFOHF That, at least, is reasonable. There’s some sloe gin here I’ve been looking at meaningfully.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-27 03:43:48	@LadyFOHF Oh holy hell! That’s criminal!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-27 03:40:19	@MittenDAmour How about a hagfish having a furtive fumble in a bucket of lube?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-26 00:03:00	@LadyFOHF For two? Have I mentioned lately that I perform tricks for gin. Okay they are crap tricks and the gin usually is donated from pity
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-26 00:01:09	@MittenDAmour Truly unto us an utter knobhead is born…again. I expect unfortunately profitable muppetry in the new year.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 23:49:06	@tauriqmoosa My pony was brown. BROWN! What is this? Affirmative action? I asked for a grey pony. GREY!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 23:44:24	I’m beginning to feel unwelcome. There is neither coffee nor rum in my parents’ house. Is this a human rights violation?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 23:41:21	@BipolarBlogger Top work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 23:14:43	Next year I’m going skiing Her Maj has inspired fresh jingoism in the relatives. I may have accidentally have let slip something about irony

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 22:25:50	@MittenDAmour I shall be doing things with a stinking bishop that beggar belief. But enough about my private life, back to cheese…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 22:22:08	@FuzzCookies Thank you! Finally someone speaks sense.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 22:21:35	@MittenDAmour I’ve got Gorgonzola delicately rubbed about my person. {waggles eyebrows}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 22:20:31	@BipolarBlogger Merry Benzomas! (I was on the buggers two days ago. Hangover now largely gone)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:21:32	@BipolarBlogger Family of restrauteurs, I have no choice! I’m in mum’s kitchen under her beady eye. Underperforming will result in comments!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:17:03	@BipolarBlogger …moderate Farage style EU loathing, and a soupçon of vilification of the poor and disabled. I also have only just started>
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:16:09	@BipolarBlogger I’ve done me forcemeat, sage and onion, veg prep and the turkey’s in (we eat late). Only endured minor Daily Mail racism…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:14:47	@clinteas Responsible. You are a paragon of top drawer parenting, sir. I may be augmenting the chemistry set…when my wife’s not looking.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:11:59	@clinteas Ah encouraging the lad into the War on Terror. I’m doing the same, just with a chemistry set.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:09:55	@clinteas Helicopter? Life size? Impressive. Medics get a decent wage in Oz ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:09:12	@LadyFOHF Win! Good pressies. I’m looking forward to giving my son his chemistry set. It is in no way a pressie for me. {ahem}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:06:34	@clinteas I shall bravely take up your fallen glass and manfully struggle on with booze. No, no. No need to thank me. (Merry Thing)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:03:12	@BipolarBlogger We will, of course, work nutmeg into a rum based cocktail. It will be done.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:02:36	@BipolarBlogger Finally!! I’m not alone. Love the stuff.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:01:54	@BipolarBlogger {Xmas hugs}* * Same as normal hugs, just with nutmeg and tinsel.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 21:01:04	@tauriqmoosa Mind you, MRA GamerGate Krampus did give me a copy of Titties and Ethics in Games Journalism For Bitch Haters.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 20:59:24	@tauriqmoosa Feminist Santa took my copy of GTA V and replaced it with My Little Simone De Beauvoir: Treating Women Like People Is Magic.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 18:34:06	@mrjamesob Yeah, Short Circuit is better. Merry Christmas.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 08:20:26	@stevyncolgan Ask for world peace, more likely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 08:19:47	@tauriqmoosa In many ways yes. And in so many more ways, no probably not. I didn’t want to violate your games journalist ethics.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 08:17:02	@LadyFOHF typical! Bloody naive scientist, I should have trained as a lawyer!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 08:16:21	@depressednotsad I think I’ll send you a bucket of hugs (international unit of hugs?). I think you need them
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 08:14:37	@LadyFOHF Does one order racism? I’ve always found it is generously provided gratis.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 08:13:26	@paulcoxon Your worrying hood obsession continues apace I note. Mind you, standards must be upheld, have a word.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 08:00:48	@depressednotsad they’re hiding the Drs at this time of year. Home soon sounds good though. Best of luck.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 07:56:24	@stevyncolgan there were three wise men in a Pret? And a virgin??? Unlikely. This is a recycled joke, please pass it on accordingly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 07:53:57	@depressednotsad now this gallbladder lark, is this on the mend, are you surrounded by happy doctors giving you the all clear?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 07:52:47	@depressednotsad … Family punchbag. Trouble is I tend to give as good as I get, so almighty rucks are likely. Hence why I try to avoid.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 05:33:37	@FromTheLabBench wow! That is amazing. Superb work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 05:30:04	Okay despite previous anger/bah humbuggery I am truly excited about one thing this Christmas My wife and have bought our son a chemistry set
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 05:27:19	@hrtbps @Doubting_Tom yeah but I reckon a woman has a real shot at playing George Eliot. Mind you it would be political correctness gone mad
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 05:02:38	@oolon but seriously, merry thing, Oolon. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 05:02:10	@oolon I get homeopathy and casual racism. It’s both very dilute and very concentrated bullshit! Luckily I have alcohol!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 03:51:39	@Skepticat_UK I could, but it seems harsh to do so over the turkey. Debrett is silent on the correct time for intrafamilial despair.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 01:01:26	To all in twinkly Twitter land, a very merry thing and a happy other thing. And may Satan bring you all you desire. ...I think that's right
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 00:59:59	And may they also learn to tolerate their aggressive, pendantic, angry, scientist son. Who is without error. Forever and ever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 00:58:08	Hope that, yay, though I go into a den of UKIP loving Daily Mail reading worshippers of the EDL, that I may remember that I love them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-25 00:57:05	Dear Twitter, I go now to familial pastures. Grant me the strength not to commit homicide and a strange adoration of passive aggression.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-24 22:53:56	But seriously, I hope all of you have wonderful festive periods. Mine's just taken a turn for the relentlessly rubbish.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-24 22:52:46	@DramaLlama85 Hmmmm. Tempting. I think I might just hide under the duvet and pretend people don't exist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-24 22:47:47	@depressednotsad Thank you. I'll let everyone know.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-20 21:44:04	@CCriadoPerez And by "big old lad" I mean shoulders. I realise this is Twitter and filth occurs. But I'm a good boy, my mummy said so.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-20 21:43:02	@CCriadoPerez I genuinely don't get it. Why is it hard to sit in a tube seat? I'm a big old lad and I try to shrink to let people sit down.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-20 07:52:33	@paulcoxon @Chemjobber I'm trying to decide whether to parse that as fumehood, neighbourhood, or hood for academic robes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-20 07:51:48	@stevyncolgan It has been for purely medicinal purposes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-20 07:51:04	@stevyncolgan I'd wait ten mins, say morning all, possibly with a flourish. But then I have been drinking.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-18 01:24:52	@ImprobableJoe @lousycanuck Well it's not about "sides" is it? Treating humans with decency necessarily includes everyone. Some people...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-18 01:23:35	@lousycanuck @ImprobableJoe THAT's the term I was looking for!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-18 01:22:55	@TheOnlyGuru @LordPVB @paulscallylgl So you are saying that it's Pauls who are to blame? Never liked them. Paul Daniels ruined them for me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-18 01:21:54	@lousycanuck I'm not a fan of these "put real people into games to be killed" things either. They're...I'm going with "a bit yuck".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-18 01:20:02	@lousycanuck It isn't okay. It's misogyny. There. That was really easy. Honestly, you're going to have to find harder questions.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-18 00:20:46	@stevyncolgan I like to think it was meant to be "a bit Yewtree" but accidentally found a more amusing target @tweetyaca
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-18 00:16:08	@stevyncolgan Went to door with 5 yr old son, heard them playing Glitter and, in words of youth, thought they were "a bit UKIP" @tweetyaca
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-17 23:59:23	@stevyncolgan I had exactly this happen last night. @tweetyaca
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-17 23:54:16	@stevyncolgan Tragically not mine. But I can't remember whose.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-17 23:53:44	@stevyncolgan I found a copy of the sex offenders register the other day. It was a 1970s copy of the Radio Times.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-17 23:33:36	@Peter_Tennant @bengoldacre You'll be hoping for a paperback then.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-17 22:21:33	@tkingdoll @AdamRutherford @bengoldacre It's got to be better than people who retweet their own praise.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-17 22:19:53	@bengoldacre I've made it compulsory for all people to have your new book. I just need an effective method of enforcement...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-17 22:19:00	@bengoldacre Unless I am grossly mistaken there are 3 books. Or do we have buy ALL the editions? That might be trickier.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-17 22:17:22	@bengoldacre There is only one solution: Write more books.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-17 22:17:11	@bengoldacre I've tried but the people I know who need your books are scared of books. The people I know who would like your books have them

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 19:13:07	@bdogrunner @debecca There is no aspect of human existence unsullied by victim blaming and woo. It's a matter of degree.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:37:56	@Julie_B92 ...after I say this: just know that if you ever need any help or support, I'm there for you however you need me to be. Even if...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:37:21	@Julie_B92 Hi X, I can't help noticing you've put on weight. Obviously I'm concerned, but that's not your problem. I'm going to butt out...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:36:37	@Julie_B92 It's FUCKING HARD to do this, especially as a close relative for all the reasons, but limit yourself to saying something like...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:35:07	@garwboy No, but I have been experimenting. I took some Nurofen Plus the other day and went on a bit of an ethnic cleanse. Be warned.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:34:09	@Julie_B92 ...than to come across as judgemental. Even accidentally. And given the way fat people are dealt with socially, most things...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:33:32	@Julie_B92 ...thing is what helps is actually counterintuitive. It's better to be there silently, perhaps after one explicit acknowledgment
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:32:53	@Julie_B92 Oh I doubt it's easy for you! Especially if whinging is occurring and the answer is "YOU'RE FAT! DUMMY!". The rather tricky...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:30:08	@b_magnanti Yah but did you know I only eat organic, hand ensmuggened gluten free, fruitarian air love food? {Actual sentence...possibly}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:25:47	@Julie_B92 Tell me about it! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:25:01	@Julie_B92 Maybe those aren't excuses, maybe they're subtle hints that intervention is not desired. None so blind etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:24:21	@Julie_B92 ...or at least complicate weight management.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:24:03	@Julie_B92 Fair enough. I ask because of things like polycystic ovaries, or use of antipsychotics etc. All of which can cause weight gain
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:22:35	@Julie_B92 True, there are scales. The question about any intervention is how likely it is to do any good. And it's REALLY hard to do good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:21:39	@Julie_B92 I ask because there are reasons (beyond gluttony etc) that may underlie weight gain and can be extremely personal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:20:24	@Julie_B92 It's complex. First is this fictional person totally not in any way real but entirely hypothetical, male or female?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 18:19:03	@Julie_B92 Don't! They probably know.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 17:37:54	@DramaLlama85 Ah but I didn't. And that's what counts. I'm the centre of the universe, my mummy said so. (She REALLY didn't!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-16 17:35:13	@DramaLlama85 Ahhh but your excellent tweets have been seen far more often. So there's that.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-14 03:23:32	@FuzzCookies I’ve gone from worrying myself with horrendous images to amusing myself with potential comments from the OAPorn audience.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-14 03:20:58	@FuzzCookies Mind you, the idea of some cheery old dear giving tips and commentary amuses. So it’s not all bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-14 03:19:52	@FuzzCookies …enjoyment overlaid with the noise of a well sucked Werther’s original The smell of lube and Vicks. All wrong. I’m off to drink
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-14 03:18:37	@FuzzCookies I’m getting over the horrendous mental image at the moment. The combination of sounds is particularly grim. The sound of fake..

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 21:31:34	@RugbyPodcast He's no Nigel Owens.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 18:54:35	@DramaLlama85 YES! Also, anything, ANYTHING, on "recovery" should define it with great detail and care.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 03:04:56	@JessTheChemist @AWTaylor83 I've just hit 40. My liver cackles at me from the corner of its box.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 02:46:53	@JessTheChemist @AWTaylor83 I am deeply envious. I remember those days. Days when my liver was not a scarred, blackened, diamond hard lump.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 02:44:04	@JessTheChemist @AWTaylor83 Mine was yesterday. Gaze upon my hangover and despair!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 02:18:05	@Chemtacular No apologies necessary. I didn't spell hangover with an extra, unnecessary "u". ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 02:02:43	@Chemtacular Similar items are being procured. (Ginger ale and fish and chips. UK specific choices!) I've given in!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 01:50:32	Good game, hangover, good game. But I will foil your tricksy plans. Quick, liver! To the greasy food!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 01:49:47	Ohhh hangover! How cunning you are. Fresh air, water, a COX-2 inhibitor, and an alkaloid convinced me I was fine. And then you came back.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 01:39:08	@michaellegge It's sad they have to be selfies, because this sums up my reaction: http:// reactiongifs.com/?p=23130
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 01:25:12	@AlexFGoldberg @BRSM_blog By that logic I am an expert in manufacturing road surfaces.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 00:56:58	@IMLahart @bengoldacre I've always thought Rob Newman is an excellent comedian, and yes, Jarvis is a rather creepy satire.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 00:50:30	@bengoldacre @IMLahart I am also reading the paper in the voice of Rob Newman's "Jarvis". It helps. https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=-1E9PZ QKklQ …
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 00:46:37	@bengoldacre @IMLahart 7 men and 4 women in the study? Okay I'm not touching that joke with a ten foot pole.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 00:41:19	@AdamRutherford @ProfBrianCox Okay, so I'm behind the times. And a bit envious!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 00:29:05	@the_author_ Oh you've seen that. It's remarkably unconvincing. Now if they'd included a rainbow unicorn and a dragon, totally legit! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 00:27:54	@LadyFOHF Maybe we should bang the side of Kent and swear at it. I find that can help too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 00:03:50	The combination of easing hangover, lessening hepatic distress, and low grade opioids is causing Friday afternoon oddness. Zounds!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-13 00:02:46	Apropos of nothing I demand that all people approve of @feliciaday and all she does. Refusal or rebellion will be punished by sulking.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 23:55:01	@BipolarBlogger Very good choices. I had neither available, so I made do with what was to hand.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 23:54:34	And now freed from their vile embrace I can now spend the afternoon and evening attempting to do the things I put off this morning!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 23:53:45	By the power of nurofen plus and coffee I am restored! The hideous alcohol metabolites in my veins have ceased their wicked clamour.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 23:52:14	@scalzi Putting two spaces after a full stop is morally wrong on all levels. Come the revolution, those people will be shot.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 23:51:36	@scalzi Yes we do this, we also kick kittens, and we're overly critical of that thing you like. In a manner that is a little too personal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 23:38:05	Possibly with crisps.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 23:37:56	I shall now engage all my diverse resource entities into a paradigm buggering superwhole which will deliver benefits to stakeholders.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 23:37:04	I have successfully integrated my parental responsibilities and an educational nativiterised stream into one coherent solution. Excelsior!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 21:08:11	@stevyncolgan Yup. I'll call you when my friend gets back to me. I can do half a job, but I'm too sciencey. I'm employing his services too!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 21:06:24	@stevyncolgan Okay, good. I'll get my friend Ben along who's the relevant expert. I take it the Bootlegger is easiest for you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 21:05:16	@stevyncolgan Oh it's totally okay. I'm trying to find an evening to do a CV thing with you at the mo. Any suggestions?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 21:04:27	I may pluck the low hanging fruit whilst actioning some visibility enhancing platforms. I will, of course, be busting old paradigms/
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 21:02:56	I'm off to synergise some aqueous cleansing modalities and cutting-edge implementation strategies before engaging in an intrafamilial boost.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 21:00:25	Now I am worried. I've just had an email containing epic Business Jargon Bullshit and it made sense This hangover has taken a surreal turn
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:57:43	@boodleoops I couldn't agree more. Case in point: hateful attacks on appearance of female political opponents. It's still damned misogyny!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:56:07	@Jo_Caulfield Εγώ δεν το πάρει
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:52:37	@robinince That baffled me too. (Although current state of bafflement is high)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:51:18	@DramaLlama85 I want to see the "Punch Service Users in the face screaming "SCROUNGER!"" control group.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:50:04	I have decided to turn off the Low Performance Brain. It is letting me down. I also have a nativity play to go and watch.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:44:39	I realise that is not a novel or tricky insight, it is all Low Performance Brain is capable of right now, but it is confusing me as to why.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:44:02	1) I drank too much last night 2) My brain is rebelling 3) We live in a world where depictions of violence are lauded and orgasms deplored.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:42:38	@RevRichardColes It's very Freudian.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:42:28	@RevRichardColes Yes. You must acknowledge their restraint as they refrain from crushing you beneath the wheels of their overcompensation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:41:03	Low Performance Brain is convinced that three membered heterocycles mean that women's orgasms should be front page news. Damn you, Brain!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:39:29	Current low performance brain understanding of Important News is: Brand and Farage are fighting the tyranny of face sitting with iridium.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:37:20	This hangover is preventing me reading a truly interesting article about a novel synthesis of aziridines with even basic comprehension.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 20:15:09	@CCriadoPerez It makes 50% of the witty chants really hard to hear. Tactical!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 19:48:15	@AdamRutherford I think you win. I got Ming. Which is less a character and more a comment on how hungover I am and what aroma surrounds me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 19:39:24	@CCriadoPerez Fantastic. I'll add it to the list!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 19:38:34	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 @rabbitsoup_zola Oh yes. There was a rum/cider/angostura cocktail available. I have only myself to blame.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 19:30:34	@DramaLlama85 @rabbitsoup_zola @BipolarBlogger Oops didn't mean to RT that. Nothing wrong with it, I'm just hungover and incompetent. Sorry!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 19:28:09	@CCriadoPerez OOOOH! When's it out?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 02:20:56	@NeilDenham1978 ...so emails etc, tomorrow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 02:20:48	@NeilDenham1978 Henley's nice and central. I had a word with the South Street people in Reading to get an idea of costs etc. I'm off out now
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 01:38:47	@somegreybloke A drug? (Medical, obv)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 01:05:15	@MirtarNoise @paulcoxon Small mercies!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 00:10:20	It's nice to see that an issue like breastfeeding really does act as a litmus test for antediluvian numpities.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 00:07:34	@IAmPippaEvans I wholeheartedly endorse this method!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 00:07:07	I never promised to be a good person.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 00:06:38	Things I need to do for my mental health: 1) Spend more time outside 2) Get more exercise 3) Be more present/mindful 4) Throttle morons
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 00:02:18	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 ...sure we know what the hell is going on in this convo but I'm enjoying it. It's always good to talk to Llama
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 00:01:34	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 Ah there you are! Great post today btw. I got distracted before I could tell you that. To be fair, I'm not..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-12 00:00:13	@DramaLlama85 Oh those are good too!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:56:58	@DramaLlama85 Rugby, martial arts and skating for years and years. I had a youth/early adulthood that was like an episode of Jackass
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:54:35	@DramaLlama85 And I am sure it is worse than that btw, I am in no way doubting you!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:54:20	@DramaLlama85 OUCH! I've broken ribs, arm, collar bone, toe, nose and leg (just tib). They all hurt. If this is worse than all that....WOW!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:52:17	@DramaLlama85 That sounds very painful if I'm honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:52:05	@DramaLlama85 Okay! If your pain is at the "broken bone" level, I'm taking back the thought that this is at the "meh" end of the scale! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:49:08	@paulcoxon Improper PPE, he's heading for RSI doing it like that What the hell is he doing contaminating plates that way? GET OUT OF MY LAB!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:46:52	@DramaLlama85 Phew. I know they can be nasty, but as with most things there's a spectrum from "meh" to "YIKES"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:45:18	@DramaLlama85 Oh crikey, Llama! That's awful!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:44:09	@DramaLlama85 Yikes! Gallstones are v nasty.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:43:13	@Telegraph @clairecohen1 @Emmabarnett Shortly to be followed by "Get a punch in the gob from an ex-friend you judgemental scum day". Harsh?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:42:22	@DramaLlama85 I recognise all of that. The harm angle is rarely explored.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:29:44	@stephengdavey @photonharvester @Chemjobber I saw it, but likewise am sceptical that one week's work would be 20 hrs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:23:22	@photonharvester @Chemjobber Apologies. As redundancy and career change loom, I am becoming a wee bit more sarcastic!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:22:24	@DramaLlama85 It's a colossal stressor. Which leads me to... ...yup... ...eat and get fatter! DERP!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:21:59	@DramaLlama85 True. I *do* mind being fat (not politically. THAT I don't hve an issue with. I get it), but because I wasn't as a younger guy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:21:00	@photonharvester @Chemjobber ...oh no wait, it's the other thing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:20:43	@photonharvester @Chemjobber Yup. All my ex-colleagues from Pfizer's Sandwich closure in 2011 are really well employed and not struggling...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:20:08	@DramaLlama85 That's an idea. I think for me to say it means I am 90% there, but it's the next bit that's tough.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:19:18	@photonharvester @Chemjobber Frankly if I could stay doing research I'd sell my nana! (Okay my nana is long dead, but I'll negotiate!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:17:41	@photonharvester @Chemjobber It isn't okay, and if that job were up the road in the UK, I'd apply. THAT'S how shitty the situation is.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:15:51	@DramaLlama85 ...I vocalised my suspicions. What's trauma/substance misuse group like? Useful?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:15:24	@DramaLlama85 I'm not sure I'm convinced yet (as in, have I internalised it? Hmm) but the people near me in the know were like "YES!" when..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:14:40	@DramaLlama85 I remember those days. Now? No.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:13:06	@Anarcha_Chav I've been applying for a species transfer. I figured a few years as a bonobo would be nice.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:11:13	@DramaLlama85 Is there another way to eat crisps? The only way I know how is with self loathing!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:10:45	@DramaLlama85 ...I think I might have been in denail a bit. Oops.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:10:32	@DramaLlama85 ...disorder. It's way beyond a bit of greed or indulgence. My wife (and also my psychologist) have basically said "FINALLY!"..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:09:34	@DramaLlama85 I *think* the avenues of self destruction I used to use are mostly shut down. But I am gradually admitting I have an eating...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:08:53	@caitlinmoran I turned 40 the other day and suddenly found a deep enjoyment of quality stationary. I don't know if that helps. It's worrying
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:06:26	@DramaLlama85 Tell you what, I'll avoid both! Now if I can get my self harm/self medicating with food under control...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:05:13	@DramaLlama85 The only appeal is I hear it suppresses appetite and makes one thin.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:02:32	@DramaLlama85 Well, I don't smoke. It is almost the only vice I've never had.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 23:02:16	@DramaLlama85 (Serious face: I'm totally fine and not in a state where caffeine = trouble) I'd love to be capable of all those things.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:58:20	@Giliell I feel like I've let you all down.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:58:03	@DramaLlama85 A feeling I know only too well. Although bipolar and caffeine can occasionally be not good friends. Nah. Screw it! Coffee!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:57:11	@bblace Some of those things might not be entirely true. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:56:41	@DramaLlama85 No! I've seen the error of my ways. I'll drink some, I'll drink some!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:56:11	@chiara84 I think I may drink some coffee on principle.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:55:51	@paulcoxon Insufficiently fawning. Perhaps we could get a live feed of Nigel's colonoscopy with suitably gushing commentary from Dimbleby.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:54:59	@DramaLlama85 I'm scared. Hold me!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:54:51	@chiara84 The one and only truest and best answer!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:54:29	@bblace Okay so there may have been a teeeensy bit of crack. And adrenaline. Injected into my heart. And atropine. And a cocaine enema.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:51:49	Ladies and Gentlemen, today I have accomplished many hours of work without, I repeat, without the aid of caffeine. KNEEL BEFORE ME!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:50:42	@garwboy Fuck that. Fuck Christmas. Bah fucking humbug. Does it show I tried to do some meatspace shopping earlier?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:50:05	@infuriousbeauty I am cursed with a particularly virulent strain.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:48:23	@infuriousbeauty Yes. {That was me shutting up and listening! ;-) )
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:48:03	@infuriousbeauty ...in addition to some fairly good ones. I.e. SIWOTI syndrome for good and ill!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:47:40	@infuriousbeauty It *IS* very one way here (and elsewhere) at times. I imagine there are a welter of nasty psychological reasons for that...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:47:22	I'm recording tonight's Question Time so I can watch it later. For the same reasons that Romans used to watch bloodsports in the Colosseum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:44:57	Beard Baubles. Farage on Question Time with Brand. Dogs and cats, living together. Mass Hysteria. You heard it here first.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:43:28	@infuriousbeauty ...educate me! With a lot of help from decent folk along the way. One seriously tough lesson: shut up and listen. V Hard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:43:00	@infuriousbeauty Oh I have (nearly) ALL THE PRIVILEGE! I was destined to be a clueless shitlord! But the Fates and Irony conspired to...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:42:07	@NeilDenham1978 Hi Neil, yes it was also good to see you yesterday too. i need to send some SiTP reminders today too, so I'll do an email.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:40:34	@infuriousbeauty ....that it's taken me >20 years to sort some of my toxic shit out. And I often don't even manage it now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:40:02	@infuriousbeauty ...grateful to the people kind enough to beat me with the cluestick (it's really not their job) and try to remember...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-11 22:39:20	@infuriousbeauty I think about this a lot because I was that 20 something... ..."was", Louis? I continually fuck up now. I'm very...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:14:07	@EmSilverwood @WomenDefyUKIP Well quite. I mean, now Big Nige has spoken, don't you feel a little daft for believing you had autonomy like..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:13:30	@chiara84 ...brim full with limitless joy and possibility.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:13:13	@chiara84 I am wondering what the fuck was in my coffee. Although I don't think this can go far enough. Taking the piss out of Farage is...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:12:12	@EmSilverwood @WomenDefyUKIP ....rockets, dinosaurs! Oooh everything's better with dinosaurs!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:11:53	@EmSilverwood @WomenDefyUKIP ...I have to say I think the sky's the limit, Dadist Ostetatious Breastfeeding protests for example. Clowns...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:11:14	@EmSilverwood @WomenDefyUKIP Well I can't advocate for the "naked" part because titillation etc, but that could be one theme song...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:10:23	...be improved by further ostentation. Non-titillating ostentation of course. But high mockery. Think Cirque de Soleil with breastfeeding.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:09:00	I've been to die ins, sit ins, marches, protests, vigls and more. I know there has to have been a "breastfeed-in" protest. This can only...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:06:01	@GrrlScientist I think there is unexploited potential here. After all, brestfeeding can be made way more ostentatious. Mariachi band?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:04:14	@chiara84 I mean, the Power Lift-Ostentatious Breastfeeding category alone would raise eyebrows.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:03:25	@JonnyJapes1 @WomenDefyUKIP I've already proposed Synchronised Ostentatious Breastfeeding for Olympics 2024. I am writing to the IOC
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:02:51	@chiara84 ...the full gamut of breastfeeding possibilities.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:02:34	@chiara84 At least. I feel that, like for example, equine events, there could be a variety of Ostentatious Breastfeeding sports that run...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 19:01:27	Ooooh further ostentatious breastfeeding idea: Women with twins, one on each boob, make babies twirl, vary direction of twirl. Add sparklers
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 18:59:26	@WomenDefyUKIP Frankly, all the breastfeeding mothers I've seen have been insufficiently ostentatious. I demand cartwheels and fireworks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 18:58:50	@WomenDefyUKIP My brain is doing "ostentatious breastfeeding" things. There is SO much potential. I think some form of gymnastics...minimum
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 18:56:52	@chiara84 Oh I know. Things like breathing, exisiting...that sort of ostentation
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 18:55:57	Oooooh Synchronised Ostentatious Breastfeeding. Olympics 2024. You heard it here first.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 18:55:15	...I know women (esp. mothers) have enough to do, but frankly I don't think breastfeeding is ostentatious enough. Up your game, ladies!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 18:54:11	My brain is currently imagining "ostentatious breastfeeding". I'm thinking fanfare, some sort of twirling, juggling baby and bottle...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-05 18:37:16	I am embarrassed to share a clade with Nigel Farage. I fear platyhelminths are looking down on me. Cover him with a cloth.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-02 16:50:13	@ehdannyboy Yeah but do you use brown or red sauce? I can put the cat thing down to style, but the sauce choice matters.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-02 16:49:12	@susie_dent …and proper vocab at dawn when you’ve been roused far too early can be tricky.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-02 16:48:41	@susie_dent Surely this is because, when one has thrown the remote control at one’s sleep destroying songster, one has to ask for it back…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-02 00:35:19	@AdamRutherford I'm sorry people are on the receiving end of racism, I'm also sorry that the second anyone is anti-racist this shit happens.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-01 20:09:41	@somegreybloke I remember Brass Eye well. It hits the problem on the head.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-01 20:05:53	@somegreybloke And frankly that amuses me so much I just cannot proceed with any intellectual analysis beyond that point.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-01 20:05:25	@somegreybloke At some point, some serious professionals had to sit in a room together and say something like "not past the last knuckle"

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-01 19:39:12	@chiara84 That is an excellent point. Although, we ARE humans, and (given current levels of cynicism) decent is a pretty good bar!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-01 18:38:49	@gravbeast I think pinching their cheeks on this one is acceptable.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-01 06:28:45	@EvoPhD @Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan I have an excess of cynicism regarding the holiday season. I think I can make candles from it! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-12-01 06:23:54	@EvoPhD @Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Whoa! Mulled wine wine rum? Who needs cider? I’m imagining it causes vapour trails.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-30 21:07:23	@TheOnlyGuru I hate to waste people's valuable time. After all, I might be mistaken as celebrating this vomit filled paean to consumerism.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-30 21:03:58	@TheOnlyGuru I say "ringtone", I mean answerphone message, phone cover, current T-shirt, and message I employed the sky-wirter for.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-28 20:42:45	@robinince @michaellegge Just one instance per episode so far. I checked it really is there by reviewing. I promise I'm not making it up
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-28 20:42:05	@robinince @michaellegge The Vitriola podcast (from ep 2 so far) has a whispered "I will kill you" over it. I promise I am not hallucinating

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-28 19:24:00	@marcuschown It's like no one has ever heard of John Maynard Keynes, the Great Depression and what worked in the past. Weird...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-28 19:23:13	@paulcoxon I remember when it was about worshipping Adam Smith and renouncing the works of John Maynard Keynes. Now it's crass commercialism

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-28 19:15:02	@robinince You must buy more things. Otherwise we cannot sustain infinite commercial growth on a finite planet. Get a catalogue and buy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-28 19:13:31	@TheRightArticle @marcuschown I can't imagine how hard that is to do. Working AND lazing around at the same time. That takes some effort.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:12:21	@sazza_jay How dare anyone pay ~£2500 extra tax on a £2m property when there are scum, lounging around with an extra bedroom? OUTRAGE! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:11:13	@DramaLlama85 Do I get big boy trousers now?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:10:20	@DramaLlama85 And yes, MH medicine demands a...dirty word forthcoming...a..."holistic" approach... ARGH I SAID IT I SAID IT!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:09:39	@DramaLlama85 Yup. The analogy I use is MH medicine is like cardiology in the late 1700s. (Okay, not THAT bad...we do know a few things)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:06:43	@DramaLlama85 I know, I'm being silly. Setting the sea on fire, honestly! There will have to be some form of specifically designed lake.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:05:50	@DramaLlama85 ...poorly funded, poorly understood (in general) area of medicine. Which can also harm (and does)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:05:22	@DramaLlama85 Yup, there's a great deal of evidence that these things work. The problem I have is that they're applied simply, in a very...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:04:40	@DramaLlama85 There's no excuse for homoeopaths. When I am in power they will be flogged and driven into the sea. Which will be on fire. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:03:40	@DramaLlama85 ...or in other words, some form of mental illness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:03:22	@DramaLlama85 ...genuinely afraid of how drugs and CBT (two best examples) are used for people with really complex biopyschosocial issues...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:02:40	@DramaLlama85 The thing that terrifies me is not the "building things on sand", I know it's not sand, it's how things are used. So I am...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:01:54	@DramaLlama85 But again, I know you know all this...so I'll shut up and stop splaining! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 19:01:36	@DramaLlama85 There's lots of really interesting (and 140 char unfriendly!) medicine around the placebo effect. It's not strictly "nothing"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 18:56:34	@DramaLlama85 ...that can minimise confounding factors. Psychodynamic therapy [for example] is less easy to reduce)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-27 18:55:55	@DramaLlama85 <at the very least. Not only that, but CBT is remarkably algorithmic, as you know, and thus easy to administer in a fashion...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 19:29:10	@Julie_B92 @MCeeP It's one of those "well they're both bad" situations. (Or at least they both have negative aspects)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 19:28:21	@Julie_B92 @MCeeP I don't think it is!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 19:28:09	@Julie_B92 @MCeeP And maybe it's that funding mechanism that needs alteration/flexibility. I'm a pluralist. Pubs = Good, thesis = Good
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 19:27:16	@Julie_B92 @MCeeP Oh with this is 100% agree! I may go to 110% for extra truthiness! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 19:26:47	@Julie_B92 @MCeeP I think that's a good point. It certainly a useful idea in those terms.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 19:26:17	@Julie_B92 @MCeeP ...the idea that publishing is all has its drawbacks (obv) esp given the CV padding pubs that get out there.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 18:25:13	@marcusbrig I tried a double Norwich once. THAT took some explaining.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 02:34:01	@ShappiKhorsandi perfectly reasonable. I use a rolled up newspaper on them. I find racists respond well to a tap on the nose and a firm "no"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 02:20:21	@JosieLong Nationalised rail, nationalised energy, if we could halt the privatisation of the NHS by selling it to the French... ...wait. Oh
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 02:17:50	@robinince I have long believed the North to be a lie. I mean, flat caps? Whippets? Hot pot? It's far fetched nonsense.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 02:16:43	@JosieLong They're renationalising the rail...just with the wrong nation?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 00:48:39	@stevyncolgan There's probably a joke about Chuck Norris and only allowing retweets in there or something, but he's not worth it. He's a git
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-26 00:34:37	@pattonoswalt I was wondering when this aspect would come up. Eddie Murphy's bit from the 80's needs an appropriate update.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 19:57:01	@noodlemaz That’s bad. I had a slightly misspelled “really” corrected to “orally” the other day. It changed the meaning a bit
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 18:00:32	@salihughes A man needs a comofrt blanket once in a while... ...what do you mean it's a scarf?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 17:59:54	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 @nuwandiss And even the animal activists and homoeopathy people have given me positive reviews! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 17:59:27	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 @nuwandiss I've given a (very rough and rapid) talk about basic chemistry and drug design to a few BPUK groups

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 02:01:00	@JohnOttaway @ProfFrancesca @LucyKafanov Tragically this results in "serious interfaith dialogue" which involves some killing of scientists
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:44:16	@BipolarBlogger My mistake. I had it in my head that you'd had longer periods of stability in that time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:42:02	@BipolarBlogger ..had periods of stability etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:41:50	@BipolarBlogger I suppose I was usuing a very different definition of "Okay" and "worked". My mistake. I had the impression you'd had...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:33:37	@BipolarBlogger Yeah you’re right. I meant okay from the perspective that it had worked reasonably well long term from what you’ve said
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:32:13	@BipolarBlogger I know THAT feeling. The sense of inevitability, that you are being run, combined.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:31:36	@BipolarBlogger I have not gone onto those sites very often. When I have they’ve discouraged me more than helped me do anything rash
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:30:35	@BipolarBlogger Or in serious mode: I’m glad you’ve are it to this appt. hopefully they can improve things, although your treatment seems ok
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:29:44	@BipolarBlogger Seven moths? That’s over half a butterfly!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:29:08	@BipolarBlogger Oh wow that’s really bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:28:27	@BipolarBlogger Smart move. I’ll keep everything crossed for you. And for the redoubled efforts of Mr B and the HTT.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:27:20	@BipolarBlogger I bet. But you’re a seriously capable and thorough person. When ideation moves to planning, it’s going to be detailed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:26:25	@BipolarBlogger you don’t think that this could result in temporary hospital stay do you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:25:34	@OpheliaBenson And no video games!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:25:19	@BipolarBlogger Good on you! That must have been seriously hard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:24:50	@BipolarBlogger Had I seen it I’d have….been really useless!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:20:01	@BipolarBlogger Shit, Charlotte that’s terrible. Are Mr B and various teams/professionals on high alert? Or was the deviousness too great?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 01:18:49	@BipolarBlogger Ah sorry to hear that. I was hoping for a rapid turnaround. Anyway, you must feel v happy to be productive in dire circs.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 00:57:02	@BipolarBlogger in that case any use of buzzwords is forgivable. Have you done any blue sky thinking or synergising anything yet?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-25 00:54:30	@BipolarBlogger you should go and sit in the corner and have a long think about what you’ve done.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-20 03:40:41	@OpheliaBenson Surely complaining about complaints about a relatively trivial thing is more trivial than the initial complaints, no?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-20 03:40:08	@OpheliaBenson I get remarkably impatient with men who complain about women complaining about what those men deem relatively trivial. 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-20 01:45:42	@Popehat I refer to it as the Central Entitlement Irony.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-20 01:45:10	@Popehat Indeed. Don't complain about X. X is minor compared to Y. Complaining about complaining about X is, however more important than Y
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-20 01:39:00	@debecca @BipolarBlogger But obviously I assume these are all men of great taste and discernment with whom it would be ludicrous to disagree
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-20 01:38:08	@debecca @BipolarBlogger I have literally no way to reply to that without getting my head kicked in! Either agreeing or disagreeing is bad!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-20 01:27:08	@debecca Oh I disagree. If the tears are hot enough it can help prolong a really nice bath. Maybe get a tear heater? I R HELPFUL!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-16 00:32:14	@Esteleth Only just. And not clean ones.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-16 00:29:28	@there_runsMary Samoa. And mostly ourselves by the looks of things. I get the impression there are some desperate geezers in the camp.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-16 00:26:19	@there_runsMary Sky Sports 1. It’s over now. And I has a sad.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-16 00:20:51	Oh balls. The chaps that I like who move a bladder around some grass have failed to beat some other chaps at moving that bladder #ENGvSA
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-16 00:15:26	Dammit England. This is not a rehearsal. You need to win these things to have a hope next year. #ENGvSA
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-16 00:10:33	@thetrudz Never! {Hic}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 23:28:52	@ShipLives @roseveleth @docfreeride Oh I agree with this so much!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 23:26:35	@Julie_B92 @lyndellmbade oh hell yes!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 23:26:17	@lyndellmbade @Julie_B92 …it couldn’t be…nah…;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 23:25:57	@lyndellmbade @Julie_B92 Not that I would like to be on the receiving end, but I wonder why my male named account doesn’t get so much…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 23:21:08	@jonronson @billybragg Generally I think you’re right, however rehabilitation is not just something done to someone. It’s something someone…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 23:19:41	@RugbyPodcast Have you seen Ben Foden’s effort? Someone should have a word.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 23:11:31	@RugbyPodcast I’ll go along with that. The scrum’s going Okayama think. Which is nice. Now sort the pretty boys out!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 23:04:11	@RugbyPodcast Are we witnessing the birth of a new man crush?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:48:21	Oh balls. Try by SA. Far too many errors from England. To me it seems like they’re trying to force the game.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:36:39	Oooooooohhhh so close #ENGvSA
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:34:45	@Julie_B92 @docfreeride @MichaelJewell78 …isn’t even remotely bullying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:34:31	@Julie_B92 @docfreeride @MichaelJewell78 Even “hey! That shirt is a pretty sexist choice if you want to encourage/welcome women in STEM”…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:33:28	@Julie_B92 @docfreeride @MichaelJewell78 …and its all been about raising consciousness over troublesome depictions in pop media.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:32:39	@Julie_B92 @docfreeride @MichaelJewell78 Yup. Also quite literally NONE of this has ever been about bullying nerds. I am a nerd. I am a geek
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:31:33	@srhbutts @HorzaEdeo I am shocked. Shocked I tell you. Or, you know, not shocked at all. Depressingly predictable.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:29:53	@Julie_B92 @docfreeride @MichaelJewell78 And of course claiming to be only angry about “ethics in gaming journalism” as they do so.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:27:42	@Julie_B92 @docfreeride @MichaelJewell78 Oh it’s (certainly in significant part) deliberate. For example some harassers of Anita Sarkeesian…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:22:29	@evilfelicity Also this means we need to be the ones to start the revolution, or something. Can I do it after the rugby?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:21:34	@evilfelicity Deary me! You’re not too far up the road then.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:18:58	@evilfelicity Which, considering it is one of the safest Tory seats in the country, is one of the many reasons I drink! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:17:27	Also I’ve been cooking and gardening this morning, to say I was under dressed to meet the Home Secretary would be a colossal understatement.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:16:14	@evilfelicity In her constituency.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:15:26	I’m also trying to watch the rugby very sober. So this rates as a relatively surreal afternoon.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:14:45	I did let her know, very politely, that I was ferociously left wing. I thought the rather obvious security might object to me being naughty.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 22:13:57	Teresa May has just knocked on my door campaigning for a local councillor. I have smoked precisely nothing. I have never been so flummoxed!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:49:35	@BipolarBlogger …I’d be a much happier bunny.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:49:21	@BipolarBlogger If I’ve learned anything it’s that people largely don’t notice the shit we do. That said, if I could remember I learned that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:44:18	@BipolarBlogger Okay so your timing sucks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:43:37	@drinksinthedark @BipolarBlogger Oh hell do I know THAT feeling!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:43:22	@drinksinthedark @BipolarBlogger I just remember the shocked faces of people trying to deal with my flights of ideas and general gobbyness!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:42:05	@BipolarBlogger I imagine Mr B has v broad shoulders and is understanding.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:41:42	@BipolarBlogger Ha! But but if you don’t tell stupid people they will never know! (My excuse) (it’s a crap excuse)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:40:10	@BipolarBlogger …it’s harder on those closer in my opinion. Various views may differ! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:39:43	@BipolarBlogger okay that’s an interesting wrinkle! I wouldn’t feel that guilty about it tbh. They’ll probably be really unfazed by it….
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:37:06	@drinksinthedark @BipolarBlogger I’m a fucking nightmare for a whole slew of reasons when hypo!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:35:21	@BipolarBlogger Ah good that’s really positive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:32:43	@BipolarBlogger Go easy on yourself if at all possible. I know the irritable when hypo thing well. I’m sure they forgive you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:29:12	@BipolarBlogger Ah bugger. No improvement on your son’s activity front the cause?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:06:28	@robinince It’s the watches that always amaze me. Worryingly expensive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 21:00:22	@alicebell @TomChivers @flashboy Seconded in toto.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 20:58:50	@ProfLAppleby Adults are making the free “choice” to be unwell/offenders and that’s the sum of it. Reality is, as you know, more complicated
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 20:57:55	@ProfLAppleby I reckon it’s in part due to the illusion of an independent self/free will. The idea that mind has infinite degrees of freedom
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 20:55:02	@BipolarBlogger You get those anyway btw, but you know, I’m pretty sodding useless over here!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 20:54:34	@BipolarBlogger Want to talk about it? If not, I’ll send solidarity vibes/hugs your way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 20:50:41	@docfreeride There are no excuses for that schedule! That is an act of oppression…somehow…let me work it out and get back to you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 20:46:41	@docfreeride I also suspect you heard that eye roll across the Atlantic. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 20:46:10	@docfreeride I hope you are okay. I find no irony in the fact that the death wish/threat makers are complaining about over reaction. None.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 18:57:52	@amynelmes @Izaakson NOOOO! Seriously!? That went from pathetic, entitled docuhery to really sinister FAST!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-15 18:57:05	@amynelmes @Izaakson I've seen more pathetic things. But not very often.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-14 07:31:33	@docfreeride Seems good. Am I allowed a stocked beer fridge? Either way, you’ve managed rightly earned frustration better than I could.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-14 07:23:55	I am watching #BBCQT This is fundamentally an act of self harm. I have just jabbed a fork into my eye in a bid to reduce the pain.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-14 07:22:29	@docfreeride It’s a work of brilliance. I expected no less.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-14 07:16:19	@garwboy I’m watching QT because I really felt like some quality self harm. None of your nonsense, this is the real stuff.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-14 07:11:24	@evilfelicity I know a chap who is particularly fond of having his balls stamped on. Therefore I can stamp on anyone’s balls. Works for me!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-14 07:07:31	@RevRichardColes …punitive to require him to engage in some manner. Also the appropriateness of that specific job is arguable.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-14 07:06:40	@RevRichardColes On that we agree most fulsomely. This chap is unrepentant, not engaged in his part of the rehab process. I think it’s not…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-14 06:58:01	@AllyFogg I was thinking the same thing. And it appears our dread is well founded.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-14 06:55:19	@Aaron_D00 @OliverJamesUK Just in case it’s not obvious I am taking the chronic piss out of this specific claim made by many Tories
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-14 06:53:57	@OliverJamesUK I know! I’m sure that nice Blair chap was making policies for all those other sovereign nations.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-14 06:51:55	@OliverJamesUK I was really impressed by the last Labour govt’s ability to ruin the entire globe’s economy.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 19:49:11	@CarlieP @paulcoxon THAT is what I think is very very seriously bad. As you said with your Truck Nutz comment, you have to be trying to miss

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 19:48:04	@CarlieP @paulcoxon This is the thing that really gets me. I can see "Oh it's just HIM, being a bit of a lad" as letting this shirt pass...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 19:47:11	@CarlieP @paulcoxon I have seen so many fucked up things fly on the basis that someone is a "bit of a character" {shuffles guiltily}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 17:42:47	@CarlieP @paulcoxon …my guess would be that the nature of the shirt simply didn’t register. I.e. Cock up. And it was a case of boys will…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 17:40:19	@CarlieP @paulcoxon I agree with you, I probably didn’t express myself well. Of course it’s his deliberate choice. And a daft one at best…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 07:50:31	@hotpatooties 20 years ago I was 20. Every day I am closer to 60 than 20. Sod wine. It’s heroin in the eyeball for THAT realisation.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 07:36:26	@CarlieP @paulcoxon I prefer the cock up theory of things in general, but this is cluelessness of a higher order than even I can pull off.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 03:13:23	@paulcoxon @CarlieP I’d agree. I’d err on enthusiastic cluelessness, but stress that as that’s my problem I’m overly forgiving!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 03:09:30	@FuzzCookies I will be hating my son’s music choices as an act of charity.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 00:28:43	@Crommunist Yeah well we can land on a comet but we still can't write decent Tweets... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 00:26:44	@edyong209 Bullshit. You're British. Well known fact we have to import people to make sandwiches. I read it in the Mail.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-13 00:24:23	I will be continuing to celebrate this wonderful scientific event by using the fact that it's a pan-European collaboration to mock UKIP gits

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 17:35:01	@OliverJamesUK It won't have gone far enough until the last Dapper Laughs Clone is strangled with the intestines of Julien Blanc. Too much?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 16:34:51	@drinksinthedark Look at it like this, we humans may have produced Dapper Laughs, but with a bit of luck will land on a comet today!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 16:33:40	@drinksinthedark Sorry! It’s pretty depressing in that loss of faith in humanity way isn’t it. (At least)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 16:08:47	@gravbeast Only a bit…{cough}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 07:17:01	@AdamRutherford Yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 07:15:42	@carlgardner I think you have to at least stand in the corner and consider what you’ve done. Possibly say sorry to anyone who read it too.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 07:09:56	@fleetstreetfox Oh way, way, WAY ahead of you on that one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 07:09:01	@AdamRutherford It was also irony and satire. Just like Bernard Manning… …whoops! (Except Manning was talented, if a bigot)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 07:07:25	…pretty much shows he doesn’t grasp either. Satire and irony are tough to pull off and not without pitfalls. Dapper Laughs was explotation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 07:05:53	Whatever the chap who did Dapper Laughs is or thinks, he failed at both irony and satire spectacularly. Trying to throw them up as excuses..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 07:05:09	Dapper Laughs wasn’t satire. Another bullshit excuse. Satire attempts to illumine the folly of things, Dapper Laughs is celebration of them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 07:03:51	Dapper Laughs wasn’t irony. Bullshit attempt at an excuse. Irony subverts expectations, Dapper Laughs specifically played to expectations.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 06:56:32	@salihughes Who knew playing TO the prejudices of an audience and reinforcing them was irony and satire? Erm, that would be no one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 06:54:53	Dapper Laughs is as much a satire as my ball bag is a hovercraft.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 06:50:00	@bdogrunner Have some {hugs}, dog. It must be catching, my day has been odd too. Both quite nice and bloody horrid in places. New day needed
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 04:01:10	@CarlieP I’m sceptical but as it’s you I’ll believe you. I may be a little sad about my impending demise, obviously! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-12 01:07:57	@CCriadoPerez I'd rather not meet him if at all possible. I'm aware of him, that's bad enough. I fear the reality might inspire tetchiness.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 22:51:30	@stevyncolgan Qualifications are routinely over-emphasised. It's tick box culture and deeply inaccurate. Hence why I loathe it.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 22:38:42	@stevyncolgan I wonder if it's just me, but the whole process feels a bit more dehumanising than before. More HR distance, less dealing...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 22:35:46	@stevyncolgan Or in other words: Best of luck with the job hunting, it's a total git of an experience.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 22:34:38	@stevyncolgan We should set up a company that allows us to be fat, drink beer and generally talk crap. Do we need a new government?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 21:48:06	This will go very badly for you all when I come to power. I demand tributes, genuflection, and hosannas. Minimum. Get on it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 21:46:49	Frankly I'm not liking being 40 so far. Massive sleeping pill hangover, annoying builder and insufficient adulation of the masses.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 21:45:47	40 years, 1 hour and 34 minutes ago, I was ripped untimely from my mother's womb, 6 weeks early weighing three pounds four ounces.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 21:34:42	I am havcing post fun mardiness. Not helped by a crooked builder. Happy birthday. Right. I'm off to punch kittens and set fire to pixies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 18:16:06	Today is my 40th birthday. Does this mean I have to stop telling rude jokes and acting like an utter clown?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 17:10:36	@_Ex_Astris_ Your friend is wise.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 17:08:00	Oh dear, I’m 40. I was meant to be dead by now. This ageing thing, I do not approve.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 03:36:04	@depressednotsad I also do a mean line of double chocolate cookies! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 03:32:27	@depressednotsad ...the next the opposite helps. {Insert hugs here if you want them} Bloody horrible state to be in.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 03:32:02	@depressednotsad Urgh, nasty. I sympathise. I hate being all over the map like that. I never know what to do. It's one minute this helps...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 03:21:27	@depressednotsad I am thanks...well I *think* I am. Possibly a bit labile but probably okay tbh. Sorry you're having a rough time though.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 02:38:57	@Julie_B92 True.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 02:21:48	@gingerdisco99 That would require technical competence above my current level of tiredness inspired rantiness! ;-) (Or "Good idea")
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 02:20:30	@gingerdisco99 {Blush} Thank you. I take comedy perhaps a little too seriously! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 02:13:13	@zatapatique Ah of course!, so simple and obvious, yet it clearly eluded me! Whoops! Thanks for the tip. @LadyFOHF @richdhw
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 02:12:23	@jearle ...the cock up version of history over the conspiracy, so perhaps that's a convenient side effect.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 02:11:58	@jearle Yup. I suspect a TV exec meeting where "The prole will lap this shit up" was uttered at some point though. Mind you I favour...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 02:09:45	@jearle Yup. No bugger comes out of this well. The conspiracy theorist in me wonders why it got a TV deal. But we don't listen to him! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 02:08:58	@zatapatique Oooh. Thread it? This is news to me, how do I do it? @LadyFOHF @richdhw
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 02:02:48	@jearle Yup. It's an act of division along the worst possible lines done incompetently in the worst possible way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 02:02:14	@LadyFOHF Oh dear. If I'm making sense one of us has done something really wrong! ;-) @zatapatique @richdhw

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 02:00:17	...So, yeah, Dapper Laughs pisses me the fuck off. It's technically incompetent comedy, it's hate-fuelled and it serves people who wish 52/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-11 01:59:36	...Errrr no. It serves the same narrative that pours hate at foreigners, pours hate at the disabled, pours hate at the vulnerable. 51/n

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 08:58:42	@ImprobableJoe Three things that I am interested in. Who doesn’t like morning wood? Also urgent morning poop with morning wood = tough issue
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 08:57:28	@ImprobableJoe …you say cool things so I want to talk to you and listen to you. But I have shit to do, man!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 08:56:57	@ImprobableJoe Ha! You are far from shitty! In fact it’s people like you that are the problem. You produce cool stuff I want to read etc…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 08:49:00	@hoperiffic Ha!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 08:48:50	@ImprobableJoe I feel great, it’s just there is too much stuff to read. I’m not intimidated or humbled, just busy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 08:48:05	@hoperiffic Okay, that I will grant is tricky.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 08:47:24	@ImprobableJoe I do not believe this to be the case. All I need is a week or two to catch up then y’all can go back to being cool.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 08:46:18	@hoperiffic Coma patient?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 08:41:27	@hoperiffic Granted. It doesn’t work well on corpses, I have a paramedic friend who swears it works on everyone else.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 08:33:20	@hoperiffic But very awakening.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 06:45:58	@Puffles2010 @pennymedu New faces not old faeces, eh?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 06:19:10	#readergate Is a serious exposure of the SJW corruption of literature and ethics in literary criticism. Read these 3000 volumes if you doubt
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 06:18:05	@damianobroin {does serious face}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 06:17:58	@damianobroin It's a serious treatment exposing the feminist corruption of ethics in literature and literary criticism. Deeply serious.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 06:14:11	Fuck any book that isn't written by Ernest Hemingway! Everything else is feminised literary froofroo shit ruined by feminazis. #readergate
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 06:11:43	@Jo_Caulfield Also known asthe "let's get a rando on who knows even less about the topics than the other gits" show.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 06:10:57	I'm sorry, I am enjoying #readergate a little too much.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 06:09:07	Three Bronte sisters, and one brother. Literary misandry. They made his writing deliberately shit with their imposing uteri #readergate
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 06:00:16	Bertha gave Edward Rochester syphilis. Teach the controversy! Read his blog post. It's about ethics in literary characterisation #readergate
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:58:19	Jane Eyre is an act of misandrist oppression AND conspriacy. The Brontes were SISTERS! Ungrateful for male Victorian works. #readergate
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:50:18	@RugbyPodcast Hot man love. It's okay, embrace your destiny.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:49:54	@ametonym I've fallen in love over Twitter for far, far less.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:35:35	SJW FEMINAZIS want to stop me reading male authors like George Eliot and George Sand. It's Political correctness gone mad! #readergate
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:27:42	@g3reth You too huh? If we go to the same parties we're going to be really embarrassed,
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:23:23	@IamJadehawk Oh that's just CRUEL!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:23:13	@g3reth I bet it is worth reading. Curses! This means I have to read it. YOU'RE NOT HELPING!!!!! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:21:30	@IamJadehawk Cheers Jadehawk. There's just too much to read, so a few of you cool people not doing amazing stuff I need to read helps! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:17:13	@g3reth ...output. I am just pissed off I have only one life in which to consume it all and try to do my own stuff!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:16:42	@g3reth As I said to @DramaLlama85 I'm not sure "I knew I could rely on you" is complimentary! ;-) I'm not intimidated by people's cool...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:15:10	@DramaLlama85 I'm not sure "I knew I could rely on you" is a complimentary reply! What I will say is thank you! That's not good either!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:12:27	@CCriadoPerez No. {He says from his bathtub full of Strawberry Clusters}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:11:21	Dear Everyone, please can most if not all of you stop being so productive and talented. I am struggling to keep up with all your cool output
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:01:49	@AlexGabriel Is that a phallusy? {Thank you, thank you. That was the oldest joke in the philosophy book. I'm so proud}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 05:00:17	@FuzzCookies We'll be in our respective bunks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 04:58:25	@MittenDAmour @garwboy Ohhh bad error. Explaining that on the tube will be... ...surprisingly easy. Talking on the tube is Verboten.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 04:56:02	@evilfelicity @CCriadoPerez @tkingdoll Oh I know he's a total scumbag. But you have to admit that in amongst it all the chair stuff is gold
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 04:51:30	@CCriadoPerez @tkingdoll I KNEW it! There will be banknotes involved for certain That and hard chairs (The hard chairs thing is legendary)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 04:49:38	Over the last few evenings I have watched @colin_furze 's YT back catalogue. I have been made offensively happy by this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 01:36:25	@mmbtox Mmmmm snark. Lovely lovely snark.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 01:32:26	@michaellegge Wise choice revising "this is what's inside a comedian". I had a series of truly harrowing product images for you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 01:31:10	@mmbtox Sorry, I'm feeling snarky and I have a deep seated need to mock misogynists. It's a weakness. I'm seeking help. Not very hard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 01:29:16	@mmbtox The Empire do all wear Fedoras. It's a little known fact. Also, Darth Vader addresses Leia as "Milady". True!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 01:27:43	@mmbtox You know it's happening. Bloody GGers will complain about Leia being too prominent or some drivel.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-07 01:15:12	@tkingdoll In the pub, plotting? Plotting against anti-vaxxers exploiting women? I can get behind that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 23:34:25	@sturdyAlex Wait...I don't do that. Do I? Was it me? Oh hell what have I done now!?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 23:05:03	@andy_nortcliffe Good choice. I had barbeque in mind too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 23:04:07	@andy_nortcliffe They can be. Tehey really can be. What flavour Pringles would you coat with chocolate?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 22:14:21	@tkingdoll @CCriadoPerez @giagia Christ don't go quiet on me I wasn't remotely serious!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 21:58:49	@Psythor What do you mean "what if"? That's the case isn't it? Oh wait....that was your point. DAMMIT! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 21:48:46	I think I am safe in saying that this Julien Blanc excrescence is one of the worst humans I have virtually encountered. Nasty piece of work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 21:47:05	@tkingdoll @CCriadoPerez @giagia I, for one, am feeling very excluded. This must therefore be misandry. I shall be in the corner, crying. ;)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 21:43:51	@TheSimonEvans It's politicians muddying the waters to avoid criticism. Comedians are a easy target (as you know!). There's a pre-exisiting>
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 21:38:22	@tauriqmoosa I'm sure they had sex too. Or is that from that slash fan fic site I was reading? I have to stop reading that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 21:36:55	@BipolarBlogger WOOT! {Insert standard picture of Fathers Ted and Dougal with "Careful Now!" signs! ;-) }
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 21:31:27	@Glinner Hmmm let me make a random guess in the dark. Would many of them be readers of a "newspaper" named something like "Maily Dail"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 21:29:29	@tauriqmoosa I worry about artificial divisions, or exaggerating existing differences, but I think there is a rift with the irony deficient.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 21:23:23	@AdamRutherford You're either reading the site, horrified, or, more likely, both. The geekery of we chemists is limitless.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 21:13:57	@AdamRutherford http://www. chm.bris.ac.uk/sillymolecules /sillymols.htm … First n{ahem} entry. Some of them are a bit of a stretch, but this one is real.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 21:12:11	@AdamRutherford Chemistry is a rich source of this sort of thing. For example, you must already know about the arsenic analogue of pyrrole.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 19:09:29	@DocHackenbush If the world had ended no one would have been around to complain. Mathematically there was always going to be a rage uptick.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 19:08:09	@tauriqmoosa I understand Rushdie was wearing a short literary form and basically asking for it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 19:07:16	@DocHackenbush Wasn't there meant to be a Mayan apocalypse a couple of years ago? Surely this could be engineered by suitable Twitter rage.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 19:05:41	@DocHackenbush Peak rage will be met when Brand features in the ad wearing a UKIP t shirt and pinching an unsuspecting woman's bum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 19:04:20	@BipolarBlogger That is true. And to be fair it is the standard tube aroma in my experience, so Windolene must be a refreshing change.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 19:03:19	@LadyFOHF No we're not. Obvious joke is obvious. I need coffee.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 19:02:20	@BipolarBlogger Is that better or worse than it smelling of wee but having clean floors? I'd be really suspicious if that were the case.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 19:01:14	@tauriqmoosa I can't even read male authors like George Eliot or George Sand without the FEMINAZI PC censors dashing the books from my hands

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 04:06:54	@Herring1967 That my birthday is on the 11th?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 03:34:57	@MittenDAmour The internet became enthusiastic after the first sentence. After the second the sound of disappointed perverts was audible.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 02:20:58	@there_runsMary It's all very clever and meta and not at all undergraduate and self indulgent. Honest! No. Really.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 02:19:41	@there_runsMary Brand is just speaking up. I don't have to agree with him, he's just using what platform he has, good on him. Hipsters...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 02:19:08	@there_runsMary There was something about hipsters and a cereal restaurant and mocking Russell Brand in the news. It's all a bit daft.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 02:18:04	@there_runsMary ....was cool. I'll keep adding "hate" in sequence. I am, unsuprisingly, being deliberately daft.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 02:17:25	@there_runsMary Tomorrow there will be ne more if that helps. The actual "hate" is entirely fictional. I hated hating hipsters before it....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 02:06:10	@robinince Errors or no, Mr Ince, you're always worth reading. But obviously only because I'm a mad lefty who wants to kill Tories etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 02:01:37	@SpokesGay But but if we vote for them then ambition and tax cuts and when I become a billionaire... ....what do you mean it's a fiction?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-06 01:59:16	@BipolarBlogger I am having cereal in a cereal restaurant. Or I would be if I wasn't into it before it became cool.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-05 23:23:41	@stevyncolgan I'm sorry but my brain is now off on a tangent about a Parliamentary Commission on Un-Cornish Activities. This needs doing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-05 23:16:47	@tkingdoll Graham's number. I WIN ALL!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-05 23:03:18	@RugbyPodcast I hope you're wrong about Eng vs NZ but with no Manu...I think you're right.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-05 23:00:25	@stevyncolgan He's one of only two people I know (incl you) who speak Cornish. He's written no books though. I reckon you could take him!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-05 22:59:28	@stevyncolgan I shall submit this to the Cornish Activities Approval Council (My mate from Mousehole). He has Opnions about pasty origins.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-05 16:53:58	@MittenDAmour Were you in my kitchen this morning? The unwashed cook pot reeked of exactly this. There was a Marital Signal so I washed it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 21:01:56	@Julie_B92 But but the data itself is romatic! (Okay, not sure even I buy that one)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 21:01:00	@Julie_B92 HA! I'll ask him if I ever meet him. I doubt it's the case. Probably something to do with data handling.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:59:20	@Julie_B92 HA! Yes! Well known fact that Sir Tim Berners Lee created the web to have better phone sex with his Mrs. (This is not true)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:56:11	@Julie_B92 That's usually the point at which I start crying with laughter and get a bit hysterical.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:52:59	@Julie_B92 Urgh, that's horrid.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:52:46	@Julie_B92 Yup The idea that everything important out of the lab is meaningless. V silly. Helping people have fewer obstacles = productviity
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:50:38	@Julie_B92 There is no "right" way to do this. And the attitude that academics (esp female academics) will "cope" uncomplainingly persists
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:49:14	@Julie_B92 ...and so it worked out for her. The timings/moves came at the right time. Hence why it would be bad for me to try to move her...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:48:41	@Julie_B92 Yeah, I undestand that. My wife followed me about, but then she was seriously pissed off with research and happy to get out....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:47:01	@Julie_B92 Yeah. It REALLY is possible. I promise you.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:45:13	@Julie_B92 Yup. Industry is a little easier on the LDR front. But it's still science, so the "easy" is v relative. As mentioned my career...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:44:21	@Julie_B92 I can imagine. LDRs are very, very hard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:43:16	@Julie_B92 You do win the distance award!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:42:42	@Julie_B92 ...bit of a career hit to be near her, sounds noble, but she was getting the big(ger) bucks, so made sense! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:42:16	@Julie_B92 Oh hells yes. My wife and I did long distance for a few years. Even across the Atlantic at one point. But later on I took a...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-04 20:38:37	Okay one more hols tweet: In Buda Castle there is an exhibition of a "historical" 80s living room. That would be historical 1980s. Okay.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-03 18:28:07	@somegreybloke I have plenty of compassion for picked on gamers and social misfits. I am one. Strange that doesn't overlap with misogyny...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-03 18:19:10	@somegreybloke That's odd. I played a game perfectly okay last night and GG still exists....hmmmm.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-11-03 17:50:54	@somegreybloke Gamergate is still going? Whiny manbabies have yet to find something else to occupy them? Isn't there some new game out yet?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-30 16:25:24	Had a meal at Tigris in Budapest last night. Everyone stop what you are doing and fly here to eat there now. Simply amazing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-28 22:25:04	@chiara84 this should be a more genteel affair. Possibly. I think my wife and I will go out partying one night. At least. Maybe two.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-28 22:17:01	@chiara84 thanks. I will! My liver is currently sulking at me. I have to do it all again next weekend. Help me Obi Wan, you’re my only hope!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-28 18:28:47	@daraobriain @slepkane Pff I’ve thought you’re great for far longer I just never dared say it for fear of…erm…poor comic timing. That’ll do!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-21 17:58:29	@RevRichardColes I'd view that as a challenge!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-21 17:58:16	@RevRichardColes Surely there is some minor clerical supply that could be purchased for precisely this amount. In either sense of "clerical"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-21 16:30:32	@BipolarBlogger You've had an enormously positive effect on me whether or not you realise it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-21 16:18:35	@Marthalanefox @jimalkhalili TLS is an amazing programme on this and so many levels. It shouldn't just be a fixture it should be compulsory!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-21 01:37:52	@RevRichardColes Was that self-throw done with 110% effort? It's a Well Known Fact (TM) that giving less than 110% means you don't care.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-20 20:24:21	@WomenDefyUKIP @chakrabortty I have never yet managed an "I can't even". I think I just did. That is an abomination on multiple levels.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-20 20:23:20	@WomenDefyUKIP @chakrabortty NOOOOOOOOOOOO! Okay that's it. I'll be in a gutter swearing at passers by for the remainder of the week

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-20 20:13:27	@chakrabortty @WomenDefyUKIP So this thing is NOT a parody? Really? SERIOUSLY? Wow. Just...wow!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-20 19:59:47	Okay please tell me that UKIP Calypso is a parody. I think it is, but as ever Poe's Law is tricky stuff.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-16 20:35:47	@BipolarBlogger @zzzedkat Yeah that is a very real fear. Unfortunately.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-16 20:35:33	@BipolarBlogger @zzzedkat I get that too, as mentioned, but the balance is the other way for me. So far at least! Interesting how it varies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-16 20:33:41	@BipolarBlogger @zzzedkat ...that permanence you mention, Charlotte, is definitely one of them. Fear's another. Stigma another.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-16 20:32:58	@BipolarBlogger @zzzedkat The vast majority of the time I have very little "external" reasons to feel bad. I do sometimes, obviously, and...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-16 20:32:20	@BipolarBlogger @zzzedkat ...question "Why do you feel like that?" is more often than not for me "Because those thoughts crash into my head"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-16 20:31:50	@BipolarBlogger @zzzedkat One of the things about "explaining suicidality to people" is that often there is no *reason*. The answer to...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-15 19:30:59	@JuliaFromIT @garwboy Sounds about right for the US. You realise I wasn't advocating such idiocy, but mocking it, right?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-14 02:59:07	The correct emotion for "sad your iPhone broke" is "FUCKYOUAPPLE". This is a proper emotion for using iTunes also.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-14 02:58:32	Dear Everyone. Please stop using the word "depressed" for low mood. It means something. That thing is assuredly not "sad your iPhone broke"

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-13 19:17:46	@BipolarBlogger I maintain there needs to be a mechanism of blocking that punches the person on the other end.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-13 19:12:09	@BipolarBlogger There are some things I find abhorrent. That is one. I'll butt out now, don't want to make things worse. Sending {hugs}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 04:47:26	@pzmyers @OpheliaBenson Doxxing is wrong. Harassment is wrong. Difficult this ain't. I wonder why they have such a head time with it. Hmm...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 04:45:36	@tessakendall If he holds the key to the wine cellar then amazingly he has something I actually want. I'd never suspected that before now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 04:43:43	@pzmyers @tauriqmoosa @OpheliaBenson I reserve this word for incredibly few people; Milo is vicious scum. He should be pointedly ignored.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 04:30:04	Again, scoreline irrelevant. That was a solid game from Tigers. Well done everyone. The doubters can bite me. Keep the faith. #TigersvQuins
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 04:12:12	@martin_crowson Nowt wrong with a little bit of handbags.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 04:10:44	@tigersunoffy I damn near had a special personal moment when I found out he'd be back tonight... ...overshared there didn't I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 03:36:06	@martin_crowson I'm developing a distressing man crush on Scully. A decent try does that to a lad after three losses on the bounce.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 03:35:07	@MittenDAmour Hurrah! I'm on the rum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 03:33:59	@OliJAnderson Only when done right with the appropriate number of enthusiastic partners.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 03:33:10	@AndromP @WomenDefyUKIP He's a deeply sinister and nasty bit of work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 03:32:25	Regardless of the score that was a good half of rugby from Leicester. Much improved. #Tigerslive #TigersvQuins #TigersFamily
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 03:27:30	Dammit, the more I see of Scully the more I'm impressed by him. #Tigerslive #TigersvQuins
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 02:55:17	I just went berserk over the Scully try and did myself a mischief... ...clever. #Tigerslive #TigersvQuins #TigersFamily #LeicesterTigers

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-11 00:41:28	@bengoldacre an "apology" for "offence" has been made. I'm not sure those quotation marks are sufficiently contemptuous.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 23:53:11	@theaceofspuds @davidschneider PHEW! I was worried I'd been mistaken for a kippist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:56:09	@zeno001 Pfff that's about as likely as homoeopathy. I was born impatient (and thus very premature!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:55:34	@NeilDenham1978 ...that would be like imposing The Man's view on you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:55:16	@NeilDenham1978 Yah but you see it's all about the experience of how it makes you react to the art itself. If we told you what to think...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:54:36	@zeno001 Has someome diluted something interesting, shaken it in a bit of a magic way and pretended it does something similarly interesting?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:50:13	But then I am one of those wild and crazy people who do things like treat women like they're human and stuff. I know radical PC gone mad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:49:21	I managed to do that without photoshop, without harassment, without encouraging my friends into a campaign of abuse. See? It's EASY!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:48:20	Here's how to disagree with a woman who has a significant platform and is saying something you think is wrong: I disagree with Naomi Wolf.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:46:12	@geologiser I'm so very ashamed.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:38:41	@tkingdoll As has been said elsewhere, I'd HATE for something like this to go viral or get picked up by mainstream media like @guardiannews
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:37:30	@alicemeat I have made the exact opposite mistake too many times. People think I just look weird in a bra.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:16:24	@theaceofspuds @davidschneider What worries me about this is there is an endless source of clueless parody available.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:08:13	@CherryMakes @zeno001 @arripay @MrMMarsh @SallyMorganTV Quite. I would really consider not going whether or not I am gay.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:05:43	@zeno001 @CherryMakes @arripay @MrMMarsh I would ghope that a public figure with @SallyMorganTV 's profile would loudly condemn such actions
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 21:05:09	@zeno001 @CherryMakes @arripay @MrMMarsh I couldn't possibly comment on @SallyMorganTV but the chaps in that video appear to be rather nasty

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 20:34:53	@bdogrunner @BipolarBlogger Definitely. To not have tried would be the failure, the "giving in". You tried something that didn't work...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 20:25:21	@CCriadoPerez Still, people get to make decisions I don't like for reasons I don't like, but really, at long last, have they no decency? ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 20:23:19	@CCriadoPerez It's an oddly British act of electoral self harm to vote for a party that is claiming to be anti-mainstream yet is so...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 20:22:02	@CCriadoPerez I realise that was mean of me. But, well, it's a little distressingly dotty to vote UKIP. Protest I understand, this, less so.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 20:19:29	@zeno001 @CherryMakes @MrMMarsh @SallyMorganTV ...are any other experts who could help inform us?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 20:17:47	@zeno001 @CherryMakes @MrMMarsh @SallyMorganTV I wouldn't wish to intrude on a busy lady's time Perhaps the press could help us @Independent

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 20:14:08	@CCriadoPerez Because of this: http://www. goodreads.com/quotes/76179-i -did-not-mean-that-conservatives-are-generally-stupid-i … (Link is safe! It's a quote)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 19:29:29	@alicemeat Still a good pun though!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 19:29:19	@alicemeat Well it's always possible there's a self-fulfilling element, but it's very hard to tease that out of existing pattern.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:33:30	@PsychiatrySHO @MHNEtweets But we might OFFEND someone by telling them they are spreading harmful bigotry. And we couldn't have THAT ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:32:01	@adambloomie2 Come friendly bombs and fall on....Clacton?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:29:29	@GrrlScientist I get a little too giddy in #NobelPrize week I'm pleased that none of my predicitions were right this year. I learned!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:26:53	@CarolineLucas @elphiemcdork Please, PLEASE do this. The relative lack of coverage you and the Greens get is frankly criminal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:25:14	@GrrlScientist @BarackObama Tragically, I could not agree more!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:23:53	@GrrlScientist <but I'm genuinely very happy about it. Perhaps too happy if I'm forgetting other things! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:23:20	@GrrlScientist I think the Nobel for Malala is a really bold and worthwhile statement by the committee. Sure it's not enough, never will be>
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:22:07	@standardnews @SLSingh Aeroplanes and airports, those fantastic venues for comedy! I'm super careful. (Whether I should be or not...)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:20:40	@femalevillain @oolon Yeah but pooping horses is realistic like Orcs and Elves. And not like women characters. Obviously. Erm...wait. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:18:17	@NeilDenham1978 I have to be honest, I'm made up. That young woman deserves every damned honour going. Including a Rugby World Cup!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:15:39	@AnnoGalactic It does terrible things. It's not as bad as Tuesday. And I've had two Tuesdays this week. Douglas Adams had it right.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:14:19	@gravbeast @debecca @BipolarBlogger I will add the caveat that git-hood in youth is only tolerable if it decreases with time. Increasing=BAD
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:13:43	There is no Thursday. There's certainly no bloody excuse for Thursday. It's a wanker of a day.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:13:17	Merry World Mental Health Day! (I know this is Friday because yesterday was Wednesday, Tuesday was Monday, Monday was Tuesday, so WOOP!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:11:50	@gravbeast @debecca @BipolarBlogger I'm pretty certain I'm not a git based on the evidence And yes one is ALLOWED to be a git in teens/20s.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:10:50	@gravbeast @debecca @BipolarBlogger ...all I hear from them regarding the people in my family who have been ill is rampant bigotry.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:10:11	@gravbeast @debecca @BipolarBlogger Yup. Same here. Reason #1 I have never Officially Told my family (whatever they suspect) is because...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:09:04	@gravbeast @debecca @BipolarBlogger ...institutions, a number of cousins and uncles/aunts on every form of happy pill going. Etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:08:28	@gravbeast @debecca @BipolarBlogger Yeah, I'd have liked to have known that I have two uncles who had ECT, a grandma in and out of mental...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:07:53	@debecca @gravbeast @BipolarBlogger Mine said I was a git. To be fair she was right! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:07:33	@gravbeast Have a good WORK! Good luck to you too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:06:07	@salihughes < behind a thin veneer of "It's only humour" to deflect criticism. We ALL know humour means you're not a nasty sod {eyeroll}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:05:16	@salihughes I always get a General Melchett "Meeeehhh Baterrr!" vibe from him. It's not banter, it's bared teeth bigotry cowardly "hidden">
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:04:04	That is a bloody well deserved Peace Prize. Sorry but THAT has brightened my day considerably.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:03:25	YAY MALALA!!!! Wonderful Peace Prize for once!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:02:39	@gravbeast I've heard bad things about some Hitler bloke. I reckon we're better than him. In my case only just, obviously. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:01:43	@gravbeast Yeah CBT style thought challenging isn't *ALL* bollocks! ;-) Just really tough sometimes
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:01:09	@BipolarBlogger @gravbeast I can imagine how horrid that is. Not very well mind you! But YIKES!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 17:00:07	@gravbeast THINK OF THE ELECTRONS!!! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:59:18	@gravbeast @BipolarBlogger I lived, in a quite destructive mood led fashion, for ~16 to 20 years in chronic denial of my "moodiness"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:58:45	@gravbeast @BipolarBlogger I remember childhood eps of up and down (quite serious in a few cases) but denial isn't just a river in Africa!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:57:46	@gravbeast It seems that my brain has learned certain things and habitually returns to them. I'm working on the bugger though!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:56:55	@gravbeast I used to think I did, but to be honest, I was in denial! I mentioned yesterday the "paths learned by the Traitor Brain"!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:56:07	@gravbeast Paperwork is evil. It kills trees!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:55:14	@alicemeat ...Window to have a force pulling it away from corproatist/right economics and isolationist/xenophobic rhetoric.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:54:44	@alicemeat Agreed. And although I disagree with some of their science policy (for good reason), I wish they would. We need the Overton...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:53:23	That's a meaningless piece of news but I wanted to share the psychological satisfaction of getting a minor, insignificant job done It's nice
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:52:38	...the NAS drive I bought 18 months ago. Music and books. Two things I have a LOT of. (Also slacking at digitising stuff) One project DONE!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:51:53	So I am working from home today on my Paperwork Mountain (normal for Friday) and today I will also have digitised the last of my CDs onto...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:49:44	@gravbeast @BipolarBlogger It's all total crap of course. But the *feeling* never goes away. I remember life before it. It's just weird!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:49:04	@gravbeast @BipolarBlogger ...sense that I am a monster and an utter {insert naughty word} and am beyond even reasonable forgiveness. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:48:30	@gravbeast @BipolarBlogger I get the waves, but there is a perma-guilt with me. A background self hate and overwhelmingly inappropriate 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:47:37	@MooseAllain Red/Green glasses or polarised ones? Or those really pricey ones that require a posh telly. I liken them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:45:42	I despise UKIP and all who sail in them, but even I have to concede that the Clacton/Carswell thing is some cynically clever politicking.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:44:17	@BipolarBlogger The Monkey never leaves one's back does it? When you manage to shake it off, as I know you will, please let me know how! ;)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:41:39	(Incidentally, that is a sarcastic remark about how little coverage the Green Party get with an MP, which is too little.)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 16:40:43	I understand UKIP have wangled an MP. With a single MP their coverage on the BBC should now be matched to that of the Green Party. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 15:19:13	@Press_Coffee It's not important that you were wrong all those years, it's important you've corrected it! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 04:29:37	@Press_Coffee Coffee, good. Rum, good. Coffee with rum, GOOOOD!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 00:33:34	@tauriqmoosa Oh sorry. I didn't realise you were pre-review. I'll keep schtum and sit here peeing myself as I try to avoid looking at Steam
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-10 00:30:17	@tauriqmoosa Oh god oh god oh gos is it good? I've been studiously avoiding reviews for fear of downloading it. It's good isn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 20:04:13	@BipolarBlogger @gravbeast {looks at calendar} {Gets out black marker, changes day} {points at calendar} WRONG!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:56:27	@gravbeast @BipolarBlogger Shhhh she's wrong. It's really Wednesday. That way I still get my work done and don't have an OU tutorial tonight
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:37:12	@BipolarBlogger @Butterflywgs I get it. I'm tragically disposed to want to help! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:28:34	@BipolarBlogger @Butterflywgs @debecca Might not feel like it, but that is a superb predictor of future behaviour.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:28:13	@BipolarBlogger @Butterflywgs @debecca The thing is you are both so strong that you will face it and recover. You have superb track records.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:26:35	@RugbyTigers Manu, Ayerza...could we...could we...win?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:26:16	@debecca @BipolarBlogger Oh crap, Bex. *I'm* the one who should be sorry. We all know the way out can and will be there, it's just elusive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:25:36	@BipolarBlogger @debecca Interesting fact: Thjings that also did this for me: Feminism! LOL (Things not equivalent)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:24:46	@BipolarBlogger @debecca ....that pit until th rope exists. I can't patronise you onto the rope being there! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:24:18	@BipolarBlogger @debecca ...are the unsatisfactory cliches you know as well or better than I do. There is no rope to pull you out of...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:23:32	@BipolarBlogger @debecca There is no way to argue with that feeling. I've had it, just not today. Very recently though. All I can offer....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:10:03	@debecca @BipolarBlogger ...return to that hole because now it's learned how to get there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:09:48	@debecca @BipolarBlogger One of those things that has never truly left me since. I know it's always possible that my traitor brain can...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:09:21	@debecca @BipolarBlogger ...but after that point it was like I had broken through a crust and gone down into a deep, dark empty hole. Nasty
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:08:46	@debecca @BipolarBlogger ...where this never happened at all. I'd been depressed before (in hindsight, didn't know at the time)...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:08:18	@debecca @BipolarBlogger Yup. Curled up in bed/wherever, unable to do even really basic things. I can point to the bit of my life before...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:07:05	@BipolarBlogger @debecca Oh yes! I had a hell of a wobble a few weeks ago, plan enacted, the works, this week...almost sane!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:05:14	@debecca @BipolarBlogger I agree. There's that one step past "low mood" and into "mildly depressed proper" where that shift happens for me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:04:24	@BipolarBlogger @roiben @debecca That's Voltaire isn't it? :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:03:00	@debecca @BipolarBlogger That never really goes away does it? Well not for me. I remember what it was like before I hated myself. It's odd.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:01:53	@BipolarBlogger @debecca For the sake of our friendship I shall ignore this. I know you're lashing out to hurt me! (Not serious btw)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:01:23	@debecca @BipolarBlogger I had a period like that a few years ago It's so destructive psychologically. Much self worth comes from what we do
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 19:00:02	@BipolarBlogger @debecca Urgh. I hate that feeling. I've been having it on and off lately even when working.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:59:37	@martin_crowson @LeicesterTigers @QuinsRugbyUnion @premrugby Ayerza, Tuilagi? Next you'll be telling me we get Allen back!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:58:16	@debecca @BipolarBlogger I hate those days. I know them too well.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:57:47	@BipolarBlogger @debecca Pain au chocolat is nice. I'm not a Coke fan...pint of egregiously nice coffee (so no better) however.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:55:48	@BipolarBlogger @debecca Any relation to the relative busy-ness of late? Up then down kind of thing?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:54:14	@debecca It's a perfectly reasonable thing o do in a limited, text based medium. (It's not catching though)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:52:57	@BipolarBlogger @debecca Not you as well? Right, everyone, gather round for squishy bear hugs and chocolate (if you want them that is).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:51:45	@indiaknight I died from a very dull fondue once. Dinner parties have a lot to answer for.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:50:26	@debecca Oh poo. I know there's nothing I can do, but, you know, if there's anything I can do... {hugs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:49:42	@HorzaEdeo Of course that was due to sleep deprivation. AND NOTHING ELSE. {Manly cough}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:49:19	@HorzaEdeo Yup. I have a 5 year odl son, and when he was a baby we used to watch In The Night Garden together. I was a mess every time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:48:20	@debecca I NEVER USE THEM!!!! LITERALLY NEVER!!! NOR DO I OVERUSE EXCLAMATION MARKS!!!!!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:45:11	@BipolarBlogger I read the appintments, just not the dates obviously!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:44:55	@Julie_B92 I have been all over the shop. Efficient, hard working but clearly clueless!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:44:13	@BipolarBlogger I think it's a conspiracy. I will work out who to blame later.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:43:22	@BipolarBlogger It's possible...juuuuuust possible I should *READ* my calendar instead of reacting to it when it beeps.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:42:47	I have been reliably informed by an expert it is not Wednesday. Okay. Monday Was Tuesday. Today is Wednesday. Tomorrow is still Friday.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:42:08	@BipolarBlogger Oh Hell! It's not Wednesday is it? I thought Monday was Tuesday. Today is Wednesday...Oh dear.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:41:27	@debecca This is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Those people, often well meaning, are purveyors of harmful bullshit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:40:14	Happy Bipolar Awareness Boxing Day! It IS a thing. IT IS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 18:38:47	@HorzaEdeo It's warmth and happiness. I felt it too. DON'T GIVE IN!!!! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 07:45:53	@stevyncolgan And him too!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 07:41:42	@stevyncolgan Predicting the rise to fame of Brian, clearly. {innocent whistle}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 07:39:32	@stevyncolgan Either way a gentleman needs a suitable vehicle for such an endeavour.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 07:37:47	@stevyncolgan Ooooh that is a thing of loveliness. You were destined to have a spell in the police! Or was that post entrance?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 07:35:27	@stevyncolgan And then it's leather jackets, dodgy interrogation, and zooming about in a Capri. I've watched too much Life on Mars
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 07:34:24	@stevyncolgan Don't apologise! I'm easily tempted by police stereotypes Terrible weakness I'll be calling people slaaaags before you know it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 07:30:50	@stevyncolgan Don't start that again!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-09 04:12:22	@Press_Coffee I'm secretly proud of it... ...he says publicly on Twitter.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 23:53:41	@ArianeSherine To be fair, I'm a dirty great ugly lump who is not claustrophobic at all and I hate it. So I sympathise entirely!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 23:52:26	@ArianeSherine Sure they do! (Best of luck :-) You'll be grand)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 23:51:52	@garwboy Smearing yourself in week old badger faeces would be a less offensive means of acheiving this.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 19:21:41	@rainy101 @chazma85 @VagendaMagazine I am so pure of thoguth I am deliberately not getting that joke. Or giggling about it. Honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 19:20:07	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 @LokisFool (Also I didn't think of it, sorry!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 19:19:53	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 @LokisFool Secret of comedy... ...timing! ;-) Where did you go?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 19:19:21	@Sectioned_ And this is the terifying reality of even the better/best end of the current state of MH care in the UK.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 19:15:38	@debecca A few things coming together nicely. Thanks for being worried...and subtle...if you were! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 19:15:12	@debecca I confess I am bloody excited today though. Euthymic not hypo. Upcoming events (friend's stag, I'm best man etc). Hols with my wife
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 19:14:04	@rainy101 @chazma85 @VagendaMagazine Or as we call it in our household "Thursday"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 19:13:37	@debecca Don't be worried (honest), capitals in my case always indicate I am taking the micky, 99% of the time out of myself. I.e. not mania
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 19:08:47	I am back sitting in my office giggling to myself like Gollum with his Precious and a large delivery of tasty fish. Worrying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 19:08:04	Mischief Managed! EXPELLI-LIVER-ARMUS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 19:07:35	{Tee Hee} I am organising a stag do None of the stags follow me or know I tweet. I have just taken delivery of some loaded dice for forfeits
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:59:25	@ProfessorKrunch @VagendaMagazine Oh shit, just laughed out loud with sufficient volume that people are looking into my office.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:58:07	@Psythor You've been snubbed? PAH! They've started returning my letters. Even the ones in crayon.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:57:30	@orzelc Easy. But only if that's not my year. {Crosses fingers}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:56:58	@martin_crowson But but we might win a match!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:55:54	@chazma85 @rainy101 @VagendaMagazine ...first come unnatural lusts, then comes the destruction of marriage...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:54:51	@debecca I have stolen all your spoons. MWAH HA HA!! (I slept last night, took a sleeping pill, no hangover, DOING THINGS)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:53:32	@martin_crowson @LeicesterTigers Oh frabjuous day, calloo, callay! Let joy be unconfined, etc. Okay what is in this coffee?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:52:38	@rainy101 @chazma85 @VagendaMagazine Or actually, in so many ways, not! {Shudder} I surreally grossed myself out. Impressive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:52:04	@rainy101 @chazma85 @VagendaMagazine Win for Louis methinks!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:51:10	And brilliantly RT @Independent : Jennifer Lawrence finally speaks out over nude photo hacking http:// ind.pn/1rfgvSz pic.twitter.com/oh11faJwcT
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:50:27	@chazma85 @rainy101 @VagendaMagazine Curses! But I am SO in love!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:50:12	@somegreybloke Oh hell! He's the worst of the bunch. Do you need a care package? Some soothingly hard drugs?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:49:29	@CarlieP With perfect timing and inflection. In this instance "sod" can replace "fuck". In many instances that works too as a milder use.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:48:20	@rainy101 @chazma85 @VagendaMagazine Actually it has removed my bingo wings I would never over exert myself when a REAL man can do it for me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:47:27	@debecca @DramaLlama85 When the revolution comes you will be first against the wall. (or, you know, not cos liking different things is ok!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:46:21	. @NobelPrize Gently and only with his explicit permission. As I have learned to my cost, punctuation matters.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:45:39	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 @LokisFool Record it. I'm originally from the area and know some superb restaurants.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:45:13	@DramaLlama85 Watch the fevered egos of the terminally inadequate on The Apprentice? (Does it show I'm not a fan?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:44:22	@CarlieP Okay which one of you utter bastards put dimethyltryptamine in my coffee.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:44:02	@CarlieP No moon. Talking unicorn from yesterday is back. He's saying terrible things. Terrible terrible things. In many impossible colours.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:43:17	@chazma85 @rainy101 @VagendaMagazine Pfff amateurs. I just went gay for the man. AND dnner is on the go and I've polished the nuclear kids.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:41:44	@GraciePocock @VagendaMagazine I even cleaned behind the fridge just in case he, or someone undoubtedly like him, would love me. WAH!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:40:59	@CarlieP Okay that tweet just made me realise I have had enough caffeine to start hallucinating wildly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:40:37	@CarlieP Feminist cookies. It is ALWAYS about feminist cookies. After all the "god" of clouds is a HE. Showing off his {ahem} cumulonimbus
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:39:37	@JessTheChemist Pretty damn useful too... ...erm apparently.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:37:35	@GraciePocock @VagendaMagazine I just went massively gay for him. I'm worried that was not what was intended. Oh the rejection!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:36:54	@VagendaMagazine ...all it needs is to have a go at trans* people, those on benefits, and disabled people and it's got the lot 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:34:53	@VagendaMagazine Seriously, that email is like a Who's Who of reactionary nightmares. It's got your racism, your sexism, your homophobia 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:33:52	@VagendaMagazine THAT is spectacular I must be doing it wrong Marxist inspired feminist feminoids are the most attractive kind, surely? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:14:12	@AdamRutherford CHEMISTIST!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:01:26	@debecca At least. There may be swearing. That always triples the number,
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:01:00	Both superficially "technology" prizes. Both assuredly not. Really fundamental science had to be done to get these results. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 18:00:28	This Nobel is, like yesterday's physics prize, a lot more subtle, difficult and interesting than it might appear. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:57:46	@stuartcantrill It's surely me next year. I say that every year. I am unrecognised as a genius in my time. Surely a sign of greatness. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:54:50	@chiara84 I have despatched rescue teams to your location with the requisite equipment
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:54:13	2014 Chemistry Nobel goes for single molecule fluorescence microscopy. A worthy winner, suprise to me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:50:55	@chiara84 Broken....Coffee...machine!? THAT IS THE WORST THING EVER!!! I may be emotional now!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:49:40	Phew it's delayed and my feed now works. I LOVE EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:47:44	ARGH NOBEL PRIZE LIVE FEED NOT WORKING FOR ME I HATE EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:45:36	@chiara84 Not the world's most terrible plan.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:43:12	I don't even care about making typos in tweets. THAT is how good that coffee was. That's big people. BIG!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:42:13	@alicemeat I'm clearly stoned out of my mind. Normal bitterness and resentment will be resumed the second I read the Daily Mail! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:41:37	This bonhomie is not in anyway informed or influenced by the stellar coffee I have drunk and by the pot of milky oolong that I am on now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:40:21	Honestly, out of the morass of mayhem, it is always possible to find genuine nuggest of joy. I wonder why I try so hard not to some days.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:38:41	@RevRichardColes There's that or Jedward's entire opus.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:37:46	Chemistry Nobel in 8 minutes and counting. I'm a shoe-in this year. (Actual shoe-in may not be so shoe. Or indeed in.)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:36:56	@somegreybloke NOOOO! Come to the dark side! Look at Katie Hopkins TL. Doubtless someone is harassing a woman somwehere! Perhaps the BNP?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:35:49	I could highlight a thousand different joys of twitter and the web. People doing positive wonderful things. Both large and small.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:34:34	@RevRichardColes Most kind. The pile just shrunk due to lower layers spontaneously combusting. Which I am choosing to see as a good thing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:32:49	There's the stunningly wonderful @jk_rowling , who can only be described as "a thoroughly decent human being" teasing her fans with hints.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:30:40	We're about to hear the announcement of the Chemistry Nobel prize, undoubtedly always controversial, but also a celebration of science.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:29:29	Seriously, it is so easy to be distracted by horrendous energy vampires and obnoxious xenophobes. The web contains joy too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:28:47	Open Twitter, see something vile from UKIP. Instant rage Then see something marvellous from @RevRichardColes Instant cheer. (FOLLOW HIM!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:25:28	@RevRichardColes You're an admirable chap. Any chance of me avoiding my admin work by helping out? Wait...that's not quite the idea is it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:22:56	@alicemeat @LokisFool @bdogrunner Ahhh yes "recovery as performance" I know it well. Horrid isn't it? But we must get better! It's expected.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:17:40	@WomenDefyUKIP ...oh shit, I believe I may have had a sarcasm overload. UKIP tossery inspires this in me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:17:17	@WomenDefyUKIP Because we ALL know that naughty naugthy brown people who are different have to demonstrate they are nice and obedient...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:15:44	@WomenDefyUKIP Maybe theyd like it if we lesser brown people bowed before them to demonstrate our willingness to accede to their superiority
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 17:14:44	@WomenDefyUKIP Oh you HAVE to be fucking kidding me! *I* don't share UKIP's values, and quite rightly so. They're a bunch of xenophobes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 15:44:07	@davidschneider Zero coverage? Coverage of the Greens hasn't been that good on the Beeb! It's been in negative numbers at least.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 15:41:48	Morning Tweeply Peoply
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 15:41:09	@kausikdatta22 @garwboy I gots mad rhyming skills my man. Shit, I think I actually got whiter just by saying that!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:37:20	@frozenforests I could live with that. I love a good question. Anyway, bedtime for me. I'm off to attempt repose. Night!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:36:34	@frozenforests It's....not fun, but yeah mental illness is HILARIOUS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:34:06	@frozenforests I remember you saying. Bit of a commute to Scotland though!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:33:51	@frozenforests It's entirely irrational.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:33:39	@frozenforests I definitely do this btw. I happen to love my work and do fun too. The insomnia is intrusive thoughts/guilt not stress
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:31:19	@frozenforests Ah I suppose I am counting sprog (singular!) looking after as part of The Duties!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:28:56	@frozenforests I wish it was every OTHER day! It's 24/7 And no, I'm very sub human! I have to keep busy or things go to shit fast.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:26:40	@frozenforests Sadly yes. And every day. Rather annoyingly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:26:16	@stevyncolgan Note that that is NEVER a question in my experience.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:25:58	@stevyncolgan What's all this then.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:25:30	@stevyncolgan Mind how you go. (Is that the proper response?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:25:12	@frozenforests Thanks! I have a bucket of the damned things but not sure I can cpe with the Random Hangover. I get them somedays, not others
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 06:18:47	@frozenforests I am supremely glad you're okay. I'll let you know if you give me reason to unfollow you! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 03:05:14	@g3reth Yeah it's lucky we're not saying this stuff on a place where people might see it like the Internet... ...wait...waaaait...shit!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 02:53:50	@g3reth Don't tell anyone but I'm one too. Sssshhhhhhhh. #SecretIdiots #NotSoSecret
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 02:09:24	@g3reth Now THAT, THAT is utter genius! You are actually somthing of a hero to me now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:40:30	@Julie_B92 Nah they already did that. Didn't work. Anyway, normal is well over rated.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:31:53	@Julie_B92 Oddly, only the left hand side. I think I can smell red.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:30:54	@Julie_B92 Probably for the best. You don't want me to start crying and weirdly discussing the mechanism of Norrish Type 1 reactions.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:30:25	@Julie_B92 Right now I'd lie down and let them have me if it involved sleep.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:29:37	@Julie_B92 Also I used the wrong "there". AND NOT ON PURPOSE!!!! It's all too much!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:29:01	@Julie_B92 I fear the White Walkers. They may ruin my golf handicap.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:28:19	@giagia @ProfBrianCox Oh honestly, you're SO infatuated, just marry him and get it over with... ..wait. I've missed something important ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:27:06	@Julie_B92 OOOH HAPPY LIGHT!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:26:50	@Julie_B92 What's worrying is I have no idea who the laxatives got in their. I'd say they're at the wrong end, but have you seen my tweets?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:25:48	@g3reth Ha! I have an unfailed one that is at least equally dull as shit!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:25:23	@Julie_B92 Right now it is a highly caffeinated place to be. It's a combination of stag party plans, various tropanes and mystery laxatives
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:24:25	@BipolarBlogger I'm off to Fat Club. The first rule of Fat Club... ...well, we all know that one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:23:54	@Julie_B92 Aren't you Susan, Brian?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:23:05	@Julie_B92 Of course not {Overheard from unicor: "YES YOU BLOODY ARE!"} NO I'M NOT, PISS OFF!! I'm fine thank you, Susan.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:22:25	Just noticed my five year old son has has put me a treasure map in my work bag with a note saying "For Daddy". I may have just died of cute.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:19:15	@BipolarBlogger Have a lovely evening!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:17:35	That unicorn is talking to me. I'm pretty sure that's a bad sign. Either solvent fumes from lab, or insomnia. Bed or fumehood not working.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:13:02	@somegreybloke @szvan It's baffling. I'm not sure I can manage hate. Mockery yes, hate? Meh. I can ignore the bejeezus outtta people though!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:11:35	@CarlieP At this point, I'll take anything! ;-) (The drugs part was moderately humorous, hence Teh Shoutin'.)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:10:09	Also, in more reasonable news. It's Bipolar Awareness Day, I may have mentioned it. Please fill in this survey: https://www. surveymonkey.com/s/9QCB25H
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:09:25	Oh holy flippety flip I am so over-tired due to weeks, months, of poor sleep (culminating in this last fortnight of 2 hrs/night). NEED DRUGS
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:04:08	@Press_Coffee I can try to find this out. I've never quite had coffee like it. It really was sublime. I've become a terrible coffee nerd!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-08 01:03:11	@Press_Coffee Light roast, not quite Jamaican Blue Mountain but not a million miles away, strong citrus notes with dominant grapefruit note.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 19:32:28	@drinksinthedark Sleepy! I'm not sleeping well atm, so currently in woozy mode! Have a lovely lunch!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 19:26:30	@drinksinthedark Morning! Or at least a close approximation of morning!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 19:20:14	@fakedansavage Happy birthday! Thanks for what you do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 19:14:54	@bdogrunner @BipolarBlogger I apologise too much allegedly... ...for which I'm sorry! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 19:06:42	@BipolarBlogger @bdogrunner Yeah, sorry I expressed that poorly. Agreed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 19:06:26	@bdogrunner @BipolarBlogger Too many people too damned keen to tear things/people down for no good reason. IMO due to blistering inadequacy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 19:05:23	@bdogrunner @BipolarBlogger Isn't it just lovely that people try to do deliberate harm via twitter because someone did/didn't tweet a thing?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 18:57:48	I love insomnia. It leads to spectacular hallucinations brought on by lack of sleep and a concentration span so short it's
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 17:48:18	Physics prize for blue LEDs! Yay! Bound to piss off the Daily Mail "Incandescent Bulb Only" wankers!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 16:09:08	@garwboy ... ....zzz.... {wakes up} WUH!? You have coffee? Gimme!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 15:21:57	Happy Bipolar Awareness Day Everyone! (Or is it Merry Bipolar Awareness Day? I always forget. This same joke will be used next year)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 04:15:54	@SallyStrange @jailawrites Oh well now you say that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 04:07:24	@b_magnanti Also fails English. I blame Jamie.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 04:07:04	@b_magnanti I do not get these jokes. Please could you explain them too me. {Does best innocent face} {Fails}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 04:04:00	@SallyStrange @jailawrites But let me explain why haddocks are wrong and why pollock are wonderful. AND THE OPPRESSED BECOMES THE OPPRESSOR
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 02:32:03	@OpheliaBenson People who REALLY think women are people? Colour me a hardcore, extremist, fanatic, militant feminist then.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 02:31:32	@bdogrunner Ahhh you're a gent. We knew this of course!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:55:13	@FuzzCookies Well the results will be interesting at least. I recommend a controlled study over several public toilets.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:52:44	@FuzzCookies Never, I repeat never, shout THAT in a public toilet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:48:03	@Hephaestus7 @theaceofspuds I want to do things to Ian Duncan Smith with a spade. We don't get everything we want for good reason.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:45:45	@JohnCleese Okay Mr Cleese two of the big questions for you: Why? Also, what for?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:42:43	@jailawrites No, look, you're not writing a piece on "how not to be an ally" and let me tell you why I know this better than you... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:40:15	@SallyStrange @jailawrites (Regrets not going for Gadiforms now. FOOL!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:37:55	@SallyStrange @jailawrites How could I have been so blind!? How I can be a good haddockist and give up my Anti-Actinopterygiian ways?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:33:21	@SallyStrange @jailawrites I was wearing a short net...it's all my own fault.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:32:19	@Baddiel Oops. Own goal. Mind you, there's a restaurant near me that has a Rolf Harris recommendation on its menu. Reprint ahoy methinks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:31:31	@SallyStrange @jailawrites HADDOCK BIGOT!!!! Don't you oppress me. I celebrate a plurality of fish!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:24:44	@jailawrites I suppose it's not a first offence. Apple have broken iTunes...and therefore me...before. I could go up to a salmon I suppose.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:22:55	@jailawrites Hmmm I could be tempted by salmon.... ....Pacific or Atlantic?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:21:41	@jailawrites After all, I'm not a monster.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:21:29	@jailawrites Kipper. Possibly Dover Sole.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:10:05	@JohnCleese How are you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:09:41	@Press_Coffee I am considering going to get them from source they are that good. I may commit acts of wanton abandon to obtain them.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:06:11	@qikipedia Beat them very roughly with an online encyclopedia that they may or may not have corrected Ironic and surreal punishment is best
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:04:41	I want to leap upon you all and slap you with a fish.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:03:52	Also, Apple, I love you. I love you so much I almost have no cognitive dissonance regarding your business ethics. iTunes is an abomination.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:02:41	...so when your advertising, OH USE THIS SEARCH ENGINE fuckery and clunky software clogs up my exquisitely powerful machine I get pissed off
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 01:01:57	I jest about my being computer illiterate, I take fantastic care of my computers, I use the sodding things daily, they are a tool I need...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-07 00:00:28	@bdogrunner Hope things look up a bit my friend. (Also sorry if I inadvertantly contributed earlier. I tweeted in ignorance)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 23:44:04	@CCriadoPerez I despise gaslighting in all its many nefarious guises. It's heaping abuse upon abuse.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 23:04:37	@worthingskeptic @SteffanGLewis @dm2008 Very true. I knock spots off Deepity Deepak for example. ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 21:52:20	@americnhumanist All of them. All of us, dare I say it. We don't stand on the shoulders of giants, we are a frothing collection of humans.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 21:42:43	@AdamRutherford @edyong209 @sciencemagazine @kejames Comments re validity of concept should be viewed with appropriate sarcasm. Just FYI.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 21:41:37	@AdamRutherford @edyong209 @sciencemagazine @kejames Not enough chemists. It's definitely a conspiracy. Because the concept is still valid
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 21:41:01	Oh! It's gone 14:30, I have amused myslf on the PC and via Twitter and accomplished only 3/4 of what I meant to in those hours. (Maybe 7/8)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 21:26:27	@debecca Okie dokie!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 21:25:49	@debecca @ing others out. She's in a bad place, but is not being v helpful to others. I tweeted in ignorance. She's triggered a few folks

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 21:11:11	@beccybutcher [Blushes} Thanks. And now the existence of Hopkins will fade into the background. Noise as I attempt to discern signal! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 21:05:42	...humanity has a lot better to offer than the recalcitrant bigotry and shallow thought of someone being reactionary for money.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 21:05:07	I wish Ms Hopkins no ill, and am happy that *a* woman's voice is given so prominent a platform for acting like a total arse, but really...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 21:04:17	...to illumine, so many unheard voices to amplify, that Katie Hopkins does not need to be news in any serious organ/outlet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 21:03:31	I know news is not precisely a zero sum game, very few things actually are, however there is so much to celebrate, so many serious issues...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:55:43	. @Independent Apologies for shouting, but it really cannot be said frequently or loudly enough.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:54:26	. @Independent STOP GIVING THIS PATHETIC ENERGY VAMPIRE AND OXYGEN THIEF THE PUBLICITY AND PLATFORM SHE NEEDS FOR HER VOMIT. SHE IS NOT NEWS
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:47:06	@Julie_B92 TERRIFYING! Also: CUTE! I approve.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:45:52	@Julie_B92 The phone is lying to you. It is controlled by a global cabal of Space Lizards to deceive you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:43:38	@Julie_B92 LIES! It's a conspiracy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:40:23	@DramaLlama85 Obviously I will be thrashing myself with a banana on a kettle flex. Surreal repentance is the best.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:39:42	@DramaLlama85 Yeah,I've heard good things about it! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:35:58	@DramaLlama85 Tweet in haste repent at leisure! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:35:45	@DramaLlama85 But I am genuinely sorry if I stepped in with my size 12s where not wanted or needed. I erred on the side of action I suppose!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:34:19	@gravbeast Me too, but apparently thingss are in hand/have been discussed by those with more details. I tweeted in ignorance of this.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:33:25	@DramaLlama85 I obviously missed a lot of stuff, and of course I care about all of you (and even occasionally myself! ;-) ). I hope that ...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:25:26	There will now commence a series of tweets that vary from angry to sorrowful to outright hallucinatory at Stephen Fry. Or, you know, not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:24:35	I am deeply offended that more of the people I admire do not follow me. 1) This is actully untrue. 2) I will pretend it's true for laughs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:22:59	@JamesGingell1 Oh I dunno about "absolution", more the knob equivalent of someone whispering "You are but a man" in one's ear!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:18:09	@JamesGingell1 Wouldn't it be lovely if we all had a really effective way of immediately recognising that we are all capable of being knobs?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:15:24	@aweebithopeful ....even if right now it sucks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:15:11	@aweebithopeful I get the impression this is a reasonable avenue of communication for you. Don't cut it off. It may serve future purpose...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:14:34	@aweebithopeful NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Do NOT do that. If you need to step away, do that. We need you!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:13:26	@aweebithopeful By deleting you mean tweets, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:12:41	@stavvers Ahhhh yes. The one and only correct response.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:12:13	@stavvers WOW! Such Considerate! Much Empathy! DAWKWIN!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:11:30	@stavvers I wonder what the response was that satisfied his curiosity sufficiently for him to declare he deletes Qs to save people time...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 20:08:34	@chiara84 IT'S MONDAY!? Holy SHIT! I thought it was Wednesday! I will issue a dictat that it's Thursday just to make sure.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 19:46:27	@aweebithopeful It is not hard to be kind to those who deserve it so much. Now if both of us could leanr to be kind to ourselves... :-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 19:44:51	@aweebithopeful And I know it's a cliche, so sorry for using it, but these things pass. I hate hearing that when I am in a bad place, but...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 19:42:58	@aweebithopeful You've worried me a bit, but "distress" is the wrong word. Don't feel bad, you need a bit of a cheer up/chat, that's what...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 18:50:13	@garwboy @Neuro_Skeptic @NewsfromScience I never specified the book. My ambiguity leaves room for compiments and/or banter. As appropriate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 18:48:58	@garwboy @Neuro_Skeptic @NewsfromScience You do science! I've seen it in a book and everything!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 18:48:34	Dear Fellow Scientists, incoming rant and suggestion: If I could wave a magic wand and go back 20 years I'd get a Miracle Academic job 1/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 18:47:04	@Neuro_Skeptic @NewsfromScience Pfff I'm not on it either. I blame a global conspiracy of Space Lizards. Or Psychiatrists. Whichever suits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 18:42:47	@garwboy Think yourself lucky, I'm still doing chemistry and they haven't even announced my prize yet. This yera. This year for sure {sobs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 17:41:29	WooHoo UK Neuroscience Nobel!!! (Well, 50% of one!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 17:29:41	Nobel Live Feed on!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 17:28:44	Also: 3) S141 started this weekend, so back to back OU goodness ( #OUStudents ) 4) Chemistry isworking! always good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 17:26:24	EXCITED! 1) Nobel Week! (Surely my year, no? No!) 2) I started working out a named rxn synthesis of a complex NP last night, it's working!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 00:36:20	I know I am going to have to figure one out now. That's just annoying. Good way to "productively procrastinate" but DAMN!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 00:35:38	Oh dear I'm fantasising about a whole synthesis based on named reactions done in either alphabetical order or done to spell out words/names.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-06 00:20:29	I want to lactamise something. I want to lactamise something NOW. I'll accept intramolecular Dieckman condensation just for kicks instead.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-05 22:18:47	@PortiaSC I am not even thinking about a computer game and procrastination. I promise. Or going to the gym. Or reading a book. WAAHHH!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-05 21:58:10	@aweebithopeful @bdogrunner Tuesdays. Occasional Wednesdays.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-05 21:57:44	@ChemistryWorld NEVER! When I come to power following The Revolution this will be punishable by death. As will stealing my beloved reagents
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-05 21:56:20	@aweebithopeful @bdogrunner LIES!!!! I am a meat popsicle with attitude and a jaunty walk! Okay, I've gone surreal early doors.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-05 21:55:42	Today I faithfully promise to finish "tidying my office". Which isnvolves a) actually tidying and b) the work I actually need to do.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-05 20:14:21	@boobygraffoe But it helps with my anxiety. I get terribly nervous if I can see where I'm going.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-05 20:13:08	@boobygraffoe Done. We'll get you that ankle! Hey are we being manipulated somehow? {THUD} {Sound of being chucked in a van}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-05 03:10:56	@FuzzCookies I'm not watching TV but i am learning so much
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-05 02:59:52	@FuzzCookies I have always striven for greatness. Excelsior!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-05 02:58:43	@FuzzCookies Okay I was lying. There's no filth. The goat and I are eating cake I may have taken some drugs though. Not sure about the goat
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-05 02:54:30	@FuzzCookies Bceause I am doing obscenely filthy things to a Bake Off. Well, I say a bake off, more a pie. Well, I say pie, a goat.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:51:52	@alticamelus Haha! Thanks. Tragically they are getting mullered. I shall remain resolute. The upper lip will not quiver, much.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:49:29	@alticamelus Union. Leicester Tigers, been a fan of the for 21 years. Not having the best start to the season.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:47:37	@alticamelus It's rugby, not football. I know nothing about soccer tbh, don't follow it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:45:29	@alticamelus It is fun really, come rain or shine, I am mocking myself to be honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:25:49	@g3reth I am currently de-larding myself, so I will forgive him that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:24:56	@g3reth Never trusted him, looked too happy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:24:39	Oh massive dog's cocks. I'm too sober to deal with both the emotional fluctuations and the sweatiness of testicles this game is inducing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:22:19	MEN WITH BALL DO BETTERER! STOP DOING THE BAD THINGS WITH THE BALL! YOUR BALL ON GRASS WORK IS INSUFFICIENT TO BEAT THE OTHER MEN!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:20:00	Why do I care about some men moving a ball around grass? Because reasons Mostly socialisation, habit, other reasons... ...GO MEN WITH BALL
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:13:58	@g3reth Very true. Pity it's so bloody difficult!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:09:59	I am having to be both an genuine, enthusiastic fan and an ironic, self mocking fan to cope. Move ball around grass gooder than other men!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:08:09	The men who move a ball around grass that I like are STILL not moving the ball around gooder than the other men. This is three weeks. Bum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:07:02	It's lucky I'm a fan of all those other teams in the Prem.. ...wait I'm a Tigers fan? Have been for 21 years? Hmm Come on Tigers! Please!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 23:00:11	@mePadraigReidy ....and hitting the paywall.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 20:26:02	@AdamRutherford ...granted, the smoking jacket, cigarillo, and large armagnac really help too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 20:25:29	@AdamRutherford My snide bullshit is better crafted from my comfortable, well lit room, with excellent view. It aids the superior tone....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 20:18:17	@MittenDAmour I love you, envy you, hate you, and will strive to emulate you in all ways because of this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 02:47:50	@RugbyPodcast It's the contrast. The grass looks greener up against the orange of Henson.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 02:46:44	@tkingdoll Yes they do this. It's "funny" and "banter" and I say that whilst liking the damn show. Stewart Lee had them bang to rights tho.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 00:39:45	@g3reth @bdogrunner It's a time honoured manner of having one's opinions verified... I'm stopping this joke here. I'll get in dead lumber!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 00:38:15	@b_magnanti In the words of Rowan Atkinson, I wouldn't trust him to sit the right way round on a toilet. He strikes me as deeply unpleasant
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 00:17:56	@bdogrunner Possibly that was the wrong attribute to use as a qualifier! Either way, the dog's wrong!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 00:17:20	@bdogrunner Tchoh! Dogs these days! I would not trust the opinion of someone who licks their own balls... ....actually, yes I would! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 00:10:29	@bdogrunner GO! You do that #SelfCompassion , Dog! After all, you deserve it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-04 00:01:14	@robertflorence @ametonym You can't. Come the Revolution I'm using him as a meaty doorstop and dish faced paper weight.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 23:38:35	@RugbyPodcast @bathrugby @btsportrugby My TV lacks the relevant electronics to produce something that orange.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 22:00:06	@SallyStrange That is Calorilicious! I shall start meditating (read: rocking back and forward in foetal position) now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 21:58:07	@SallyStrange Well the answer to that is always yes, but I'm too goddamned fat already, so I'll maintain self restraint. Whilst dribbling

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 20:40:20	@Sectioned_ @BipolarBlogger Ahhhh. I'm outside that window. It'll definitely be up tomorrow though. I'll enjoy the anticipation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 20:34:11	@OUstudents ...started an OU degree because I played Warcraft, realised I could make 20hrs a week free, quit WoW, started 4th degree!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 20:27:36	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ Hmmm maybe I'm in the wrong place. Today's Breakfast is not crrently available. Maybe clips are.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 20:24:12	@Sectioned_ @BipolarBlogger I missed it, but have the Beeb website ready and occasionally refreshed for when it comes onto iPlayer.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 20:12:14	@ZaltzCricket This is unacceptable. Any more of this and I'll have to start paying via volunto-subscription.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 19:57:32	@whittarduk They're both already on order! I'm gutted this was a limited ed, about the tastiest coffee ever. I love the grapefruit notes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 19:50:22	@stevyncolgan True. (Whoops!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 19:49:06	@stevyncolgan Given the ease of providing things for paid download, it's very disappointing. I bet selling things to Dave etc is relevant
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 19:42:51	@CarlieP I just passed out from dream induced alcoholic diabetes. My version contains UK cider.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 19:35:56	@CarlieP What is this deliciousness of which you speak? Describe it! I crave details!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 19:19:03	@CarlieP Yum! I want cider now...might interfere with work though
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 19:16:56	@CarlieP You drink cider in the morning? I am impressed. (Cider in the UK is always alcoholic btw)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:54:54	@stevyncolgan Yup. That and The Archers. And Thought for the Day. Maybe not The Archers all the time!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:40:40	@TheCrick Now THAT is future planning.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:39:03	@JackofKent You'll be back. Given that there is always fresh lunacy oozing from every suppurating orifice of humanity.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:36:00	@HorzaEdeo @woodo79 Oh I get that! It's called "Monday". Somehow I manage not to be a monsterously bigotted cockhole about it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:34:47	@stevyncolgan QI remains one of the reasons to own a televisual thingy. And MoC (indeed almost all R4) for wirelesslesslesses.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:33:15	@HorzaEdeo @woodo79 How dare you. HOW DARE YOU! Gollum is decent, lovely and an entirely reasonable organism compared to Milo. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:30:02	@stevyncolgan Both are in the diary/Sky+/tattooed on my firstborn child for extra rememberiness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:28:57	@HorzaEdeo @woodo79 Ooooh I forgot about Louise Mensch. Psychological energy vampires the lot of them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:25:37	@woodo79 @HorzaEdeo Friends don't let friends read Milo, The Mail, Katie Hopkins... They are turds in the punchbowl of discourse.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:24:43	@fleetstreetfox "You're too amazing and frankly I don't enjoy personal and sexual fulfillment" ...worst reason because it's deeply untrue.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:17:54	@JackofKent Isn't it just rhetoric? Even with Tory 2015 it won't actually happen. It's the Overton Window being pulled by UKIP etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:13:23	@noodlemaz ANOMALY! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 18:12:36	@noodlemaz I've had a bad brain week too. Must be all the internet #Greenfield .

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 17:39:04	@LadyFOHF When I come to power this is one of the few crimes for which I will reintroduce the death penalty. By bauble.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 17:22:23	@martin_crowson Thanks. I occasionally miss these things (shame)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 17:21:02	@sailor_jerry @ThatSabineGirl Request that that it be printed on softer paper so its proper function is facilitated?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 17:17:37	@martin_crowson Is it published anywhere? (Or if it's forthcoming as implied, will it be in the Mercury?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 17:16:39	@fleetstreetfox You've probably heard this, but you were bloody brilliant on QT last night...."Rosie" (eyeroll)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 17:14:21	@mjrobbins Looking forward to it. Of course, like Ben Goldacre, you're "not a scientist", so, you know, the Prof will ignore you! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 16:57:19	@whittarduk Do you have any prospect of getting the Karatu Micro Lot coffee in stock again?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 16:53:10	@ProfFrancesca Happy Birthday!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 16:48:20	@quantick Is that the play that Sartre was writing before, well, you know?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 16:38:26	@almurray What is your view of tea made with softened water?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 16:28:26	@andy_nortcliffe Cardice + tied up nitrile glove in their desk drawer. Nothing like the classics.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 04:01:19	@bdogrunner @aweebithopeful Bath? Walk? TEA!? 1) What are these revolutionary things? 2) What do I look like? A fucking golden retriever?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 04:00:16	@BipolarBlogger It's very good. I recognised a lot of it.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 02:59:49	@V_Saggiomo @RealTimeChem Hmmm is the student from Texas? (Asked because of carbons, not to disparage the Lone Star State)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 02:58:28	@mapledaroni I will do things unto your perineum that will be spoken about in hushed whispers for a thousand years!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 02:56:24	@mapledaroni Ha, you say that, but you should know that your uvula is about to become a distant memory.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 02:54:11	@mapledaroni You know how it feels to have your anterior cruciate ligament played like a banjo? You will.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 02:52:23	@mapledaroni (This is going to get rapidly out of hand isn't it?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 02:52:07	@mapledaroni Your thalamus will be crisped in front of your fading eyes with a caramelising blow torch!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 02:44:40	@mapledaroni It might help if I could spell.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 02:44:25	@mapledaroni I will harm you right in the jejunum? Your Meckel's Divrticulum will be sore I can tell you. That sort of thing?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 02:40:34	@endless_psych Say something really controversial like One Direction is a bit poo. That'll tell you if it's working.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-03 02:39:51	@JackofKent That's the common refrain isn't it? You have rights but it's very gauche to exercise them. Every protest (for example) gets that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 21:25:33	@garwboy As if millions of brains all went a bit extra plastic at once?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 20:50:26	@sineadredmond It's really great that people want to make men and boys "do their part". Seriously. Brilliant Maybe we could listen to...NAH!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 20:49:16	@sineadredmond O.o Wait....that would imply I'm surprised. I'm not surprised. I'm appalled. Bog standard clueless sexism.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 20:46:04	@noodlemaz @soozaphone I'll make them to myself though. Because we all know them already.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 20:45:49	@noodlemaz @soozaphone If Prof Greenfield is going to say things like this, then I am going to make "dating solo" jokes. It's compulsory.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 20:44:16	@carbonfixated @SidRodrigues @MWStory But but there's a tag! And you were asked not to! Naughty naughty. I could never condone such a thing.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 20:40:17	@stevyncolgan The wrong key was picked. Repeatedly. And with some venom.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 20:36:58	@CarlieP I'm hoping for "Thumb Twiddling: Boredom its New Heights"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 20:22:31	@Sectioned_ @HorzaEdeo That would be wonderful. I don't demand/expect perfection, but learning is a really good thing to demonstrate openly
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 20:18:44	@Sectioned_ Exactly. High profile for one (or in his case many) positive thing(s) unfortunately gives a platform for the negative. Well put.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 20:16:57	@HorzaEdeo @Sectioned_ I've seen him do both the double down/defensive in the past and the reasonable retraction. Time will tell.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:57:44	@tauriqmoosa Ooooh is it sugar and spice and all things nice?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:57:09	@aweebithopeful Like the Douglas Adams quote: I love deadlines. I love the whooshing sound they make as they go past.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:55:06	@aweebithopeful It's a lot less...erm...worky...still surprisingly tiring and requiring of effort It's like it's not about avoiding work ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:53:25	@aweebithopeful Tolerable! Procrastinating. About to switch off the universe and return to the paperwork.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:51:38	@aweebithopeful Yikes! (Does Father Ted "Careful Now!" impression). You okay? (You don't have to be! ;-) Esp if you need a chat)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:49:30	@Tolstoved @zeno001 I've always found it a central irony that the stupid in homoeopathy is so very, very concentrated.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:43:41	@Sectioned_ Yup. He's wrong, and he's doing harm by adopting that position publicly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:40:28	@Sectioned_ Yeah, it's a spectacularly disappointing position for Fry to adopt (Understatement of the year. It's harmful not disappointing)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:39:34	@HorzaEdeo @Sectioned_ Yeah.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:36:18	@HorzaEdeo @Sectioned_ Cripes! It's just everywhere (okay I knew this, but it feels inescapable sometimes).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:32:53	@evilfelicity Ha! Probably! It's like a Ghostbusters-esque crossing of ther Faecal Streams if you ask me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:31:46	@Sectioned_ ...happening at a smaller scale in groups I'm familiar with.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:31:25	@Sectioned_ Oh just that this round of excuse-for-abusers, victim blaming, circling of wagons that is writ large over society is also...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:29:45	Ok this is not news to anyone probably but Piers Morgan has joined MailOnline as its US editor. Is this one of the signs of the Apocalypse?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:22:01	@Sectioned_ (It's also par for the misogynist victim blaming course. Which IMO is double odious)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:20:50	@Sectioned_ This is currently going on in atheist/sceptic "movement" (urgh) circles (as well as gamers etc etc). One person/a few people 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 19:00:56	@Sectioned_ I wonder the same thing, and/or if they are speaking up to defend friends/provide cover for friends.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 18:54:20	I wandered lonely as a cloud, Because I hadn't had a shower and, frankly, had developed a habit of being deliberately unpleasant to people.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 16:14:28	@garwboy I'm having nightmares about this for entirely nonpolitical reasons. The phrase "Farage's gurning, frog-like cum face" has been used
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 15:59:11	@ametonym You started it! I've got Clegg in a harness, Farage in a tutu and for some reason a mariachi band playing. I remain unamused.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 15:55:27	@ametonym Okay I need brain bleach. I just imagined Farage's gurning, frog-like cum face.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 15:54:40	@stevyncolgan If It was something racist rather than something mocking racism I'd get it. This? No. It's not PC gorn mad it's just stupidity
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 15:51:47	@ametonym But but won't the human right act be vanished by then?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-02 15:48:19	@DrSMMorgan But the muttering makes it. One has to have a certain style about these things.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-01 20:54:35	@JohnNor No, not really. The "mansplaining" phenomenon, whilst not unique to men, is more prevalent because of extant social misogyny.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-01 20:50:25	@noodlemaz Are you "benefitting" from the "deeply wanted" attention of a "helpful gentleman"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-01 20:48:56	@JohnNor Ask Caroline and the other women in the conversation. My comment was about a specific phenomenon, not that song.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-01 20:42:14	@JohnNor The joys of saying things in public to accounts lots of people follow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-10-01 20:36:45	@JohnNor The "he" wasn't YOU. The "he" was the general "man" referred to in one of the previous tweets.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-29 20:39:33	@stevyncolgan The degree of social media involvement can become an obligation can't it? Especially for one in your line of work I imagine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-29 20:38:36	@HenstridgeSJ @stevyncolgan It's more "news" than news, isn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-29 20:37:59	@stevyncolgan I sympathise entirely. The noise to worthwhile ratio is distressingly human! I know, I contribute to it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-29 20:37:05	@stevyncolgan ...then from there to looking into a story/subject properly. It's the noise not the signal. It might just contain a breadcrumb

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:53:02	@davidschneider I am a young man/woman/horse (delete as applicable). I want to see your bits. Send pics that will not be published, honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:52:02	@Julie_B92 He's five. 1) It's a lot to ask to gt an unspilled beer delivered, 2) I don't want to cause the lad more psychological damage
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:48:36	Also 3) It's very funny when you get caught. You will be mocked roundly and have to resign your sinecure. This is bad for you but amuses me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:47:32	Public Figures: Stop sending cock pictures to people you think are much younger women/girls. 1) It's really creepy. 2) They're the press.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:45:36	@Julie_B92 I'm proud to have done so. I consider today fulfilled. I will now lie about in my pants demanding people serve me. With no effect
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:44:17	@Julie_B92 I ask out of a need to create unpleasant bodily function based weather imagery.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:43:40	@Julie_B92 Does the cloud hang over you like the ball bag of an intemperate thunder deity raining his wee down on you all in displeasure?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:43:00	@Julie_B92 100% agreed. Or 101% for extra mathyness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:41:47	@Julie_B92 Since I like the cold, I'll swap.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:40:29	Hmmm I am struggling to muster rudimentary seriousness today.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:36:58	@RugbyBanterPag3 That's what props SHOULD look like. I am in no way biased. Honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:36:17	@upulie @pzmyers @Ilijasx Shhhh The free speech PZ police will stop you saying "No". For the clicks or to get laid or something. Now pay up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:33:27	@pzmyers @Wintersfall @JackLScanlan It's true, So Called PZ Myers told me I couldn't say "bottoms". Or in other words: This is fatuous crap
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:31:53	@pzmyers @Ilijasx No. Sod off! I'm spending my money on boots with which to kick puppies. As befits an atheist of my stature.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:31:12	@awhooker @Fire_Pretty Hmmm I can rhyme policy too. 18 year olds should be wanking or banking. 18 year olds should be drinking or thinking
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:29:55	@MoragTheGeek Very decent of you God. Keep up said thermostat twiddling and this Global Warming lark will be properly sorted.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:29:18	@tkingdoll High carbon object your tampon. Mined from diamonds and softened with the tears of MRAs I hear. I hear some odd things.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:28:22	@Julie_B92 Also, horizontal rain? If so I am sure I can work out a wee simile for you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:27:29	@Julie_B92 It's disgustingly sweaty. At a crap temperature too. Only 24C. Which is balmy at best. The fug of armpit hangs low over us all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:25:59	@tkingdoll True true. Is the moon cup a bit middle/upper? or t'other way around?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:24:20	@tkingdoll Are moocups particularly classed then? (Honest question, this is new info to me)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 20:22:31	It is sweatier than the inside of a very sweaty organism's sweatiest folds today. For some odd meteorological reason. I am unamused. Fix it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 15:47:37	After discussion and effort, my wife and i will be going on holiday to Budapest. Three days after I get back from Budapest. Well played!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 09:18:24	@rhysmorgan My Apple Adoration is being slightly tested. It's okay. I have Apple Stockholm Syndrome, I'll never stray! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 09:17:51	@rhysmorgan Also, my bitterness may be due to the fact I have manually downloaded LOTS of apps and haveto re-sort them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 09:17:07	@rhysmorgan 12 is out? I'm on 11.4 and it's v new. Last week IIRC
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 09:15:23	@rhysmorgan I'd be happy if it brought an itunes that could sync with my new iphone without crashing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 08:54:59	@tkingdoll Tofu cows?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 08:47:37	@WowbaggerOM That @pzmyers . He's occasionally not wrong. (This is genuinely very high praise. One day I hope to be not wrong once.)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-28 03:48:26	@aweebithopeful @CAMHSToAdult @GumOnMyShoeBook @Cat_Cassels @FemalePTSD @BipolarMeditate @Curiouschickee @chrisref @crimefish Thanks v much!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-27 19:01:10	@Dr_PaulC @tjwuk we should be grateful no Texas carbons are involved
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-26 20:06:11	@rosschawkins @rhysmorgan Just when I thought the battiness was at peak bat. No...no...they have to over-bat don't they?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-26 20:03:35	@Herring1967 And now we have our iPhone 6 what shall we do with it, Oh Lord, Prognosticator of Prognosticators?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-26 20:01:32	@stephenfry Your newest book appeared in my greedy hands today. I am prepared to be significantly amused and captivated.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-26 19:40:51	@HorzaEdeo RAWR! You work that pasty goodness, girlfriend! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-26 05:29:06	@BipolarBlogger busy, not too wobbly so pretty okay apologies for my poorly timed wobble the other day
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-25 23:51:20	@debecca Ewww I remember you saying had the Q hunger pangs
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-25 23:49:38	@debecca Sounds like bullshit to me! What are they thinking? Were you literally barking at the moon when they came to operate?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-25 23:47:58	@debecca W The ACTUAL F!? Please may they have moderate inconvenience for a long time! So what's the next course of action?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-25 23:46:24	@debecca You're back! How was it? How are you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-25 22:54:49	@BipolarBlogger HA! I am sorry to have online stalked you insufficiently! In that case, how the devil are you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-25 22:19:49	@RevRichardColes Cathedrals of capital have capitulated to corporatism. The divine becomes the dull. Customers mere cogs impeding cash flow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-25 21:48:26	@BipolarBlogger How's it going today? Is the hypo within manageable range (or is that by definition not the case)?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-25 01:29:33	@ProfAbelMendez Ah. I was unsure with the quote marks. There are definitely worse ways to live than via MC simulation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-25 01:24:36	@ProfAbelMendez Whoever said that is lucky. My life just got Fourier transformed. Again. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 23:52:08	@Hayleystevens Crap TYPO! I meant "offence" oh dear!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 23:51:32	@Hayleystevens ...I'm anti-sexism because I can show the very real social harms it does and the very real logical + factual flaws it has 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 23:50:37	@Hayleystevens My issue with "offense" is that it is usually a red herring. I'm not (for example) anti-sexism because sexism offends me 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 23:29:52	@pzmyers @rebeccawatson I am already helping by not tweeting anything interesting enough for her to follow me. NO NEED FOR THANKS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 22:58:16	@aweebithopeful I shall back the truck up and ship the whole lot out to you. It's a big truck!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 22:57:18	@aweebithopeful If you did I apologise for not noticing! I can only dole out Internet prizes, but you have your pick of those!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 22:56:22	@marcuschown Holding one's breath on this one could be remarkably fatal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 22:51:08	@SaintsRugby @espnscrum My condolences to Luis' family and all at Saints.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 22:48:57	@tauriqmoosa Holy hell that thing is UGLY. It looks like the ergonomic equivalent of a Tabasco and broken glass enema.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 22:46:11	It's Wednesday my misanthropy and meeting cynicism is permitted for at least 3 more hours. I will be refreshed tomorrow and love everyone.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 22:45:15	Therefore I have won chemistry for the day. I will now go and win at meetings. Or more accurately, lose. Everybody loses at meetings.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 22:44:08	In other news, my current chemistry involves no relativistic speed electrons, more than 18 atoms, remarkably few accelerators, and works.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 22:42:18	Shiny thing make it all better. I am not a victim of Stockholm (Cupertino) Syndrome. I am making a free choice to be this fucking stupid.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 22:41:02	I refuse to understand the technological demands Apple is under I refuse to inform myself about software. I just want my shiny thing to work

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:54:37	@DrSMMorgan ...approach and a reall understanding of audience and context. It's impossible to have that over the web. Esp in 140. I take..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:53:59	@DrSMMorgan Well, I have a terrible tendancy to make bad jokes. I'm sure you haven't noticed {cough}. Some jokes require a very careful...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:53:03	@DrSMMorgan And I think we'll leave THAT there. It's for the best.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:52:36	@DrSMMorgan You have made me commit a first. I have never envied someone their hate! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:50:22	@DrSMMorgan I'm also aware of unpleasant parallels I am going to avoid cheapening by mentioning. Let's just say I'm an Apple Tragic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:49:52	@DrSMMorgan I love Apple too much to ever leave, and THAT is the damned problem. Their hardware is so good!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:40:04	@somegreybloke You've taken that to a place even one so depraved as I had not imagined. Well done, sir. Well done. Collect your internet!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:31:55	@somegreybloke You luuuuurrrrvvvvve him. Okay, perhaps not. Did I just give us both a mental image that will need acid to clear?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:30:09	@garwboy You shut up! They are the best of us! The best! They deserve all the things and know all!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:29:24	@noodlemaz The Internet will mould your plastic brain into a drilling psychopath that hates women and loves cats... ...wait. Oh god...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:27:31	@DrSMMorgan Don't talk to me about itunes. It has hurt me too many times. I keep going back to Apple. I have Stockholm (Cupertino) syndrome

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:20:18	@debecca Best of luck for today Bex. If it is today! If it isn't, then best of luck for then! Oh yeah, my timing is impeccable! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:05:04	@boobygraffoe That's the best, and sadly the most accurate, description I've seen.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 18:03:12	@Hayleystevens @RanticMarketing Disgusting. I think the viral effect on this will backfire.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:59:36	@RossalynWarren @tauriqmoosa Well that is spectacularly opportunist, exploitative and disgusting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:57:27	@noodlemaz @tauriqmoosa There's a lot more social power behind it than the worst vitriol. Though that has more personal power obv.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:56:41	@noodlemaz @tauriqmoosa I think this is one of the more dangerous silencing tactics. It's more subtle. Won't someone please think of the X.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:55:26	@tauriqmoosa @noodlemaz Its difficult to tell if the person you're talking to is acting in good faith. Cluelessfine, time wasting, less so
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:54:21	@tauriqmoosa @noodlemaz It is intensely tiring. I confess I don't speak up at every opportunity online. Precisely because it is so wearing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:52:56	@tauriqmoosa In all seriousness, I think it is fine to be fatigued and take time out of dealing with this. For the sake of personal health.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:50:37	@noodlemaz Women speaking in the temple!!!! Calamity!! Ooops I mean, why do you have to be so divisive? Ahem.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:48:25	@noodlemaz Show me on the criticism of Dawkins how you harmed the Movement. This is all very....Catholic I think the word is.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:47:36	@noodlemaz World famous (right or wrong) face of atheism says sexist thing: NO DIFF! SHUT IT! Unknown woman criticises him: ZOMG SPLITTER!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:44:24	@noodlemaz Which does rather say that I have become a tad jaded by current drivel.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:43:38	@noodlemaz Yup it is...hmmm today's description is: Monumentally Poo. I'm disappointed in my fellow sceptics etc. Not surprised mind you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:42:11	@noodlemaz I am struggling to FIND a charitable interpretation. He obviously doesn't get it and obviously seeks people who reinforce that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:41:09	@noodlemaz But but he's a LEADERRR! Dude says something daft. People criticise daft. Dude doubles down epic style. Cue flailing apologetics
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 17:35:33	@noodlemaz Oh hellz what's he said NOW? Dare I look?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 07:43:48	@aweebithopeful I have such bad Apple Stockholm Syndrome. Cupertino Syndrome?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 01:13:39	@LadyFOHF No! Not at all. I have occasionally googled to find out what these things are. I confess I came out slightly more confused!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-24 01:12:35	@LadyFOHF Since I am assuredly not a finance person, every time you mention HF I think "Hydrogen fluoride" and shit myself. This is amusing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 23:33:52	@tkingdoll I always start trying to do an impression, fail, regain self confidence and try to actually sing as self. Usually by end I'm good
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 19:45:14	@sturdyAlex Perhaps you don't get their "concept". {giggle} Sorry I nearly said that with a straight face Concept: Good coffee. Now please
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 19:37:32	@noodlemaz #WhatAboutTheLADs #NotAllLADs Etc Sorry, couldn't resist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 19:36:46	@sturdyAlex You? A paying customer? Politely asking for your order of a relatively quickly made item in a reasonable time? MONSTER!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 18:39:21	@EmWatson And it was very good. I've signed up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 17:56:20	@JonnyScaramanga I expected the Telegraph to possibly be a bit crass, I knew the Mail would vomit forth something odious. Innit charming?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 17:49:08	@Sectioned_ Only if it is privatised in the woods and strips the trees for assets one parliament later. Too cynical?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 17:47:17	@stuartcantrill @deuxbeck I'm just going to be over here sulking. For comedy effect only though. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 17:45:52	@JonnyScaramanga Oh that is fucking pathetic. "Intelligent person says important thing....oh it's a she...nice shoes love". Depressing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 17:29:05	@TheOnlyGuru Well as the feeling is returned we should collaborate on manufacture of Auld Bynt toiletries. Tested exclusively on the gauche.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 17:25:37	@iszi_lawrence I feel your pain. Which if you think about it, given the distance between us, defies all known physics and biology.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 17:19:28	@TheOnlyGuru Eggs are hard to come by here, but I can wet the rim of a litre beaker and stick either sucrose or sodium chloride to it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 17:16:32	@TheOnlyGuru Very frequently in my experience. I have limonene, citric acid, a whisper of sucrose, some eugenol, thymol....mmmm cocktail!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:58:59	@stevyncolgan @pwa2009 The best excuses always start with pointing at someone and offering traditional "bigger boys done it and run away"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:57:24	@stevyncolgan Dare I ask about the genesis of this new pic? I'm not sure whether to be aroused or disturbed. Or disturbingly aroused.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:55:44	@Izaakson Nothing says responsible like being in a gutter humming a merry tune surrounded by vomit and cider I had a great careers advisor

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:48:26	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens Ah I see, so if the evidence is available you dismiss it before looking at it. Well this was a waste of time. Bye
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:47:16	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens Do you understand statistics? Do you understand that one anecdote (or several) don't represent the wider picture?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:46:32	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens I don't "think" it, some jokes about rape demonstrably do do this. Again, it's a matter of fact, data not opinion
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:45:23	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens ....evidence demonstrates it is the case. I follow that. If the evidence showed something else, I'd go there.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:42:08	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens One can vocally oppose that without being offended by it, without being sensitive. The fact that you clearly...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:40:49	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens This is what you're failing to grasp, the "joke" by that company and their crap response doesn't affect me...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:39:29	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens That's not a point, you're just moving the goalposts. You really think you're not transparent?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:35:27	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens You don't have a point. You found a thing funny. If you'd bothered to read I've addressed that, it's irrelevant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:34:16	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens Now do you have an actual point beyond "I found it funny, chill"? Which is utterly asinine given available data
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:32:42	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens Oh no, quick the smelling salts! You go for undeserving patronisation and you can't handle a little pushback? Ha!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:29:03	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens Forgive me for not mistaking you for one of the world's foremost intellectuals.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:28:25	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens I mean, you've confused funny for not problematic/harmful. You do know something can be both, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-23 07:27:09	@IAmJimPage @Hayleystevens ...you have something worth saying, maybe even something novel, wake me, but thus far, sorry, piss poor and dull.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-21 19:56:11	@joythestore @poeticfeminist That's pretty funny. Would you make a similar response about a criticism of your products on the basis of race?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-21 19:55:32	@poeticfeminist @joythestore Haha my narrow avoidance of suicide is your marketing opportunity. Spectacular! #PRFail #sellingstigma

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-21 19:43:14	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan It is an option to not do so? Are you attempting to defy the Cult of Jobs? Is such a thing possible?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-21 19:41:54	@evilfelicity @WhyAmISoWeirdo Okay. Also fairly amusing. The two aren't mutually exclusive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-21 19:07:50	@DrSMMorgan Yup. That was an {ahem} early discovery which lead to Amusing Discourse.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-20 18:56:02	@TheOnlyGuru If one cannot have minor inconveniences like truly annoying people shot on occasion it can cause stress and sexual impropriety.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-20 17:37:54	@BipolarBlogger But apart from my daft imagination, how are you?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 17:20:31	@stevyncolgan A decent invasion and a damned good thrashing... ...Sorry, had my brain tuned to Upper Class circa 1700 there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 17:18:53	@BipolarBlogger @fuzz_walk I get v frustrated with the"everyone gets that" crowd. Pathology is partly a factor of extent as well as type 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 17:18:13	@BipolarBlogger @fuzz_walk Everyone sniffs occasionally. When your nose runs constantly and you're sniffing all the time you're ill. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 17:15:15	@DocHackenbush I wonder if we could get the cash to join then use the account to highlight social issues. How long before a ban?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 17:09:46	So whilst I am meant to be preparing for an exam (I'm prepped really), Scotland decides a major change my traitor brain is consumed by shiny
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 17:08:40	Shiny thing = dickhead + self hate + oooh shiny + joy + guilt If Guilt cancels joy, oooh shiny cancels self hate. Shiny thing = Dickhead
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 17:06:01	Strictly speaking I am not *YET* a dickhead to the tune of £100 but the chances of me being a dickhead are high. Shiny thing makes dickheads
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 17:04:54	Price of my phone = X Cost of leaving contract + new very similar phone = Y Y = X + £100 New phone = Shiny Me = dickhead to the tune of £100
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 17:01:57	@sethcadin @PatrickStrud I couldn't let you do that. It's too great a sacrifice. Piers moving in I mean. I suspect I can cope with Yes! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 17:00:48	WHAT DO YOU MEAN "IT'S A BIT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT!"? Why do you hate world peace? WHY?! {Sobs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 17:00:13	1) I demand we be nice and work together. 2) No, you probably don't need all that and neither do I. All world problems solved. Carry on.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 16:56:53	@Storm_Images PRETTY POSH LADY DOES A THING! WHAT IS SHE WEARING? LOOK HERE! LOOK! Don't look there, shit is happening. PRETTY POSH LADY!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 16:56:01	@niceonekenji @caitlinmoran Are we all allowed to move to Scotland if that happens? I'll be quiet and sit at the back. Honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 16:54:18	. @PatrickStrud @andrewhunterm This is THE reason to vote No. Self determination? Bollocks! Piers needs to make with the off fucking. Rapido.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 16:51:01	@DocHackenbush Thatn is a phrase I need in my life. Excuse me, I'm off to get a coffee and ask for it using that.. {wears the coffee} Oops
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 16:49:43	@caitlinmoran I'd second that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 16:48:45	If Scotland gains independence can I have their science funding? Please. I promise not to spend it on crisps.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 16:46:46	Good Morning! 1) EXAM!!!! 2) I slept! Nice! 3) Mental Health cartoon of the day, so much this: http://www. robot-hugs.com/reschedule/

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 06:29:54	Luckily I have the day off booked well in advance. Haha brain! I win! I win! Now be a good brain and remember all the things for the exam.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 06:29:14	Fuck me running. I decided in my AddleBrain that the exam tomorrow is in Town A (near), it is in Town B (less near). Fuck you brain.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 05:20:49	@hoperiffic Deeply unpleasant. The "work harder not smarter" mindset is bullshit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 05:18:49	@hoperiffic I'd have a word at least if it's a pattern.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 05:18:38	@hoperiffic The serious answer is this is abusive shitty management. I'm not sure what you can do about it as I don't know your systems.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 05:18:04	@hoperiffic No. I beat them with a kettle flex and tell them to stop fucking whinging I was not traumatised by my PhD boss. Why do you ask?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 05:11:36	@hoperiffic Go!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 04:16:12	@mjrobbins Is it ok to find him really quite unpleasant? I try to avoid visceral dislike but that chap managed to generate it on first sight
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 03:47:47	@SpokesGay @ingdamnit You're making me go to FACEBOOK? You used to be cool, man. You know this means I'll have to remember my password.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 03:45:14	@SpokesGay @ingdamnit What have you done, Josh? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!? Did you done a Meen Werdz?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-18 03:43:07	@hullodave You got off lightly. I've had to do....things. Terrible terrible things.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 23:53:33	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 I'll take "THIS!!!!!!" For $1000 please Alex
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 22:52:26	@Julie_B92 I did the same thing with martial arts, then later with more rugby. Finished PhD, put on a billion kilos. Maybe two billion.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 22:51:32	@Julie_B92 I'm a bit old fashioned, I prefer paper lab books so I use both, which is more work but it helps me. I see advs of computer books
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 22:49:34	@Julie_B92 And this tweet is super naughty! I'm using an iPad in the lab with a proprietary lab notebook app on it. There is no escape!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 22:48:50	@Julie_B92 OH THE HUGE MANATEE!!! (My house, when I was writing up the PhD, was so clean I could have done microbiology research in it)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 22:12:07	@David_Dobbs @docfreeride Oh and if it isn't immediately obvious the emphasis on "few" in the previous tweet is "so sarcastic it hurts".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 22:11:26	@David_Dobbs @docfreeride They missed a few stellar scientists. I'm wondering when we'll get told it's a joke (uses K index) and lighten up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 22:03:50	@curiouswavefn Ha! Yes. I'd accept Julius Rebek Jr or Pier Luigi Luisi too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 22:01:46	@curiouswavefn Oh true. I wasn't considering the "how to BECOME popular" angle. More if big qs were all that's needed, we "own" (yuck) that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:59:20	@curiouswavefn About the biggest question there is. I don't think the biologists "own" it! Abiogenesis is ours! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:58:47	@curiouswavefn I mourn this because the origin of life, for one example, is an explicitly chemical (but tricky to convey) problem.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:36:26	@noodlemaz @tauriqmoosa ...despite me begging! Made multiple tweets, complained about me flooding his TL when I replied. People, tchoh!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:35:50	@noodlemaz @tauriqmoosa I had fun the other night with some goon complaining at me. Made lots of assertions, strangely low on argument....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:22:43	Sod it! The internet has done it AGAIN! I was going back into the lab half and hour ago. I was. I WAS! Okay there was this cat video...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:19:34	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox Phew!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:19:10	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox Like a PAPER book? Pervert!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:18:58	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox I do it every day. Some days because I pick my son up from school at 15:15. Most days because I get more done.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:18:25	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox CURSES! Write some ideas down on paper....no that's just weird.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:17:50	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox I got in at 5am this morning, did 6 hrs lab, got into the office at ~11am and have done five eights of fuck all since!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:17:16	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox Hmmm phone signal fast enough to download new games? ARGH NO NO! I MUST GET BACK IN THE LAB!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:15:46	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox GAMES!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:15:24	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 How will I procrastinate without you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:15:10	@scicurious ...love to see more "unknowns". After all we don't stand on the shoulders of giants but rather hordes of humans.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:14:39	@scicurious Yes please! The "stars" are far too mythologised. Their achievements are awesome and admirable but humans build legends. I'd...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:12:25	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox Get in line! Mine's thoroughly buggered.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:10:59	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 Oh I do! Playing with language for the purposes of comedy amuses me greatly. I love it in all it's forms.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:10:06	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 AwwwwWWWWWwwwww. {Thorws shoe into bush} I lost my shoe can I have 5 more minutes?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:09:33	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 BTW the image you need now is this one: http://www. troll.me/images/you-sha ll-not-pass/you-shall-not-has.jpg …
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:08:37	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 MUST HAS THE PRECIOUS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:07:43	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 It's a good word. I need it. It's now mine. Okay I think I just became Gollum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:07:16	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox I have pictures of puppies with words on them and I am not afraid to use them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:05:28	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox NOOOO! There are peoples and sights and sounds and THINGS! Stay in the internet with a nice cat video.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:05:02	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 I've had sufficient caffeine to be hallucinating drop bears. The bunyip in the corner thinks they're real though
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:03:17	@Julie_B92 HOLD ME FOR I AM SCARED!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 21:03:04	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox Dropbears are real. So are haggis that run ne way around hills due to shorter legs on one side.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:58:15	@garwboy The internet never inappropriately harmed me in any way and I am fully in line with its goals.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:57:20	The internet is simultaneously an evil time-sucking vampire and the best thing ever. I hate loving you internet. I need you. {sobs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:50:46	@wnbooks @RevRichardColes Thanks. It will be bought. It will be read. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:39:36	@RevRichardColes Oh when does the memoir come out? Or have I just embarassed myself and it is with us already?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:19:45	@ShappiKhorsandi Congratulations!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:06:33	@debecca Urgh. Because THAT's a sensible reaction to something one disagrees with (right or wrong0
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:05:31	@depressednotsad Ah thanks.Exam stress is both helpful/not helpful. I think there's Underlying Things (ominous music!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:03:41	@debecca Oh that's naughty! Well done!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:02:59	@debecca It's just abuse. Why on earth would anyone say it? Urgh!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:02:37	@debecca Sensible. Just why do people tweet things like that at each other? I love a bit of fun/banter but THAT, that's nothing like it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:01:28	@debecca Wonderful. have a lovely pre op! Is there such a thing?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:00:59	@depressednotsad Which is, frankly, bloody odd! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:00:47	@depressednotsad Thanks, I'll do what I can. I confess I'm a bit all over the shop at the moment. The mask is tough to maintain. V paranoid.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 20:00:10	@debecca WHU!? Who said that? Shoot them with extreme prejudice. Inna face. Minimum!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 19:57:44	@depressednotsad Oh I'll be fine, I know my onions. I'm just struggling a little with time management and not being mental!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 19:57:03	@debecca WHICH IS WHAT MATTERS! ;-) But seriously. Are you generally doing okay? It's a big deal I imagine
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 19:56:32	@debecca Perfectly reasonable. I approve wholeheartedly of impromptu paddys! As long as you're doing (largely!) okay, paddy aside, I'm happy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 19:55:02	Regardless of my views (confused/ignorant) on Independence if at least one TV channel is not showing Braveheart tonight I'll be disappointed
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 19:51:49	@mmbtox @paulcoxon Future chocolate is a lie. Be mindful, scoff choccies in the now. I just messed up a central tenet of Buddhism didn't I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 19:49:46	@ZJR18 @RealTimeChem Solvent runs are also good (in absence of trolleys)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 19:49:10	I started doing practise papers at 1am last night. They went well actually. But really not clever timing. Exam tomorrow! Woot!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 19:44:12	@debecca "Your surgeon today is Mr Tumnus" "FUCK OFF!" (How are you doing btw? Today's the big day I take it?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 19:43:15	@hughlaurie I've discovered there's not one in "ignorant" either.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:35:44	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan I admit I do too a little. Does that make me a bad monkey?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:34:13	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox @DrSMMorgan @realjohngreen @hankgreen Dammit you know I'm going to have to go and look up this stuff now. ;-) (or thanks)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:28:32	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox @DrSMMorgan I've never seen that before, thanks. It's good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:25:52	@mmbtox @DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 I am an advocate of geekery/nerdishness as passion and enthusiasm. Which I maintain are good things.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:24:42	@mmbtox @DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 oooh nice! I am a fan of geekery of all kinds. The subject is nearly irrelevant. The fact of geekery matters.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:23:52	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan I have found being high helps many many things... ...but it's not compulsory.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:22:58	@DrSMMorgan @mmbtox @Julie_B92 ...don't worry about that, our reeducation camps are surprisingly comfy. And draconian. And lethal. But comfy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:22:17	@DrSMMorgan @mmbtox @Julie_B92 Of course I'm lying, you do have to like it, and black helicopters are converging on your location now, but..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:21:13	@DrSMMorgan @mmbtox @Julie_B92 I don't feel superior. Python is truly great, but taste etc. I'm not prescriptive. You don't have to love it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:19:52	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox @DrSMMorgan ...boarding school. I do mean exactly. If you wonder why I turned out odd, there you have it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:19:27	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox @DrSMMorgan Seconded. Also, the boarding school and sex ed sketches in Meaning of Life are EXACTLY like a British boys...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:18:36	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan ...with at a specific point it their lives. It stands on its own merits, but there's a window when it's best
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:17:45	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Python is good, really, but I will spare you the gushing praise. It's a thing many people fell in love...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:15:42	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 @mmbtox We have Photoshop on standby. And a crowd of eager revisionists. I invented cheese dontcherknow?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:14:40	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan @mmbtox We could build a bridge out of her,
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:13:52	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 @mmbtox Hmmmm. I may actually let this slide. It means you like coffee flavour....there may be room for you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:12:46	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 @mmbtox Manifestos are always suitably vague. Crikey I don't want to have to keep too many promises. This is politics
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:11:50	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan @mmbtox Two of my favourite neurotransmitters.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:10:23	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan @mmbtox There are people who don't think that? Caffeine + theobromine FTW!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:09:09	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 @mmbtox Well obviously I like good things. In contrast to those other people, who like bad things. Obviously.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:06:47	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan @mmbtox ...something with be done. And by something I mean Something (note capital). That's SRS BSNS.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:05:41	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan @mmbtox I'm beginning to worry. There are people who do not share my tastes? UNPOSSIBLE! When I rise to power...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:01:28	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Brilliant! There is no higher compliment I can pay that wit other than stealing it + pretending I said it ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 18:00:03	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan @mmbtox I have occasionally fallen into an unstoppable pun cascade. Then a slap is necessary. A right good one too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 17:58:59	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 Guilty. I accept full responsibility.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 17:58:32	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 Oh phew! That has helped stop the brain making mental images. I don't trust the brain it is evil. {narrows eyes}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 17:57:05	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox This day you have made me proud to share a species with you. Puns are amazing. I won't hear a word against them! Hurrah!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 17:56:06	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 No! NOOOO! Really? Surely that just means running your boat over them, not, {ahem} "thingy"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 17:54:59	@mmbtox @Julie_B92 I hadn't thought of that.. ...oh no what's wrong with me? An innuendo I missed? It's the stress, it can happen to anyone
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 17:52:32	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox I tried fiddling with tigers once. I don't advise it. Still, it turned out better than speaking in public!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 17:50:09	@Julie_B92 @mmbtox Is that like dancing with wolves?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 17:49:06	@JandMo And there was much rejoicing.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 04:08:16	@CanonicalKoi @lousycanuck I disagreed with Dawkins once. I think I got away with it. #DontMentionTheWarIMeanRifts
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 04:07:11	@evilfelicity It's a good 'un. It's usually used by more educated bgots the step before Godwin's Law is demonstrated AGAIN.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 04:00:03	@evilfelicity I had you down as more Vichy! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:58:40	@pourmecoffee @NBCNews @Crommunist It's always an option. The only surprise is we don't do it all the time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:34:40	@FuzzCookies Okay All Night Dogging is a bit celeb heavy, we had that Paul Ross on here the other day.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:33:52	@FuzzCookies Sadly not. Watching it with my wife (who's not seen it) We then switch to the All Night Dogging Channel and drink meths.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:30:35	@FuzzCookies Reruns of The Wire and serious nodding plus discussions of social issues over Pinot Grigio?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:26:05	@_youhadonejob @ametonym Why am I worried that porn categories were used to make this list? Why am I more upset "amateur" doesn't appear?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:24:38	@PlanetCath I am of the opinion we all need the Roman Slave (Auriga?) to whisper in our ears "You are just a X" (whatever X might be)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:22:21	@evilfelicity @PlanetCath Yup. Didn't people learn this already? After all, The Pope, not stupid, rampaging homophobe, total ass on condoms
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:18:32	@PlanetCath Let's be honest, old profs are not always the most....forgiving or easily reasoned with class when it comes to disagreement!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:16:36	@PlanetCath ...unexamined cultural sexism. He's not in a place to be easily challenged, so reacts to challenge like an utter goon
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:16:00	@PlanetCath I doubt he's lost it. I think this was always lurking in the background waiting to come out. Clear motivated reasoning plus...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:15:09	@rabbitsoup_zola Glad to read you're safe. Hope all goes well.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:13:26	@PlanetCath For a clearly intelligent man The Dawk is making an heroic effort to be a right old fashioned knob-head. It's almost impressive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 03:11:02	@PlanetCath Favourited specifically for the use of the phrase thick as mince. Which needs greater application in the world. Oh and truth.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 02:09:55	@SPARSE_TEAL @jeffyb75 @pzmyers Okay that's too far! UNSUBSCRIBE!!!* (*With full credit to Josie Long)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 02:05:54	@jeffyb75 @UnknownEric @pzmyers Don't be obscene! Even PZ wouldn't do THAT. He did commit the genocide of an entire alien world though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 02:02:57	@CCriadoPerez 3 questions: 1) Are you a woman? 2) Are you speaking? 3) SHUTUPSHUTUPSHUTUP There I have translated 90% of this sort of tweet
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:56:39	@KrytenRD @DannyJohnJules @TORDFC This needs to be made.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:55:57	I have secretly used the free U2 album on my iPhone to make myself more aware of their music. I've told all my friends I deleted it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:51:09	@NoirDraak42 Damn! I need to watch that now. Thank you for letting me know. (puts show on The List)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:50:46	@SpokesGay @MelodyHensley @chaos46692 @pzmyers @kellybarnhill DEEP RIFTS! White chocolate and caviar FTW! #MolecularGastronomy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:49:24	@NoirDraak42 @DannyJohnJules 1) Happy birthday Danny! 2) That cake is superb and has made my day!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:48:13	@jailawrites @pzmyers I confess I'm never really sure why it is. I think it's because of evidence and reason etc. But I am assured I'm wrong
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:46:47	@jailawrites @pzmyers Well we all know men only agree with feminists for Teh Hawt Secks so either that or, erm, satanism. Probably.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:44:24	@CCriadoPerez @giagia I'm a little worried about the ads on Cartoonito. My 5 yr old started walking about saying "credit cards and loans".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:41:53	@sondosia @pzmyers Sno, no, but he did make that horizontal sleet that gets into whatever you're wearing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:39:36	@UnknownEric @pzmyers Oh come on he's not THAT evil. Although he did invent high fructose corn syrup and Olestra
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:36:30	@pzmyers THAT is a false flag, obviously. You're secretly Paul Elam.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:35:52	@pzmyers Oh come on we all know that @rebeccawatson is your secret feminist lovechild with Mary Wollstonecraft and Aileen Wuornos.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 01:33:44	@pzmyers I understand you shot Archduke Franz Ferdinand, were the man on the grassy knoll, and invented making profit by writing things.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 00:54:40	@rebeccawatson Or in other words "Chicks, don't do that."
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 00:53:53	@rebeccawatson Okay sorry, but that is just very very funny. Nice one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 00:52:32	@UnknownEric Worryingly I am now thinking of song titles... ...NOOO MUST WORK!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 00:52:09	@UnknownEric I love Cheap Trick, and the original is my favourite of their songs (hmmm maybe with a few others)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 00:49:35	@UnknownEric That is full of win.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-17 00:19:12	@BipolarBlogger How's stuff going? I have a small favour to ask in DM if you feel up to it, it's not onerous. If not believe me it can wait.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 23:12:04	@hoperiffic Thought so, just wanted to make sure
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 23:01:16	@hoperiffic LADYBRAINZ! Obviously You with your PhD and multiple degrees and being in medical/nursing school and all
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 22:48:41	@hoperiffic Well Duh! It involves rollerskating and blue liquids. And perhaps looking happy riding a horse down a beach.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:50:51	@GailSimone @ingdamnit "What's that Meth? Jesse's fallen down a well?" I may have become confused somwhere. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:50:08	@stevyncolgan Obviously his was not a position of advocacy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:49:51	@stevyncolgan To steal from Jeremy Hardy: "It's the only language they understand. Which can also be used for foreigners and old people".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:49:09	@bdogrunner Yeah, I've encountered patronising therapies/therapists. (Not IAPT, but some CBT modes/practitioners) Always made things worse.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:46:54	@stevyncolgan How to respond to that? "I hope so!" or "I hope not!" have equally bad connotations!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:45:20	@stevyncolgan I may have to have therapy and a great deal of revenge for that one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:45:00	@stevyncolgan Oh I am sure all is wonderful, I was clearly jesting. Mind you, I'm not sure I'm psychologically over the bum wiping phase.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:42:43	@stevyncolgan Also, answering daughter with "Yes M'Lady" FTW I have this to come. My 5 yr old just orders me about like the Family Guy baby
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:40:26	@Dr24hours @drugmonkeyblog That is brilliant. And damn I hope it's true.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:31:13	@stevyncolgan But not taxis eh? Don't buy them a coffee on arrival and ask them to sit in the back of car whilst you wear a peaked cap. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:28:59	@BipolarBlogger Good. Glad things are on the up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:26:04	@BipolarBlogger Are you okay?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:10:23	@hoperiffic Black market tampons? Ooooh black market feminist tampons to be used in MRA summoning rituals!? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:07:44	@hoperiffic o.O 1) I am sorry this happened to you. 2) Glad little was taken, hope damage is minimal 3) You know what's coming...TAMPONS?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 21:01:55	@BipolarBlogger Ah shit. {all the hugs} Maybe it's going around. My mask feels like it needs a lot of maintenance atm. Anything I can do?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:58:23	@BipolarBlogger Sounds like anhedonia. If Twitter is too difficult...and I know that feeling...a break? Walk in park etc?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:55:15	@BipolarBlogger Hmmm sounds unpleasant, especially robot. Absence of emotion or just on autopilot?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:51:39	@BipolarBlogger The feelings I mean, not youpersonally! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:51:22	@BipolarBlogger Less terrified + safe = good. The other stuff less so. A bit less weird than yesterday?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:48:05	@aweebithopeful Okay maybe not the last one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:47:57	@aweebithopeful {Internet hugs} {soothing beverage} {massive night out on the town involving copious boozey drinks and naughty drugs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:46:07	@bdogrunner Was IAPT that bad?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:45:50	@Pundamentalism Oh I've made THAT mistake before.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:45:17	@kasthomas Or alternatively: "Hoop Girl: an amazing horror movie that will cause months of insomnia and a terror of young girls"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:15:28	@Esteleth Nah, not enough public school people for that. It's Daily Mail populist/aspirational bigotry as opposed to The Sun's version
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:05:50	@Esteleth Historically yes, policy wise a few (UKIP bans former BNPists for ex), in reality the difference is tone and class and little else
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 20:03:30	@Esteleth Ha! I was awake for ages by that point. Don't be scared to google, go look they're impressively inadequate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 18:04:14	@Chemistry_Emz ALL VEGETABLE! Why I bet there aren't even any chemicals in it! ;-) I wonder if my eyes should be pre-rolled to save time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 18:02:22	@Chemistry_Emz Green coke? I'm going to have to google up a new consumer experience aren't I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:33:10	@edd00 @WomenDefyUKIP It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't matter if they vote my way (or not) or if they are my best friend. They go to gaol
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:24:09	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Well, I guess when you're daft enough to miss the difference between "argument" and "assertion"...I despair!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:23:06	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson So you go to Twitlonger, make no argument, just a re-assertion of your original comments and that's it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:21:58	@Esteleth ..the BNP for Daily Mail readers with aspirations plus a bit of nationalist tub thumping. Occasional exceptions Not many I've seen
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:21:08	@Esteleth ...mostly they're just a bunch of clueless bigots who are sufficiently polite to not use the n-word when people are looking, It's
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:20:28	@Esteleth ...matters of policy and heavy on rhetoric, they're dragging the Overon window rightward and sometimes a bit libertarian. But...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:19:52	@Esteleth ...but what may have started as anti-EU has morphed into a reactionary bunch of populist pains in the arse. Notably light on...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:18:49	@Esteleth ...the history of UKIP (and the movement associated with it) is complex, there's objection to the EU from the left for example...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:18:14	@Esteleth ...is now largely a protest vote by right wing Tories and people polite enough to note vote BNP but who have the same views....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:17:40	@Esteleth ...in their sights and insufficiently British, Basically it's a collection of violent bigots and apologists. UKIP on the other had
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:17:00	@Esteleth ...they're a tiny minority, had a few council seats etc, but they are really just nasty noise. A bogey man. Unless you're in....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 17:16:14	@Esteleth The BNP is an openly nationalist party that grew out of the UK "far" right National Front. V racist and often nakedly so...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 05:30:32	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Lovely! Thanks. The only issue is it's 22:30 over here and I'm off to bed. So I'll see it in the morning.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 05:15:24	@WhySharksMatter I saw it last night. Bits of me are still in pain.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 05:15:01	@LadyFOHF It's okay, I'll counterbalance you by being a total rotter. I don't even like kittens. (I do really...DAMN!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 05:14:18	@aweebithopeful YAY! I'll pay extra tax too. I will. Just please be progressive. Please.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 05:13:50	I know this makes me a bad person, worse than Hitler, and at least Double Stalin. I murder babies in my spare time and kick puppies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 05:13:19	The previous tweet has been brought to you by "FUCKING TORIES!!!". Also, I want to point and laugh at UKIP from across a nice border.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 05:12:29	Dear Scotland if you say YES and go socilaist can I come? Please. I'll work really hard and stay at the back and not make much noise. Honest
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:54:19	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Before you go, I have one question. Just one, indulge me. Is it possible you're wrong? (Key word:"possible")
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:53:13	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Please let it be over! You've provided nowt of substance and a lot of whining. Pity. I was hoping for more
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:45:25	@CarlieP Not me, guv! Far too much like hard work. I've met the Youth, they don't call 'em johnnies any more. I think. I've not really asked
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:43:09	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson ... and frankly act like a silly sod then you are just wasting my time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:42:45	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson If you make your case I'll agree and tweet a retraction. Sound fair? If all you're going to do is assert...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:42:11	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson All this effort, all this twittering could be saved, go to twitlonger, type up a demonstration, I'll read it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:41:40	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson ...demonstrating something is true and asserting it is true?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:41:15	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Oh dear, really? What point have you made beyond mere assertion? Do you understand the difference between...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:37:17	@CarlieP We have the phrase, it means what you think it means (clean meaning), but I haven't heard it used in ref to condoms.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:30:54	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Anyway, you have, let's say, 3 tweets to prove I'm not wasting my time with you. Please start your argument.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:29:39	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson But by all means keep handwaving.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:29:29	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson No I agreed it wasn't 100% accurate due to various limitations, misrepresentation is something else.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:22:17	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Then make the case, don't merely assert it. Can you do that? You do understand the difference right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:17:01	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Now come on. You have a choice: Make an actual argument or don't, but spare me this drivel, it's tiresome.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:16:19	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson I'm happy to chat, but if all you're going to do is masturbate in public, I'm not really willing to help.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:15:41	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson WaHEY! Underservingly patronising for the win! Look, are you going to make an argument or not? Seriously.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:11:19	@CCriadoPerez I feel the same way. However, nice socialist state to the north? There will be a stampede!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:10:28	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson But by all means keep hand waving, the breeze is fantastically cooling
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:10:09	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson HA! I'm not remotely upset. It's on my left hand screen right now, you;re on the right. I'm merely waiting
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:09:46	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson If I were a terribly cynical old man I could infer that you weren't serious.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:09:26	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Also interesting how the character limit's reasonable for you to cite as preventing full argument but not me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:08:07	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson So Twitlonger and more than one tweet don't exist? Interesting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:07:20	@f1_karen @WomenDefyUKIP @UKLabour If my previous was too sublte. Please @me out, Karen. No longer interested. Thanks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:06:23	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson I made no claim to represent a whole article in one tweet, nor do I think it would be a reasonable claim
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:05:54	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson I have. I can explain what I meant. Perhaps you can explain what you understand by both my tweet and Harris
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:04:58	@f1_karen @WomenDefyUKIP @UKLabour Well obviously. Anyway, if you don't mind, you;re rather boring so, I'm absenting myself, thanks. Night.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:04:28	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Also, reasd Harry G Frankfurt "On Bullshit" an excellent philsophical explanation of what "lies" are.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:03:50	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Lies? Please demonstrate this. You have thus far failed to do so. Merely asserted it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:03:25	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Perhaps what I mean by "inaccurate" is not the same as what you mean. Gosh! Wow! Much Subtle! So Nuance!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:02:45	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Haha! thanks for the advice. I'll take it on board. Anything else in lieu of actual argument? I note no refs
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 04:02:13	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Again assuming intent. You missed the point didn't you. (Note that isn't a question)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:59:35	@CarlieP The 1963 part might be inaccurate! Rubber Johnny = condom (archaic nowadays)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:59:03	@f1_karen @WomenDefyUKIP @UKLabour My point is child abuse is horrific whoever does it. How does it relate to what UKIP are criticised for?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:56:39	@f1_karen @WomenDefyUKIP @UKLabour If it was. Great. If it wasn't. Equally great. How does any of that exonerate the drivel UKIP spout?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:55:37	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson ...expand on "inaccuracy" etc is pretty ironic. And funny. But then I am mean.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:55:10	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson So far you've done fuck all but whinge about mediocrity. Which let;s be honest, given your reluctance to...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:54:42	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson ....of what I said. I know where I could be misinterpeted/have made mistakes. I'm asking you what you think.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:54:12	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson So, as I said, what's the basis of your argument for "inaccuracy". I know why *I* am aware of the limits...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:53:34	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson ...doing is having to assuage the hurt feelings of a fanboy then really you're wasting my time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:53:02	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson I'll cheerfully have a chat about what I consider the limitations of Harris' articles, but if all I'm...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:52:36	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Perhaps there's another cause for your complaint than dishonesty. Or is that too sublte for you to grasp?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:51:49	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson ...comment as opposed to a detailed and well constructed argument?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:51:34	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Or are you simply going to whine I didn't use the ~140 to make anything other than a very quick and dirty...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:50:58	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Not too sublte, just making baseless assertions. Have you got an actual argument, referenced preferably?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:48:08	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson That's not a criticism, I'm simply saying it gives me little to get my teeth into.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:47:50	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson What substance was there other than assertion? No argument was made. No reference made. Just assertion.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:44:41	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Fantastic, then explain it to me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:41:51	@f1_karen @WomenDefyUKIP @UKLabour Wait didn't you just tweet? How do you know what people do outside of tweeting? I smell hypocritical bull

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:36:34	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson Farcically dishonest? Interesting. No other possible source of what you view as inaccuracy?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:32:37	@btsportrugby Hi Manu, have you thought about diving lessons from Tom Daley? Your form off the ferry was good but could use work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:31:02	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson ...bitterly disappointed by Harris et al. He should not only know better but be able to do better.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:30:31	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson I'll grant it's only partially accurate, but not as inaccurate as I might like. What you don't grasp is I'm..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:29:47	@Shawn_Beaulieu @OpheliaBenson I could say that about the Harris reply article. In fact I have The comment above about biology is semi-jest
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:27:25	@FuzzCookies Ah. I am having a man moment and watching rugby. Not for the nice sweaty men with their muscles. That's right out. Honest.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:12:21	@CCriadoPerez {Puts hand up} I know! I know! That would be "badly".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:09:13	@RevRichardColes Better training. There has been a campaign of militant nice. What do we want? Manners! When do we want'em? When convenient!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:07:25	@evilfelicity Yeah, just a tad!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:07:01	@evilfelicity Yeah THAT isn't criticism or pushback! That's nothing resembling it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:04:25	@evilfelicity Hence I would recuse myself from any conversation about it on the basis of catastrophic ignorance! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:03:59	@evilfelicity Say them, or say them without criticism/pushback. Those are different things. And it's an area I am *REALLY* not an expert in!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:02:13	@evilfelicity @CCriadoPerez Oh hell yes. Almost anything that involves folk psychology or a nice powr gradient to punch down.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 03:01:14	@CCriadoPerez @glosswitch Honestly, if the objection to something is that your ideas have been "oppressed" by "political correctness"...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 02:58:55	@CCriadoPerez @glosswitch n the Wolpert thing, I noticed a large number of instances of "political correctness". It's a litmus test for bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 02:57:47	@CCriadoPerez @glosswitch A loo-ee that is

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 02:53:32	@Bolg_i_am @WomenDefyUKIP If I remember rightly, yes. But why let the facts get in the way of a top drawer narrative?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 02:52:52	@nucAmbiguous @docfreeride ...we'd be oppressed". That one always causes me to start crying uncontrollably. The dissonance hurts.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 02:04:10	@WomenDefyUKIP Is this because of the Harman/PIE thing?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 01:59:44	@szvan "Ladies"? (Although I confess that it part of my British idiom, albeit self mockingly. It translates poorly across the Pond IIRC)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 01:58:45	@Giliell @andtheunicorn @OpheliaBenson Yeah, by leaving out race we're being racist.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-16 01:51:04	@docfreeride Now I would NEVER be so uncharitable! Such a thing has no historical precedent in race issues for example {Flutters eyelashes}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:11:51	@BipolarBlogger It's enitrely possible that a "blip" (yeah, well, you know what I mean) is the standard course of such a decrease for you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:11:17	@BipolarBlogger I'm not sure that's the case though. After all the med change has effects, you could well be working through those.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:10:38	@BipolarBlogger Ha! "It's not all about you" "Are you calling my mother a liar?" ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:10:17	@BipolarBlogger It's a little debateable atm. Overal positve but a little unsure.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:10:01	@BipolarBlogger I've been there of late with mood stabiliser. I have halted Doc approved gradual decrease for ages to make sure I'm stable.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:09:10	@BipolarBlogger So this time the decrease didn't work. It's not destiny, it's a temporary adjustment. You know this will pass better than me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:08:23	@BipolarBlogger That is impressively bonkers! :-) (<----empathetic/sympathetic not mocking) Seriously unpleasant to experience though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:06:44	@BipolarBlogger <still available.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:06:32	@BipolarBlogger Awww {hugs} post med change wobbles are not uncommon. You know that as well as I do. And as you said, option to increase is>
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:04:54	@BipolarBlogger ///which I confess sounds very scary.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:04:39	@BipolarBlogger Best of luck. I am having the paranoid/feelings of worthlessness/feelings of being hated atm too. Not about objects though..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:03:51	@BipolarBlogger ...not yet busted but thoroughly chipped. Is something similar for you? I.e. overall progress/effort positive, today shoddy?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:03:17	@BipolarBlogger ...I'm stuck in it (obv) can see through it (obv) have tools to break it but cannot smash the glass. My wife said glass...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:02:31	@BipolarBlogger Urgh. We're procrastinating together! I was talking to my wife about this last night. Analogy I used was glass box....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:00:37	@BipolarBlogger ...as mine is today?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 19:00:17	@BipolarBlogger ...feature for you? Are you experiencing things that are equally problematic, or is "agitation" within "Monday limits"...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 18:59:34	@BipolarBlogger That's a tricky feeling, when common things are alien. Only had it at serious moments of panic/paranoia, is it a common...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 18:49:54	@BipolarBlogger Worried about an upswing? Or within normal limits for you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 18:27:42	@Julie_B92 This is all true on every count. I understand the rain in Bergen is frequently horizontal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 18:26:04	@Julie_B92 Very true, but only occasionally. The rain is pretty often.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 18:24:43	@Julie_B92 Oooooh good choice. Excellent dilemma. I'm v fond of Scotland, conflicted about independence but would rather like to win the WC!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 18:23:54	@Julie_B92 ...after all you get Aus and NZ, beautiful, warm etc, we get, well, to be blunt, rain.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 18:23:22	@Julie_B92 Calling me Australian! That's... actually funny. I maintain that Aussies and Kiwis have a special smile for we Brits....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 18:19:27	@Julie_B92 Ahhhh I had heard about that. I'll trade you decades of lapdoggery and Tony Blair for The All Blacks? You don't need them, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:59:34	I have decided that idiomatic langauge and use of metaphor and simile is odd. I blame those people.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:59:01	I suppose there would also be some possibility of me being housed in luxury stables and put out to stud. Frankly, that's much less likely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:58:26	I have just pissed like a racehorse. I.e. With the strong possibility of being shot if I broke my leg. (How I would do that eludes me)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:47:31	@TheOnlyGuru I mean, I do the "w-word", but purely for reasons of irony. No gentleman has to do that sort of thing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:46:56	@Julie_B92 Is it okay to be proud I'm not entirely sure (absent a google) who or what that is.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:45:40	@TheOnlyGuru The dirty fucking bastards.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:44:04	@TheOnlyGuru Horrendous!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:43:09	@Julie_B92 Is a pretty lady doing something pretty? Have some brown people done something naughty? Those usually work as bread and circuses
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:42:04	@TheOnlyGuru Seriously? You got binned for that?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:41:22	@Julie_B92 There will be some serious psychological reasons for this, no doubt, but why examoine that when I can blame everything else? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:40:48	@Julie_B92 I'm seriously considering the utter destruction of the internet and, by extension, humankind Hm I *might* be tetchy this morning
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:39:56	@Julie_B92 Probably! It makes the pain vodka-tastic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:30:48	This is why I strongly believe that marijuana should not be legal, but instead, compulsory. It is also why I inject vodka into my eyeball.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:29:51	Dear Internet, you have managed to cause mild to moderate ranting. Sexism, more sexism, cheeky racism, and bullshit about magic water. GG
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:24:16	@charltonbrooker @RealSharHorgan @robdelaney @SarahMillican75 @glaceau_sw Given it's a Coke product, see @markthomasinfo 's book on subject
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:02:20	@stevyncolgan Must be. Good news is that you've effectively had an MRI scan every time you've cooked. Check wall opposite for results
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 17:01:13	@SarahMillican75 @glaceau_sw Because really, really impressively overmarketed nonsense claims about water need boobies? I dunno.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:58:21	@stevyncolgan Every time I look at that photo I'm surprised you couldn't cook on the magnetic field from it alone.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:55:49	@ThomasSwindell @simonpegg ...after what was essentially a joke. But you know, internet! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:55:33	@ThomasSwindell @simonpegg That goes all the way down to any division of time you care to meaningfully use. Apologies for science pedantry..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:54:38	@stevyncolgan It is...I...wow! Impressive!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:54:18	@ThomasSwindell @simonpegg ...get used. Think for example of GPS systems and atomic clock experiments. Need better resolution than 1 hour.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:53:49	@ThomasSwindell @simonpegg Actually, it is. TimeZONES might vary by hour for various reasons divisions by seconds different from Greenwich..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:52:46	@stevyncolgan THAT...THAT...please tell me you pulled that off the web as a joke. That is impressively lethal. You, sir, have my respect.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:51:58	@LadyFOHF @CCriadoPerez Mind you, that said, when STEM organisations get sexist, they rarely do subtle!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:51:31	@LadyFOHF @CCriadoPerez I'm honestly surprised. I've been in big/little pharma and unis for ~20 yrs (working), and it would raise eyebrows.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:49:36	@simonpegg No. Sorry. It's always the right time somewhere. whatever time I give you. Apologies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:48:29	@LadyFOHF @CCriadoPerez I'm really surprised it would get past anyone in work environment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:47:26	@LadyFOHF @CCriadoPerez ..I confess given how sensitive and professional my work environment is, that that phrase would fly anywhere similar
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:46:32	@LadyFOHF @CCriadoPerez ...(it usually is ;-) ) And it (up to individual) likely is a minor instance. Still gendered in construct....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:45:31	@LadyFOHF @CCriadoPerez Certainly no need to apologise to me! You face sexism I simply don't after all! Maybe it's ranty Monday for Louis...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:41:30	@LadyFOHF @CCriadoPerez ..phrase in my earshot would be for a bollocking so epic they would still be glowing! Jokes apart, that stuff annoys
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:40:34	@LadyFOHF @CCriadoPerez ...sort of patronising guff (sexist or otherwise) is a teeth grinding part of my daily work. Anyone who used that...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:40:05	@LadyFOHF @CCriadoPerez I suppose at this point I'll confess as a (senior) scientist dealing with (senior) non-scientist management this...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:38:37	@LadyFOHF @CCriadoPerez ..an activity associated (largely) with one gender. It's pretty sexist. Intent might not be, effect certainly can be
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:37:53	@LadyFOHF @CCriadoPerez Ahhh so some "lesser" person has to stick to their "lesser" task, the simile for which just happens to be coded to..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:35:53	@CCriadoPerez Because, haha, you have to do, hoho, things that, haha are inconsequential, hehe, like old women. {vomits}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:34:53	@CCriadoPerez What does it mean? I mean WHO has to "stick to their knitting"? "Underlings"? It's problematic from top to bottom AFAICT..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:32:59	@robinince Pfft don't be ridiculous! Although, I hear Jonny Wilkinson has some views on monetary union and Eurozone fiscal responsibility.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:31:18	@registrarism @UniofNottingham Really sorry to read about the fire. Glad no one hurt and no research lost. All the best with the rebuild.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:28:38	@stevyncolgan {sniffs} I have this amazing screenplay to pitch to you...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:27:55	@brianmoore666 @SteveH8960 I'd err on the side of their being the option (usual caveats about practicality)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 16:27:23	@brianmoore666 @SteveH8960 I certainly agree. I appreciate teams have to raise money but I'd rather not be a walking billboard on match day
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 04:56:06	@DocHackenbush Fantastic choice!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 02:32:44	@andy_nortcliffe It's up to 30 days now? Or is that including bank holidays?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 02:30:39	@andy_nortcliffe Luxury. When I were a lad (etc etc series of rampant lies about hardship) Have a nice time!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 02:29:50	@MittenDAmour "I'm in ur hows! Poopin on your d00ds"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 02:29:10	@andy_nortcliffe Bitterly I would imagine. Glad no one hurt and no work lost. BTW What is this "day off" of which you speak? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 02:27:31	@there_runsMary @rbhu7 (These may not represent my actual views....shhhh)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 02:26:50	@andy_nortcliffe How's everyone after the events of Friday?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 02:26:17	@Skepticat_UK Oops got DrOz spam after that. I suspect that wasn't the answer that he was looking for...naughty naughty Louis. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 02:24:11	@there_runsMary @rbhu7 1) We don't say that. Rich is a soccrist. By definition wrong. 2) We don't say that. Cameron is a Tory etc.. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 02:23:22	@welfordwrites @Skepticat_UK Yes It works wonderfully at exploiting the worried well and desperate people in vulnerable health circumstances
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 01:22:52	@SpokesGay I'd like to thank the United Mangina Academy Of Betas And Below for bestowing upon me this Vagenda. And Mum. And Anita Sarkeesian
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 01:21:42	@SpokesGay I had LITERALLY not considered this. ZOMG! I am a mangina too! I've been told this. Finally! Finally acceptance by the cool kids!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 01:11:48	@SpokesGay BTW have you seen the Agenda? It's surprisingly well argued and soberly coloured. Who knew stereotypes were bullshit? 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 01:11:19	@SpokesGay {And now Louis moves to the non-serious portion of the twitter exchange} Well I blame the Gheyz. With their Agenda. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 01:08:59	@SpokesGay It's like "denialism". Doesn't matter what's being denied, the pattern of behaviour is the same.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 01:07:55	@SpokesGay ...but I think that is a difference of size/tone of issue, not substance. Happens in the US (etc) too I note.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 01:07:27	@SpokesGay Yup. It's a bit complex in the UK because of the racist "critiques" of Islam (for ex) as masks for xenophobia being v promiment..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 01:05:31	@SpokesGay As with everything. I know the phenomenon. Get it is many SJ/anti-bigot fields. Weird misunderstandings of racism for example.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 01:04:40	@SpokesGay Sees next tweet. Gotcha
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-15 01:04:11	@SpokesGay Is this a consequence of fat acceptance or something else? Have I missed the point? (Serious for once)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 20:57:55	@AdamRutherford @jimalkhalili Only on Sundays!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 20:56:17	@AdamRutherford @jimalkhalili Clearly you are a Big Pharma Shill. Try all natural, historic Pythagorean Method and work it out with a pencil
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 20:18:09	@profanityswan @TheOnlyGuru "Piss off!", surely?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 20:03:59	@stavvers Could you get me one of the "how not to rape" leaflets I am sure he's also handing out... ...what do you mean they don't exist?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:55:28	@daraobriain May I be the first to remind you of the classic Python sketch. And congratulations.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:43:41	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 Awwww but she's my go to guru for everything. I listen, laugh, do the opposite.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:35:00	@CCriadoPerez ... the Toby Young and the Clarkson for comedy value? Or do I admit that that's a feeble joke? ;-) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:34:26	@CCriadoPerez Yup. Just one 5 yr old boy. It has been bought and is winging it's way to my growing reading list. Do I put it between 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:32:26	@Lucy_Worsley @debecca That would be "crossed". I'm now furious about my typos.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:26:42	@Lucy_Worsley @debecca They've sorssed out both nothings. I'm furious about the grammar!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:25:11	@tkingdoll That's very kind but it's not for weeks yet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:23:27	@andrewcopson @jimalkhalili Some sort of electric cattle thingy? Isn't that how we humanists are usually corralled? That or biscuits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:17:39	@raluca_hippie @DMReporter Absolutely. Small particulates are just the beginning of the issue. What about burning Kendall Mint Cake?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:13:45	@szvan @AlexGabriel Sorry you two! You appear to have stimulated a minor rant. One that is in no way related to current procrastination. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:12:58	@szvan @AlexGabriel It's enormously frustrating (and demonstrative that certain interlocutors are not honest). Dawk should know this 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:12:15	@szvan @AlexGabriel Oh this jail thing is such a massive red herring. Discussing an injustice in public =/= jailing on flimsy evidence. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:11:13	@LadyFOHF Oh YES! The one and only correct parental response! Outward concern. Restraint. Teaching gouging in the back garden privately!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:09:04	@LadyFOHF It's a lesson 99% of the adults I know have yet to learn. Myself included on occasion.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:07:09	@andykhouri We're sorry about that last bit. But to be fair I was awoken at 4am by the thought I might be missing out on nighttime US tweets
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:05:14	@DMReporter Scottish Independence Causes Cancer? It's been done hasn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:03:44	@LadyFOHF .... the Threat of The Cupboard With Spiders and Pointy Sticks (unused), or more normally the Threat of Sarcasm (used a lot).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:03:02	@LadyFOHF Ooooo ouch! THAT has to hurt! My son gets "interesting" when he doesn't win the cup. It is at this point I usually administer...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 19:01:42	@LadyFOHF No worries. Candles lit, wine on standby. I am in no way procrastinating my way out of revision. That is right out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 18:59:22	@LadyFOHF With gritted teeth, obviously.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 18:59:11	@LadyFOHF (Also, impressive competitive spirit in your daughter. Next season she'll be shaking hands and saying "good game" to all!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 18:58:14	@LadyFOHF I'm not convinced. I'm making chicken stir fry for dinner by the way. What time are you due back. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 18:57:33	@wildwalkerwoman @junayed_ Ah yes, the Potter data. Good call.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 18:55:22	@LadyFOHF I have a 5 yr old who has just been taken to rugby by my wife (I'm revising, honest). He too lobs wobblers. Are we married?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 18:53:29	@wildwalkerwoman @junayed_ Ahhhh good point. I always mix them up. Mind you, I've heard about white witches.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 18:49:00	@wildwalkerwoman @junayed_ Yeah something like that. Pointy hats would get people confused with witchcraft, no? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-14 18:44:21	@stephenfry Crikey! That's deeply eerie.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 17:52:11	@bdogrunner @aweebithopeful I have a better idea, how about "Be you, you're bloody wonderful you are"? Sounds accurate to me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 17:51:28	@bdogrunner @aweebithopeful Seconded. Bloody crap plan. Mind you, my plan of DRINK ALL THE GIN EVER is only mildly worse! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 17:50:16	@MittenDAmour Does it need to be a certain number to get you there, beacuse 5.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 17:48:50	@drinksinthedark Not unless it involves occasionally poking him with a pointy stick when he says things about feminism.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 03:26:26	@drugmonkeyblog ...teachers as a general rule, highly supportive of education (obviously!) and just surprised. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 03:25:52	@drugmonkeyblog Okay. As I said these rare encounters for me are the tiny exception but v odd when they happen. After all I am in awe of 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 03:21:16	@drugmonkeyblog I ask because it is so at odds with my normal experience.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 03:20:44	@drugmonkeyblog My son's at a good school with the odd patronising teacher who, I think, might view parents as an obstacle. Similar?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 03:18:35	@drugmonkeyblog Is this as a parent? Because if so, holy hell do I encounter the same thing!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 03:17:25	@nicoleintrovert @SecularWoman Drunk near those trees? Totally means them getting their pollen everywhere is your fault. You know trees.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 03:13:18	@BBCScrumV Did he tell them it wasn't soccer? It's not a Full Nigel without that IMO. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 03:11:55	@WomenDefyUKIP Well it is true if everyone votes UKIP, UKIP will win However, if unicorns flew and farted rainbows, I'd be a pixie. Likely!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:59:54	@BipolarBlogger Hmmmm now how do I disagree with that?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:59:00	@BipolarBlogger Are you calling my mummy a liar!? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:58:42	@gogreen18 Super secret project? The very best of extremely public luck! Love your work!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:58:15	@tkingdoll Not....innuendo? But... {Faints from shock}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:57:42	@BipolarBlogger Whu!? Unpossible.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:57:23	@Giliell Well, exactly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:57:12	@V_Saggiomo @reddit @RealTimeChem I saw this earlier. I am being a good boy and not laughing elitisticallynessly (That is SO a word).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:56:20	@BipolarBlogger I'm working on it! (Also I now want curry!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:56:00	@inmywindow @BipolarBlogger I'm not sure the iOs ones are all free, IIRC there are free versions of two of them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:55:10	@Giliell Well testicles do make one's pronouncements truthier. Well established Man Fact (not to be confused with truth or fact).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:54:24	@tkingdoll Talking about G'n'R/music or was it some species of frightful innuendo. If the latter, I Disapprove. Never catch me innuendoing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:49:09	@BipolarBlogger @bdogrunner @MentalHealthCop Well you are all such impressive advocates and activists for MH issues. Deserved in all cases.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:47:58	@BipolarBlogger @inmywindow Online I use Beating Bipolar (free, just sign up), on iOs My Mood and iMoodJounral and Moodkit are not terrible!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:46:46	@bdogrunner @MindCharity All right, I'll relegate you to inspiration only every other day, but you have to work really hard on Thursdays! ;)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 02:45:18	@bdogrunner @MindCharity Stunned...but very very deserving. You my friend are bloody inspiration!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 01:22:54	@bdogrunner @MindCharity WOOT! Well deserved!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 00:53:49	@BjarteSF Apparently so. With no small degree of clue-lack too. How......odd.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 00:50:14	@BjarteSF Ah but does it go as slowly as Dawkins getting the point about rape apologetics. I wonder what I have been reading today...Hmmm.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 00:45:08	The last two tweets were brought to you by the letter SARCASM and the incredible misunderstandings and false equivalence of rape apologists.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 00:44:27	Obviously they were drunk, so my punching them in the face is because they were irresponsibly drunk. They should watch their slutty face 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 00:43:20	1) Someone is in a pub. 2) They're drunk 3) They speak to me nicely 4) I like punching faces so I punch them in the face Slutty face 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 00:12:53	@hoperiffic well were I a betting man I'd err on Yorkshire not Surrey for Stansfield. But it's not my field of expertise
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 00:11:19	@hoperiffic That is possible, but the UK is so mixed about that tracing name origins that specifially is a little antiquated. Not always.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 00:09:59	@hoperiffic The wealthier ones. It tends not to be the cheapest of locales.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 00:09:11	@hoperiffic Inform them that the clueless is strong with them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-13 00:08:51	@hoperiffic The answer to that is what can only be described as: VERY NO.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:54:50	@TheOnlyGuru ...something to make offensively nice martini bases. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:54:32	@TheOnlyGuru I recently bought a vacuum/siphon coffee maker from Cona. I am tempted to get some gin, some syrup and infuse it with 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:52:24	@TheOnlyGuru {blushes} I'll blame the drink! I've not had any. More's the bloody pity. I shall remedy it forthwith.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:50:04	@TheOnlyGuru What's the q? Or is it my atrocious rantery!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:49:03	...horribly ignorant and blinkered, at worst, malevolent. I'm struggling to see what other conclusion to draw. n/n Rant over for...oh 1min.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:48:17	I am bending over backwards (stupidly) to find some reason to conclude that a man I admire(d?) is not what he appears to be. At best 10/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:47:03	...there is robust data and evidence in the social sciences. Not all points by any means but how does that differ from any area of study 9/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:46:16	....with the available data in a manner that he would (rightly) decry in others. Despite my youthful opinions (wrong) to the contrary 8/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:44:51	...that doesn't just border on harmful but crosses it right into the middle of dangerous. That or he's in some manner utterly at odds 7/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:43:44	Either he is demonstrating a fantastically tin ear, a degree of motvated "reasoning" that would shock a creationist, or an indifference 6/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:42:44	If Dawkins is willing to not be sexist, but not able, or able but not willing... Why treat the man seriously on the subject at all? 5/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:41:07	...remotely funny, nor innocent. What conclusions on (scant? HA!) evidence is one to draw? An Epicurean theodicy of Dawkins? 4/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:39:28	...are humorous in some fashion (sarcasm etc) is moot. The impression, the "fellow travellers" (deliberate!), the *context* is not even 3/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:38:34	...either does not grasp the (relatively simple) issue of consent or is willing to appear not to grasp it. Whether or not recent tweets 2/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:37:49	And again despite my own many, many mistakes I find it staggering that a man as erudite, subtle and clever (not sarcasm) as Prof Dawkins 1/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:35:55	@SpokesGay @juliabwrites Me too. Clearly because we are bad, bad people. I blame you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:33:02	I don't hate men as much as Professor Dawkins clearly does After all, I'm relatively confident I have more moral agency than a falling rock
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:23:47	@SpokesGay Christ that's good! I'm on carpet!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:22:27	@SpokesGay I wonder, did you hear my eyes rolling on the other side of the Atlantic?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 23:22:10	@SpokesGay In a bottle? Being drunk magically lifts responsibility from abusers. Warning on booze. "Caution may cause rapeability you slut"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 22:04:58	@tauriqmoosa Are we placing bets on Commenter 3 accusing you of being a troll?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 21:47:04	@MiggyMoonbeam Oh that would do it. A Pizza Raft on a reasonable lake of pea and ham soup. Or minestrone...okay I think I crossed into weird
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 21:42:17	@MiggyMoonbeam You know Scrooge McDuck with his (physics defying) gold pile? THAT with bacon. Possbily kebab. Cravings are not rational!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 21:33:58	@MiggyMoonbeam 1) I sympathise and empathise entirely 2) I'm in the same boat 3) Bacon. I want it. It's not fair. I'm sulking.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 21:19:32	@szvan I've read it! I've read it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 21:15:47	@jailawrites @SpokesGay Also, I am considerably cleverer than you. I've done books on it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 21:14:22	@jailawrites @SpokesGay No no, but you see nuance and witch hunts and criticism and twitter is bad and thought police. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 21:13:21	@szvan 1) Sees title. 2) Brain goes "bow chikka wow wow". 3) Feels shame. 4) Thinks he better read the damn thing! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 19:57:25	@tkingdoll It is something I am still recovering from after trying one for the first time a week ago. There were calories.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:25:35	@oolon "heroes" (with feet of clay, as we all have) are disappointlingly un-self-aware on some issues. Depressingly so.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:23:25	@oolon @Giliell Read 'em? I can write 'em!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:22:32	@Julie_B92 Phew!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:22:06	@DrMRFrancis No no! Not "stupid", he's being "nuanced" and we are alllll to unerudite to see it. Natch. Goes without says. Obv. {eyeroll}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:21:14	@oolon What did you expect? It's just apologists for the status quo being apologists for the status quo? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:20:31	@Giliell @oolon It is if you're a scientologist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:18:44	@Julie_B92 Thanks. Is the fact that the unicorn is talking to me a bad thing? Or does it depend on what it's saying?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:17:17	@Julie_B92 There may be an extended period of "reading the literature" {ahem}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:16:52	@Julie_B92 Yup! Synthetic chem. I thnk the fact that I am currently destructively interfering with the NMR machine in the other wing is bad
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:14:15	Okay, according to a colleague my caffeine consumption has resulted in my being blueshifted. This is possibly bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:12:28	@oolon That adds to the truthiness of his innocence if guilty or not. Funded or not. Because penis and feminazis. Or something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:10:40	@Julie_B92 Considering I am vibrating at about 3THz right now, I'm thinking less caffeine is always good. I need caffeine sequestration!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:08:06	@AlexGabriel @tauriqmoosa And I had read it! Double shame, brain clearly on hold after reading today's DawkTweet
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:05:01	@AlexGabriel @tauriqmoosa And now I feel shame because it's possible haven't read said famous article. Is it on FtB?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 17:02:39	Okay...too much caffeine. Oh buggeration...everything has multicoloured vapour trails I'm pretty sure that unicorn shouldn't be here either
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 07:09:27	@strongest_smile ...former on,y slightly lardy size and then do proper delard based on real change not temp diet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 07:08:54	@strongest_smile Think so, and yes, exactly the same plan here. Although I can exercise (and do a bit) now, I just want to get back to...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 07:08:02	@slignot I think Apple (topical) should just make their slogan: Shiny thing make it all better. Because, it is sort of true. Temporarily.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 07:06:55	@strongest_smile ...is the lifestyle adjustments etc. I've planned it carefully. Do not want to screw it up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 07:06:20	@strongest_smile Lighter Life. it is the only method I have found I suit. Good results, but not long term solution by any means. Phase 2...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 07:01:51	@slignot MY capitalist overlords thank you. We are truly their servants!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 07:01:08	@strongest_smile Yay! I am on the same "journey" alternately wonderful and fucking awful innit? ;-) Congrats!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:59:11	@slignot Right, it is approaching the hour I turn into a pumpkin, so I am going to try this sleep thing I have heard so much about. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:56:49	@tkingdoll Ethical and innovative!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:54:54	@slignot That is an awesome childhood advantage!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:54:35	@slignot It's an excellent way for me to have an existential crisis and end up drunk as a bastard in some gutter. likely too!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:53:53	@slignot But but meteor strikes! Jehovah's Witnesses being right! End of world! Harold Camping!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:52:50	@slignot But but but TEA! (def Euro advantage is near/cheap flights to awesome places. I suppose I have to celebrate my wife's 40th too!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:51:45	@slignot Recent purchase of Cona siphon coffee maker may have been influential large coffee/tea kit/supplies cupboard at home has overflowed
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:50:10	@slignot Ooooooh I'm 40 in 2 months! I sense a cunning plan!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:49:42	@slignot WANT IT!!!!! And now you've told me how good it is.... Flight to Prague....more tea shit....flight to Prague...more tea shit...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:48:38	@slignot Doesn't matter if it's free if I get another tea/coffee gadget my wife will divorce me on the spot. I may have exceeded reasonable!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:47:15	@slignot I NEARLY bought a kettle with a thermostat that could heat water to perfect temps for teas and coffees of different types
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:45:30	@phdcomics Daily. But then I go to the lab anyway. Because, well, you know.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:43:26	@slignot It is a disgusting violation of my potential profits and ability to buy shiny things. probably.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:42:15	@slignot ...so am pretending I DON'T NEED IT IN MY LIFE!! I don't. I don't. okay I do... Damn.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:41:25	@slignot OMG that looks wonderful. I saw a similar thing here the other day that I was looking at buying, but I have umpteen infusers etc...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:39:16	@slignot ...Conservative. I believe that to be so obvious and undeniable a fact that I hardly think any hon. Gentleman will question it."
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:38:59	@slignot reminds me of JS Mill quote: I did not mean that Conservatives are generally stupid; I meant, that stupid persons are generally...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:36:15	@slignot My brother, for example, has never paid a day's tax in his life to fund those scum stealing his hard never earned unpaid tax! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:35:14	@slignot There's profit in them thar privatisations. And do you know unworthy poor people and Teh Immugrents use the NHS? Without begging!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:33:58	@slignot Have you heard of a coffee maker called a vacuum or siphon maker? Works for tea (or anything) too. Makes great tea. Cona make them
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:32:39	@slignot ... Is not set up to provide this is a failure at the. Last fundamental level. And we're trying to emulate you? YAY! 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:31:59	@slignot it's basically, as you said, fucking evil. Healthcare is a basic human necessity and dammit a right. The fact that a state is 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:25:53	@slignot 14.....how the....you have insurance I hope
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:23:56	@Fire_Pretty @SMcK89 The apologist prick earned that fedora.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:23:02	@slignot Ouch. That sounds....I'm going with "like a valuable learning experience" ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:21:23	@slignot HOW MANY?! That is ALL THE MONEY! We're seeing ads here about $40k for childbirth (anti privatisation ads) is that realistic?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:19:32	@slignot Bad and impatient patient can be a pretty good sign. If you have the energy to be pissed off, you're probably healing!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:18:58	@slignot Good idea. I'll raise a transatlantic glass to your being free from endometriosis. (YIKES! Cousin had it. Horrid)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:17:32	@slignot You have my profoundest sympathy. I realise office work isn't horrendously physical, but still, 2 weeks is no time for recovery 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:16:35	@slignot I forget that, despite the fact that our govt is trying to destroy it, we live in Hobbiton when it comes to healthcare. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:14:43	@slignot Ahhhh the proper way to do these things. I approve. Especially about the loose tea and cider. But then I am britishish! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:13:47	@slignot ...that burdensome uterus (which we all know=evil. I read the interwebs) you can be free to be rational and shit! 2/2 (joking obv)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:12:49	@slignot Holy crap! You shouldn't be working. I know people who've had minor toe surgery and taken longer leave. Mind you, now without 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:11:16	@slignot When I come to my Glorious Rule, there will be good recovery times post medical things and phased return to work. So mote it be!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:09:56	@slignot Surgery? Crikey! I missed that! I hope you're well.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:09:22	@slignot ...amounts of very scary Mormons. You have a lot to whine about! 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:08:58	@slignot Whining is fine, and likely you have something to complain about. Utah...if I remember it's very beautiful with terrifying 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:08:02	@adambloomie2 Second hand? Congratulations, sir!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:07:24	@FuzzCookies I wonder how the fedora happened. It's like clueless gits got together and said "you know, we need to be easily identifiable"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:05:03	@slignot Yes. Your capitalist overlords demand you are a productive meat unit. in other words, I sympathise but am powerless to help. Sorry
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:03:19	@FuzzCookies The man wears a fedora. A FEDORA!! The hat of clueless misogyny. I haven't yet got over this to be honest. I'm still giggling.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:02:30	@adambloomie2 Ah but one first must learn how to masturbate from a book. Or isn't that how it's done?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 06:01:03	@scalzi @wilw Dancing? No...wait...that's fornication.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 01:59:55	I am so tired my balls just literally fell off By "balls fell off" I mean "went all weird and dizzy" and by "literally" I mean "buglewarble"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 01:58:11	@stavvers IT EXISTS! Holy shit! This is beyond my wildest dreams of clueless, slightly nerdy, slightly ironic douchery
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-12 01:56:07	@stavvers Oh hell I hope so. The fedoratasticness of it all would cause...well I'm not sure what but it would be funny.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-11 21:27:39	@aweebithopeful Says the bloke who CONSTANLT beats the shit out of himself for everything! ;-) (Advice is easy. Doing it is tough!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-11 21:27:14	@aweebithopeful NOT pathetic at all. Standard feeling when anxious etc. Please don't blame yourself even though I know how easy that is.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-11 15:29:50	@MittenDAmour Well, quite! Is she smug about it, proudly displaying her love? Or quietly confident in the demonstrated affection?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-11 15:25:05	@MittenDAmour Mere moments away surely given the olfactory stimulus you are being encouraged with. Act with pride!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-11 15:23:31	@MittenDAmour Well, a romantic of that power was bound to be snapped up sharpish. It's a little know fact that chest shitting is true love.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-11 15:19:41	@MittenDAmour Marry whoever sent that immediately. They're a keeper.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-11 15:16:13	@BolsoverBeast True now as it was then. Self interest motivates many Tories, rank stupidity shouldn't be ruled out for many more.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 17:24:20	@LadyFOHF As per our discussion the other day about coffee, the Cona has just arrived. I will be testing it VERY shortly!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 17:23:23	@mjrobbins And, of course, simultaneously worse. But still shiny.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 17:23:05	@mjrobbins I hate Apple so much I will buy their new devices out of self loathing. Because paradoxically shiny thing makes it all better.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 17:10:55	@FuzzCookies I believe I also need to see Danny Dyer hacked by Germaine Greer. The reverse, less so.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 17:09:25	@FuzzCookies That would be great. The reverse would also be pretty immense!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:55:14	@Herring1967 They must be. Although as noted by many the other day, the Duchess of Cambridge getting pregnant was a strong surprise move.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:49:30	@depressednotsad SO MUCH THIS!!!! "Come on dalring. Come on. Yes it is an exciting bush. Well done for balancing on the kerb, but cars..."
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:48:13	@BipolarBlogger Good advice. After all, if I do it I could break a nail. Or worse, a sweat! I'll get the chap to fetch more caviar too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:39:34	@BipolarBlogger I'll send out to Pfizer for another yacht. This one's looking tired and doesn't match my handbag.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:39:03	@depressednotsad And good luck with child free efficiency drive, it feels good doesn't it? :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:38:42	@depressednotsad It is weird isn't it? 30 secs after they get back it's hair pulling out time, 30 secs after they're gone it's emotional!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:35:36	@BipolarBlogger Well naturally, but you and I are CLEARLY big pharma shills and living on the millions they pay us, right? More champers?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:31:44	@depressednotsad Parent feelings....tchoh!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:31:30	@depressednotsad DO WANT!!!!! Tee hee. When my son is away for a few days at grandparents, the first 30 mins is glorious! Then I miss him.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:30:24	@BipolarBlogger I second that. You particularly, Charlotte have been and are an inspiration, a superb help and a real check on excess!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:22:41	@depressednotsad YAY! Teach me oh great one! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 15:22:19	Okay 3 days, a total of 2 hours sleep. Coffee is my god.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-10 02:40:44	@aweebithopeful Take care of yourself. I sure we'll all be there if you need any of us! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 21:16:41	@DocHackenbush Get used to it. My five year old son sings let it go twice a day at full volume. Without fail and at a minimum. Good song tho
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 21:10:56	@Jenny_Trout Seems fair. Says the bloke who does the science equivalent in any conversation to the annoyance of…erm…everyone. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 16:47:20	@FuzzCookies I know. I'm a hopeless old softy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 16:45:13	@FuzzCookies MAGIC LADY PARTS MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER! Wait...actually that is kind of true though. Hmmmm.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 06:03:19	@prodnose But they promised to stay with us. Don't leave us. We can change. We'll be better. {sobs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:59:54	@ImprobableJoe Too damn polite.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:59:24	@sturdyAlex Too good for him.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:58:53	@ImprobableJoe Possibly. Those Candianistas and their socialist chicken.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:50:34	@ImprobableJoe @jailawrites I managed to miss Red Lobster when I lived in the USA. How I will never know.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:49:51	@ImprobableJoe Ah well, when one drifts off the area of one's expertise anything can happen. I've learned this to my cost.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:48:41	@ImprobableJoe Dear Lord! There is no excuse for such things.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:47:47	@jailawrites @ImprobableJoe Ahhhh you get biscuits (scones). We don't. We get shite.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:47:08	@ImprobableJoe Analogies are dangerous things for old white men.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:46:53	@ImprobableJoe I will defend the chicken breast zinger as not unredeemable however. It is moderately not shit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:45:45	@ImprobableJoe Good analogy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:45:24	@ImprobableJoe Agreed. It's shocking. Dirty chicken only fit for the drunken states in extremis
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:43:54	@ImprobableJoe We do some things stunningly, but fried chicken is a specialist thingummy over here. KFC is one of the triumvirate of toilets
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:43:17	@ImprobableJoe It's awful. However in the UK getting decent fried chicken is not always easy. It's an import, not a well undrstood cuisine

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:10:01	@ImprobableJoe I am organising a stag party in pub that has 300+ European and UK (and US as it happens) beers. I am moist with anticipation
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:08:26	@ImprobableJoe That would be Aurora Borealis. Surprisingly hard to spell when rum has been taken in sufficient quantity
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:07:55	@ImprobableJoe I am in sufficient denial that I have put everyone off. May go with beloved Mrs to see Aurroa Borealis. Negotiating details.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:07:16	@ImprobableJoe Missed the window. I think I'll be more careful with my pension fund and buy a Volvo.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:06:13	@ImprobableJoe I've been trying. But I'm 40 in a few weeks. Horrendous.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:03:28	@ImprobableJoe I know, it's atherosclerotic loveliness in a pitta. With chilli sauce.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:00:30	@ImprobableJoe The horrors abound. Delicious!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 05:00:15	@ImprobableJoe The British Kebab of drunkenness is thedoner. It's never seen a grill. It's fat and mystery meat salted to a massive stick.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 04:58:52	I have achieved the correct drunkenness to desire a kebab. The wrongness is apparent.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 04:24:32	Cuban cigar, Cuban rum. Hurrah!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 04:23:52	And this cigar is remarkable. A treat, a treat. Hurrah!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 04:23:11	Incidentally, I highly recommend drunkenness. Parts of me are significantly amused.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 04:20:29	@debecca I blame whoever invented alcohol. It's not me, guv. It's society! "Okay, we'll arrest them then." [/Python]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 04:19:06	Christ! Being pissed seems to have rendered me in love with Wodehouse all over again. I'd do it you know. I'd be a Wodehouse character.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 04:17:27	Granted I am dieting. Granted I am revising for an exam at this time. However, somehow I am pissed as a fucking mattress.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 01:15:41	@andykhouri I have a problem with self DX. It's v stigmatising. The "but" is that it's okay to suspect X it's not okay to use X as an excuse
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 01:12:47	@debecca I SEE NO JOKES! {runs away giggling}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 01:06:57	J K Rowling seems humble, witty, and intellectual. I thoroughly admire her. I don't usually care about "celebrities" she just seems decent.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 01:04:20	Agree with her or disagree with her. Love her work or loathe it. I am confident in the fact that J K Rowling is a very lovely human being.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 01:01:58	@blearyboy @gingerdisco99 Oh it's no conundrum. I have done the joke equivalent of publicly shaming myself via this medium already. Wait...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-09 00:47:30	@jailawrites Me too. It's funny as hell.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-08 17:03:32	@BipolarBlogger ...that you were having a bit of constructive stress prior to The Big Event. You're braver than me (as has been established)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-08 16:54:54	@TheSimonEvans You can, you can. But I ask you, where's the fun in that? (Plus, chemically speaking, the alcohol extracts more flavour)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 21:43:12	@rhysmorgan @endless_psych I did ask someone to tone it down when they were being a bit sexist once. I said please. Is that castration?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 21:20:36	@LadyFOHF It does looks interesting. I'm a coffee fiend, do you have an Aeropress, because it is surprisingly good?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 21:17:58	@LadyFOHF I haven't. I get my coffee and tea from Whittard who have a stupendous selection. I confess to not having investigated the ethics

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 03:48:13	@tkingdoll HOW DO WOMIN HAVE BABBY? Look that was too good to resist. Sue me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 03:45:24	@IamCarrieeeeee The bubbles are pure hate. I am avoiding television for a reason. It could cause an explosion.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 03:43:33	@IamCarrieeeeee All the best wines do. I am currently drinking a very spiteful and nasty prosecco.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 03:10:40	@BipolarBlogger I feel me a Barbara Woodhouse-in' comin' on! Rolled up newspaper, apply to bridge of said educator's nose, utter sharp "NO!"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 03:08:06	@BipolarBlogger Which exam board is this?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 03:06:27	@BipolarBlogger WHAT the everloving FUCK!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 02:15:30	@BipolarBlogger Would that be from a flying unicorn that farts rainbows? Because those are the only ones that work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 02:13:34	@2BipolarChicks Obviously nothing's perfect, but working on it. Hope it's all good for you too. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 02:13:11	@2BipolarChicks Thanks! It took a bit of work to get here as I am sure you can imagine. Good balance of meds, therapy and self care. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 02:10:59	@BipolarBlogger Give me....ohhh a few billion, a huge group of collaborators, no restrictions and the next 50 years. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 02:09:08	@2BipolarChicks It's okay, I absolutely DON'T mess around. Current regime seems to be working well. Thanks for concern though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 02:00:46	@2BipolarChicks ...enough to make a reasonable diagnosis of SAD. A few prodromes correlate with time of year, but not conclusively 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 02:00:04	@2BipolarChicks Sorry I should have been clearer. I've made detailed mood diaries for years, but the pattern doesn't appear to be strong 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:57:35	@2BipolarChicks Ah. I wonder about that with myself but have not elucidated the pattern if it is SAD.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:56:20	@zahzahden @DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger I've just bought two superfoods on line and I think I'm feeling saner already Don't tell Big Pharma
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:42:24	@2BipolarChicks A feeling I entirely sympathise with. The "blues" can come from a blue sky for no apparent reason.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:39:50	@MarkAttwater @RevRichardColes @prodnose Agreed. My fish finger question was an easy soft lob. Bacon is a trickier beast some might say.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:31:40	@prodnose @RevRichardColes Surely there is no need to take it so far. Wouldn't stern looks over the FT in the reading room suffice?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:15:51	@gstokey @RevRichardColes I have yet to venture to YouTube to see opinions of people who claim to have slept with my mother on this topic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:13:11	@gstokey @RevRichardColes Isn't that the magicians' choice?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:12:39	@gstokey @RevRichardColes That is clearly some crazy bourgeois deviancy. I will only approve on Thursdays and alternate Tuesdays.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:11:35	@gstokey @RevRichardColes I beg to differ. The dough is different, the toroidal shape causes baking differences. Mathematicians choice?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:05:09	@RevRichardColes I will grant it is not up there with the "classic white", but I would not be traumatised to find one in breakfast.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:04:07	@RevRichardColes I would have thought that the cinnamon raisin was a classic of bagel kind. One of the better species of the genus.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:03:17	@RevRichardColes Good good. Obviously certain heresies are punishable by severe disapproval.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:02:41	@RevRichardColes The wholemeal raisin and cinnamon bagel is a strong counter argument. Possibly not with salmon, however.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 01:01:07	@RevRichardColes However, the real determinant is: Fish Fingers, brown or white? Bonus question: red or brown sauce?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 00:59:32	@RevRichardColes Tuna etc: brown Crab: brown Marmalade: Personally either, trad. white Beef: brown Wensleydale: brown Mice: focaccia
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 00:35:36	@BipolarBlogger Not you obviously, I mean that commenter. I WISH drugs worked that simply. I wish the state of MH meds was that good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 00:30:42	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger And of course just Seeking Attention, Making Excuses, and Not Good Enough.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 00:29:46	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger It is All My Own Fault. I'm Not Trying Hard Enough. Natch.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 00:29:14	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger But it must be steamed kale. Otherwise it loses all the "goodness". Organic. Steamed curly organic named kale.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 00:28:27	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 I did forget the kale.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 00:28:14	@BipolarBlogger In the words of Ben Goldacre: I think you'll find it's a bit more complicated than that. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 00:27:50	@BipolarBlogger Speaking in my capacity as someone who designs and makes such drugs {puts on official hat}: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-07 00:22:41	@BipolarBlogger But but but if I do yoga and eat fish oils and think right it will All Go Away (TM)!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 21:04:07	@LeicesterTigers I thought so. Thanks. Is it really so tricky to arrange online video with TV partners etc? (That'll be a "yes" won't it?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 20:59:41	@LeicesterTigers I'll be listening on the radio, obviously, but I am wondering of "untelevised" matches have any legal video anywhere.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 20:58:56	@LeicesterTigers Is there any way to (legally obv) *watch* today's match other than be at the ground? I have Sky, BT etc I don't mind paying

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 19:57:06	@noodlemaz I skipped all of the themes (good or bad) in the Wire because I was desperate to get on with the story. I got good at skip timing
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 19:48:46	@RevRichardColes It is, I have heard, "large". You may be right.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 19:47:48	@RevRichardColes Would such a casting contribute to the already large problem of oceanic pollution by solid waste matter? Perhaps recycling?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 19:34:00	@Julie_B92 See now access to clean water, THAT is a genuine problm. Me wanting rootbeer based booze...less so. Mind you, lots of tea = good
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 19:00:04	@ExtAnimal @somegreybloke Oh I dunno. A disabled person under the car would be more accurate. Not something I would advocate though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:36:57	@g3reth CHEATER! ;-) I see that sort of viewing as the future (obvious thing is obvious) I just hope the transition is painless for us.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:35:13	And another thing. People. Bastards. All of them. Good Glad I could help Also, excessive misanthropic negativity. Only for pricks. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:30:56	@g3reth Oh yeah. I'm an intellectual snob. I went there. I'm not ashamed!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:30:41	@g3reth ...TV series of late have been brilliant. It's not a totally lost medium or artform. Just avoid X-Factor On Ice With the Star Bakers
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:29:59	@g3reth Ah. Impressive. I own a telly for the rugby (something of a fanatic). Everything else is nice to have. Mind you, occasional...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:28:25	@g3reth HA! Thanks! Well a cathartic whinge about matters so globally unimportant they cause testicular achage always makes things better.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:27:12	And another thing. If TV folk/rugby fans do not want to see Alesana Tuilagi and Manu Tuilagi go head to head today, there is something wrong
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:24:29	Also, rootbeer. Make it more available in the UK. Especially alcoholic versions. This has been a pathetic rant about bascially fuck all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:23:38	Granted this isn't the world's greatest problem but it is a tiny reason why I despair. An ability to do something so simple is not beyond us
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:22:50	I tolerate the adverts, I pay my Sky Sports, I pay BT. How hard is it to actually televise, via red button or web, EVERY rugby match?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:22:04	I am having a grump about Tigers/Falcons not being televised. Seriously, Clubs/TV folk I will pay for this stuff. I *DO* pay for this stuff.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 18:20:50	@TheQuinnspiracy I impressed they can spell a second four letter word with the letters c, u and t in it. I thought they lacked the capacity.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 17:55:25	Fucking little bears and lizards and people in plastic. Weird names, all bullshit. #ExplainAFilmPlotBadly

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 17:53:06	@BipolarBlogger Instead I'll just admire your resilience from afar and hope you're doing okay
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 17:52:45	@BipolarBlogger Okay, well telling you to look after yourself is pointless, you look after youself so well you don't need me to say anything

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 17:51:25	@DocHackenbush This seems to fit a type of thing I call "Reasonable Orwellian". Horrendously intrusive/nasty policy that is presented...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 17:42:49	@BipolarBlogger Well done you! (Sorry for slight pause in reply, my wife and I were discussing shopping between tweets!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 17:39:22	@strongest_smile @BipolarBlogger It was an honest and innocent misreading. Could happy to anyone. Almost. Maybe.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 17:35:24	@BipolarBlogger I know! I have taken out the brain bleach to give myself a good scrubbing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 17:32:54	@BipolarBlogger But more importantly, how did last night go?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-06 17:32:21	@BipolarBlogger HAHAHA! Sorry I just read "I purchased a big greasy vag..." That was the fastest double take in history. Oh dear!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-05 21:47:21	@Openyoureyes8 I should point out that my fave insult is the Southern US fave "Bless your heart". If you don't know it, google. Hilarious

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-05 21:42:01	@Openyoureyes89 That is the only time it "failed". Mostly people just laugh until I insist I am deadly serious.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-05 21:41:25	@Openyoureyes89 One year I had to buy RAC membership because the guy in an Indian call centre gave me a full of set of Bollywood tunes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-05 21:40:51	@Openyoureyes89 That works, I try to make them feel they've effectively punched a benevolent cartoon Santa in the face by being really nice.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-05 21:36:42	@Openyoureyes89 Oh when I say "polite = nasty", imagine being horrid to someone who refuses to return the favour. Mwah ha ha! Evil niceness!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-05 21:35:55	@Openyoureyes89 I also, in extremis, refuse to buy anything from anyone over the phone unless they sing a song. They sing, I buy. Works! 2/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-05 03:06:24	@daraobriain I care. So take one voice against the barrage of "meh". Joan Rivers was an immense comic talent. Sad day.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 21:13:10	@paulcoxon Yet again demonstrating my O-level physics teacher was right about the utility of dimensional analysis. Painfully painfully right
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 20:50:51	@RSC_Science @professor_dave I'd love to see a professorship for the Public Understanding of Chemistry somewhere. (Unless I missed one!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 20:49:07	@RichardDawkins Too obvious. Try claiming epigenetics proves Lamarkism in its strongest form. Or that everything is adaptation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 20:15:16	@stevyncolgan It's going to be superb for me in Maidenhead. I'm really looking forward to it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:39:03	@TheOnlyGuru May your day be beautiful and your need to enage with others sufficiently pleasant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:37:41	@TheOnlyGuru Well, we started at gin and it is fitting we should return there form time to time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:35:50	@TheOnlyGuru I also had an Uncle once. I don't like to encourage that sort of familiarity.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:35:27	@TheOnlyGuru I was using the vulgar, modern word to demonstrate my full distaste. I apologise if this disturbed you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:30:56	@TheOnlyGuru Physical affection? It's one step away from public displays and attention seeking. Who do people think I am? An Celebrity?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:27:22	@TheOnlyGuru I once succumbed to my Urges and am now a father. That taught me. Never again! There shall be no conjugal unpleasantness here.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:21:43	@TheOnlyGuru That is deeply sensible. And also impressively chaste. Wouldn't want to inflame the baser lusts accidentally with contatc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:18:27	@TheOnlyGuru Quite. Quite. I trust in subsequent marriages you have conducted yourself with the appropriate aloofness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:14:33	@TheOnlyGuru Well, that was a reasonable terminus. The hand gesture was possibly a little *trop*. But one does what one must in trying circs
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:10:16	@TheOnlyGuru There is no excuse for that type of wanton vileness. I hope you gave him a particularly swift elbow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:08:58	@TheOnlyGuru ...putting Tabasco sauce on one's genitals, it should be done with care and only when needed. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:08:23	@TheOnlyGuru I am something of a fan of the swearing. I believe it is big and clever by definition, and deeply necessary. However, like 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:07:45	@TheOnlyGuru Indeed. Imagine if one's spouse toddled off with someone who actually made them happy? Deary me. The horror!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:05:46	@TheOnlyGuru 3) Corridor sex. Where the partners that make up a couple pass in the corridor and shout "FUCK YOU!" at each other. 3/3
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:05:14	@TheOnlyGuru 2) Bedroom sex. The more mature partnership may find that they have entered into a routine sexual practice centred in bed 2/3
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:04:19	@TheOnlyGuru The three stages of sex in marriage: 1) Anywhere. As it says, sex occurs as the whim takes the couple in any location. 1/3
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:02:44	@TheOnlyGuru I would be lying if I were to pretend that none of that informed my own union!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:02:17	@TheOnlyGuru Ahhh excellent. A Traditional marriage where one stays with one's partner out of spite. There's a lot to recommend it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 19:00:19	@TheOnlyGuru A women with greater patience than the majority of rocks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:59:56	@TheOnlyGuru Oh deary me no. We're tolerably fond of each other. Merely to provide a poignant counterpoint to the aforementioned rosy specs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:58:30	@TheOnlyGuru Full credit must of course go to the teacher in this instance.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:58:07	@TheOnlyGuru She is a bit of an old romantic. I have tried to constructively disappoint her, but alas my efforts are not enough so far.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:56:57	@TheOnlyGuru I may be allowed to perform simple tasks and be allowed into public view sometime before I turn 50.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:56:37	@TheOnlyGuru My wife assures me that after 21 years or so of constant vigillance on her part, pre and post marriage, I am almost servicable
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:54:10	@TheOnlyGuru Of course. Make sure the husband is correctly briefed. I am well informed that husbands these days need a lot of care.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:52:23	@TheOnlyGuru There should be some sort of beating. It's a kindness. Maybe rubbing their nose in it and judicious use of rolled up newspaper.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:50:03	@debecca I say this because I am convinced my son is, basically, deliberately fucking with me. Which makes me so proud.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:46:30	@TheOnlyGuru Stwike them vewwy woughly!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:44:02	@debecca Kids: Love them. Massive pain in the arse. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:42:01	@TheOnlyGuru That was truly a neGROANi worthy pun. Happily some gin will be just the tonic to soothe my muddled nerves. #Ginius
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:39:30	@debecca My 5 year old has developed a "fear" (it's fake) of "Apple TV". I have no idea why. I think he's being deliberately weird.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:37:31	@TheOnlyGuru Of course. The youth will only get training gin. Working towards a more sophisticated gin palate at university.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:35:16	@TheOnlyGuru Well okay, I am not immune to a cabinet reshuffle. Especially if there's the right amount of gin involved.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:33:15	@TheOnlyGuru I haven't! And thank you for letting me know that they exist. You will be Minister for Education during my reign. There's gin.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:30:05	@TheOnlyGuru Did I say charity enough to be convincingly benevolent a dictator?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:29:33	@TheOnlyGuru It's a start. I prefer funds wired directly to my account. My cahirty account. For all the charity work I'll be doing. Charity.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:27:25	@TheOnlyGuru FINALLY! Someone's noticed. My conquest of the world begins here. I demand tribute.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:26:19	@TheOnlyGuru With enough gin, everything else becomes details.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:25:04	@TheOnlyGuru Gin. And lots of it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:15:29	@stevyncolgan ...is worth a shot. Very strong smelling but the taste is not overpowering at all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:14:08	@stevyncolgan Yeah I'm in a similar position. Do you like slightly floral tasting teas like jasmine in general? If so the Piccadilly Blend..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:03:18	@stevyncolgan I am a tea fan. Every few months I indulge myself with an order from Whittards. They really do have some spectacular blends.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 18:02:13	@stevyncolgan That sounds very nice as it happens. I may join you in the tea drinking. I have a very nice green tea that needs my attention.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 17:32:47	@TheQuinnspiracy I think I *may* have misundestood why the gamergate gamer manchildren are whining. Naughty me! 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 17:32:19	@TheQuinnspiracy You can, but obviously, you have to first steal it from iCloud, then use it to make games with guns banned or something 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 17:30:08	@Psythor And the term "ISIS" has a strong asssociation with Oxford University. Which EXPLAINS EVERYTHING. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 17:28:51	@frkbmb @oolon WOW! That's even more immensely daft than I was prepared to credit. Personally I think crucifixion's too good for 'em ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 17:25:34	@frkbmb @oolon Who with the what now? People will go to prison because someone made a feminist critique of games? Or because harassment?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 17:24:19	@stevyncolgan I may even move to the corner for A Long Hard Think About What I've Done.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 17:23:59	@stevyncolgan You did this to me yesterday. Today's stimulant of choice is a Long Hard Look At Myself, followed by A Healthy Dose Of Shame.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 16:55:39	@FlossieTeacake Electric cattle prod? Granted the wishy washy judge told me it was "child abuse" but it was fine in my day etc. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 02:23:39	@BipolarBlogger Chronic Stoopid?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 00:42:34	@jearle Apparently somebody said some evidence based things about games that some people didn't like. Therefore the world had to burn.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-03 00:33:00	@guardianfood I believe that a fusion of Jamaican spices and American sandwich garnishes mean that it will be the year of the Jerked Gherkin
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 21:19:28	@noodlemaz Keepy uppy with a small leather clad ball made of food?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 21:09:14	@rabbitsoup_zola Dammit now I want a biscuit. See what you have done, with your wanton biscuit advertising. It'll be a choccy one too. ATGH!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 21:08:18	@rabbitsoup_zola SO bad...so so bad. MMMm bad. I need help. #TooManyBiscuitsNaughtyNaughtyBiscuits
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 21:06:21	@rabbitsoup_zola There are biscuits LEFT? Pfff amateur! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 20:46:52	@chenghlee @edyong209 Oh you are lucky! I have an episcopal see, I can call national synods and am permitted to crown the sovreign. ARGH!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 18:54:17	@noodlemaz @toph_bbq What worries me is I am shovelling comedy bullshit that I am simply making up and STILL making more sense than MRAs etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 18:52:48	@noodlemaz @toph_bbq Lions are beige. Lions are all men and reproduce by budding. Don't believe PC hype by Attenborough!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 18:50:53	@noodlemaz @toph_bbq Lady Ears are close to Pink Fluffy Lady Brainz(TM) which could be disturbe by Man Colours. Do you even Biology? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 18:48:46	@Julie_B92 Oh that is awesome! As a tea-oholic I must have one!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 18:46:24	@MooseAllain I'm working from home and would like to take myself to HR for seventeen counts of sexual harassment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 18:41:51	@Julie_B92 I'm searching as we speak. I'll let you know. Any particular genus? I'm thinking about trying Pan. I fancy being a bonobo.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 18:32:22	@cupofcrow It all depends on whose boobs they are, where you are on the organogram and, strangely, lighting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 18:29:34	@stevyncolgan True. It's not half as bad as Thursday's Cocaine, Caviar and Blood Diamond Bonanza. Nearly as ethically dubious too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 18:27:00	@stevyncolgan It's heroin on Mondays. I like variety, what can I say.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 18:24:19	@stevyncolgan I think removing coffee from my diet could kill me. If not me, lots of other people! I guess I never met a vice I didn't like.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 18:04:44	@stevyncolgan Not for you! For me. I've had a caffeine holiday. You can't have addiction without...erm...dic...I didn't think that through.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 17:55:18	@Bonn1eGreer @DPJHodges @LabourEoin A fantastic boost for the no vote.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 17:54:32	@UnhealthyEcon @DavidAllenGreen Ah but has political correctness gone mad?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 17:42:33	Come on humanity, what are you going to do today that makes me want to apply for species transfer? {Waits 2 seconds...reads} Good game.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 17:41:00	@tauriqmoosa In serious news, I am marvelling at the levels of denial and conspiracy mongering being done to avoid recognition of privilege
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 17:40:03	@tauriqmoosa Numerology proves feminists worship Satan and want to castrate all men. I read it on the interwebz. Must be true.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 17:38:48	@stevyncolgan Segments of me are not disgusting. Definitely time for caffeine in some form. I'm voting for direct injection into eyeball.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 06:19:26	@heinousdealings Btw the feminism conspiracy thing, I am kidding of course, but I’ve already seen it said for real…{sigh}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 06:16:41	@SpokesGay But of course. I hope this is a move to more sanity from the JREF. Hahahahahaha. Ahhhh optimism.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 06:14:40	@SpokesGay I’m scared. And slightly moist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 06:13:36	@heinousdealings Hmmmm. I reckon it’s a secret feminist MISANDRY campaign. Must be. That or Bigfoot did it. And which is more likely? Huh?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 06:12:35	@oolon False flag…erm…creep shaming…erm…get out of our games…MISANDRY…rape is less likely than Bigfoot…attention seeking…help!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 06:04:30	@SpokesGay o.O
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 05:59:33	@heinousdealings Any news yet?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 05:54:25	@stavvers @evilfelicity There is always one kid who’s into the dirty protest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 05:53:58	@stavvers @evilfelicity Mine was all boys….hmmmmm. Coincidence?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 05:51:41	@TheSimonEvans They have controversial views about soccer team transfer protocols and therefore should be burned/praised accordingly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 05:47:08	@evilfelicity @stavvers This maybe a confession too far, but I spent some time at a boarding school as a kid. I believe you. A lot.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 05:45:25	@evilfelicity @stavvers okay but that bit is true. I’m never without a good poo smear. Okay almost never Fairly infrequently Pretty rare
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 05:43:53	@SpokesGay Laydeez: in ur TAM, being human, expanding ur diversities.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 05:33:13	@SpokesGay And those concerns are stupid. Ahhhh standard weeping man baby behaviour.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 05:27:56	@SpokesGay Strange things are afoot down at the Circle J.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 05:26:10	@rbhu7 This would be the best way to make a soccerist team.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 04:42:44	@ChrisClose51 Ahhhh. Political discourse. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 04:41:45	@rbhu7 Is that some sort of treaty? {giggles}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 04:40:58	@FuzzCookies Of course I don’t know about any of this. Pure speculation. Officer.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 04:40:21	@FuzzCookies Bach I could cope with. Not on mushrooms though. That could get scary.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 04:39:56	@FuzzCookies I should be clear, I doubt I’m her type either. Far too talkative whilst mullered. I’d do her head in.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 04:38:51	@FuzzCookies I mean, can you imagine trying to have a nice mellow spliff with Widders? Deary me. Talk about buzzkill.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 04:38:15	@FuzzCookies I would be PLEASED with sex and drugs. I approve of sex and drugs. Not with Ann Widdecombe, she strikes me as a frightful bore.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-02 04:36:32	@FuzzCookies Or, worse, anything bordering on sense.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:54:55	@Julie_B92 I can. I learned v fast at university years ago. Mainly by getting the club's 1st, 2nd and 3rd, spectacular capsizes of the year!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:53:37	@Julie_B92 Which is my way of saying, I will act on your recommendation! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:53:21	@Julie_B92 I've done a good bit of kayaking/canoeing (sea, whit water and just plain ol' calm river pootling) but never polo. Sounds great.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:44:51	@Julie_B92 WOW! I think you just rocketed to the top of my "most admired people" list. That sounds amazing. [ENVY!]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:42:46	@Julie_B92 I believe it is deeply necessary. Many lives have been saved by me having coffee. Now I will just go and be sweaty and jittery
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:39:58	@jailawrites @ImprobableJoe @SpokesGay That is....erm...how do I put this...DO NOT WANT!!! RED FLAG! RED FLAG! EWWWW! You are well out of it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:34:11	@Julie_B92 You'd think with everything I know about drugs, pharmacology, biochem, chem, metabolism etc I'd exercise restraint, but noooooo!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:33:14	@Julie_B92 Worryingly yes. I can also see dead people. I'm scared.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:26:49	It's possible I've had too much caffeine after my caffeine holiday. Should everything have vapour trails?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:20:31	@ImprobableJoe @jailawrites @SpokesGay I confess I have a hard time deciding WHICH interactions are the worthless ones, so get angry a lot!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:20:02	@ImprobableJoe @jailawrites @SpokesGay ...are only worth so much effort. The majority of interactions are pretty insignificant. 2/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:12:31	@tkingdoll @PeteEtchells #NotAllCorners . It had to be done. I'm a little ashamed. (And I sympathise entirely btw.)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:10:34	@zoelyons And don't get started on those hipster hedges. I cut them down before it was cool. I think I've got lost somewhere.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:10:06	@zoelyons Tragically the beards have to be established for decades to home the requisite number of species. Fashion is too short lived
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 23:08:02	@SpokesGay @jailawrites @ImprobableJoe "Bless your heart" My personal favourite dismissal of all time.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 21:51:55	@DramaLlama85 I HAVE NO FRIEND CALLED LLAMA! I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF FOOTBALLISM! IT IS WICKEDNESS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 21:47:37	@DramaLlama85 FOOTBALL!!!!!!!!! {Faints from offendedness}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 21:45:00	In other news, Tigers kick off their season on Saturday against Newcastle and I can't find it televised anywhere. THAT is a disgrace.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 21:39:14	@MirrorCeleb @fleetstreetfox Thanks for this it is, as I am sure you know, bloody brilliant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 21:36:58	@SellaTheChemist @RSC_Science Study done by @ProfBrianCox ? He's v prejudiced about chemists. I reckon one was mean to him in a past life ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 20:19:49	@tessakendall I still can't do either.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 20:18:32	@there_runsMary Fucking hell.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:33:20	@there_runsMary I didn't know that. Yikes. Even more violation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:32:06	@tauriqmoosa Pffff no REAL person has to do that, silly! ["Real" persons may be restricted to people a bit like me. Unless I say different]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:30:23	@somegreybloke Yup. I owned stuff once, I was just seeking attention and asking for it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:29:24	@somegreybloke One day I will be able to spell. Until that day! Hurarh!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:29:01	@somegreybloke Indeed. Bloody people. Exisiting. Fuckers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:28:29	@ametonym That's very kind of you, thanks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:28:07	@stavvers @cupofcrow Seconded. Like, ya know, when I was on my gap yah, I helped an African village byt taking over as chief for a week ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:26:57	Sorry for ranting but it's just so ARGLE BARGLE RAGE inducing. n/n Rant over.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:25:22	The existence of someone or something that can be violated by me does not mitigate my actions as a violator. It changes nothing. 6/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:24:31	There is no other aspect of life in which acts of the violator are excused so wantonly. I can commit violations. I have the capacity. 5/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:22:38	Consenting adults can use technology to enjoy aspects of their sex life. It's not reasonable to expect that this use demands violation 4/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:20:50	The logic of the argument is flawed Your face exists. I like punching faces. Why did you allow your face to exist where I want to punch? 3/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:19:18	...argue that said vulnerability to theft (being now non zero) is a reason to in any way shift blame from the violators of her privacy. 2/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:18:28	And, I'm sorry, whatever vulnerability to theft the taking of THOSE photos creates by their simple existence, it is not reasonable to 1/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:17:04	It's simple: Ms Lawrence consented to do THESE photos for public consumption, not THOSE. THESE photos are the ones she wants you to see. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:16:06	There is another argument I've seen and find incorrect: "Ms Lawrence did THESE bikini/sexy photos, so why shouldn't I look at THOSE?" 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:13:21	Consent is about the simplest ethical + moral consideration I can think of. Does the other person explicitly consent? No? Then don't. Easy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:09:12	@MrPLitchfield @MittenDAmour Ouch, Hulk forgot leg day.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:08:31	@BipolarBlogger Damn straight.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:08:22	@PeteEtchells @NewHumanist @BHAhumanists Half a billion? Seems legit. Well within this year's litigation budget I'm sure.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:06:48	@BipolarBlogger YAY! Congratulations all round. I expect Oscars, minimum! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:04:53	@somegreybloke "Your lack of entitled violation disturbs me" Darth Bro
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:03:25	@noodlemaz Yup read back through. Ay yi yi. I have the daft today. Possibly best to just go to the pub.... ...Okay that's always better
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:02:17	@noodlemaz Jesus I have a brain like a sieve today. At least I remembered my wife's birthday is Friday. So I get to live through the weekend
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:01:26	@noodlemaz Oh crap did I miss it? {facepalm}. Erm... Monday...lack of caffeine...{points at distraction}. I blame something!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 19:00:30	@noodlemaz Hmmm, re-reading the tweet, if I replac "stop" with "don't", any better? Or do you think it's in the construction?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:58:47	@noodlemaz Very true. And even after a year on here I am a neophyte. Just learned what a subtweet is the other day. (Yes, I am a noob!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:57:24	@noodlemaz Phew! And really, seriously, thank you for correcting me. It's a simple mistake to make, infelicitous tweeterage!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:55:58	@noodlemaz Did I do that better?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:55:37	2) What I screwed up was not expressing that obtaining explicit, enthusiastic consent is step 1. Not a later step. My error.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:54:40	1) Re: if you don't have consent then stop, @noodlemaz pointed out to me this sounds like "Try it, if told no, stop". My bad! It does.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:53:21	@noodlemaz You have a standing invite to correct me when I err. And I did. Lemme wrack my brain for a better way of putting it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:52:29	@noodlemaz I'll try to make that kmore explicit
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:51:35	@noodlemaz You're right to be picky. And of course you're right. My 140 limited what I know to be true. ALWAYS ask first. Obviously.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:50:05	It is about the simplest ethical and moral consideration I can conceive of. Does the other person explciitly consent? No? Then stop. Easy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:49:04	I don't know about Israel/Gaza. I can't solve the energy crisis. But I do know that consent is a moral hurdle 1nm high. Not hard to leap.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:46:01	@noodlemaz Very good point. I will of course give him the 10 year curve that seems to be required. Mind you took me about 20...;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:45:22	@noodlemaz I should stress, personal responsibility on the part of "potential viewers of stolen private pictures et al" not "victim of..."
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:44:24	@noodlemaz I expect my 5 year old to be a git. I hope that by the time he's 15 I'll have managed to convince him that gittery is a bad idea
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:42:50	@Julie_B92 Lies! I read a book once. I've still got my L plates on. (Of course everything I do is for feminist cookies. Naturally. ;-) )
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:42:12	@noodlemaz ...responsibility enters the equation. Shit...personal responsibility? I've become a Tory! ;-) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:41:40	@noodlemaz Oh evolving society this, systematic that, historical the other... ...I do reckon past a certain age a little personal 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:40:12	@zeno001 It took me years to work that out. Oh wait, no, about 5 seconds. My mistake. And I reckon I'm slow!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:39:25	@noodlemaz Basically it gives me the massive shivers. I loathe it with a passion. And I am sat high on privilege hill.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:38:41	@noodlemaz ...to grasp is how it is possible not to notice the violation, how it is possible to lack empathy to that degree and function 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:36:57	@noodlemaz I could not agree more. It staggers me this is even hard to gras. I know why. I understand the history/sociology. What I fail 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:36:18	It's possible to be "horny red blooded" (yuck, crap description) male and not enjoy the violation of women. Consent is vital.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:35:04	Woman speaks > death rape threats. Woman engages in consensual, private sex > she must have that privacy violated. No! Unacceptable!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:33:46	I hate this entitled sense of lazy violation that some seem to think is reasonable. I don't think shaming women for their sexuality is good
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:31:59	I genuinely don't grasp why the idea of consent is so very tough for some people. If someone wants something, grand, if they don't, stop!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:30:56	Re: Ms Lawrence I want to see her nude Correction: I want her to want me to see her nude She doesn't So I won't Is this really so hard?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 18:21:26	@gracepetrie Dogs these days. Notorious for their double standards. Dock him one Bonio.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 06:14:05	@aweebithopeful I wish I could spell. I feel YOUR pain, and that was choccy I was offering. Autocorrect got me right in the typos!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 06:13:19	@jailawrites Righteous, wonderful and above all spot fucking on. Thanks for tweeting it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 06:11:51	@aweebithopeful I never used to, but now…..hoooooo boy! I need down time. In other words I feel you pain and offer further hugs and chock!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 06:10:12	@ThatSusanBurke @thelindywest Thank you! So much this!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 06:09:19	@Herring1967 Hurr Hurr Hurr Hurr, nice one… …I don’t get it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 06:07:36	@aweebithopeful I’m more of a Paula Radcliffe. I go for a long procrastinate at a world beating level!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 06:05:50	@aweebithopeful Urgh. all work and no play makes Hound very unhappy?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 06:05:25	@aweebithopeful Are you saying that at the next Olympics we could form the procrastination team?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 06:01:16	@aweebithopeful Anything specific or are you just feeling in deep need of hugs? It’s a feeling I understand btw!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 06:00:50	@aweebithopeful Yeah I’m doing reasonably. Staring down a mountain of work that has my procrastination gland twitching. Other than that good
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 05:58:03	@aweebithopeful I’ll leave these {hugs} here for you. Wouldn’t want to intrude.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 05:52:01	@tauriqmoosa “You know who else had empathy? Hitler.” Because if it hasn’t been said, you know it will be.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 04:58:42	@FuzzCookies It's political correctness gone mad! Probably. I mean, you know, it usually is.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 04:28:41	@bellatrixstark @GRRM I know. Says so on the front. I was having a bit of fun.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 04:18:37	@BipolarBlogger VIBES!!!! Well done him. Well done you! I'm sure it will go swimmingly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 04:18:09	@RepublicanDalek @TheQuinnspiracy Makes sense. Especially now you can go up stairs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 04:09:57	@TheQuinnspiracy I heard you were in league with the Space Lizards that rulle the world. Something only slightly less plausible!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 04:07:12	@anarchic_teapot @zeno001 In the words of Rowan Atkinson: I wouldn't trust these people to sit the right way round on a toilet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 04:04:34	@TheOnlyGuru I am a nerd. We take these things very seriously. Luckily, I am also British(ish) and so I don't complain, just die of an ulcer
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 04:02:50	@TheOnlyGuru How could it be anything else?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 04:01:32	@TheOnlyGuru Oh you! I'm blushing. But of course you must know the feeling is entirely mutual.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 04:00:59	@TheOnlyGuru I'm very lucky, I know of at least three coffee houses within walking distance where I could provide this chap with all of this
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:59:24	@garwboy THAT will take some very proactive filtering.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:58:14	@TheOnlyGuru And just the wrong side of overpriced.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:57:44	@GingerMillie @caitlinmoran @SarahMillican75 Works well. Or you could bin the damsons and drink the gin. Works bloody wornders for me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:56:59	@TheOnlyGuru Inadequate crema layer? Old beans? Terrible grind? Improper filtration? Ooooh you're wicked you are! Wicked!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:55:38	@zzzedkat Normal clothes with just the faintest hint of poo.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:53:18	@TheOnlyGuru That is very harsh, maybe make him read a comment on the internet with which he disagress...no...no I could not be that cruel.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:50:06	@TheOnlyGuru ...wish upon him significant misfortune. Perhaps a poor result from a normally reliable dry cleaner. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:49:29	@TheOnlyGuru I am, blissfully, largely unfamiliar with this gentleman's opus. However, if he is a mind virus like Cowell I will happily 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:46:25	@TheOnlyGuru I briefly thought you meant David O'Docherty. I was aghast. He's lovely! I take it you mean the Irish Alan Titchmarsh/crooner?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:43:00	@TheOnlyGuru That one deserves unpleasant things to happen to him at remarkably short intervals. I hope he develops a mild skin complaint.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:42:06	@TheOnlyGuru I'm sure, in all seriousness, they are perfectly lovely and all involved are paragons of light and wonder. Except Cowell.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:41:25	@TheOnlyGuru I shall endeavour to avoid circumlocutory, sesquipedelian, verbiage and rhetoric henceforth.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:40:01	@TheOnlyGuru Take a spoon and jam into the sensitive organ of your choosing. It's how I get through "Strictly" when mum visits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:37:27	@TheOnlyGuru I wonder, was I too subtle? Did my real views get adequately communicated by that oblique tweet?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:36:56	@TheOnlyGuru DON'T DO IT! It's a fucking horrorshow populated exclusively by deluded twats and nasty overpaid twats. It is twatapalooza.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:34:52	@caitlinmoran @SarahMillican75 1) Chop Damsons 2) Get bottles of gin 3) Put damsons in gin 4) Close bottles until next year 5) Drink XS gin
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:28:46	@GRRM It's okay. I'm cool. I'm cool.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:28:27	@GRRM WHAT! Really? When? How? Where? Why? MUMMY!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:18:01	I am now wondering whether the discovery of a celebrity dogger practically at the end of my road will increase house prices.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:15:46	@mjrobbins And Capt Speedy here just worked out that the Thicket is less than a mile from his house.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-09-01 03:08:24	@mjrobbins I'm always the last to find these things out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:30:52	@RevRichardColes Have you been restricting biscuits at the WI meeting in the church hall again?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:27:05	Is it just me that wishes a celeb outed for drugs and sex "scandal" would just admit that actually, drugs and sex are bloody good fun?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:21:40	@debecca @DramaLlama85 @aweebithopeful I stress that the last tweet is untrue. Funny though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:21:15	@debecca @DramaLlama85 @aweebithopeful I think it's an aphrodisiac. I smear on my old chap and pretend to be a Twiglet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:19:56	@DramaLlama85 Haha! "I'm going to do it!" "Have you considered brown sauce and bananas instead?" "I don't want to hurt myself THAT much!"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:18:03	@DramaLlama85 Well there we go, I've provided you with an option. My usefulness knows no bounds! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:16:34	@DramaLlama85 It is surprisingly good!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:16:25	@DramaLlama85 I'm not easy to say the wrong thing to either, kindred spirits in that regard! Have you tired a sandwich of PB, jam and mayo?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:14:10	@DramaLlama85 ...I hope you stay safe and for my money don't SH. Peanut butter does sound like a good alternative!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:13:39	@DramaLlama85 I'm spectacularly out of my depth re: SH. I never know what to say or do for dear of alieanting or enabling. Either way...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:12:46	@DramaLlama85 Yikes! It is what I worried it might be. Oh Llama! Nightmare scenario for you!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:12:16	@DramaLlama85 That's not judgement btw, judgement's not my bag baby!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:10:33	@DramaLlama85 SH? I hope it's not what I think it is.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:07:59	@DramaLlama85 Eek! No chance of a nap? Anything else that works?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:06:56	@DramaLlama85 I've definitely used simple computer games to help tune the noise out. Interesting to see it's something others do too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:06:08	@DramaLlama85 When the "head noise" gets too loud it's not pleasant is it? If even a game isn't distracting you, that sounds nasty.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 21:02:24	@DramaLlama85 Insert {Hugs} here. I know this only too well. It's bloody horrible. You have my sympathy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 19:18:21	@tauriqmoosa I understand she is in league with Space Lizards who will control us all. It's all in numerology around the name. There's maths

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 05:25:57	@tauriqmoosa What about it? It's the only one I've got.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 05:24:43	@tauriqmoosa I'm hip. I'm up with current affairs. I just bought it the other day and started playing it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 05:20:17	@tauriqmoosa @garwboy I can hear a bell clanging.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 05:11:17	@garwboy I am currently coming to terms with my Fat Dad status. I realise my dreams of sex symbol status will not happen. See also astronaut
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 05:10:11	@sazza_jay Hurrhurrhurr. Sorry, that did make me laugh.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 04:42:19	@andiosho Variations on the same theme.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 04:40:26	@PatrickDeneny I recommend it highly. Nice variant on a Cuba Libra. In other news, you're all my best mates and I love you. I want a kebab.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 03:45:26	Dr Pepper and spiced rum with lime is very tasty. #TheMoreYouKnow
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 03:42:50	@sazza_jay @femfreq NotAll… ….fuck it I can’t even do it as a joke. The problem is I agree with you!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 03:41:50	@gimpyblog Aren’t they the same person?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-31 01:15:19	@Esteleth They made me do it. It wasn’t voluntary.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 22:21:47	@sarahditum No. But I will correct that oversight right way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 22:20:06	@RevRichardColes @RichardDawkins Nothing changes if we don't stand up to "petty" incidents. Well done you. Society shifts around such things
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 22:03:57	@mmbtox Well they insist on putting these things in front of me. I am sufficiently Britishly aculturated to try to find something nice.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 22:01:19	@mmbtox There is a page that lists things between adverts, I understand.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:56:30	@rbhu7 Stop it! You're turning me on!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:56:05	@rbhu7 ...eat bacon and drink copiously because that is not the same thing. Not at all. Nope. Completely different. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:55:39	@rbhu7 Oh all right, I'll live and let live. I won't even think bad things. Whatever gets people through the night. Now I'm just off to 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:55:04	@rbhu7 I am speaking for myself... ....okay I'm not. I will purge GQists rom the face of the earth. Along with footballists. RAWR!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:50:49	@LivinwithBATman No worries. And likewise! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:50:17	It is simply impossible to maintin a calm state in the face of consumerist fuckery of that level. My life will not be enriched by a man bag.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:49:18	Sod it, I'm having a sarcasm overload. I read GQ whilst waiting for my haircut. It's done things to me. 16 pages of ads before the contents.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:43:25	@chiara84 I promise not to mention it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:42:42	Is it okay that I hated myelf before it was cool? Perhaps the other side of awareness is nirvana. Perhaps it's John Lewis.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:41:14	Can I descend into self referential pseudy-hipster-privileged-wankiness and disappear up my own arsehole thereby creating perpetual motion?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:39:59	[Do I need to tell anyone I'm not remotely serious about any of this?]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:39:35	I've moved on from sex and drugs. The only real emotion I feel now is a slight sense of smugness about my moral superiority and awareness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:39:00	Please give me shiny things. Please. Please help me beat myself with liberal guilt over the sweatshop conditions they are manufactured in.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:37:11	@chiara84 I have reasons! They're crap reasons and I am deeply ashamed. If that helps.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:35:33	I demand consumer durables and techie stuff to distract me from the horrors of life. I DEMAND THEM NOW. Shiny thing make everything better.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:34:48	Also, in other news, my descent from loftily aloof to early adopter techie dependency is complete. I want an iphone 6 and iwatch NOW!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:31:38	@MittenDAmour "I'm sorry, I'm leaving you, for Pepsi. It turns out it was okay".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 21:25:28	Dear Twitter, is "I WILL BURN YOU!" an acceptable response to a poorly poured pint of Guinness? If not, I *might* be tetchy today.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 02:00:09	@marcuschown No. Just in case there was any doubt! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 01:54:11	@RugbyTigers @canterburyNZ @LeicesterTigers I like both kits, when this sodding diet is done I’ll be parading my less lardy carcass in them
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 00:04:48	Threat Level: Men, feeling rapey? Smear rape prevention nail polish on your click and balls, wait for them to dry and stick to your leg.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-30 00:00:23	Threat Level: Trying to get excess tin reagents out of clumsily worked up reaction via a poorly set up flash column. Oh yeah I went there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 23:57:58	@DocHackenbush OH THE HUMANITY!!! Save yourselves!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 23:52:35	@garwboy Too soon, man. Too soon.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 23:51:07	Threat Level: [licks fingers, rubs saliva on nipples] Disturbing I mean, I’m an overweight, nearly 40 yr old dad. No one wants to see that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 23:45:28	@Society_Biology Surely “doing press ups outside her house” counts for something?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 23:44:26	Threat Level: Watch the puppet to distract from child abuse cover ups, dismantling of the welfare state, and any newsworthy events.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 23:40:46	@DocHackenbush Threat level just got cool like 4chan. [puts on sunglasses! harasses someone] That’s cool, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 23:39:49	@lecanardnoir But but that is TRUE! Well….ish.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 23:37:21	@noodlemaz Now THAT is a threat worth considering.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 19:03:54	@greenstemsUoY @AWTaylor83 And thank you in return, I'm always interested in green chem/stem advances

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 18:09:57	@bdogrunner I hope you're okay, but dammit that imga eis a) perfect and b) hilarious.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 17:53:45	@Fire_Pretty YES! (I am seriously considering ordering a pizza. MAKE MY WEAKNESS EASIER!!!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 17:38:27	@tauriqmoosa "Wouldn't it be much easier to just pick that cotton rather than rebel against your master..." I SEE NO PARALLELS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 16:51:06	@ProfFrancesca Well it is to do with UKIP, and therefore deeply appropriate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 05:18:20	@Crommunist Which reminds me, I have to stop sending my mum my scientific work to review. She's really mean.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 05:18:00	@Crommunist Well of course you did, why the last three papers I published came back with "fuck you you lying whore" from the reviewers. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 00:18:04	@SarahKnowsNowt @WomenDefyUKIP Schadenfreude is such an ugly emotion. But I'm a bad bad person, so it's okay. I checked.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 00:13:29	@WomenDefyUKIP HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA {BREATHE!} HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAA
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 00:12:57	@SallyStrange @SpokesGay I cannot deny it. 'Twould be absurd!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-29 00:11:34	@SallyStrange @SpokesGay You're just gutted because I look better in them... Okay no one's buying that bullshit. That was a bridge too far.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 23:14:53	@SpokesGay @SallyStrange I told you to keep that quiet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:44:59	@RugbyBanterPag3 Oh yeah....dammit! I should have said "I would like to see Richie McCaw do it". He's had this year's penalty already ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:42:10	@RugbyBanterPag3 I need to see that done to a defender on a rugby pitch. That would be even more awesome.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:38:32	@debecca That's why you'd get the upgrade. I'd give it a 5 if it was in the fast lane. Without a car.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:37:57	@noodlemaz @tauriqmoosa I could make millions covertly converting young men to being really rather decent to women.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:37:29	@noodlemaz @tauriqmoosa As mentioned earlier, more and more my moderately evil business plan of surreptiously feminist "Game" advice tempts.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:36:17	@debecca IS this IT? Hardly very naughty. I'd give it a 3. Unless it was in traffic, then it's a 4! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:34:50	@debecca I've closed ym eyes. I'm such a massive prude. Pffff ahahahaha! The least accurate use of THAT word ever!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:34:16	@debecca ...in my case, it would be male sexual expression, frankly there's enough of that! We get to do it all the time! 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:33:44	@debecca Me, I try to keep these things private because I know my proclivities are not universal and I DO regret shit. Also...1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:33:10	@debecca If you don't regret it and you aren't harming anyone, erm, where's the problem? You're allowed to express your sexuality aren't you
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:32:33	@debecca Why do I say that? Because BOY do I know the feeling about being wanting to be sexual/sexually inapproipriate
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:31:29	@debecca DISAPPROVING CAT IS DISAPPROVING! Did that help? :-) Obv I don't disapprove, but hope you're ok and don't do anything you regret
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 22:17:15	@edyong209 Pffff it's still space lizards. They run the world dontcherknow. Jon Ronson told me. I think. Maybe.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 21:23:59	@MooseAllain TURN SAFE SEARCH ON! FOR THE LOVE OF DECENCY TURN SAFE SEARCH ON!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 20:25:57	@tauriqmoosa (It's okay, I know it is. But all my entrepreneurial ideas are reasonably evil)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 20:24:08	@tauriqmoosa Is it wrong of me to want to set up a surreptiously feminist version of "The Game" and exploit these people for profit?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 17:56:26	@AdamRutherford @andrewcopson @zeno001 @alomshaha Typical public school privilege Even web works better (Says ex-public school Cantab grad)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 17:26:55	@AdamRutherford Oof. {Facepalm}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 17:21:39	@upulie @EricIdle @realscientists Well if what I read about Mr Idle is accurate his tastes don't include 40-ish male scientists like me!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 17:14:34	@KingOfIona @TaraFlynn World's fastest pre-order just happened.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 17:11:28	@EricIdle @upulie @realscientists Ok that's worth it, but I have a terrible feeling you'd complain.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 17:07:26	@femfreq I play the odd game, I am male. I don't only support what you're doing, it's breath of fresh air. Thank you for your excellent work
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 16:33:26	@ayeshapowell @OwenJones84 I try so hard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 16:27:22	@ayeshapowell @OwenJones84 IT happens in science too. I'm always pleased to be told I don't understand/do science and am a big pharma shill
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 16:14:50	@OwenJones84 Both. Depending on which is useful at the time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 05:35:48	@CCriadoPerez Woman says thing I don't like -> Woman must be attacked. Nope, still don't get it. I can say aloud and I still don't get it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 03:47:08	@FuzzCookies Ridiculous! That is clearly a police matter.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 02:05:47	@heinousdealings I do love it when some bigot outs themselves. Saves the effort of having to wonder about whether or not to ignore them
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 01:31:37	@lousycanuck @SallyStrange Well we all know that feminism is done for the clicks and retweets. Sally's rolling in $$$ from Big Outrage. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-28 00:26:04	@giants_orbit @MCeeP Rice that your mother makes that renders you slightly aroused, you filthy beast?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 18:37:58	@gravbeast I'm probably a Nazi! I will now incorrectly use the term "Godwin"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 18:36:14	@gravbeast I think that tweet is positively Dadaist.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:16:11	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger I shouldn't snark too much. It's just the first lesson I learned: my experience is not binding on others.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:15:13	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger I've had viral meningitis and am therefore a neurologist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:13:53	@BipolarBlogger May we be seeing a similar phenomenon?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:13:42	@BipolarBlogger I encounter a lot of people who've (for example) taken an anti depressant after a tragedy and feel free to opine on all MH
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:11:05	@BipolarBlogger The blog piece? The reply? I read that. It was...unimpressive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:09:34	@BipolarBlogger PLus doubling down. I always love a good double down. SO fun to watch.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:09:07	@BipolarBlogger It seems that {ahem} a gross misunderstanding of the problem has been entered into by the journalist in question.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:06:45	@BipolarBlogger ALso, as an aside your piece on the Elizabeth Day article...stellar. Thank you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:06:24	@BipolarBlogger Possibly, possibly. I've ballooned in that period too, And got worse at music. COINCIDENCE? I don't think so.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:05:30	@ProfBrianCox And the occasional smashing of dominant hierarchies. You gotta let us smash SOMETHING.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:04:33	I understand some incredibly talented, wonderful and rarely seen musician has put on weight. I never knew fat affected music. {eyeroll}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 17:00:31	@tkingdoll It seems to be very popular this year. Like an ice bucket challenge of fever and yuck.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 00:17:23	@RugbyBanterPag3 It is not possible to believe the game is soccer with Nigel Owens on the pitch. Top lad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 00:08:01	I hated hating the ice bucket challenge before it was cool. I'm so over criticism of critical assessment of charitable giving.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-27 00:02:07	@TheOnlyGuru HAHA DOG. That is the intellectual level I am capable of today.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 23:58:20	@TheOnlyGuru BUT DID YOU SEE THE THING? THE THING THE GUY DID? AND THE OTHER THING THE WOMAN WAS WEARING? BE OUTRAGED!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 04:04:12	@ballaterbboy @FuzzCookies And I wouldn't trust any of them to a) do it right and b) not work out how to fuck the vulnerable whilst doing it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 04:03:18	@ballaterbboy @FuzzCookies If so it will be the first useful act an politician has performed in a while.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 01:48:03	@marcusbrig Are you watching the last series for the first time? I won’t spoil it, just envy you that first experience. It’s truly wonderful
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:44:36	@BipolarBlogger Many many naughty words have sprung to mind. That is....well....very shitty of him.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:41:43	@SchizophrenicGB @teaandtalking THANK YOU! I have been wanting to say this I feel so damn stupid I didn't. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:41:14	@ka_tie Tolerate, plot to kill, your word, my word. There's not a big difference! I stress I am not remotely serious.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:38:04	@ka_tie Ah. Good idea. Save and dream of the (hopefully golden foreign) beach upon which you will sun yourself.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:36:26	@SpokesGay And in my case I've done all of those this week. Well not the last two. I have some standards, I mean, shoplifting! The very idea
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:35:05	@ka_tie And I am very much on the mend, thanks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:34:53	@ka_tie YIKES! Moving back? The psychological damage isn't worth it. Have you tried something less harmful? Slavery? Hard drugs? Death? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:32:13	@ka_tie PHEW! I always panic that tweets are easy to mis-read/I mis-communicate stuff via tweets.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:31:41	@ka_tie ...to the point that I had her on speaker phone and my wife was open mouthed, agog that she could be such an arse for no reason!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:30:45	@ka_tie I've got a mother like that! I've been really ill with a virus this last ~10 days. My mum has phoned up specifically to pick fights
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:28:23	@ka_tie Not saying your do btw! Christ! THAT would have been a staggering communication fuck up! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:27:56	@ka_tie Mine do the same to me...or rather, try to. I am somewhat "non-compliant"! And they have no reason to.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:26:48	@scalzi It works for Prince Philip. He's really from Denver. State secret.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:26:29	@scalzi Upper Class British. Always. Throw in colonial references, pretend you were part of the Raj, beat anyone you consider a "servant".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:23:02	@ka_tie Oh I know THAT situation! At home with parents are you by any small chance?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:21:38	@damianobroin It's meant to be very good indeed, I confess this is on the reports of others, I have it, but have yet to pull the trigger.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:21:02	@damianobroin Yup. And if you (heavily) enjoy podcasts like me...Ay! It is not a pleasant experience.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:20:22	@damianobroin I bought Media Monkey. Only the work involved in transferring/relearning has held me back from a complete swap.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:19:29	@damianobroin The call in our house goes, as my wife hears the commotion from my office: "Darling, have Apple fucked iTines up again?"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-26 00:17:46	@tkingdoll THANK YOU! It needed saying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 23:45:56	@DramaLlama85 I'm not a vet but I am not shy with the mallet and a guinea pig if you get my drift.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 20:12:02	@AdamRutherford @pzmyers @Schroedinger99 It always has been and ever will be.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 20:09:10	@Schroedinger99 @AdamRutherford @pzmyers So we get Glenn Beck and Ann Coulter? No thanks. I like our home grown shitheads more than that lot
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 19:53:25	@AdamRutherford @pzmyers PZ, you lot took Piers, you lot keep him. We sent you Puritans and look how well that work... ...I'm deeply sorry.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 19:39:14	@mmbtox Yup. How do we get it out there? If only there were some way? How about "Shut Your Mouth" for Twitter? #InappropriateSongsForAds
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 19:36:30	@mmbtox I have that song in my head now! "The Drugs Don't Work" surely is the (in)appropriate choice! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 19:32:52	@debecca YOU GO!!!!!!!!! That is my encouragement for the day. You're welcome.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 19:32:29	@mmbtox "Back in the saddle (again)" for a riding school. I'm struggling with "Go Down" at the moment. No ideas. Shocking.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 18:14:33	@mmbtox Ooooh that's dark! I like it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:46:55	@cogito_ergo_bum @debecca Everything works if you add anal to it: Anal Songs Of Praise (or songs of anal praise)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:45:05	@debecca @cogito_ergo_bum Then it would be feminist of me to create a mad scientist orgasm ray that caused global lady nether part fun?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:43:43	@debecca @cogito_ergo_bum Oh yeah. Systematic oppression of women is a massive pain, but do the orgasms really compensate? I don’t think so.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:42:40	@cogito_ergo_bum @debecca Kinky!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:41:40	@debecca @cogito_ergo_bum “who lives in an arse like this?”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:41:08	@debecca @cogito_ergo_bum 5! Seems reasonable, although as a man, it’s 3 max, then a bit of a lie down! You ladies and your superpowers!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:39:52	@cogito_ergo_bum @debecca Through the Bumhole. The Bum Show. Rearenders. The unbearable lightness of fuck me now you dirty bastard…too far?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:36:28	@debecca @cogito_ergo_bum It can be fun... ...erm so I've been told. I don't know myself you understand. Oh look over there! A distraction!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:35:11	@cogito_ergo_bum @debecca Pantless? 15 Into 1 (old school)? Cuntdown? Dick or no Dick?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:33:24	@debecca @alicemeat I know this feeling only too well. The diagnosis only matters so far as it gives me something to work with.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:31:58	@thedailymash ...mentally ill people (the vast majority actually) who make enormously more sense than anything the Mail vomits forth. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:31:31	@thedailymash I get the joke, but please don't throw mentally ill people under the bus to poke fun at the Daily Fail. I know plenty of 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:29:55	@debecca Do it nicely, not via the methods I colloquially describe on Twitter! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:28:50	@debecca Exactly. Greif is normal, reasonable and well recognised response to death.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:28:10	@debecca Request he never darkens your door again. Tell the CMHT (or whoever) you find him unpleasant and counter productive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:27:30	@debecca Quite the contrary! I will cheerfully abandon/be abandoned by certain toxic shitheads any time!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:27:03	@debecca ...didn't allude to or even approach obliquely. I shut that drivel down fast. I dislike certain types of conflict, not abandonment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:26:28	@debecca My therapist, who knows me well by now brought up fear of abandonment the other day, something I a) have never worried about and b)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:25:24	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 I highly recommend beaches over basements. Well for some purposes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:25:02	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 Ahhh the kitchen of the conference party!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:24:41	@BipolarBlogger Ha! I can completely imagine. See this wringer? It is that you have been through!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:24:00	@debecca Have the words "leave diagnosis to those competant and qualified please YOU FUCKING ARROGANT COCKSTICK" escaped your lips?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:21:55	@debecca Not a psych? Psychologist?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:21:26	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan This is TRUE!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:21:16	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 That's a fringe benefit. We're scientists after all, pure quest for...erm...knowledge...yeah....that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:20:32	@debecca Who is this person who pricks about with your diagnosis?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:19:50	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 ..to real work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:19:40	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 Well yeah, we *could*. But I favour the more ambitious version. It would be an acheivement. And it could be coupled..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:18:37	@debecca Oh joy! a Knobhead!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:15:50	@BipolarBlogger We're here for you if you fancy a chat. You've had a rollercoaster of a few weeks. Totally understandable.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:15:04	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Although, we could have a computer lab on the island for those who wish to tweet rather than talk!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:14:35	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Without trying to be charming or odious, I find that hard to believe. You seem perfectly personable.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:11:36	@debecca I have been a pretty good source of it in my life! I'm trying very hard not to do too much of it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:10:07	@debecca I bloody love 'em. But they are a rapid way to get into Trouble.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:05:54	@debecca And Conversations are VERY DANGEROUS!!!!!! Never have them on the internet. Naughtiness could break out. Shocking stuff. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:05:18	@debecca I don't. You've hinted but I don't pry. Esp as I am kinky in a different direction I believe, and this could lead to Conversations
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:03:35	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 @phdcomics PhDComics is so painfully accurate it has made me cry and laugh. With the same cartoon occasionally.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:02:26	@debecca Oh no, DEFINITELY tell him. Just about the time he starts getting out of line. Bring the fucker back to his rightful place! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:01:37	@chiara84 Seems reasonable. I have always favoured sodium pentathol and bamboo strips under the fingernails. But you know, personal style.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 17:00:20	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan "This fictional holiday has been incident free for 0 days".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:59:22	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Whoa whoa whoa! Are you suggesting we have done anything less than a full safety assessment of the Lego work area?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:58:48	@GrumpyCatsMind @glosswitch My day has been made.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:55:31	@MarkBucko1 Government cut backs. Can't be helped. More than my job's worth.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:55:04	@chiara84 Back away from the sawn off. Take out the debit card, move to the internet enter "emergency cookie delivery". You know what to do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:53:59	@MarkBucko1 We moved it to next year for your convenience. YOU'RE WELCOME.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:51:57	@debecca ...you know about yourself and what your doc says. Not internet randos like me! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:51:37	@debecca ...I use it no problem at all. So bear in mind it might be correlating with you issues, no causing them. Obviously go with what...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:51:00	@debecca The issue with codeine is that extended use can cause habit forming and also depression in vulnerable patients. But for example...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:50:09	@debecca Also, legged it and assaulted a copper, top work! (no fun I imagine, but allow me to be impressed!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:49:17	@debecca Same family...ish. They both act on the opioid pain receptor system, but are not same chemical class...a picky distinction!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:46:07	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan ...we'll be there in a week. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:45:55	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan ...cut to a happy island. Scientists frolicking in the sand and by the telescope...the appeal, he PayPal details...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:41:31	@debecca Do you find codeine affects you badly then?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:41:15	@debecca Yikes! That WOULD trigger a normal person I think. It's just that for folks like thee and me, the triggering is more of a problem.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:40:27	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Good point, well made. Especially as we could be up front. We'll do some science, but mostly Lego and drinking.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:39:15	@debecca YUCK. Those are the worst. I hate those. Hold on tight, Bex, you're in for a bumpy ride. {hugs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:38:34	@Herring1967 Dear Mr Herring, as you're King of Edinburgh would it be okay to briefly bend your ear for advice for a future fringe visitor?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:36:31	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 ...they run an astronomy course for a week in Mallorca. Educational, fun possibly fundable by work {waggles eyebrows}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:29:55	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 @realscientists OH HELL YES!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:29:46	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 Why do I get the impression that the more we talk about this the more it is happening?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:29:00	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 Or we pick a "nearest land to centre" island with an observatory....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:28:39	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 And I reckon we could work in some science. Zoology/geology is the easiest to imagine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:26:21	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 WHich in the cousins example is the Azores... not bad!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:26:03	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 For example, I have 28 1st cousins all over the world. I worked out we'd meet mid Atlantic We could pick closest land
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:24:10	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 I've often wanted to take a weighted mean of people's locations and set a party up in the middle. Wherever that was.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:23:31	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Norway UK NZ...either way, this has to be done
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:20:29	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 SO I'm in the UK, you're in Aus and NZ, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:15:42	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Oh YEAH! This is epic. A Lego/Rummikub fest preceded by a dinner party where our dad's do the cooking!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:14:59	@DramaLlama85 They might, I won't! It's not other people;s piddling standards I have to worry about. It's MINE!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:14:22	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Actually, given that my dad owns a restaurant and is a chef, I'd back my dad on that one. He's crap in a fight though
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:12:46	@DramaLlama85 I'm the boss too. So not only am I behind on my stuff, I am behind on helping people with their stuff.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:12:08	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 Google it but put safe search on. I nearly blinded myself.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:11:23	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 That's a good question. Does the Lego come after pudding but before port and cigars or with brandy?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:10:45	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Ah but can your dad beat up my dad? (I love how grown up we're being)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:09:53	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Okay THAT you'll win. I am no rummikub-ist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:09:15	@Julie_B92 @DrSMMorgan Also, my mummy says I'm the best at Lego. You're not going to call my mummy a liar now are you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:08:28	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 All-comers International Comepetitive Lego! IT IS ON!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:08:00	@DramaLlama85 I had all of last week off. ALL OF IT {runs around panicking}. I have what can only be described as shit to do!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:07:03	@aweebithopeful You get back here! Or rather, you get back to bed!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 16:04:55	@DrSMMorgan @Julie_B92 This is an amazing idea. I WOULD OWN YOU ALL!!! I AM THE LEGO KING! Sorry, I don't know where THAT came from.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-25 15:58:22	@DramaLlama85 Hurrah! There;s something in the eair! Only 50% of my head hurts and I had a sensible amount of sleep (also zopilcone).

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-24 23:01:58	@DramaLlama85 I will say this, hallucination due to high temp + intrusive thoughts + bipolar symptoms = severely not fun.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-24 23:00:34	@DramaLlama85 The whole shebang. The doc took 1 look at me last week and sent me for a CS fluid test. I haven't been this sick since I was 3
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-24 22:59:49	@DramaLlama85 ...symptoms and secondary infections etc. It just SUCKS (sorry, ranty!). Last week I was properly ill high temp, hallucination

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-24 22:23:37	@DramaLlama85 I tried that. It worked out less well than you might think.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-24 21:18:54	@BipolarBlogger None of this was ever going to end in anything other than really bad puns. We both knew it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-24 21:18:13	@BipolarBlogger Hmmm do I be a decent person and agree, or do I... DECLARE VICTOR(T)EA!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-24 21:15:24	@BipolarBlogger Worse, I knit my own coffee. Or something.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-24 21:12:40	@BipolarBlogger It's deeply transgressive. And I was into it before it was cool too. Using only authentic ethnic methods and stuff.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-24 20:50:57	@BipolarBlogger IT NEVER HAPPENS. Just like sexism.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-24 20:49:39	@BipolarBlogger I read the same article. I don't have the energy today. It was a head shaker. My eyes rolled and off into my day I went.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 15:21:31	@Dr_Black Yup. I can confirm those are definitely onions. I am now suspiciously proud of myself. Standards have been set for they day. Low

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 02:28:20	@andy_nortcliffe Very true! I confess to a twinge of horror that Phil Baran is the same age as my younger brother though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 02:26:02	@anyabike "I'm not racist. Some of the best people I have been really discriminatory about on the basis of their race are black".

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 02:20:31	@AudleyZDarke NO INTERNET MEME IS TOO OLD FOR ME I CAN HAZ INTERNET MEME!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 02:20:10	@AudleyZDarke SEX RASH! Actually that's a legit thing. I saw them supporting Frank Zappa back in '83.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 02:16:16	@AudleyZDarke Stop it! I am becoming dangerously aroused. Or, you know, not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 02:14:14	@AudleyZDarke they're bundles of fun.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 02:13:43	@AudleyZDarke Or about as much fun as sex with someone from Youtube comments.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 02:13:08	@AudleyZDarke TOTALLY! It's less fun than the Funtime Flu Fandango and the Mono Mania Midnighter combined.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 02:08:45	@AudleyZDarke ....which is LOVELY! How have you Jon and She Who Will Rule All Over Us been?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 02:08:23	@AudleyZDarke Not really, I haven't been much of anywhere of late! A little bit though I guess. Just getting over viral meningitis atm...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-23 00:20:47	@DavidAllenGreen I noted the book writing comments before. I feel your pain. Pity you're not doing public speaking, you are a great speaker.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 22:24:39	@stevyncolgan Pay day has rolled around so supporting your book had to happen. I demand hand delivery to the Bootlegger! I say "demand"...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 21:38:21	@zeno001 It's true, I was foolish and clicked despite the warnings. The field probably made me do it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 21:37:51	@debecca I have nothing to offer but my sympathy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 21:30:45	@zeno001 I just read three lines of that. I am now a) in pain and b) stupider.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 21:29:42	@SpokesGay It has a very variable efficacy pattern. (Nice way of agreeing!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 21:28:54	@SpokesGay If you get the chance to try it: don't! It makes much of the suck of many large donkey balls, as we say in Russia.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 21:28:06	@SpokesGay Given how horrible it can be, I've been very mild. Staill hallucinating from the fever, which makes a difference to usual method
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 21:27:30	@SpokesGay ...docs were really disappointed, said "uh, only viral", sent me home with paracetamol,. Which is pretty much all one can do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 21:26:58	@SpokesGay No foolin'. Firday night, felt a bit rough, Sat am was hotter than the sun, Sat pm was getting spinal fluid test....

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 21:24:12	@SpokesGay Dogist!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 21:22:57	@SpokesGay That's the REAL problem. Cats are thugs. It's not dogs that perpetrate violence against cats. Wait! I have cartoons to back me up
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-22 21:21:18	@edyong209 Mmmm you can almost taste the coprolithic goodness. That's how to identify these things, right?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-20 18:31:16	@noodlemaz I think I'm v lucky, just like a bad flu. I get to flop about the place doing my romantic poet impersonation and demanding soup.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-20 18:27:20	@noodlemaz ....my wife's sister died from bacterial meningitis as a kid, and tbh the "m-word" carrries a lot of emotion in our household.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-20 18:26:22	@noodlemaz Cheers. Yeah when the doc looked a bit concerned and sent me for a CSF test I was a little perturbed (understatement)...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-20 18:19:56	@noodlemaz I think the answer in my case is "pretty mild, eat paracetamol like Skittles, lie down".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-20 18:19:13	@noodlemaz Cheers Dr M! I have...{ahem}..."extensively" been reading that site, not panicking, that is right out! 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-20 18:09:11	@clinteas I noticed. I was sufficiently feverish and yuck I went to the Doc instead standard Man Practise (stay away, think it's cancer)...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-20 18:05:47	So viral meningitis. It's a thing adults get apparently and in my case it's getting better and is like a bad flu. Lovely. I'm suing nature.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 19:33:42	@BipolarBlogger I hallucinated "separately" from intrusive thoughts, i.e. in different ways. I've just never experienced intensification of

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 19:20:53	@BipolarBlogger ...the fever made things worse. I'm not sure of course, I was just wondering if this phenomenon was something you knew about
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 19:20:17	@BipolarBlogger No. Definitely part of recent mood wobbles. It felt like hooking a stadium PA up to normal speaking voice. I think...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 19:00:59	@BipolarBlogger I mean in the event I lost insight, went erm “odd”… … well “odd-er”!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 19:00:16	@BipolarBlogger …I made sure my wife had the emergency contract folder had said that if she was worried, get me sectioned. That bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 18:59:31	@BipolarBlogger Yup I get the same thing “normally”, this varied in intensity with my fever. High fever = much higher intensity. So scary…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 17:58:51	@BipolarBlogger i’ve never experienced intrusive thoughts that strongly even (hypo)manic. Have you ever experienced/heard of this? 4/n

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 17:54:18	@BipolarBlogger Here’s a question. I’ve had a v high fever the last few days, which has made me hallucinate. A major feature of this 1/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 17:52:25	@dr_know @VillanuevaLaury Controversial choice. How shall we decide best method? Scissors paper stone?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 17:47:50	@VillanuevaLaury @dr_know Seems fairer than many of the other ways.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 17:11:10	@BipolarBlogger I think I just managed an audible eyeroll over Twitter! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 17:10:49	@BipolarBlogger Okay. Still clearly saying that makes you a terrible terrible person and deserving of abuse. Obviously. Goes without saying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 17:07:19	@depressednotsad Thanks. :-) The hazmat suit and tong were a bit insulting though! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 17:06:45	@BipolarBlogger …and thus people who do do self care are lazy workshy scum? I’ve had that one bandied about. Something else?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 17:06:17	@BipolarBlogger Oh FFS! Really? What the hell is wrong with that? Let me guess, the implication (untrue) that one can work at being better…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-19 16:56:06	@stevyncolgan @NeilDenham1978 I said “sidewalk” outside the Bootlegger once. I think I got away with it.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:53:23	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 It is at this point in the conversation that the internet demands PICS OR DIDN'T HAPPEN.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:52:12	@marcusbrig Your Man Skills are impressive. Move immediately into the garage and/or shed and saw some wood. It is what we do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:51:35	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 Okay, I can't even English. I DEMAND DRUGS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:51:03	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 Yikes! Post holiday yuck. I've in a similar boat and I only went to Dorset!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:46:38	@DramaLlama85 High temp induced Weird Brain stuff. Drugs okay. Lack of sleep is a big problem though. Tonight will involve a sleeping tablet
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:44:46	@DramaLlama85 How have you been?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:44:14	@DramaLlama85 Thanks. It's annoying Non-Specific Lurgy. I was hallucinating last night which was...I'm going with "fun"!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:43:08	@BipolarBlogger Ha! yeah, that'll be it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:39:14	@vandeand {Dives between you and the comments} NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:37:59	@BipolarBlogger Good. Baths help, weird isn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:37:46	I am sick as a very sick dog. I just thought everyone needed to know that. In fact, if you got two sick dogs, breed them for sickness, that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-17 02:36:50	@BipolarBlogger Are you feeling any better?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-16 17:22:06	@BipolarBlogger Not a bad plan.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-16 06:42:10	@BipolarBlogger That’s top drawer parenting. I only hope when my son grows up I cope as well as you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-16 06:41:04	@BipolarBlogger From what I can see you’re doing a stunning job. Talking things through, using appropriate services, setting realistic goals
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-16 00:30:31	@BipolarBlogger Seems reasonable. This date needs to get further tags. What cuisine shall we opt for?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-16 00:22:53	@BipolarBlogger ‘s true though!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 06:27:49	@FuzzCookies Sensible. I have purged such thoughts from my brain by watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 06:25:01	@FuzzCookies Imagine my disappointment at the films Free Willy and Pacific Rim.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 02:39:33	@rabbitsoup_zola @bdogrunner @debecca @BipolarBlogger I got that, if you apply the cream it clears right up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 01:57:09	@RevRichardColes It’s not just slebs, the Met was suspiciously well filmed in recent raids on brothels.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 01:55:11	@jourdemayne That is the minimum response, I admire your restraint. I’d have them tattooed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 01:54:16	@debecca {insert standard advice about meds} {insert standard disclaimer about trusting you and me trying not to be an interfering git!}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 01:17:53	@BipolarBlogger The bar is ALWAYS open. In the words of Rodney Dangerfield, I’ll have a PooPoo Punch, heavy on the PooPoo!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 01:15:29	@BipolarBlogger I don’t blame you. You’ve been through the ringer today by the sounds of it. Internet hugs are yours on demand.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 01:08:08	@BipolarBlogger Of course Cpt Positive here firmly believes that 3Us will be an excellent tale to tell when he collects his Nobel prize.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 01:03:36	@BipolarBlogger Crikey, that is rough on everyone. Are you okay?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 01:01:00	@OliverJamesUK I wouldn’t dare offend the noble turds of a public toilet with BF drivel.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 00:59:21	@BipolarBlogger …I read what you said to the others about the CAMHS meeting. Sounded hard but potentially a forward step. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 00:58:20	@BipolarBlogger A BTEC is not a terrible plan at all, good qualification. Especially if it gets him through this part of his life…1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 00:27:38	@BipolarBlogger Tip for Louis, read TL first, tweet later.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 00:25:33	@BipolarBlogger widgets? I meant wishes. Autocorrect spectacular!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-15 00:24:22	@BipolarBlogger Dare I check in to ask how results day went? I hope all is good and not too fraught. Best widgets to you all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-13 05:29:35	@fleetstreetfox Damn fine article. Thanks for it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-13 04:11:44	@garwboy @guardiansciblog Thank you Dr Burnett, that is a bloody good article. Smack bang on the money.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-11 21:08:23	@TheOnlyGuru Pay...For...Theralchopy? I...I...I'm in love! Please send a large cheque to my usual address: 1 The Gutter (Outside Oddbins).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-11 21:03:35	@TheOnlyGuru I saw the D**** M*** once. It hurt me. It hurt me in ways I have yet to recover fully from.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-11 20:57:21	@TheOnlyGuru I want you to sit in the corner and think about what you’ve done.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-11 20:55:05	@paulcoxon Relieved, tired, apprehensive, keen to get home shower off the child excretions and finally have the opportunity for sex? Weird!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-11 20:50:52	@CCriadoPerez A bit aged hipsterish of me, but I didn’t even know who he was until I found out about Blurred Lines, then didn’t want to.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-11 18:48:02	@DocHackenbush I favour a rotary sander, a septic monkey, some duct tape and IDS’ face. But you artists, so creative! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 02:32:28	@saspist @KevEvans In a different life, very briefly a while ago. I went into industry. That worked out! {eyeroll} #phramajobcuts
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 02:22:18	@saspist After all, imagine the unrest humour could cause in the wrong hands! Deary me. I saw someone be humorous the other day, killed him.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 02:21:38	@saspist I do worry that my initial serial killer/ice cream based joke has lead us down a dark path. One I hope is not being taken seriously
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 02:20:27	@saspist In a pinch. Personally, you can't beat lime. I did use a pomelo once, but made sure the house boy flogged me for it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 02:15:30	@saspist It's the only way to fly. I have eschewed champers for the evening and moved to beer and rum. It's that kind of day.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 02:02:12	@saspist ...proper fair trade that I got into before it was cool. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 02:01:45	@saspist {Reclines in wing backed armchair, puffs on cigarillo, adjusts smoking jacket} But of course. Not common fair trade though...1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:29:24	@Esteleth Christia...what? Never heard of them!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:28:43	@saspist I am an organic free range mass murderer. One has one's standards. (I'm not sure if this joke just got creepier)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:27:38	@wordgeeksarah I did it. It worked wonders. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:27:24	@wordgeeksarah It's ok. Breathe. You can put a skewer in your ear, followed by hot bleach + a wire brush. Keep scrubbing. The pain will pass
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:24:55	@Esteleth My my. What COULD thos nations have in common? {Flutters eyelashes innocently}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:22:51	@Esteleth Cognitive Dissonance: It's what's for breakfast.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:22:33	@Esteleth Phew!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:18:10	@Esteleth Oh wow. That's surely worthy of a (careful) complaint on the grounds of clinical incompetence.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:14:05	@Esteleth Hmmmm. I used to work with a lovely Ghanaian bloke. Taught me some filthy Ghanaian (Fante?) that may help... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:13:03	@Esteleth Nasty. That's a shite state of affairs. {Clenched fist of solidarity from other side of Atlantic}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:11:40	@Esteleth Well that's true, obviously. Goes without saying. Honest. No really. Why are you looking at me like that? OW! NOT THE FACE! NO!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:10:55	@Esteleth Lovely! That's a definite "bless your heart" to the person who said it. With extra "bless".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:03:49	@saspist @sturdyAlex Well naturally I do like to eat in season. I behead people and use their skulls for ornaments but I'm not a monster.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-10 00:03:30	@Esteleth Do I want to know?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 21:33:27	@Hayleystevens Forget I asked. I just read back. Typed before thinking! Old habits die hard! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 21:32:25	@Hayleystevens Christ! What have we/they/whoever done now?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 21:31:33	@saspist @sturdyAlex Yes. The bloo..I mean ice cream... gets everywhere. That wine you mentioned, a nice Chianti?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 21:06:07	@sturdyAlex @saspist And the joke dies on shitty spelling. I blame the ice cream.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 21:05:50	@sturdyAlex @saspist Sorry I punctuated that incorrectly: "I now desire good ice cream and a series killer, television series?" ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 20:53:04	@sturdyAlex @saspist Is it bad that , in following this conversation, I now desire good ice cream and a serial killer television series?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 04:00:52	@thetrudz And why do you think I followed you? Precisely for all that good stuff!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 03:59:34	@BipolarBlogger I stress these are different from "feelings that men have" which are just normal. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 03:55:40	@noodlemaz The Wore is, in my very humble and probably wrong opinion, the best thing on a screen ever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 03:54:01	@BipolarBlogger I am also struggling with Man Feels (TM) which we know involve fixing EVERYTHING and are 99% bullshit! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 03:53:31	@BipolarBlogger I care, I truly do. I sympathise with you, I also remember being a 17 year old boy. Something for which I apologise often!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 03:51:49	@BipolarBlogger No, it can't be good for either of you. Especially you I imagine. {Hugs} I wish there was a good solution.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 03:48:06	@BipolarBlogger Yeesh! You're in a hard place.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 03:47:35	@richardosman Put on a funky outfit and try to join them. Guaranteed to stop it in moments. That or you'll have a terrific night. Win win.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-09 03:21:23	@BipolarBlogger Sorry about that. On the other hand: welcome back safe and sound.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:32:48	@BipolarBlogger A bit of "Needing Rock Bottom" syndrome perhaps?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:31:34	@BipolarBlogger ...but obviously the choice is entirely yours. If you want a sounding board, my twitter name at gmail
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:28:55	@BipolarBlogger I figured you would have done this, the offer stands. The experience with academia/MH issues etc might be helpful....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:27:44	@jmcefalas @BipolarBlogger ...resist as a moody teen (ahhh memories!) counts for more than gold.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:27:21	@jmcefalas @BipolarBlogger ...MASSIVE advantages. Also, having a great mum helps. Not kidding btw! knowing you're cared for, even if you...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:26:50	@jmcefalas @BipolarBlogger My cautious note of optimism would be because he's a high acheiver (that doesn't vanish) and young. Those are...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:26:06	@jmcefalas @BipolarBlogger I'm a fan of reality biting BUT it can cut both ways, and that is a terrifying uncertainty. Reality also destroys
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:24:51	@BipolarBlogger After all, you've been immeasurably helpful to me, no reason why I can't return the favour if you want me to.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:24:26	@BipolarBlogger ...and I've been DBVS checked (kids and adults) due to volunteer work with schools etc. So you can check me out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:23:43	@BipolarBlogger And I *AM* serious btw. If you want a free science tutor an hour or so a week, I can offer a bit of help. I could send a CV
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:22:39	@BipolarBlogger Have a pleasant and safe journey home.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:21:20	@BipolarBlogger ...get it out of the way now. Much better than later on. That I promise is true!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:20:59	@BipolarBlogger It's not uncommon and it IS recoverable. Honest. And if failure etc is a "teaching moment" (yuck!) it is really good to...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:19:03	@BipolarBlogger Want a free tutor?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:18:55	@BipolarBlogger ...doesn't hurt too much, or cause sufficient distress to you all that harm happens. (in terms of mood etc)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:18:30	@BipolarBlogger ...the state of the benefits system he's hardly likely to have other options! It's a tough situation. I hope reality...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:17:34	@BipolarBlogger That said, a few months/yrs working in minimum wage jobs will (hopefully) scare the living bejeezus out of him! And given...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:16:17	@BipolarBlogger ...I can't presume to advise, I can only hope that you are all okay, and that the stress from this can be managed somehow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:15:27	@BipolarBlogger ...time and maturity. Well there might be, but I don't know what it is! Something with an electric cattle prod perhaps...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:14:50	@BipolarBlogger I can only imagine it's a heart breaking and frustrating situation. I sympathise entirely. There is no solution other than..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:10:28	@BipolarBlogger But sadly, all I have to offer is pablum and platitudes. I'm too remote to actually help. Unless he's doing any science!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:09:07	@BipolarBlogger ...the only problem is it can be (trust me!) MUCH much harder to balance the time, but much easier with a bit of maturity.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:08:41	@BipolarBlogger ...all I can offer is from my own perspective: screwing up exams is never as bad as it seems. It's always possible to redo..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:06:26	@BipolarBlogger It's a tough thing. I have no idea what to say (and who knows, I'll probably have to do the same thing in a few years)...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:05:31	@BipolarBlogger ...to talk to a seriously inadequate member of the Twitter MH support circle! 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:05:05	@BipolarBlogger Yeah, the crash is horrid. I'm in and out next week for chats, so not v reliable, but I'll have the mobile if you need 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:03:12	@VicMetcalf_NZ @hebehu @AcademiaObscura The person I'd ask about any of this is @ProfFrancesca who most definitely is a proper expert!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 17:01:47	@VicMetcalf_NZ @hebehu @AcademiaObscura I am not an expert! I'll link: http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of _the_beast … But with the caveat that I can't assess it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 16:58:41	@VicMetcalf_NZ @hebehu @AcademiaObscura Mind you, I've heard the neighbour of the beast (668) is a lot worse! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 16:58:19	@VicMetcalf_NZ @hebehu @AcademiaObscura I wouldn't worry about 666, isn't the "real" number 616 anyway? (Not that any of it is real)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 16:56:03	@BipolarBlogger I wasn't joking when I said I need a holiday after a holiday. The reality crash can be horrendous. Good luck for results day

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 04:14:36	@OliverJamesUK Did you put it all on red? Rookie error. Should be all on black. Obviously.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-08 01:50:38	@SpokesGay NOOOOOO! Not Dennett! Oh balls. Time to start with the many many drinkings again. Should I google?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-07 18:19:23	@mistressmatisse Ha! I will do my best.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-07 18:17:32	@mistressmatisse But I decided it was insufficiently witty for your Twitter! Obviously I did that really well. Nice work, Louis, nice work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-07 18:16:56	@mistressmatisse Along the lines of I regularly meet with rich folks to get my Lego AND NOTHING ELSE out. Never ask for donations either
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-07 18:15:52	@mistressmatisse Sorry, I think I meant to say something witty and sausage fingers did something daft instead. Apologies.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:50:02	@rabbitsoup_zola Wet cloth and a broom? (I've used it in the past to great effect)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:49:11	@Sectioned_ ...message that I should have some halloumi. It is a message. It IS! Okay, look, I'm just hungry dammit. (And joking) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:48:25	@Sectioned_ Okay that is just evil. I am struggling with a halloumi based ethical dilemma. I have decided to interpret your tweet as a 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:45:54	@gravbeast DEFINITELY!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:45:03	@gravbeast Yup, in terms of MH discussions etc, definitely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:39:19	@StopBlaminWomen @CCriadoPerez @sarahditum We're dangerously close to agreeing again. I listen to some shocking stuff.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:37:23	@StopBlaminWomen @CCriadoPerez @sarahditum Have you HEARD the music you listen to? Tchoh!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:36:38	@gravbeast (If you didn't get the hint, you're one of them!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:36:14	@gravbeast Yup! I've met some really stunningly decent people on here.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:35:06	@StopBlaminWomen @CCriadoPerez @sarahditum Or in other words: STOP BEING SO DAMNED RIGHT! All this agreement hurts! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:34:32	@StopBlaminWomen @CCriadoPerez @sarahditum The more I learn the less I know.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:30:50	@gravbeast Thanks. It is a bit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:29:15	@StopBlaminWomen @CCriadoPerez @sarahditum I'm a big fan of smart people. I hope to be one when I grow up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:27:06	@gravbeast I know. It's an AWFULLY large barrier of total horseshit to wade through/counter. Even with well intentioned folks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:26:17	@gravbeast And that's another angle. It's not all "woe is me" (far from it). Why lay that weight on them too?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 23:25:46	@gravbeast I stress my family are lovely. They, erm, how do I put this, just read the Daily Mail. And believe it. A lot.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 21:34:43	@JagexSupport Okay, no problem.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 21:24:57	@JagexSupport A further thought occurs: When will that account be deleted? Freeing up name etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 20:56:26	@JagexSupport As for a new account...I DO love the quests... ...oh dear! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 20:55:27	@JagexSupport I thought as much (from the FAQ). Sad, but I let my sub lapse for years, ignored the game and someone clearly got in somehow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 20:14:24	@paulcoxon Also, that's a trick question. Nice one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 20:09:39	@paulcoxon Come now, the rotation of polarised light is a socialist disaster we inherited from Labour to make Great Britain bad at Wiff Waff

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 19:31:09	@bdogrunner @rabbitsoup_zola E) All of the above, all-round awesome and other stuff I haven't thought of yet that's generally positive.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 19:23:17	@JagexSupport The question is really: do I wait to see what happens, or start from scratch (if I wish to)?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 19:21:58	@JagexSupport ...and that the "appeal pending" message in that account is never going to happen, so if I wish to re-sub I should create new?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 19:21:14	@JagexSupport I read the FAQ, as a (very) lasped player who returned to find a perma-banned acc, I take it there is no reprieve even for me?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 18:06:53	@gravbeast By the way, do you know how many jokes I am holding back? The strain is audible!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 18:03:57	@RichardDawkins I oppose her views in practically all forms. Except for her resignation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 18:01:49	@gravbeast Oh dear, you seem to have struck a rich vein of a) humour and b) knowledge (no questions. Wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 18:01:08	@gravbeast Oh yes, and you pass the lube to the left. Naturally.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-05 18:00:24	@robinince I saw a brown person on screen once. The fact that it was in the mirror as I shaved is purest coincidence. PC gorn mad!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-04 16:59:32	@bmagnanti The hypocrisy, arrogance, destructive ideology and generally being massive arse on the other hand, THAT I hate him for.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-08-04 16:58:53	@bmagnanti Engaging in consensual sub/dom/sex/whatever, hopefully pleasant, paid for with a SW would be a thing I *don't* hate him for.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-25 17:21:43	@gravbeast @DramaLlama85 The word there is "procrastinatory" ignore the awful construction and typo. It happened because space aliens Honest

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-25 17:15:58	@gravbeast @DramaLlama85 Okay, experts on Scumbag brains. I have had a bit of a downturn of late, leading to being behind in my work...1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 20:47:07	@there_runsMary Yeah "Smiling happy laughing" is tough to distinguish from "angry crying afraid"

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 20:39:47	@saspist @bdogrunner And I am never going to stop being a total bastard. I like upsetting muppets far too much for that. I'm a bad monkey.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 20:39:07	@saspist @bdogrunner "unfit" will definitely come good towards the end of the "fat" part being over.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 20:38:30	@saspist @bdogrunner I *am* doing good on the "fat" part though. Middle aged seems impossible to combat in reality, but easily in attitude
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 20:37:47	@saspist @bdogrunner Well I exaggerate for comic effect, and Dog's response was correct and excellent btw.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 17:29:01	@there_runsMary Yeah, I mean who wants to be a victim, amirite? {near fatal eyeroll}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 17:26:21	@aweebithopeful I think something’s in the water. A few of us are needing to don the galoshes at the moment it seems. I’m here for you too.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 17:24:55	@bdogrunner Okay it was terrible advice, you’re right. Tragically, it was also quite funny. I do need to build the habit. I want to do a…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 17:15:46	@bdogrunner I need to learn running tips from you. I imagine the first tip will be: stop being an unfit, fat, middle aged bastard. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 17:13:37	That last tweet was a joke. Please realise that. No. Seriously. It’s a parody of MRA bozos.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 15:51:07	@BipolarBlogger Thanks for looking out for me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 15:50:47	@BipolarBlogger Unless of course you have The Secret!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 15:50:03	@BipolarBlogger Morning. Physical illness looks like it was 24 hr job. Depression, well, you know the drill. Cyclical. Wait for it to pass.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 15:48:52	@aweebithopeful I don’t need to tell you it’s like weather. Just have to wait for it to pass and try to stay dry!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-24 15:48:13	@aweebithopeful Thanks for yesterday. The bug seemed to 24 hrs, so I’m not doubled over any more. The depression is simply cyclical.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-23 23:25:27	And yes, I managed to work in hating the Tories into a tweet about shitting liberally without comparing them to my anal output.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-23 22:33:54	@aweebithopeful Thanks. ANd thanks for being so kind.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-23 22:29:23	@BipolarBlogger I'm always mistaking the two
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-23 22:28:58	@aweebithopeful I'll do what I can. I'm also sick, which is odd and annoying. My wife and son were poorly last week I thought i'd avoided it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-23 22:28:07	@BipolarBlogger And on this occasion, as with so many, you were right. Curse you and your rightness! Okay not actually "curse"..."praise"

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-23 22:15:41	@pzmyers @chromesthesia Shears? Kudos! Oh come on...THAT was never getting passed up!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-23 20:08:20	@BipolarBlogger If I’m honest, no. But I don’t want to burden you with that. A bit low etc, it should pass.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-23 02:32:04	@_Ex_Astris_ Well, I was (read: am) clueless. I just got most of my stupid out of the way before this recent blow up. And clueless=/=nasty

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:59:23	@RevRichardColes Try being a scientist. I only have to mention "chemistry" and people's eyes roll.. Anti-intellectualism is rife.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:57:52	@gravbeast @bdogrunner I'll get a sign to distinguish between serious/non-serious. But yes, I usually make serious v obvious.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:51:00	@gravbeast @bdogrunner In all seriousness, yes. Don't alcohol! I *hope* my lack of seriousness was apparent, but yes, very good point.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:44:33	@BipolarBlogger Ah yes. The crappy phase before the good bit! I know it well.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:37:50	@BipolarBlogger I can offer no more than remote sympathy. I feel a bit crap and ineffectual!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:36:16	@RevRichardColes A meat raffle is the minimum requirement for Proper Pub status. Pickled eggs are a definite strong move, however.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:34:45	@bdogrunner @aweebithopeful The best people never feel like good people. It's a prerequisite of the condition! Trust me You're a good sort
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:32:59	@bdogrunner @aweebithopeful I'll second that, and I'll also note that I wish I'd said it. You're a good person, Dog. Don't forget it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:30:46	@bdogrunner Okay there are things I cannot tolerate...UNSUBSCRIBE!!!! Oh all right...I'll admit it, I'm actually really impressed. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:28:49	@noodlemaz Oh I love Kraken. Cpt Morgan's spiced is decent, I do like spiced rums, hence tonight's choice of Sailor Jerry's.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:26:46	@bdogrunner Insert {hugs}. These are feelings I know. I am currently recommending rum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:26:06	@noodlemaz Do you have a favourite?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:25:44	@noodlemaz More than rum. It is my favourite kind of rum: Large Rum. I may be moved to Very Large Rum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:24:09	I have decided to start drinking. It may reduce errors. {Lights up Cohiba} {Pours Large Rum}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:20:13	@pzmyers Also to be fair, it is easy to mistake a Quaker for a eugenicist...no...really.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:19:03	@szvan Excellent, we'll go with that, say no more about it and I'll make sure the funds will be sent to the usual accounts.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:17:45	@szvan True enough> I think I need a new brain. Can I blame excessive gardening and heat? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:17:14	@szvan @pzmyers Ha! I was also thinking along the lines of sexism etc so my own sexism made me head for a male Sanger. And typos. Many typos
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:16:05	@szvan @pzmyers There is a reason default to Fred as my Sanger. Apart from just meeting him.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:15:12	@szvan @pzmyers Yes serious, but epic fail on my part. I blame lack of both booze and sleep. Honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:14:38	@pzmyers Thank fuck for that! I've met Fred and I would, despite knowing about feet of clay etc, be distressed to learn of epic douchiness
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-20 05:07:49	@pzmyers Is the Sanger you refer to in your peice of Bill Maher *the* Sanger, i.e. Fred Sanger? If so...I...I...go on tell me. {scared}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 23:20:49	@BipolarBlogger Ah. Ouch. You all have my sympathy. Sadly the wise head on young shoulders is not an easy transplant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 23:02:08	@andy_nortcliffe Many moons ago it used to be halfway decent (high praise). No idea of current state.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 23:00:31	@andy_nortcliffe Ahhhh. Lovely part of town. Could be either. Nip into a swanky bar and forget about it. Is Blue still there?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:59:23	@andy_nortcliffe Depends. Beeston? No. Lenton? Probably.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:52:54	@wordgeeksarah I've never thought being a bit gauche or wrong is a crime. Being a manipulative/deliberately hurtful git on the other hand...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:47:56	@wordgeeksarah Seconded in toto!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:42:10	@wordgeeksarah Yup, that's how I meant it. But sometimes I do these incredibly well intended stupendously stupid things! I blame Pickles.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:37:11	@wordgeeksarah So entirely my bad. I fucked up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:36:58	@wordgeeksarah I just realised that, unintentionally (MAGIC!), my tweet could hve come across as saying fat = nasty/objectionable. It's not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:27:23	@BipolarBlogger That's all undoubtedly true. I was wondering about the value of failure as an object lesson. Risky strategy though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:20:33	@BipolarBlogger Crikey! That could be...dramatic! Is there the option to let him fail? He's still young and therefore recoverable.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:13:31	@BipolarBlogger I can only hope that both of your MH is cared for, but it sounds like things are very stressful.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:12:30	@BipolarBlogger I've been reading, aghast. I have nothing but sympathy, because I have no ideas about what to do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:06:13	@wordgeeksarah The size of Pickles, arse or otherwise, is the least objectionable thing about him. What's between his ears is far nastier.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 22:02:33	@BipolarBlogger I am looking forward to my son growing up and there being no conflict ever. Oh look! A unicorn! In other words: {Hugs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 20:47:24	@biorhythmist @UnstableIsotope Ridiculous! Changing the bulb would break western society which was made by white men in the dark. MISANDRY!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 20:42:24	@RevRichardColes …things about Christians in general and the intellectual aspects of a life of faith. Stop it immediately! ;-) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 20:41:33	@RevRichardColes I saw your Sky Arts In Confidence interview last night. You’re the type of Christian that makes me think favourable…1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 08:52:56	@DrRubidium @szvan I don’t know what movie it is, all I know is that my wife approves of the shirtless bits. They are essential to the plot.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 08:50:56	@SarahMillican75 @JohnFinnemore Ah the joys of insomnia and this being the first tweet I saw. Two of my favourite comedians discussing baths
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 06:56:09	@MyTChondria @pzmyers @docfreeride I’ve always viewed their use of the word “Discovery” in the same vein as that of the Discovery Institute.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 06:49:06	@lousycanuck You are a very, very naughty person. I will now expend not insignificant effort to tell you this. Naughty! Naughty! There.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 06:36:24	Just watching Breaking Bad’s “Felina” (second time for me, first time for my wife). Oooh it is good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 06:34:41	@hughlaurie It’s gorgeous, and I’m off for a second visit in October, can’t wait.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 05:47:38	@chenghlee @neva9257 @rocza @docfreeride @ct_la I’ve seen what USAists do to tea, I shall brook no culinary correction! (Not serious)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 05:42:27	@ElizabethDelphi @ct_la @docfreeride @chenghlee Usually fairly simple salads with balsamic/tomato. Sometimes soups. Sometimes in saag.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 04:43:10	@sciencenotscary @chenghlee @docfreeride Oh deary me I was not being serious! I’d still like to see the rant though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 04:41:30	@chenghlee @docfreeride That is a good point. We’ve butchered the language.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 04:39:53	@chenghlee @docfreeride Canadians don’t get in line they are just very polite when they mill about in crowds that appear to be lines. Honest
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 04:38:35	@MuseumMusings @docfreeride @chenghlee That would to my mind imply leaf, ground would imply seed, but yes, potentially imprecise.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 04:37:23	@docfreeride @chenghlee Cultural imperialism, pure and simple. Now get in line people. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 04:35:27	@Geeka In the UK the whole thing is called coriander, we add “leaf” or “seed” afterwards.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 04:34:13	@chenghlee @docfreeride Not in the UK, we call the whole thing coriander (followed by leaf or seed)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-19 04:28:55	@docfreeride Cilantro fight? Nice tasters vs soapy tasters? The real fight should be over the fact that it’s called coriander. Dammit.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-14 16:40:01	@BjarteSF @chiara84 V possible. It's one of those things that's partially soluble by asking "what do you mean by that?".

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-14 16:04:14	@BjarteSF I think it depends on how you use/define "hero". I guess my use is less haloed! Just means "someone whose X I admire"

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 20:54:06	@Sectioned_ Harsh! But it happens. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 20:50:59	@Sectioned_ Indeed. I confess my ignorance, but on an MH basis too? Compliance with treatment? Play acting in accord with "medical" reqs?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 20:49:36	@WhySharksMatter But but FeeFees! You hurt mah FeeFees! I'll bloody sue!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 20:48:01	@Sectioned_ I suppose my concern is more that people will be required to act "well" by some metric/compliance in order to receive benefits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 20:46:08	@Sectioned_ ..how problematically personality disorder diagnoses have occasionally been used/stigmatised. As opposed to actal compuslion 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 20:45:22	@Sectioned_ Actually yes, good point. I overegged that pudding! Not "compulsory", {ahem} "encouraged". I'm thinking along the lines of 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 20:39:18	@Sectioned_ Totally unethical and v scientifically dicey, obviously. But with sufficient govt obfuscation... ...not unimaginable.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 20:38:38	@Sectioned_ Compulsory compliance with computer based CBT/SSRIs is a relatively cheap intervention. Could be requirement v easily. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 20:37:56	@Sectioned_ Without substantial commitment to MH treatments they're unworkable. So yes, deliberate stigmatising. I have one caveat: 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 20:33:53	@Sectioned_ Agree that it's clickbait, agree it's almost impossible. It's also a highly stigmatising narrative that is problematic itself.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 20:00:39	@boglestone @EverydayAbleism Compulsory treatment of people who present with depression as condition of benefits is going to be dangerous
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 19:59:13	@boglestone @EverydayAbleism 1 ex of why this is a bad idea: bipolar disorder. Hard to diagnose (time to Dx ~10yrs), SSRIs can cause mania
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 19:43:59	@BipolarBlogger This policy would kill. This "announcement" and sundry similar rhetoric kills to a slightly lesser degree. I am unamused!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 19:36:50	@EverydayAbleism @ka_tie 1) Yes. 2) It should also provide some treatment. Getting therapy via NHS, esp more than a tiny amount is tough.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 19:34:57	@BipolarBlogger @Katcopley ...leading to people being required to act "well" by parrotting CBTisms for benefits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 19:33:30	@BipolarBlogger @Katcopley And I am very concerned that PC based/non-therapist delivered CBT would be the therapy of choice for DWP...1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 19:32:52	@BipolarBlogger @Katcopley Agreed on all counts. I find elements of CBT useful, had to be well(ish) to do so. The rest was algorithmic crap!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 19:18:58	@dr_know No excusing needed. If swearing is not induced by such politicking then I think something is profoundly wrong! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 18:05:36	@JackofKent Soon to come: “mistakes were made” = “I’m retiring to the board of a company that manufactures spy equipment”

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 17:56:25	…limited CBT style computer based therapies, use of SSRIs (or similar), and pressurises vulnerable people on benefits to act well. 3/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 17:54:31	…route. Which, while cost effective is hardly universal or more than one step. My nightmare is that govt requires “performance” on very 2/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 17:53:15	That said, requiring treatment requires treatment to be available! Not likely. Unless they go down the most algorithmic Internet CBT 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 17:51:46	@Sectioned_ I hope so I really do. I do see it as a worsening of the rhetoric around MH though. Requiring treatment would require treatment!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 17:49:55	There will be bodies. Mark my words. Yet another Tory policy aimed at killing people when they are vulnerable.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 17:49:15	…recur, first line treatments fail, the effective treatment of MH issues is an evolving relationship between a person and their Dr/psych 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-13 17:48:05	“Refuse” treatment? “Refuse”? I don’t know many people who can GET treatment for MH issues, let alone refuse it. MH is complex, issues 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 16:15:18	@Storm_Images Tax you say? I've heard good things. @VagendaMagazine
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 16:14:06	@VagendaMagazine And on this day, the world's most ridiculuous chat up line was invented. Well, they're all equally ridiculous... 2/2 :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 16:13:36	@VagendaMagazine I don't mean to boast but I'm, erm, very, you know, fiscally responsible. If you get my drift. {waggles eyebrows} 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 16:10:45	I've seen it before, but this from @TaraFlynn is so bang on it's explosive: https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=J80q7Q 3UIEM#t=166 … Ah yes "nice" racists. Hmmm.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 16:00:59	@chiara84 Ahhh. I am, as yet, not fully caffeinated. Ergo my homicidal/misanthropic tendancies are reaching their zenith. It's midweek too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 15:57:57	@chiara84 Very fair, very fair. I am impressed by your kindness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 15:56:59	Two things: 1) Coffee 2) Work 3) Coffee 4) Sarcasm
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 15:56:25	@DrEvanHarris @giagia @JackofKent No, Dr Harris! No! Never say *those* words on Twitter. I am given to understand abuse is not rare here ;)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 15:55:11	@chiara84 I suppose, when I come to power, I can permit soccer to be played. Maybe.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 15:54:47	@chiara84 Damn you spotted my (glaring) source of bias! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 15:44:33	@chiara84 Fan of Pinochet? That's dodgy And my hypothesis that soccer overlaps with every moral wickedness there is gets anther data point!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 13:58:23	@WhySharksMatter my wife is watching Breaking Bad at the moment, I’m (re)watching it with her. No sleep has been had ever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 13:47:13	@finediningguide @RouxWaterside He deserves it. He made our visit there exceptional.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 13:44:33	@sturdyAlex I’m in the same boat. I’m looking for someone to blame. It is a disturbing feeling. I’ve dispatched my valet to find bacon.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 13:42:47	Okay brain. I’m awake. Little sleep was was had and I feel like a military academy. Bits of me keep passing out. There may be Norty Werdz.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:27:31	@AdamRutherford @pzmyers @ScienceNewsUK Ah jayzus! “Scientific” racism AGAIN? If I knew bollocks could be recycled I would’ve binned my jock
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:24:22	@lady_abs You’re most welcome. Especially as I know exactly how you feel. Horrid isn’t it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:23:42	@aweebithopeful I’ll cross fingers for us both and turn off the twitter pad! night!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:21:54	@lady_abs EMERGENCY HUG!! (If you want it that is)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:21:31	@aweebithopeful Urgh, yeah. I’m similar, v early in morning or v late at night are best. From 4pm to about 7pm I might as well be a brick.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:19:14	@aweebithopeful Solidarity! {clenched assignment salute} Same boat here. All nighters nearly killed me. And yes, literally.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:16:27	@aweebithopeful It has to. I have an unfinished OU assignment due tomorrow. Brain needs to function a bit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:13:20	@aweebithopeful awwww you’re all too nice. I was joking. I’m not that sulky, honest! Sleep would be nice though!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:10:54	@andiosho It does explain a lot. Annnnnd now that song is in my head. Dagnabit!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:09:43	@DramaLlama85 It’s okay, I meant the other yous, you’re exempt! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:09:01	@chiara84 Good point. Is it wrong to imagine the heads of Brazilian football are just going to wordlessly pull his pants down and spank him?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:02:20	I went to bed two hours ago for an early sleep. I am not getting sleep. I blame everyone else. Especially you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 06:01:52	Something something Brazillian, something something painful, something Germans, something something torn off a strip Work it out yourselves
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 05:58:33	@AdamRutherford Watching the snooker?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 05:57:03	@piersmorgan @DavidAllenGreen Piers, don’t lead with your chin, it makes it too easy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 05:55:17	@MitchBenn The hairstyles were, however, curiously similar.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 04:51:34	@miketindall13 He’s a big lad, not the quickest, I’ve heard he can do miracles…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 04:11:05	@SpokesGay You had me at the words “gobbler” and “coming”. What…WHAT? You expect that sort of opportunity to pass?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 03:40:31	@depressednotsad Let's be honest neither do I. I looked into my mind once, scary place! And on that note, early bed! Night!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 03:38:21	@depressednotsad I do not have a dirty mind! It's just, erm, errrr, "diverse in its interests".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 03:36:33	@depressednotsad And you have a nice night too. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 03:36:05	@depressednotsad OH NOES! {Steals All the Motivations}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 03:34:17	@depressednotsad Ah thanks. I'll use it tomorrow morning if that's okay. Tonight is about to be all about sleep and making sure I'm ready!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 01:29:22	Although smallpox does win on epic nasty.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 01:29:10	Smallpox in freezer discovery nasty. All chemists, will have "found explosive/drug in the lab stories". And by "found" 90%="made" if honest
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 01:26:19	@OBFSFieldBio @bug_gwen Smallpox does take the biscuit, as a chemist the number of mouldering explosives found at back of lab cupboards >0
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 01:19:08	Why am I struggling for even basic motivation? It seems to be plaguing lots of people around me too. Weird. Contagious craposity.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-09 00:06:44	@Sectioned_ They are two of the best possible phrases.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 23:33:46	@bengoldacre @Anorakus I read the headline. I’m now going for a bit of a lie down until the urge to kill passes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 23:31:57	@OliverJamesUK I’ve read it’s fake…which, if true, makes it more ironic if you think about it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 23:30:20	@AdamRutherford It’s obvious bullshit. After all, gingers can just dye their hair, and climate change won’t get them. Tchoh, scientists!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 21:48:24	@noodlemaz Unless you get caught dancing and singing cheesy pop and then have to deliver performance reviews same afternoon. Erm, allegedly
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 20:38:34	@CCriadoPerez Ah yes the overlap between "No True Feminist" and "Holier Than Thou". It is a joyless place.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 20:37:23	@jonmbutterworth Well you get Deepak, we chemists get homoeopaths. I'm not sure a trade would work either way!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 20:32:32	@jonmbutterworth Was it engaging with Deepity Deepak what done it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 20:29:42	@matt_factor @EverydaySexism @OwenJones84 @NoMorePage3 One can but hope.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 20:21:17	@ProfBrianCox My guess (not a physicist) is no.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 20:20:57	@ProfBrianCox I wonder if, using the Many Worlds interpretation of QM, there's a universe in which Deeptiy Deepak'S Quantum Bullshit is true
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 20:17:44	@tkingdoll Global space lizard conspiracy. Always. Always.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 20:16:28	@AdamRutherford @tkingdoll SO last year! It's raw cocoa now, darlings.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 19:56:00	@tkingdoll As long as those pants aren't historically inaccurate and only contain warlocks... Look this MRA stuff is hard to keep track of.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 19:54:34	@tkingdoll Deary me, what's wrong with ethical pants?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 19:50:04	This is one of the scariest things I've read: http://www. theguardian.com/commentisfree/ 2014/jul/07/anxiety-depression-not-the-end-mental-health … @ArianeSherine Thank you. If only I had your courage.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 19:36:39	@MiggyMoonbeam Also, bitterness and anger aside. I sympathise and empathise. It's a horrible thing to be accused of when ill.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 19:33:49	@ChrisClose51 Which, let's face it, is a pretty serious state of affairs. When Tebbit is the moral compass, shite follows.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 19:33:09	@Herring1967 Congratulations. To celebrate let me take out a subscription to RHMOL.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 19:32:09	@MiggyMoonbeam Clever. Real chance of suicide too, what's not to love!? Is it obvious we're a bit bitter about this bullshit?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 19:30:20	@MiggyMoonbeam Oh are you faking it too, like me? I do it for the lovely stigma, crippling morbidity, career destruction and hate. You?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 19:16:57	@RevRichardColes I think this is a litmus test of a decent human being.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 07:35:39	@Jenny_Trout Excessive and filthy you say? Excuse me, I need to get beer. BRB. What is this Merlin you speak of btw? UK TV show?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 07:32:17	@ImprobableJoe There is/was a Sigma Aldrich (chemical supplier) deodorant for the less fresh lab colleague. I understand your pain well.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 07:31:04	@h2osarah I’m imagining the Miss Manners dissection of such behaviour. “When should a Lady Motorboat…”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 07:28:40	@JosieLong Don’t fantasise. Live the dream. Then replace the alarm like a responsible adult. It’s the right thing to do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 07:27:29	@h2osarah Sentences like that are why I read the Internet. That is great on at least 2 levels.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 07:26:28	@ImprobableJoe Yes, let’s go with ear. Btw this is all a joke, I am a functioning adult (I fucking am!!! Honest) not a rampant soap dodger
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 07:24:11	@ImprobableJoe Hold on I’m writing this down. Okay, best not to think about what I’m writing it with, but still, notes are being made.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 07:22:42	@ImprobableJoe Whoa whoa whoa! BOTH? This is news!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 07:22:07	@drugmonkeyblog My PhD boss boasted once about the number of suicides he’d had. I’d say that nailed it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 07:19:22	@michaellegge It’s loony great isn’t it? Hey Mr Bass Man…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 04:33:18	@sex_ational Very yes. Much much yes. Yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 04:31:58	@red3blog @jteeDC @celesteasaurus @Crommunist No, but I did MySpace Zoroaster. Does that count?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 04:26:46	@FlossieTeacake Oh dear me yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 04:22:47	@Press_Coffee Yes. Send the coffee AND NOTHING ELSE directly to my address. Your honour. {ahem}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 04:22:03	@Press_Coffee They’re definitely not really watching my every move. Wait…does this mean I’m fake paranoid?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 04:16:36	@SpokesGay @ingdamnit The pair of you are merely prejudiced against clairvoyants. Why will no one think of the poor clairvoyants?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 04:13:51	@Press_Coffee @laurenlaverne I am forever in vague trouble with the fake law. It’s an entirely fictional burden of my virtual life.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 03:51:03	This Panorama documentary is horrific. I already knew this stuff, but seeing it adds to the horror. Also count the standard MH tropes/stigma
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 03:09:24	@ingdamnit Only on special occasions.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 03:08:16	@ingdamnit I had a hot date and she had my leg off. Can I sue?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 03:07:13	@pzmyers Think for yourself! But only in the way I do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-08 02:57:29	@depressednotsad @rabbitsoup_zola @debecca I do blame me. Humbly sorry

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 21:59:21	@WellNowUniverse @everydaysexism @TaraFlynn Bloody brilliant. Horribly accurate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 21:51:32	@tauriqmoosa The reason I ask is because you might not get push back, you might be lected their leader with that piece of "advocacy". ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 21:50:50	@tauriqmoosa ...how should I put this...the cohort of gentlemen who are, ahem, "remarkably keen on lesbian documentary videos"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 21:50:13	@tauriqmoosa Wait...erm...a thought occurs. Wouldn't there be overlap between the cohort that demands "historically accurate" gaming and...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 21:41:47	@tauriqmoosa @noodlemaz @Crommunist But only if, you know, historically accurate. Incidentally, my orc shaman says women are fictional.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 17:53:13	@noodlemaz Dear Churchill! An Foreigner? Or worse, Northern, possibly French? There are no excuses for such things. I shall write to my MP.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 17:48:17	@noodlemaz Someone spoke to you? On a train? Surely that is the greatest UnBritish crime?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 17:32:14	@SidRodrigues As I said to the Indy, I did find his Commons performances tough to masturbate to. Granted, not *impossible*. One does try.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 17:29:07	@AdamRutherford Does the minister also espouse the, allegedly evolutionarily determined, virtues of specific hip to waist ratios?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 17:25:32	@TheIndyPeople @Independent He isn’t? Well, I confess, his Commons performances are tough to masturbate to. I should have realised.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 17:24:06	@boobygraffoe Impressive! casting that will create characters less popular than Jar Jar.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:59:12	@BipolarBlogger Very true. Unless your old socks have evolved to the point where they are grazing on the cress growing from your carpet!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:57:32	@themonkeycage @BBCRadio4 @DaveGorman @alexbellos Calloo Callay!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:57:02	@qikipedia …other e-readers are available. Does this mean a group of puppies in an iPad?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:53:51	@BipolarBlogger @ThisTangledWeb All true, but so so hard to manage I find. I have Inner Hypercritical Bastard!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:50:55	@SabrinaMorgan WORK HARDER! NOT SMARTER! Ah yes, the familiar refrain.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:50:17	@evilfelicity Forgive them. It’s an easy trap to fall into. I suppose my excuse is love of chemistry. It’s a poor excuse. But true.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:49:16	@RevRichardColes A fight in the Peace Tent? What over? Doctrinal interpretation or improper administration of cream onto a scone?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:47:59	@RevRichardColes One thing I do miss is paying attention to the (usually wonderful) feast days. Deeply nostalgic for prep school days.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:45:54	@BipolarBlogger < and you? Sounds like you have a busy day or two ahead.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:45:32	@BipolarBlogger Ah the usual, lots of work, not enough self forgiveness (can preach it, bad at practising it), standard attempt to motivate>
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:38:34	@BipolarBlogger Mornin’!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-07 16:36:18	@laurenlaverne Dammit, I’ve looked at the site now. It’s morally obligatory to buy stuff… …erm apparently.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-06 19:44:05	@stavvers Not enough misogyny? It’s too early! That shit takes effort.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-06 19:43:03	@stavvers Yeah but not all men called Rolf Harris something something FEMINAZI. How did I do?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-06 19:37:44	@CCriadoPerez …in the sense that I understand, not approve. But hissing? What are you trying to say? “Hello I’m voldemort” in parseltongue?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-06 19:36:48	@CCriadoPerez I’m not one of those so no clue but I read yesterday’s tweet and thought it was incredibly sinister and nasty. Lechery I get..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-06 19:34:20	@MCabournSmith Sorry that last tweet contained genuine emotion, I shall now make a series of crass knob jokes to cover it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-06 19:33:46	@MCabournSmith Have a lovely time. Frozen has caused singing in even a bitter, tone deaf git like me. Listening to my 5 yr old son is joyous
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-06 19:30:31	@garwboy But there’s 53 Bayer or Flamsteed classified stars in Cassiopeia… I don’t get it. (Or in other words, it’s bloody good joke!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-06 19:27:43	@stavvers Ah good, a nice level of hate combined with a resigned feeling and moderate despair. I wouldn’t want you to reach Osbourne levels.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-06 19:25:41	@stavvers Gove level of super-hate or merely Teresa May level?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-06 19:24:28	@MarkBucko1 @PFPTMillsy That’s where you went wrong. The tea in Costa’s bloody awful.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 23:43:08	@BipolarBlogger You are actually my hero. Not joking. Serious. I am the Procrastinator, anyone who does anything gets my admiration.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 22:59:26	@bdogrunner Shhh I’m faking it for the sweet sweet life destruction, free career ruin, morbidity, stigma and discrimination… …wait… Shit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 20:33:07	@DocHackenbush Oh you have to do the side quests. Why yes, I am a completionist nightmare, why do you ask?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 20:32:23	@Dr_PaulC It was bad too. It was this: https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=6R4hsN 6snFc … Nasty Girl by Inaya Day. Try doing performance reviews for people after that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:55:35	@DocHackenbush Yeah. I viewed it as very fun rather than massive challenge. Boinging all over the city at the end, super = v good laugh
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:46:18	@DocHackenbush Ah now that I did finish! I feel less guilty. How did you like it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:40:11	@bdogrunner @depressednotsad @rabbitsoup_zola @Peter_Tennant Curses! Foiled by my own abbreviated tweet!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:35:44	@Ermintrude2 I got Teresa May….who is also my MP. I’m just off to stick my head in the oven… …curses! Electric oven.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:32:17	@depressednotsad @bdogrunner @rabbitsoup_zola @Peter_Tennant It’s happening again isn’t it? Twitter Innuendo. Terrifying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:12:21	@Dr_PaulC I got caught sashaying through the lab singing to some hideous pop song the other day. At least you're in the right place.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:10:25	@BipolarBlogger Well, I mean that I never correct myself...too daft! Not that I never make mistakes. Lots of those!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:08:14	@ad_mico @mmbtox Entirely appropriate for a lab environment too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:07:23	@BipolarBlogger Correct? Mistakes? I believe it's *possible*. Never done it myself.... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:06:37	@depressednotsad @bdogrunner @Peter_Tennant @rabbitsoup_zola I've written to my MP to complain. Filth on the Internet. Whatever next?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:05:57	@BipolarBlogger This is also an opportunity to offer these {hugs} and this {solidarity}. Maybe it's the weather! My brain is on strike today
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:04:56	@BipolarBlogger Seconded in toto. I can cope with people on here when lower/slower more than I can in face to face interaction.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:03:54	@NyxyNyx @rabbitsoup_zola Jesus, I'm a bloke and I'd do that! Fine lookin' man flesh there... ...I said that out loud didn't I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:02:50	@Peter_Tennant @bdogrunner @depressednotsad @rabbitsoup_zola I've (almost) been behaving myself. Honestly that allusion never occurred to me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:02:17	@bdogrunner @depressednotsad @rabbitsoup_zola @Peter_Tennant Filth! Call the Victorian Prude Squad! Cover those table legs!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:01:48	@NyxyNyx Superb! I stress I don't work for them in any capacity, they were just really good when I used them. Hope it works out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 19:00:59	@bdogrunner @rabbitsoup_zola @depressednotsad @Peter_Tennant And hiding under desks gibbering.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:57:22	@bdogrunner @depressednotsad @rabbitsoup_zola @Peter_Tennant I too have been Touched By His Noodly Appendage.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:57:07	@depressednotsad @bdogrunner @rabbitsoup_zola @Peter_Tennant Better than them walking in on you... ...oh bugger, that's torn it. Jokes ahoy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:56:33	@NyxyNyx ..and a loads of money off vouchers for Ocado (of all places!), so about a month's free shopping when used carefully
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:56:07	@NyxyNyx You're v welcome. We used them when moving house this time, much of our old stuff died. We got good deals (they can change daily)..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:55:00	@bdogrunner @depressednotsad @rabbitsoup_zola @Peter_Tennant I wish I did. I was an Evangleical Atheist from ~7. Got into lots of bother.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:53:57	@NyxyNyx Have you tried appliances online? They're v good in my exp, and may be able to help you. Also, decent deals occasionally.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:53:25	@depressednotsad @bdogrunner @rabbitsoup_zola @Peter_Tennant That had not gone unnoticed at the time. Qs by boys in class made him flee
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:52:34	@bdogrunner @rabbitsoup_zola @depressednotsad @Peter_Tennant ...and we (grp of 12/13 yr old boys) thought it was hilarious Bad plan school!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:51:39	@bdogrunner @rabbitsoup_zola @depressednotsad @Peter_Tennant ...First discussion of The Subject was done by v embarassed elderly priest....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:50:43	@bdogrunner @rabbitsoup_zola @depressednotsad @Peter_Tennant It's not how I am doing it! It's how it was described in R.E. class at school
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:50:10	@NyxyNyx Oh crap. That IS very annoying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:49:31	@bdogrunner @rabbitsoup_zola @depressednotsad @Peter_Tennant {Hold head} ARGH! Too. Many. Jokes. The Pain. ARGH!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:48:44	@rabbitsoup_zola @bdogrunner @depressednotsad @Peter_Tennant ...and getting that idea out of my head is not going to be easy! 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:48:24	@rabbitsoup_zola @bdogrunner @depressednotsad @Peter_Tennant That's self abuse! Very different. I've never thought self care = That! 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:47:39	@NyxyNyx My washing machine in death throes too. Take them out onto the lawn, burn them, dance about video it, upload to YT, tweet it? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:43:22	@PFPTMillsy I know a bloke who can fix you up with a mince and onion, proper pastry, no messing. Lounge bar of Dog and Duck. Ask for Nosher.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:42:08	@PFPTMillsy {looks about shiftily} I can get you steak and kidney pudding. Just saying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:41:24	@MaidenheadBeer @MaidenheadLocal ARGH! Must stay in house! On diet! This would ruin me! See you in an hour.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:39:44	@bmagnanti Never do this. It's almost like reading YouTube comments. The psychological damamge is immense.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:38:22	@aweebithopeful I am feeling extraordinarily procrastinatory! Which is a baaaaaad thing. Must engage Protestant Work Ethic! And you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:37:20	So, tweeps, twitterati, twittizens and twends, how do I keep myself on the straight and narrow regarding Matters Calorific today?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:34:46	@aweebithopeful Mornin'. Coffee?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:33:22	@debecca @bdogrunner I am banking on a massive lottery win to set up the Mental Health Village talked about the other day here.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:32:32	@bdogrunner You know this means that for half my day I'd have a band playing "Baby Elephant" behind me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:30:17	@bdogrunner And yes, it is a Bugle Minimum situation! ;-) Life should always have appropriate musical accompaniment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:29:42	@bdogrunner If that's the key for you too, then do it. Forgive yourself. Take care of yourself. You'll fight on when the fatigue has passed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:28:57	@bdogrunner I have no advice, I'm no good at this myself. The only thing I need to do is to forgive myself. I suspect it's similar for you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:28:17	@bdogrunner It's bloody horrible isn't it though? You feel rotten, which adds to the fatigue, which means you do less which... ...and so on
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:22:47	@bdogrunner You do deserve it. So there. With bells on!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:22:16	@bdogrunner I know the situation well. Hope everything pans out for you. Tactical retreat to safe ground, to better fight again = good idea.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:19:47	@tkingdoll @CCriadoPerez @drlangtry_girl @ProfBrianCox Prominent feminists, sceptics and physicists debate penis terms...my day is made.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-05 18:17:56	@tkingdoll Since I've been reading your tweets and giggling... ...I exclusively use "knob" (not "nob) when referring to gentleman sausage.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 22:52:13	@oolon But but but blockbot unfreezes their peaches and hurts their Man FeeFees.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 22:02:00	@Jo_Caulfield I’ve heard terrifying things about this new rock and roll music. Perhaps he’ll try that. Oh no…appearance on stage with Quo!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 21:54:29	@Jo_Caulfield Dear lord, the man is so painfully unhip even I notice. And I just used the word “unhip”. Please Labour, give us a prospect!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 19:04:52	@ChrisClose51 @theaceofspuds Pedantry is good! I definitely screwed up the phrasing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 19:01:45	@theaceofspuds @ChrisClose51 Well I am, but I did phrase it inarticulately. I definitely blame an evil conspiracy of no coffee for that ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 18:56:33	@ChrisClose51 Sorry my knackered brain repaced "think" with "doubt". Dammit I know what I meant! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 18:54:18	@ChrisClose51 Not remotely. In fact I did wonder what was being "buried" this time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 18:01:53	@martin_crowson @LeicesterTigers @premrugby Ooooh nice! Big finish!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 17:38:43	@bmagnanti And the McDonaldses on every street corner. It is to be envied by every devoted Wimpyist out there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 17:36:30	@bmagnanti And indeed, spread democracy. Of course the traditional British manner is via flags and racism. But that's v 18thC now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 17:33:09	@bmagnanti And a Merry Apple Pie to you! (Is that the right way to celebrate it? I never know.)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-04 03:18:49	Diet be hanged. I am committing the sin of special fried rice. I have ordered double bacon to rub all over myself for good measure. Dammit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-03 23:37:25	@alibali50 @suzanne_moore Oh you know how to hurt a boy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 23:51:37	@WhySharksMatter I've fallen in love with people for less than that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 19:26:21	@depressednotsad @lady_abs @gravbeast @bdogrunner Professio..? Never heard of it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 19:20:38	@edyong209 And not just that, this success, can you believe it, is used as an excuse to UNDERfund science. Can you see my mind boggling?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 19:19:38	@depressednotsad @lady_abs @gravbeast @bdogrunner Ahhh yes. I am reading twitter to avoid meetings! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 19:12:15	@depressednotsad @lady_abs @gravbeast @bdogrunner Phew! I was worried our banter was upsetting/annoying. I'm glad it turned out to be useful
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 19:00:02	@lady_abs @gravbeast @bdogrunner @depressednotsad HA! I assure you my passions are strictly tweed based. It was not I who mentioned "ankles"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:58:36	@gravbeast @bdogrunner @lady_abs @depressednotsad We're veering dangerously towards unseemly! There may be Innuendo Afoot.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:57:45	@gravbeast @bdogrunner @lady_abs @depressednotsad A not unreasonable degree, surely?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:55:40	@differentdela1 @gravbeast @bdogrunner @depressednotsad Come to think of it, I'm not sure. {Beetles off to tailors}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:54:40	@gravbeast @bdogrunner @lady_abs @depressednotsad I demand satisfaction. We're back to "valet territory" again aren't we? :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:54:13	@gravbeast @bdogrunner @lady_abs @depressednotsad is entirely appropriate for a gentleman of my position and proclivities. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:53:49	@gravbeast @bdogrunner @lady_abs @depressednotsad And just what are you suggesting? I will have you know my relationship with my valet 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:51:38	@gravbeast @bdogrunner @lady_abs @depressednotsad @LouisRedux Has my good name been bandied carelessly? Are extra Xs attributed to me? Tsk!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:49:58	@bdogrunner @lady_abs @gravbeast @depressednotsad Of course. I also had my valet thrash me with a stout birch stick until I was duly sorry.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:45:34	@bdogrunner @lady_abs @gravbeast @depressednotsad I saw an ankle once. I reported such wantonness to my Member of Parliament immediately.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:44:51	@gravbeast ...to inform them that they bally well better straigten up and fly right. Can't have them getting Ideas. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:44:16	@gravbeast Absolutely. A tricky thing to manage. However, if hoi polloi are getting out of the place, it is the duty of a gentleman 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:43:23	@gravbeast Quite. Quite. {twirls stick}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:42:29	@bdogrunner @gravbeast @depressednotsad Very true, very true. However I meant something more serious than that place: The cricket ground.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:41:49	@gravbeast Look? At another person? Only if you are of the Lower Social Orders. Dependent on class one may Remonstrate with the Transgressor
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:40:39	@bdogrunner @depressednotsad Ah phew. In that case you have Harmless Eccentricities and can be permitted to enter Lords.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:39:55	@gravbeast @bdogrunner @depressednotsad That is true. And that must only be demonstrated by a disapproving stare. Possibly a "tsk".

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:31:28	@bdogrunner @depressednotsad I actually have to stop myself using Wodehousian language and restrain my deep desire for tweed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:31:01	@bdogrunner @depressednotsad I'm only English-ish at best but boarding school influences have lingered. I can act like a Wodehouse character

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-07-02 18:16:41	@copland73 @PhDisabled That said, the "closet" is not difficult part. It's inconvenient and occasional stressor. 4/increasingly inaccurate 2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-30 00:48:56	@idavidro @lousycanuck I've been doing this to anything disturbing for years. It resulted in a quite spectacular drinking habit. ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:31:24	@jourdemayne Ooooh now THAT is international standard. And I can do it whilst looking at the books I'm meant to be making notes on.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:30:51	@scalzi Is there any one of your enemies who can match you? I'm thinking the things that make them your enemies render them incompetent
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:29:43	@jourdemayne I do feel that spice organisation needs to be included in the halls of Olympic level procrastination. Also, my office: Tidy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:27:14	@leighalexander NOOOO! FIGHT THE POWER!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:26:51	@jourdemayne It's one of my favourites.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:26:24	@BipolarBlogger Brilliant. And it is a recoverable change if problems arise. And everyone I know, you'll be most careful and responsible
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:24:24	@BipolarBlogger Ah. Yes. Well. That! It was a suggestion...just not a very good one! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:23:23	@jourdemayne I'm just not sure if I should be ashamed or proud.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:23:10	@jourdemayne ..I sorted spices by principle flavour molecule and natural product class (LOTS OF TERPENOIDS!) 2/2 #Chemistry #procrastination

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:18:48	@oolon Shotgun, caffeine, constant vigillance. Minimum. Electrifying the tree also an option.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:16:35	@BipolarBlogger Yeah, that will take time and super human patience.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:14:24	@BipolarBlogger That's what I was worried about! I wanted to check if typo and thus blatant insanity or reasonable change and thus fine!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:12:05	@BipolarBlogger 3.33%! Yeah you can recover from THAT drop. Do you mean 33.3%?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:09:09	@BipolarBlogger I do not blame you one little bit. I'd be terrified.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:07:01	@BipolarBlogger After all, presenting the docs with a successful fait accomplis would not be so bad... ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 23:05:37	@BipolarBlogger To any other person I'd trot out the standard "under supervision" line. But a) you know it, and b) you're better informed...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:56:34	@BipolarBlogger I know. I can be a proper serious grown up too. Honest. I just like really, really feeble jokes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:55:50	@bugsbunney @realscientists Fantastic! I feel a bit ashamed at my intensely minor contributions! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:25:57	@davidschneider That is an immensely wonderful joke. Never be ashamed of it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:24:49	@BipolarBlogger Yes, why yes I am.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:22:45	@BipolarBlogger @bdogrunner I worry abt this in all parts of life. I HATE unintentionally upsetting people. Intentionally? Different! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:20:49	@BipolarBlogger WAH YOU HATE ME!!!!! Okay, you're forgiven ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:15:20	@BipolarBlogger {Hugs} That's a tough decision you're facing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:14:25	@realscientists My point being that, of course in capitalist soc there are winners/losers, but this is opportunity not neessarily doom eyc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:13:55	@realscientists Again, scientist not businessperson/economist, but isn't diversifying one's business, getting in early etc generally good?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:04:58	@realscientists Not found an analysis of those yet! Fuzz stays on my face with all the electrics I've tried.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:02:31	@realscientists The idea that pro-environment/anti-CC measures are all poor economics/anti-business is a horrendous lie. One easily bought.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 22:01:53	@realscientists That's one of the most astonishing things to me. There is a serious, excellent business case to make in majority of cases.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 21:59:51	@realscientists I love finding little analyses that demonstrate how simple things we take for granted can be imporved/altered for the better

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 19:35:38	@BipolarBlogger @NyxyNyx @rabbitsoup_zola My school matron was TERRIFYING. And was also taught similar skills by a brigadier. Bad combo!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 19:32:54	@BipolarBlogger @NyxyNyx @rabbitsoup_zola including the 10p trick and proper hospital corners. See also: ironing. I’m scarily domestic!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 19:31:36	@BipolarBlogger @NyxyNyx @rabbitsoup_zola Part of youth in boarding school. I make beds that a harsh 1950s hospital matron would approve of!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 19:24:42	@rabbitsoup_zola We’re setting dangerously productive precedents. Something like work might happen….
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 19:22:37	@rabbitsoup_zola Even more terrifying, is I am thinking of skating to the shops….worrying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 19:21:33	@rabbitsoup_zola You’re inspiring me with caffeinated temptations. I am close to going from pit to shower, shower to shops, shops to kettle
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 19:12:30	@MsJackMonroe 1) because you expose their drivel so they attack 2) may the funds to do so descend upon you should you wish! 3) love the book
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 19:03:43	@rabbitsoup_zola Yes. But for a price. Oh no wait, just yes! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 19:02:50	@rabbitsoup_zola Hahaha! I am still on my bed. I’m winning…. ….okay not sure what I’m winning, but gimme a break! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 18:53:29	@rabbitsoup_zola @NyxyNyx Should we have a lie-in-athon? See who leaves their bed last?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 18:52:57	@rabbitsoup_zola @NyxyNyx I’ve slacked off this morning too. Meant to be up and working, had lie in due to wife and son being away for w/end
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 18:51:55	@BipolarBlogger @NyxyNyx @rabbitsoup_zola Are boys allowed, separate wing of the village obvs? Because I need fluffy towel/hot shower too
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 06:50:21	@AndrewCollins Hell yes!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 06:49:06	@DocHackenbush But but the curiously modern dance scenes and Bowie-esque Knight action….
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 06:44:10	@DocHackenbush Best. Film. Ever. For given values of “best” and “ever”

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 06:39:57	@FuzzCookies Pedicures are SO METAL!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 06:38:01	@DrJaneChi @hollybrocks @oolon Holy crap that is horrendous.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 01:30:41	@FuzzCookies When it comes to pubes, I’m old school… …wait that didn’t come out right
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 01:29:55	@FuzzCookies I’ve always used a magic 8 ball.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 01:28:44	@garwboy I’ve always maintained that if it’s a prime number you’re good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 01:28:03	@alicemeat My apologies. I’ll go and sit in the corner and think about what I have done.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 01:27:30	@kokupuff @ingdamnit I… Okay no. That’s it. I’m hallucinating. Who put special mushrooms in my tea?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 01:26:14	@alicemeat There’s a Big Ears/handle joke in here somewhere but I am far too polite to make it. Honest. No. Really. Maybe.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 00:01:57	@christheneck I think this is a terrible sectarian schism that could develop. Where do you stand on Tuscany?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 00:01:25	@TheAngryFangirl I feel that to be a minimal and reasonable response
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-29 00:00:13	@ImprobableJoe @lousycanuck Well you see there are words that really irrationally upset people so they complain about minor...wait..oh shit!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:55:42	@TheAngryFangirl I saw this. No good can come from him learning the words.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:54:37	@ashleyfmiller @Giliell I'm with you. I'm a tactic pluralist. They're all worth trying
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:53:43	@christheneck That is good middeclassing, but if it didn't involve an Aga or a fish kettle you're so far behind! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:51:20	@Giliell @ashleyfmiller Have no fear, I am feeling optimistic, not suicidal! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:51:03	@BipolarBlogger My fingers are crossed for you! I am a fan of the "minimum therapeutic intervention"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:50:13	@Giliell @ashleyfmiller One can but hope that reason will appeal...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:46:59	@sazza_jay @stavvers Me either. We have been conditioned away from it. O tempura o morays. Or something
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:45:45	@suey_park @bullhorngirl All things are made better by empathetic, anthropomorphised tubers. All things.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:44:01	@stavvers @sazza_jay You needed to take of the sunglasses and meaningfully break the fourth wall. Minimum.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:32:43	@BoyGeorge Taxi. Restaurant. Immense drunkenness and food indulgence. You deserve it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:31:28	@BipolarBlogger Previously I have beaten myself up and got mentally iffy. This time I am being v sensible. By virtue of hard won experience
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:31:01	@BipolarBlogger Bodies: Tchoh! I'm not happy with my size, and still healthy enough to do something. No excuses but forgiveness and effort.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:30:09	@BipolarBlogger As sins go it is quite saintly. I'm being Very Good though, so anything enjoyable is wicked. ;-) (Forgive self mockery)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:27:00	@BipolarBlogger My Food Sins are currently crap. I'm getting my lardiness under control. Difficult but worth it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:26:38	@BipolarBlogger {whispers} I have made a home made burger I am going to grill later. Shhhhh.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:15:14	@SpokesGay Learned about lesbians today too. They oppress me by not respecting Mah Peen Based Man FeeFees! Y U NO LOVE MAH PEEN MAN FEEFEES?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 23:13:57	@BNarJohnson @GeorgeTakei I wish I'd made it up. I'm just not that funny. Hence why I think the profs did it on purpose.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 22:14:10	@GeorgeTakei It MUST have been deliberate
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 22:13:59	@GeorgeTakei I took analytical chemistry with Profs Colon + Keister No word of a lie. Posters read "Profs Colon and Keister Anal Chem Class"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 22:11:33	@mrjamesob It's been used to great effect in past. I, for example, had my nuclear warheads clumsily run into by a series of Pacific islands.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 22:03:46	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola I was disgusted and outraged... ...to have missed an opportunity to lower the tone myself! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 17:53:16	@debecca @alicemeat @BipolarBlogger @bdogrunner @aweebithopeful @rabbitsoup_zola I genuinely couldn't do it. I'd find it too tough
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 17:52:54	@debecca @alicemeat @BipolarBlogger @bdogrunner @aweebithopeful @rabbitsoup_zola Very much so for me too I think you're brave for being open

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 17:45:41	@BipolarBlogger @alicemeat @debecca @bdogrunner @aweebithopeful @rabbitsoup_zola And therein lies just one problem. Tough to talk about....

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 17:35:58	@bdogrunner @aweebithopeful @rabbitsoup_zola It's a topic of interest to me too. Erm from a writing perspective. Honest! And yes, v taboo!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 17:31:31	@LeftFootFwd Come on, most of them can't SPELL "email". Rarely have I encountered such a bunch of troglodytic know-nothings.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 17:30:00	@MiggyMoonbeam @rabbitsoup_zola I find a Choccy Digestive Intervention is a minimum first step. I can progress to Serious Bacon on a bad day
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 17:29:19	@TheNewslo Love the site! Really love the "show facts feature", excellent satire.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 15:35:23	@marcuschown One doesn’t try to impress UKIP, one whaps them on the nose with a rolled up newspaper and utters a firm “No! Bad racists!”.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-28 04:10:52	@debecca Said in a good way or does said date need to meet an ugly end as part of a motorway flyover? I know some people…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-26 00:12:58	@soozaphone @AdamRutherford Sacked? Such crimes deserves flaying. Minimum. I've been watching too much Game of Thrones.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-26 00:07:40	@SidRodrigues The knowledge that you could buy a cheese off the bassist nowadays? Because I like cheese and so this makes me smile.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 17:55:36	@paulcoxon The reason I ask, and this is not criticism, is I found a genuinely different attitude/pressure during PhD. I wonder if it…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 17:54:18	@paulcoxon For example: performance reviews, care of kit, meetings etc. I.e. Things beyond the lab work.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 04:15:17	@KayVDickinson @fight4uk @voftheppl Oh yes! And seriously, thanks! I've been in "Sarcy Prick" mode all day, so hard to return! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 04:07:24	@KayVDickinson @fight4uk @voftheppl Either way, it seems like a reasonable thing to me. Oh no! I must be a MONSTER!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 04:06:42	@KayVDickinson @fight4uk @voftheppl Thanks for letting me know (I hate to say it but I did already know. It's what I was hinting at with qs)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 03:53:59	The music to @bobbyllew 's Carpool is causative of joyous feelings. It has formed a strong memory that wonderful is about to happen.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 03:51:08	@TheOrlandoJones @JenLucPiquant Ro No! #RIPCaseyKasem
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 03:48:46	@ShappiKhorsandi Woohoo! (Bookmarked)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 03:23:34	@MitchBenn Surely if you could blow your own trumpet you could find work in specialist films... ...I'm going to stop now. I'm deeply sorry.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 03:22:53	@MitchBenn It takes massive balls... ...to post a picture like that to Twitter
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 03:02:40	@mndsci It exists: http://www. chm.bris.ac.uk/sillymolecules /sillymols.htm … Kind of! Enjoy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:55:50	I'm not sure I have a face left to palm. Mind you, I made a mean risotto for my wife and son whilst mocking. And risotto is EUROPEAN!! ZOMG!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:55:11	There's wilfully stupid, wilfully fucking stupid, and UKIPists. Jesus the one I've just been mocking is a stupid bastard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:45:16	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Here's a question: Should a non-UK embassy (durr!) in the UK fly the flag of that non-UK nation?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:44:25	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl You do like lying don't you? Any thoughts on what I'm a traitor too yet? Still too scared to mention it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:44:00	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl And AGAIN you're lying. I never said anything about support. I said I don't buy your claims and context is needed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:43:36	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Do I support extremism (esp religious) of any kind in schools: Absolutely not under any circumstances. Clear.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:41:44	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl And what do I support? What I said was your claim is not established by that photo.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:41:08	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Agree with what?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:39:19	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Either way you can't answer my questions can you. Even one so pathetic as you is too scared to be that nakedly racist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:38:48	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl That would be a tricky thing to accomplish!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:37:28	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Haha! I don't know, you tell me. You're the one who brought it up. What were you thinking about specifically?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:34:21	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Not beleiving your spin =/= support. Are you too stupid to grasp that? And yes: SPELL IT OUT! Let me see.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:32:46	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Awww, but I thought we were falling in love. What am I a traitor to? Let the dog see the rabbit, come on out and say it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:31:44	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Still can't answer about what I'm a traitor to eh? Bwark bwark bwark.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:30:25	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Well I didn't vote for that liar. Try again. Different set of liars! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:29:48	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Ready to tell me what I am a traitor to yet? I can't answer if I don't know. Or are you scared to bare ur naked racism?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:28:53	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl My lovely little Kipper, I wouldn't trust you to sit the right way around on a toilet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:28:22	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl So not believing your fearmongering and xenophobia = support. Wow! That is some powerful stupid from you, well done
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:26:59	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Also, not the Perople's Front of Judea. Or The Judean People's Front. Or the Popular Front...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:26:22	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Hint: Not UKIP.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:26:13	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl And WHAT support? Lack of YOUR kneejerk xeonophobia, hate and fearmongering? That's not support, that's having a brain.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:25:44	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl I can't answer can I? I don't know what I am a traitor TO. Tell me, what am I a traitor to?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:24:54	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl This is what I love about UKIPists, shallow as a puddle of lukewarm spit. Hence why I generally just laugh at you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:24:10	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Also are you really too unimaginative to think of a legitimate reason/context in which that flag could be flown?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:23:12	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Are you too afraid to answer: What am I a traitor to? Come on, you said it. Your word, not mine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:22:46	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl I never said that. I said the claim (fearmongering) you are trying to establish is not done by that photo.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:21:53	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Not a fan of Halal/Kosher slaughter, no. Traitor to WHAT? Answer it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:18:53	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Explain how it's wrong. As I said can you really think of no legitimate context in which a non UK flag could fly in UK?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:16:45	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Still not answered my question. What am I a traitor to? You made the claim, back it up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:16:25	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Again demonstrating that you can't see past your own bigotry. I don't share your hate so I must be the thing you hate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:15:28	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Flying a non-UK flag (for unspecified reasons) in the UK is a moral issue is it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:14:41	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Gotta ask, how is this related to a non-UK flag being flown (for unspecified reasons) in the UK?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:12:22	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl No fo course not. This is an abomination. Whoever does it, wherever it's done. Did you expect different?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:10:24	@Voftheppl I confess I have a hard time taking UKIPists seriously at all. Oppose them seriouly, yes. Also laugh like a drain at them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:08:44	@Voftheppl Wait til I tell this UKIPist I just made risotto (FOREIGN MUCK) for my multiethnic family whilst laughing at him/her. HEADSPLODE
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:06:06	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Which since you have to lie about public tweets and rely on the cupidity of people disposed to hate is amusing
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:04:58	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl More lies! Your claim is not established by the flying of that flag. You're scaremongering for small minded xenophobes
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 02:01:36	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl You are welcome to ask, just like I am welcome to laugh at you. So enlighten me, what am I a traitor to?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:59:39	@noodlemaz MInd you I *am* mocking a UKIPist at the mo. So my own advice needs to be heeded!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:58:08	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl HAHAHAHAHAHA! Oh THAT, THAT is the dog’s bollocks of fuckwittery. Well played, very well played. Traitor to what?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:54:27	@CCriadoPerez Although when it comes to the rugby I will profoundly disagree! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:53:53	@noodlemaz There is finite time for each of us, and near infinite fuckwittery. Good decision! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:50:38	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl HAHA quote mining? Oh you are precious!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:48:51	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl …bolster your rather obvious and nonsensical bigotry is transparent, and very funny. Never forget your clown shoes. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:48:08	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Some Commonwealth celebration perhaps. Who knows. Either way, your context free, evidence free assertions to … 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:44:47	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Perhaps because people a re too busy laugh at you? Like I am.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:44:14	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl I said one thing does not establish the other. Also, can you really think of no legitimate reason to fly another flag?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:43:08	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl What I find the most laughable about you Kipper chappies is that you have to lie to maintain your outrage. It’s funny
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:41:31	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Is that what I said?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:41:13	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Well obviously no, as you could have easily worked out from my first tweet. Classy dishonesty from you. British value?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:38:23	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Wow! That was dishonest! I said it doesn’t matter regarding your previous photo tweet. One does not prove the other.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:34:18	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Real or fake does it matter? Does it prove what you claim? No. No excuses, just no tolerance for your xenophobic panic
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 01:23:47	@Fight4UK @Voftheppl Awww lookit hurt FeeFees! Sweetums, you made no argument. Nice try.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 00:21:03	@Fight4UK 1) The Islamic god is the same one you (presumably) worship. 2) Either way it's fictional. Cope. 3) Wow! Much racism. So bigot!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 00:18:07	@Voftheppl @Fight4UK Wow! Spectacuracist! This is not mere closet racism, this is full fat, double sugar, luxury racism.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-16 00:13:28	@OsamaBinSwagger @sazza_jay Either that or a sodding great rolled up newspaper to whap IDS on the nose with whilst uttering a firm "No!".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-15 22:24:23	@maxkeiser @wildwalkerwoman NOW?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-15 22:23:51	@jephjacques The puns in Angewante Chemie just get better. And by better I mean much worse. So much worse they're back around to good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:59:05	@LewisMoody7 Agreed on the centres. Who benches behind Vunipola at 8? Morgan? Haskell?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:48:23	@miketindall13 Never been the favourite pundit of many a Tigers fan. Can’t imagine why…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:46:55	@brianmoore666 You can stripped or drop the ball easier with one hand… …I’ve misunderstood haven’t I? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:44:37	@g3reth @BipolarBlogger Good luck! Optimistic: It can happen. Realistic: keep an eye on yourself! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:43:34	@BipolarBlogger @g3reth Yup. Same experience. Forced myself back to work + everything early on, massive downturn months later
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:42:47	@g3reth @BipolarBlogger problems are impossible. People do “recover”, but more luck than judgement sometimes. 2\2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:41:45	@g3reth @BipolarBlogger Yup. It is possible to bias things towards your favour a little with self care etc, but lunacy to pretend the 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:38:30	@LewisMoody7 Burns on earlier/starting, Manu 13 nailed on + build around him, Haskell bench, Ben Smith converted to Englishman ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:33:31	@g3reth @BipolarBlogger method over the last 7 years and things went what can only be described as Spectacuwrong! 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:32:48	@g3reth @BipolarBlogger Just a bit! I’ve taken a long time to build back up to work and other things. I tried my usual DO ALL THE THINGS 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:30:36	@tigersunoffy Maybe for 5 mins of it….
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:30:18	@g3reth @BipolarBlogger NOTHING!!! Or that’s what I’m telling myself. ;-) Mind you, I definitely am waiting for the other shoe to drop.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:28:46	@davidflatman Me too. And Manu in the centres, dammit!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:28:22	@CharlieFelix @tigersunoffy He has quality Retrospectacles.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:23:49	@alastaireykyn For me Manu is first name on team sheet in the backs. Nailed at 13, build around him, not other way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:21:41	@danbowden_ I hope so. Two losses to a very very good NZ on NZ soil, both within a score. 6N and last test are litmus test for me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:20:29	@WomenDefyUKIP Very, very much yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:19:59	@Cornish_Buddha Oroit moi ansum. Pasty and a pint for brekky?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:16:49	@tigersunoffy NO COMMENT! Okay some comment: Bugger!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:16:17	@davidflatman @nick_easter Has also started to spit dummy (again). Burns should have been on 20 mins ago
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:14:42	@brianmoore666 I think NZ have feared us less because of lack of Tuilagi in midfield, he’s been too far from action. Build backs around Manu
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:12:28	@call_me_cockers I’m having a sulk, should be Manu/Eastmond or Manu/Allen. Burrell bounced off 90% of NZ, 36 some good runs, some shockers
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:02:56	@tigersunoffy And LB just got tucked up again in a tackle
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 17:02:29	@tigersunoffy I am spitting blood. Burrell/36 have done a lot of good, but Eastmond/Manu did great work last week. Team should build on Manu
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 16:59:19	Buggeration. #NZvENG
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-14 16:57:55	@IamAustinHealey Yes please. And Burns on for Petulant Fazlet at the end of the bin. He’s spat his dummy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-13 09:50:42	@wilw @ApostasyPanda The temptation to ask "how do you know?" is strong. What frightens me is you might take me seriously and link examples

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 23:49:26	@TheAngryFangirl People for whom my accent makes me a Proper Human, but my skin colour and Funny Surname seems to confuse the issue. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 23:48:42	@TheAngryFangirl After all, admittedly I'm in the UK, and thus met surprisingly few Klan members. Quite a few "Polite Racists" though. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 23:47:50	@oolon I am also curious. What will the Fedora Count be....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 23:46:31	@TheAngryFangirl More dangerous in my view. MLK's "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" puts it better than I've ever seen elsewhere.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 23:45:26	@hoperiffic I blooming well hope so. I want this According To The Book (Does sign of the Seven). Very much so. Very very much so.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 23:41:47	@oolon I have Secret Ways Of Knowing. Dark Ways.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 23:40:19	@GameOffThrones_ We Smug Book Readers all know the death I'm talking about don't we? I WANT IT! Or IS THERE a death? It's GRRM. There is!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 23:38:24	@oolon MRACon? SRS BSNS! {SRS BSNS face} Will it be dominated by: a) Women = evil. WAH! PLS FUCK ME! b) Unique issues pertaining to men
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 23:33:01	@oolon Are you mocking MRAs AGAIN!? Haven't their FeeFees been hurt ENOUGH? Will no one think of the FeeFees?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 21:07:31	@reneewebs Sorry, I just have to go and stroke a white cat and mutter things about POWER.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 21:06:52	@reneewebs Of course now I'm the boss, they sing the song about me! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 21:05:36	@reneewebs Of course the chorus was "Let Me Be..."!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 21:04:56	@reneewebs It was intended as a purely comedy song though, btw. A laugh, not a complaint.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 21:04:18	@reneewebs X is 2 syllable first name of PhD boss from lo those many years ago. Bit of a tyrant. We got on well, but his people skills = BAD
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 21:03:16	@reneewebs I'm struggling to remember all the lyrics, but the 1st line ran "When I find myself in times of trouble X comes and bollocks me"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 20:59:30	@reneewebs ...to the tune of "Let It Be". To do with the his convenient appearance during times of bad results to be "helpful"! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 20:58:18	@reneewebs I do exactly the same thing with songs/poems. So we're dorks together on this one. Did a rather poignant one about my PhD boss...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 20:52:40	@reneewebs These are brilliant! I'm laughing...occasionally with bitter recognition! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 20:38:46	@garwboy I genuinely think this is the best thing to do. There will ALWAYS be uninformed critics. Good criticism is wonderful but poor S/N
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 20:32:20	@Whoozley Or is it, again: "really nasty bigot defines religion as their own really nasty bigotry. Complains when called on it.". Oh. It is
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 20:31:05	@Whoozley Oh no! Are Christians being persecuted again? With their guaranteed representation in the Lords, established church and wealth?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 18:09:56	@DocHackenbush Everyone dies... ...except Arya Stark. Ahhhhhh post meme regurgitation bliss.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 18:06:42	@bdogrunner a) now. I hate an unsatisfied curiosity
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 18:05:44	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola WEIRD = GUD There, your internet fact for the day. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 00:21:15	@sousan50 Not sure I want anyone to suffer, just that the fickle fingers of Fate are...erm...fickle. Ironically. Thought that through well!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 00:17:12	@hyperdeath128k @stavvers ...and worst of all: Hurt FeeFees. DO YOU KNOW HOW HURT THE FEEFEES WILL BE!? DO YOU!!!!? 3/v large value of 2.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 00:16:26	@hyperdeath128k @stavvers ...girls go into treehouses it can cause dogs and cats to live together, the downfall of Western Civilisation 2/3
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 00:15:52	@hyperdeath128k @stavvers Oh you see it's more than that. That's just biology, merely one reason girls are rubbish. Sociologically if...1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 00:13:05	@hyperdeath128k @stavvers Oh and that they especially are not allowed in the treehouse.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 00:12:46	@hyperdeath128k @stavvers I am Doctor of Boy Sciencology. I can prove with paper and pen that boys did everything cool and girls smell.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 00:10:56	@stavvers You win the internet. Collect your mammoth from the desk. Just don't hunt it because you're a girl.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 00:09:40	@stavvers Based on previous tweets from me there is a joke combining the words "mammoth" and "genitals" but I just can't see it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 00:08:34	@stavvers Either way, my loos aren't going to be infested with girls pretending to be mammoths or something. I'm wondering if I'm confused
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 00:07:42	@stavvers Whoa...mammoths aren't blue? How did we hunt them?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-10 00:06:28	@stavvers But but pink berries for ladies to gather and apparently mammoths are blue to be hunted by men! And stuff!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-09 23:43:09	@paulcoxon Isn't not knowing a failing offence? Double viva, no free beer afterwards?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-09 23:40:54	Rik Mayall dies, IDS lives. No justice.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-09 23:24:13	@MissObdurate @TheAngryFangirl That is astounding. You can hear the fedora.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-09 18:59:39	@BipolarBlogger Ah good! I've occasionally found down {ahem} "too easy". That WAS when "tired and emotional" however! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-09 18:55:28	@BipolarBlogger Urgh, the Tube can be really unpleasant when you're not at 100%.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-09 18:55:00	@BipolarBlogger Have you got somewhere safe for a few minutes sit down if you need it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-09 18:54:45	@BipolarBlogger I can imagine! I get different issues when out and about (probably familiar tho), I would hate to add that to the mix.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-09 18:49:56	@UNHCRUK {Waves} Morning! Keep up the good work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-09 18:49:36	@BipolarBlogger Horrible thing to have happen in all seriousness. I have a friend who's claustrophobic, similar result, different cause.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-09 18:48:55	@BipolarBlogger Pissed AGAIN? At this time of day. Shocking. I'm phoning my MP and sending the BBC the bill etc. (Seriously tho, you okay?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-08 23:02:18	@thriftybits @WomenDefyUKIP Very possible. After all the back of my fridge was the back of a magic fridge in the magic realm...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-08 22:54:21	@WomenDefyUKIP @thriftybits I cleaned behind my fridge and found a portal to a magical realm. Tragically no sluts lieved there. Crap realm.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-08 22:25:38	@WomenDefyUKIP I've given most of them a good try, but sadly to no avail. I get no sympathy I tells ya! ;-) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-08 22:25:13	@WomenDefyUKIP I never understood that Bloom gaffe. After all, there are more {ahem} traditional routes to being a slut, I understand. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-08 22:21:37	@WomenDefyUKIP Make sure you clean behind your fridge. Otherwise...well...you know. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-08 22:20:34	@_GRRM_ I hope you're talking about the "sacrifice" I'm thinking of. I've been waiting for this, and very much want it to follow the books.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-08 21:54:46	@DocHackenbush I also demand this is done by the Ministeer For Housinge (note spelling) personally to all poors, layabouts and scroungers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-08 21:53:55	@DocHackenbush I feel most strongly this is the logical step up from a firm "no!" and swatting them on the nose with a rolled up newspaper.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-08 21:53:22	@DocHackenbush I'm in favour of individually poking people in the eye with a pointed stick. Not any specific group of people, you understand
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-07 05:15:52	@healthyaddict Tweet loads of photos to make me EVEN MORE ENVIOUS!!!! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 23:13:58	@dorolfe Nooooo!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 23:12:50	@dorolfe Ewwww naughty persons!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 23:11:14	@dorolfe If you missed Firelands, I reckon it was great. MInd you I did my best raiding there!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 23:10:43	@dorolfe Nice! I never really saw the old WoW properly. Only as high level "tourist"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 23:08:21	@dorolfe ...to keep raid spot. Which is fine, but work. And drama filled tragically.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 23:08:01	@dorolfe struggled to find it ever again. Server had LOTS of top players, so guilds could afford to boot people. This meant lots of effort..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 23:06:58	@dorolfe Ah a long term core group was what I missed. I had it on one server, it was grand. Moved to more competitive server when guild died
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 23:05:50	@dorolfe Impressive. We did ~12 hrs raiding, but it was the >12 hrs on top of that of min/maxing, resource gathering etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 23:04:50	@dorolfe ...it became a LOT of work to raid high end. And it was just a ridiculous time investment for me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 23:04:25	@dorolfe Joined at very end of WotLK, raided all of Cata. Dragon Soul raids burned me out. Too much guild/human drama to do a simple job...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 23:01:43	@dorolfe Yup. I bought MOP, subbed for 3 months, levelled toons...remembered why I burned out spectacularly. Quit again!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 22:56:04	@dorolfe Is it any good?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 22:54:20	@dorolfe Same reasons here. But teh temptation...the temptation....ohhhh the temptation
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 22:52:33	@dorolfe ...but I want to see WoD and raid again and....I'm clearly losing what tiny bit remains of my mind
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 22:51:59	@dorolfe It's weird isn't it? I know how much I'll hate the grind, I know I don't have time, I know that raider drama is unavoidable...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 21:31:50	I need help. I have no sub, I have almost deleted my toons, but some part of me constantly wants to restart WoW. I know the pain. WHY!?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 21:13:42	@FlossieTeacake @Dr_Teacake Tragically not, to the best of my knowledge. But I know the technique. I will witness Dish Evolution in my life.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 21:12:23	@FlossieTeacake @WCNchris And lo! On the fifth day there was Chinese food eaten from trays. On the 6th day, the washing up evolved sentience
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 21:10:14	@FlossieTeacake @WCNchris Oh WOW! That is SPECTACUBAD! On so many levels that is bad. Fractally bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 21:06:29	@FlossieTeacake @WCNchris It might. I'm unproductively procrastinating. I need to emulate your procrastination methods!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-06 21:03:33	@FlossieTeacake My name is Envy! :-) Enjoy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 23:11:07	@sneakinhysteria Thanks for coming last night. Hope to see you and @uanrah at future events. I was too cowardly to try my schoolboy German!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 22:05:04	@EmmaK67 Except? Surely all the truly great dinner parties have had a "likely death by large predatory cat" course?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 22:04:05	@MarkOneinFour Yes. Nice easy one. What next? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 22:03:36	Today has been grim. I go now to pick up my 5 year old son in the hopes of it improving massively.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 19:50:20	@DocHackenbush Good call! I understand the football literally never ends. I used the word "literally" for extra evil.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 19:48:04	@DocHackenbush That said, what football thing? I don't understand.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 19:47:49	@DocHackenbush To be fair being angry about the Mail and Gove is entirly reasonable and a decent measure of a person's sanity.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 18:28:49	@FuzzCookies This tweet has made my day for inexplicable reasons. Granny Whiff FTW!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 18:27:22	@marcusbrig I dunno. My psychiatrist thinks things like that are hilarious. All the way to the bank apparently. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 17:45:33	@Herring1967 Wonderful. I shall arrange an expenditure with the bank!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 17:39:44	@Herring1967 Apropos of my curiosity, is RHLSTP Series 6 a possibility?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-05 17:09:22	@tessakendall Indeed. I've always known my toned and muscular physique was related to my intellect. Tragically just not in the way I want!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-04 23:49:17	Okay, I am supremely busy. It may be time to procrastinate unto self destruct.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-04 15:02:56	@BipolarBlogger @debecca 1) Have several nights bad sleep, 2) See it start to affect mood, 3) Take sleeping pill, 4) feel like shite.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-04 14:47:15	@BipolarBlogger @debecca Tired ladies, you have my sympathies, I'm in the same boat today. IT'S A CONSPIRACY!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-06-02 00:34:57	@BrianODriscoll You too can have a body like mine... ...if you're not careful!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 21:04:19	@DocHackenbush I DISAGREE! Surely he is a colossal cockwomble. The alliteration makes it truthier.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 20:57:21	@debecca @BipolarBlogger Revisiting this to tell Teh Wurld! When depressed, the ability to "do well" just is not there. It's a physical lack
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 20:01:13	@pzmyers Of course. Thanks for considering it. I know the trip's part holiday and part you being v busy. Whatever you can fit would be grand
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:59:13	@g3reth @debecca @BipolarBlogger ...so many external (and internal) messages are stupid, nasty and ignorant
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:58:53	@g3reth @debecca @BipolarBlogger It's not always bad to hear the same things if they're sincere and pleasant. Makes a nice change tbh...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:44:28	@debecca Ah. Important.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:43:42	@debecca News of sudden death can trigger cats? Well maybe but... ...I've misunderstood haven't I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:42:52	@pzmyers As I imagine your talk dance card will be heavily marked, the last option is very refusable!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:42:27	@pzmyers If I was to offer all sorts of blandishments and bribes do you either fancy a beer/meal or giving a talk at a Skeptics in the Pub?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:28:05	@BipolarBlogger @debecca I'm a bit like that. High high hypos are a problem, moderate depressions I can cope with. Ish. Nearly! Sometimes!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:27:02	@debecca @BipolarBlogger I know the feeling. Like I said, only recent "stability" has allowed me to progress at all. I truly get it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:26:27	@debecca @BipolarBlogger Yup. I know. I'm feeling optimistic. It's a sunny Saturday! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:25:57	@pzmyers Reasonable. After all, all murders and wars were committed by people with faces. No one talks about that do they?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:22:41	@BipolarBlogger @debecca And you've clearly got there by supremely hard work. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:22:27	@BipolarBlogger @debecca If anyone can do it, Charlotte, you can. You are so immesensely knowledgeable and together about your BP. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:21:34	@debecca @BipolarBlogger Only my wife knows the whole truth. I'm (stupidly and against my better judgement) closeted as all fuck!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:20:40	@debecca @BipolarBlogger My phenomenally supportive wife and the fact that I avoided hospitalisation by hiding saved my life undoubtedly 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:20:03	@debecca @BipolarBlogger Part of that luck was when suicidally depressed I locked myself in my flat and only came out when I had to. 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:15:11	@debecca @BipolarBlogger But CANCER? There's been awesome money poured into it. That's rank mismanagement period.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:14:45	@debecca @BipolarBlogger Tragically I am used to shite MH care/lack of beds/facilities/therapy I'm used to entrenched MH bigotry and stigma

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:11:29	@debecca @BipolarBlogger Holy shit!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:09:20	@pzmyers Are you locking people up again PZ?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:08:28	@debecca @BipolarBlogger YIKES! That's a double whammy, and anorexia is no joke. You have psych therapy?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:01:38	@BipolarBlogger Annoyingly life saving and tummy making at the same time!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:01:21	@BipolarBlogger And anti-psychotics are notrious nightmares for people with any chance of putting on weight. As I know you know. Hate them!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:00:30	@BipolarBlogger Ordered rather than disordered habits around food are hard to maintain/develop but the only thing that works
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 19:00:05	@BipolarBlogger Yeah dieting is a very mixed bag (and the clinical data is mostly: it don't work, son!), I agree on the mindfulness front.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 18:56:33	@BipolarBlogger I will run a marathon before I die. I will. I will. I hate it but I will. Dammit!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 18:55:24	@BipolarBlogger A feeling I know only too well. I ballooned post diag/meds, I lost huge weight, put most back on, and am losing again now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 18:53:53	@BipolarBlogger SHOOT THEM WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE!!! Or, you know, not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 18:10:30	@BipolarBlogger I feel your pain. Stay strong, sister! {clenched pasty salute}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 18:09:52	@DawnHFoster @heinousdealings A woman told me to fuck off once, my peepee fell off and my FeeFees were hurt. Someone think of the FeeFees!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 18:07:03	@BipolarBlogger Really? That’s impressive. I’m hoping to do something similar in a few months. I’m in weight loss mode now. No more fatty!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 18:05:43	@DMReporter @michelleoyen Finally after years of use, my Irony-O-Matic 3000, triple shielded, lead lined, bunker housed irony meter melted.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 05:45:17	@BipolarBlogger Glad to read your mood is doing the right stuff!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-31 05:43:25	@jessiecath @RoomOfOurOwn @noodlemaz But being a millionaire footballer does… …no wait…it doesn’t And this guy was on BBCQT why? Insight?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-30 17:45:17	@BipolarBlogger @ilonacatherine @5WrightStuff Quick fix? I loathe those plaster casts. Quick fix for broken legs. I went to Tuscany.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-29 20:32:32	@BipolarBlogger Parts of me are, as usual, great and a bit odd! You’re feeling wobbly? The hell of the last few months would not be good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-29 16:04:29	@mePadraigReidy This is news! Something true in the Star.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-29 16:04:00	@BipolarBlogger Typical, rewards for new customers, just like banks. Help help I’m being oppressed!! ;-) (or in other words, how’s things?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-29 16:02:24	@BenKay5 Or it could be a hot mess as one of the worlds greatest episodes of shallow twattery that by some miracle doesn’t include Farage
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-28 21:18:54	@jon_trickett @LabourLeft Is it "testicle"? Because this is a load of bollocks. Yes I am here all week, no I will not be changing day jobs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-28 19:04:36	@terngirl @IBPhysics @DeepFriedDNA @Ananyo It isn't true. That's not a spherical bird of negligble volume for starters!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-28 02:30:10	@OpheliaBenson It just can't be misogyny! It can't it can't! It hurts my FeeFees to think it is! It can't be. Summary or 95% of reactions.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-28 02:29:04	@OpheliaBenson But but he was MAD! Or the wrong sort of misogynist! Or women should just put out! Or sex workers need to be thrown at men!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-28 02:27:21	Jesus suffering fuck, the leaders of the major UK poltical parties are falling over themselves to be anti-Europe. I need beer.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-28 02:23:34	@artologica @DrMRFrancis This wins the internet. We can now close it and go home. Finally free, finally sated. I salute you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 18:34:05	@CCriadoPerez But some of them were misogynist in hats. We can now talk about hats, maybe sell hats, and we can avoid talking about misogyny
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 07:24:15	@FuzzCookies Most kind. Most kind.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 07:23:38	@FuzzCookies When you're done with it can I borrow it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 07:21:14	@stevyncolgan That tweet would have been in English but I'm drunk

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 06:19:01	@EmmaK67 @emmafreud Don't do that. Let her be happy for a while longer. I saw the news once it...did things to me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 01:02:23	@RealDMitchell But I thought it was significant and have written an extensive theis on your recent works. I thout it was Dadaist, DAMMIT!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:47:57	@RealDMitchell Interesting. I think what Mitchell means by this tweet works on 12 levels. Firstly, A. The first letter, the beginning...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:46:45	@wildwalkerwoman Not again!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:45:48	@helenlewis @glosswitch I've just realised I have tapped a new and infinite vein of sarcasm about this. I am scared.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:43:40	@wildwalkerwoman Was I being just a leeeeetle obvious?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:40:29	@wildwalkerwoman That was my point! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:38:28	@wildwalkerwoman Granted, you are right. Forgive my humour. I was playing with the "not all men" meme.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:37:42	@Cornish_Buddha 1) Put a Tic Tac in the end of the condom 2) Put the condom on your John Thomas 3) Find a lady from Bodmin. Ansum!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:36:15	I have not posted on the YesAllWomen hashtag (bar RTs) it isn't for me to comment there. It is for me to listen. Try it, you might learn.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:34:52	@sondosia But but what about Teh Wimminz! Holy fuck, they've actually managed to acheive irony via tu quoque! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:24:26	@FuzzCookies By which I mean still very much a muppet!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:24:10	@FuzzCookies Nah not excellent Basic "being a human" I deserve no feminist cookies! :-) I'm just fucking ashamed I was a muppet for so long
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:22:22	@FuzzCookies I learned it due to being an accidentally sexist knobhead in the right company. Got my arse handed to me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:21:08	@FuzzCookies ...a very tough lesson for me to learn. Glad I am learning it. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:20:44	@FuzzCookies We teach boys and men a lot of nasty shit and then pretend we're innocent when it reaches its logical conclusion. That was 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:18:53	@ProfEdCopeland ARABIC (or Hindu I suppose) NUMERALS!!! Why that's terrorism. Won't someone think of the children?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:17:30	@FuzzCookies But but {flails around for some excuse} it can't be because of stated misogyny!!!!! I have no face left to palm.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:15:47	@OliverJamesUK The problem is that (IMO) they're wonderful poems. But to imply (even by accident) that they're the ONLY wonderful poems...NO
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-26 00:15:05	@ProfEdCopeland Carbon is dangerously foreign. I understand it is in French things like garlic and American things like apple pie.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 23:21:10	@electroboyusa Plenty more where that came from. I'll be manganimous and wave the fee! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 22:53:49	@DragonTat2 @DrJaneChi @debecca 1) I was being sarcastic in case I wasn't clear 2) In case I was clear (sorry) thanks 3) Google is HARD! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 22:34:12	@Xanthe_Cat I find park benches and pools of one's own urine to be particularly conducive to the whole effect. It's performance art.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 22:31:20	@Xanthe_Cat Although I do recommend that rather a lot for some reason....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 22:31:06	@Xanthe_Cat You are far too kind. Hope for humanity takes a lot of knocks doesn't it? I recommend drinking a lot and swearing at strangers
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 22:26:58	@Xanthe_Cat And thanks for your thanks! I've wanted to say something for ages, years. But never bothered because it would open floodgates.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 22:26:17	@Xanthe_Cat Is mental health stigma the last great bigotry? The one that will last even EVEN WOMEN (GASP) are considered real people? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 22:21:57	@Jenny_Trout We can but hope. (Although obviously I was referencing Gove's odious attempts to curtail Lit in the UK)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 22:18:44	@Jenny_Trout Don't worry, soon those plays will be all that's left on the Eng Lit syllabus in UK. We're to be saved from Nasty Foreign Muck.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 19:14:45	@electroboyusa Do I have to do all 1000 RTs myself? Do I get a fee? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 19:13:27	@sarahditum I’m wondering if it’s beginning to show I’ve been on Twitter too long and burst my sarcasm gland? How you deal with this amazes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 19:12:13	@sarahditum OMG that is the most complicated thought ever! Excuse me while I spend forever trying to minimise the bits that make me uncomfy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 19:00:58	@CCriadoPerez I spent too much of last night fending off this drivel. How openly misogynist does someone have to be before it’s factored in?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 18:57:25	@JosieLong I am a bit worried by how much I giggle every time I think about it. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 18:56:45	@JosieLong I have to say I loved your impression of their spluttering outrage. “It’s not ‘unsubscribe’ it’s ‘unfol…’” “UNSUBSCRIBE!” 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 11:09:40	@heinousdealings Oh THAT! Isn't that over? Someone told me it was over? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 11:08:53	@Valkyrie_77 @YourAnonNews @heinousdealings Enlighten me. What's it about?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 11:03:54	@heinousdealings @JosieLong She does it it will amazing timing. Which annoys them all the more. V funny.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 11:03:11	@heinousdealings @JosieLong It annoys people impressively by all accounts. I want to steal it but lack the comic ability to pull it off. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 11:01:46	@heinousdealings The amazing comedian @Josielong (who I hope will not object to me including her) tweets "UNSUBSCRIBE" at the fools. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 10:57:50	@heinousdealings I've just read the exchange. I was frighteningly close. I'm really scared now!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 10:56:31	@heinousdealings Well known fact: RTing is like not having sex with someone. Or having sex with them. I'm very confused. I blame everyone.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 10:54:16	@heinousdealings Even I know Twitter doesn't work like that... ....wait. It doesn't, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 10:44:42	@stavvers Shhhh I'm huntin' wabbits
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 10:44:31	@stavvers I too am drunk. Drunk Cypriots FTW! I'm also being rude to sexists, mental health bigots, gun nuts, and assorted scum. It's fun
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 10:42:38	@stavvers HEY! (Do I count? We sort of chatted earlier...was it yesterday?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 10:30:09	@DrJP2011 @heinousdealings I think that's the policy statement. Needless to say I disagree with it.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 10:06:57	@docfreeride I did thinking once. It done hurt me. And things are better now. Some of my best friends are women. I think my wife's one too.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 07:44:08	@Monkeymagic22 @brianmoore666 I will not dismiss the possibility that this is a wind up however, in which case: nice work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 07:43:44	@Monkeymagic22 @brianmoore666 If you really think that your views are so divorced from reality as to be not worth bothering with.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 05:11:16	@CarlieP That is my new favourite tweet of all time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 05:08:49	@sarahditum Oh and that was sacrasm by the way, just in case I messed up the 140!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 05:08:31	@sarahditum Important: He's British, his dad helped to make a violent movie. Not Important: His misogynist rant, entitlement and MRA status
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 05:06:21	@UnLawfulNews @stavvers Dude you need to fuck most directly off.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 03:56:05	@there_runsMary Annoyingly it’s jokes terrible. Acting/writing so below par I will be suing to get my time back.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:24:19	@stavvers Yup. "HAHA LET'S BE CONTRARIAN WITH YOUR RIGHT TO EXIST" No, let's fucking not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:21:56	@splendisaurus I think we probably agree 100% is my guess! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:21:42	@stavvers And don't get me started on the Spiked bunch, that's six hours of sweary ranting minimum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:20:31	@DavidFutrelle I think you'll have to wait about...oooooh....negative five minutes. Sadly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:19:01	@stavvers You KNOW it's on its way. And that makes me vomit all over again. This is horrendous shit. And too too common.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:15:30	@splendisaurus Because their ideas are SO extreme that the blame needs to rest on them? (I would NOT want to let them off th hook!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:13:09	@splendisaurus There is not enough face to palm. And that is the mildest possible reaction.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:12:37	@CCriadoPerez @glosswitch I'm learning more about her. I feel a deep need to for some reason!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:10:49	@glosswitch @CCriadoPerez Is this what Florynce Kennedy called "horizontal hosility"? Acts directed sideways to deflect oppressor's attack?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:09:23	@splendisaurus I'll cheerfully defer to your assessment! I fear PUA-esque ideas are common. If even I've encountered them...! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:05:04	@splendisaurus Which is mainstream wankery from what I can tell. Insert correct commands, recieve female attention/favour. Utter horseshite.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:02:15	And on that note woe betide any clueless fuckstain that witters at me about mental illness. Misogyny and entitlement is mainstream not rare.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:01:25	Just how the fuck does anyone believe they have a right to other people's bodies and attention to the degree that its denial makes them kill
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 01:00:40	I cannot claim perfection nor can I claim I have never done anything sexist or daft, but this level of entitlement/cluelessness is beyond me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 00:59:54	Young man feels entitled to women's bodies and attention. Young man whines about alpha maleness and gentleman status. Young man shoots women
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-25 00:57:20	@CCriadoPerez It's utterly sickening. I hear these sorts of rants far too frequently. I just can't grasp the entitlement, the rank arrogance
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 16:47:12	@Giliell @oolon It's a very civilising thing for them to do, bringing all that wisdom to those poor, poor benighted "globalists". {cough}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 16:44:18	@oolon @Giliell I'm very impressed they're going to solve the globe's problems secularly. It must be a terrible burden for them. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 16:39:24	@clinteas It's like you read my mind!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 16:36:02	@clinteas Yeah that's my solution, less and better sourced meat (also River Cottage methods!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 16:31:12	@clinteas That said, vegetarianism is the one really important ethical goal that so far completely eludes me. So compromises had to be made!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 16:30:30	@clinteas WOW! That's abominable. I confess I only consume meat of known provenance, which is the (crappy) compromise I've made.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 16:25:02	Today has already included coffee. Will today include bacon or even sausage? Stay tuned for more exciting pig based developments!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 16:14:32	@Crommunist @Million_Gods Never NEVER underestimate the artisic merit of a well drawn toilet dick. I was totally with you up until that. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 15:18:27	So the claimed UKIP increase is really a decrease, I want to know why it’s reported as an increase and why UKIP get undue media attention.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 06:53:31	@FuzzCookies I’ve tried, I really have, no dice. And dice were the least of my problems. In fact, perhaps I shouldn’t have tried to use dice
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 06:52:30	@FuzzCookies Mind you, post Kardashian self pleasure is tricky.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 06:52:06	@FuzzCookies NOOO! Think back to moments ago when all that disturbed you was the thought of luxuriating with a romantic wank. Save yourself!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 06:47:03	@FuzzCookies NOOOOO!!! Stop the madness! I’ll be thinking about that all night… …okay that came out wrong. I meant… …bugger.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-24 06:45:15	@FuzzCookies Do you realise the number of candle/bush fire jokes that just leapt into my brain? Have a heart, that could cause unrest!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-22 17:03:26	@FollowBDT I did once try "Errm, so I'm mad". It did not go well. I was in a spectacularly depressive phase at the time. Judgement impaired

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-22 17:00:45	@gimpyblog The one flaw with the Greens generally is they hide the kookier elements of left wing UK politics, i.e. antiscience numbskullery.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-22 16:59:40	@BipolarBlogger Me too actually. So are you bringing trifle to the Future Hot Platonic Bipolar Date and I'm bringing tiramisu?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-22 16:57:22	@BipolarBlogger Tiramisu is inferior trifle that should be purged from this green and pleasant land! Ooops. Went a bit Farage, I am v tired

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-22 16:53:28	@BipolarBlogger Yup. I agree. I'm only 40 mins out into the Home Counties and it's like going back 40 years. Unimpressed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-22 16:51:58	@BipolarBlogger Diverse working enviroments are (in my experience) the best. You always find something new out.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-21 17:31:41	@dorolfe @HappiestAtheist I can't speak for all my compatriots, naturally, but it's a bit antiquated. I woudn't use it, it's a bit UKIPpy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-20 21:38:34	Drinkable sunblock? Is this a new level of human stupid? Speaking of drinking, today I will be starting early.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-20 02:16:08	@openeyedsmiler @WomenDefyUKIP @billybragg I've been doing extensive research. Thirst causes misogyny, hunger => homophobia. Important work!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-20 02:00:56	@IamCarrieeeeee Hey it's a serious problem. Also I've noticed being thirsty makes you misogynist and hunger causes homophobia. #Farage
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-20 01:54:07	@DocHackenbush I have to do my own research? OH THE HUMANITY! The scrolling finger work alone will tire me. And thus render me a bit racist
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-20 01:52:58	@BipolarBlogger I have this problem. Parents own a restaurant, learned to cook there, habitually cater for 50!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-20 01:52:31	@DocHackenbush Also I feel that the room temp IQ is surely measured in Gas Mark and not Kelvin.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-20 01:51:55	@DocHackenbush Farage letter? This I must see!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-20 00:42:47	@BipolarBlogger Sadly, so am I. I will have theoretical booze instead.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-20 00:29:01	@UKiPNews @UpikNews Well all that running a country's hard work. Late nights and what not. Nobody thinks of the struggling bigot, do they?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-20 00:27:58	@BipolarBlogger It's been one of those days. The same policy applies to alcohol!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-19 23:54:21	@UpikNews @UKiPNews I was tired once and I accidentally started a genocide. I demand to be forgiven, could happen to anyone.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-19 20:03:34	@JackofKent Impressive interview technique. Are you to take over Newsnight?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-19 03:36:19	@TolpuddleTim @billybragg Storm his bank account with pitchforks and give hos dosh to people whom it would make immeasurably happy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-19 02:54:30	@there_runsMary When this goes to court I said nothing. NOTHING!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-19 02:52:55	@there_runsMary Congrats! Make it a large G for me!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 20:21:48	@DocHackenbush Because criticism of political ideas and calling racism "racism" is the same as racism, homophobia, misogyny etc. {facepalm}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 19:46:58	@stevyncolgan Although, I could go even further. I was once moved to audible tutting and stern looks of disapproval.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 19:46:13	@stevyncolgan Nothing says "I disagree with your vile politics" quite like a pitchfork in the nadgers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 19:45:43	@stevyncolgan The Lard knows I am not a violent man but I am a hair's breadth from taking up my special rioting pitchfork and having at them
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 19:42:21	@stevyncolgan To be fair, it is hard to maintain a banner that is on fire... ...I've said too much.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 18:45:05	@DocHackenbush But he seems like such a charming bloke. Lovely moustache. How can he be a rampaging bigotted fuck-knuckle? Oh wait...easily
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 18:43:40	@RomeshRanga @ShappiKhorsandi I once explained I wasn't from India (or wherever) asked if he could use accurate racist words. Didn't go well
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 18:42:01	@RomeshRanga @ShappiKhorsandi I got the same drivel. For example: Often got "go back to the trees from whence you came" by a teacher.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 18:32:31	@pwk2013 Mmmm lovely lovely drugs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 18:02:47	@gimpyblog Impressive. Disapproval shared with another person, that's at least Level 3. Hand beer been involved that could have escalated.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 18:01:09	@gimpyblog A suitably British rebuke. Did you tut audibly?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 18:00:03	@gimpyblog Granted. THAT is clearly an act of abomination. I hope you persecuted him appropriately.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 17:56:26	@gimpyblog A particular fetish for the works, and styles depicted therein, of P G Wodehouse?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 17:28:59	@Cornish_Buddha I saw a bloke from Mousehole in shorts once. I damn near dropped my pasty.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 17:23:10	@MCabournSmith @mrchrisaddison NO ONE SPEAKS FOR MY PEOPLE! {Burp}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 17:19:19	@bobbyllew @mrchrisaddison I'd settle for being able to vote for someone who really understands and supports UK science.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 16:35:39	@MrRogerFlatt @WomenDefyUKIP Luckily, I hate kittens. Okay I don't, but I am willing to sacrifice a few to stop UKIP. Okay I'm not. Damn!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 16:29:27	@BipolarBlogger I'm not sure if the plan is useful! I seem to have gotten lucky this time! ;-) It's the depressive side that ruins me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 16:23:04	@BipolarBlogger Had a distinct downward wobble last week for a few days. Enacted plan, seems to be working. Still a bit procrastinate-y!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 16:21:50	@MrEdByrne I feel exactly the same way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-18 16:00:07	@IAmPippaEvans @quantick I have comedy in my crotch and toothpaste on women. That sort of thing can cause unrest.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-17 00:59:26	@SpokesGay I was tempted to go with "Garibaldi"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-17 00:57:54	@SpokesGay Important questions like "What biscuit are you?" may go unanswered! (I was asked that in an interview years ago I got up + left)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-16 17:17:57	@paulcoxon The people who hide my reagents in the fridge (usually in plain sight), those people are the worst too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-16 06:27:30	@davidschneider Because I like shortbread and don't want to pay what'll undoubtedly be exorbitant luxury biscuit taxes to fund foreign wars?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-15 17:04:16	@soozaphone Wait...I've missed the point. This isn't about safety is it? Oh...wait...yes it is. {depressing stuff}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-15 17:03:29	@soozaphone Speaking as a scientist, that first lady is not wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. She wouldn't get in my lab.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-15 01:58:19	@there_runsMary I have had a few songs. The worst I get is a testy caller (STEADY!) who thinks I'm weird. Which I am anyway! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-15 01:57:36	@there_runsMary It's fun. Just apologise for interrupting and say "I'm sorry, it's personal policy that I buy nothing without a song"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-15 01:52:56	@there_runsMary I am always polite to them too. I do refuse to buy anything or even continue unless they sing me a song though. Fun times.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-15 01:48:13	@SpokesGay I know right? My life is SO difficult. I'm also unappreciated in my time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-05-15 01:42:39	1) I can feel the first inklings of a depressive cycle. I am unimpressed. Plan is being enacted. 2) Things on the internet are not helping.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-21 19:30:07	@debecca Thanks for those. I think my 2 and 3 would be very similar to yours. I think my 1 might be several paragraphs though! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-21 19:19:46	@chiara84 Execution too drastic? I present you Michael Gove as evidence it would be insufficient! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-21 19:19:02	@chiara84 I'll have to read the book. I think it'll hinge heavily on the definition of "stupid". Thanks for the interesting book suggestion!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-21 19:17:34	@stevyncolgan @neildenham1978 Mind you, it is a really crappy definition of "virtue". I need a more beer inclusive definition.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-21 00:15:31	@BipolarBlogger As for looking forward to something, isn't it lovely? A ray of hope when stuff has been bleak for what seems like forever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-21 00:14:42	@BipolarBlogger Well, generally speaking it is. ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-12 06:42:15	@onesarahjones @LornestoToledo @ZaidJilani but this is a MUCH longer discussion not appropriate to 140 chars!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-12 03:03:29	@onesarahjones I clearly need to read more of her stuff, I'm commenting from relative ignorance. The older stuff I read was less problematic
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-12 03:02:22	@onesarahjones Definitely with you on all of that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-12 03:01:43	@onesarahjones Crikey! I *AM* out of the loop! That's...erm...well...yes. Wow! I change my mind. Disavowal is a good option.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-12 03:00:26	@onesarahjones Mind you, advocating Muslims become Christian (not atheist) from an atheist sounds bonkers on the face of it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-12 02:59:40	@onesarahjones Obviously I'm happy to disavow really egregious knobbery. I'll have to read Hirsi Ali's bit to see what level it reaches 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-12 02:58:41	@onesarahjones Ok, I'll be serious! :-) Disavowal is a big deal. Are we not allowed nuance? As in "I disagree on X but not Y"? 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-12 02:56:43	I have been feeling deeply silly today. I blame the fact that it is Friday and that I am not drunk. Schoolboy error on my part.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-12 02:55:25	@onesarahjones I even hadn't noticed! I disagree with Ayaan on this. Do we have to agree about everything? Hope not. I love a good schism!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-12 02:41:38	@MitchBenn @keewa @scalzi was wise when he said the default setting of clever should not be "asshole". Should extend to the default of male

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-02 18:12:56	@DRobertPrice Subtle racist narratives etc are all damaging too, but certaintly don't detract from odiousness of Pub-Bloke sneers and slurs
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-02 18:11:35	@DRobertPrice Doubtlessly. The overt stuff (like this) does harm too. Reinforces the acceptability of overt racism to have on prime time BBC
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-02 18:10:35	@garwboy @Marjorie73 FIEND! May your personal, proprietary blend of tea be slightly unbalanced for such teasing!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-02 18:09:08	@DRobertPrice @almurray @JeremyClarkson Ah now on that we agree. Subtle racism far more pervasive and harmful. This was crass and deliberate
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-02 18:07:48	@garwboy I am, however, very interested in this rationale of milk before water. I await your exposition with baited breath.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-02 18:07:17	@garwboy You have my interest, sir. I always thought milk after water because of fat etc clogging of tea bag pores (should one use them).

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-02 17:39:38	@RevRichardColes That could be considered bribery of the highest order. I would not go as far as instant and a sneer, but perhaps older perc

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 18:00:09	@zoesqwilliams Is it too optimistic to think the entire Tory government has been one long spate of trolling building to a big reveal today?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 17:57:01	@BathComedyFest @caroldecker @rondotheatre @almurray @boobygraffoe Lucky coincidence the city is called Bath, eh? Be daft if it was Shower.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 17:53:37	@BathComedyFest @caroldecker @rondotheatre @almurray @boobygraffoe Showing off you've got a big bath, eh? Typical!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 17:13:12	@BipolarBlogger I'm normally Glass Half Empty too, but I seem to be up of late. I seem to do this in March and October, I just hope it stays
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 17:12:16	@Independent April Fool?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 17:10:55	@BipolarBlogger But let's cross all our fingers and toes that progress is forthcoming
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 17:10:14	@BipolarBlogger I know you didn't say it, I was being absurdly optimistic! ;-) It's a bad habit!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:58:38	@FelicityMorse @BipolarBlogger MUST. DO. THIS.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:58:23	@noodlemaz @feitclub Surely that's a radioactive super baby?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:57:22	@BipolarBlogger So progress is being made?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:56:24	@robinince @garwboy Let the inadequacy see the disappointment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:55:55	@unfortunatalie @onalifeglug @noodlemaz Nothing says "this is pants" like a polka.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:53:42	@tweetyaca @noodlemaz The temptation to accidentally sack off work and play Skyrim is growing. Must be strong. Look at the lab. Mmmm lab.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:52:48	@onalifeglug @noodlemaz @unfortunatalie Ha! Nice one. I've never heard the original. The remakes were too funny to spoil.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:52:12	@noodlemaz @tweetyaca An arrow to the knee joke. Dammit that is THIS geek's day made. Thank you. [No sarcasm. I mean this]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:51:38	@BipolarBlogger {Hugs} Yup. Especially rough, when as you say, collaboration seems optional to some professionals.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:50:50	@garwboy @noodlemaz Everyone on the internet is fake. We're all mere manifestations of a 400lb Arkansan trucker called Bubba. Hail Bubba!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:47:18	@tweetyaca @noodlemaz Ah the Friendzone Boss. I've heard terrible things. Apparently having friends is bad. Who knew? [Also sarcasm]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:46:30	@noodlemaz We could try the Skyrim noise, but from recent tweets I feel this might traumatise you! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:45:57	@noodlemaz {FAINTS}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:45:20	@NewHumanist @ArianeSherine I'd agree wrt my son too. Mind you, dinner conversation WILL be interesting if he ends up religious. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:44:06	@noodlemaz Not WoW "Boooom" Level up and new spells?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:41:20	@noodlemaz Don't be done! You're right. We're are often brought up to treat women as sex RPGs. Complete the puzzle, level up. It's pathetic
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-04-01 16:39:53	Good Morning Twitterverse. How will you distract me today? What boltholes of procrastinatory joy will you find for me? Oh how I love you!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-31 23:45:13	@JodiAman By the way that joke has to be made at least once per use of that quote. It was my turn. Sorry.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-31 23:44:39	@JodiAman You're René Descartes? Wait...punctuation makes all the difference. I should have noticed! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-31 23:42:05	@hughlaurie This also reduces noise pollution due to high pitched whistling emitted by wind-struck European cattle.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-31 19:09:55	@rbhu7 Mmmmmm cock n balls....wait what?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-31 19:08:53	@rbhu7 I could tell. The fact we're both wearing clown shoes and red noses gives away the serious.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-31 19:08:26	@rbhu7 The combined work of Teh Ghey (Misandry Division) and Teh Feminazis!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-31 18:57:49	@rbhu7 WHAT!? I thought we were really espousing how hard it is for men and how the world is against us + hurts our FeeFees! (Yes. Sarcasm)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-31 18:57:00	@rbhu7 Agreed. I was convinced by a genius that hard chairs are misandrous because men's arses are bonier.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-31 18:53:08	@rbhu7 Well known fact: Anything that doesn't fall before my chopper in worship and blow me heavily is misandry. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-30 19:34:14	@WritersofColour Incidentally the previous "haha X People are a bit Y" jokes are abhorrent too But this was prime time flat out naked racism
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-30 19:32:54	@WritersofColour ...bared teeth, fucking racist abuse. Pure and simple. Like going up to a black actor and using the n word. Abhorrent 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-30 19:32:11	@WritersofColour GREAT! I saw the episode could not believe my ears It wasn't a "haha X People are a bit Y" like before. It was outright 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-30 19:29:33	@RugbyTigers Ohhhh. Nasty stuff. For a damn fine player Hartley does seem to get himself into some dumb scrapes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-30 19:26:56	@RugbyTigers I was in the pub, and didn't hear who was meant to have bitten who. Hartley being naughty? Or on recieving end?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 02:19:27	@BipolarBlogger Urgh. My thoughts are with you. Let's hope it gets better fast and the appt comes Monday.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:46:38	@RugbyTigers @logoviimulipola @premrugby Nice one big lad!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:45:57	@BipolarBlogger Do you think it will firm up after the psych meeting?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:43:05	@BipolarBlogger Indeed. That would seem the logica (and medically sound) approach from what I know.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:40:36	@BipolarBlogger What was his reasoning for no new med?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:40:11	@BipolarBlogger Great! Seems like a nice chap then...NOT
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:39:53	@BipolarBlogger Ahhhhh sorry. I missed yesterday's meeting news.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:38:32	@BipolarBlogger ...and time for a really thorough meds/therapy assessment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:38:00	@BipolarBlogger It sounds a bit insensitive (UNDERSTATEMENT) to me. Surely if you're this deep in crisis it should be straight to the Shrink
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:36:56	@BipolarBlogger Ha! No, I'm gald I asked. Always good to keep abreast of how friends are doing Thought I'd let you explain it first though
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:31:26	@gordonmilson However, I have to acknowledge that may not be possible and that I have to approach recovery carefully and slowly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:30:52	@gordonmilson For me recovery is regaining previous functionality and hopefully exceding it given that I now know more about self management
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-29 01:29:28	@BipolarBlogger Today is a better day I am hoping. How are you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 07:35:26	@Bethemediauk @thus_spake_z I am away from the TV right now, who is this homophobe I see talked about in my TL? I ask so I may mock.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 07:31:29	@CarlieP Holy shit that was fast. Good work decent peeps.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 07:30:42	@OliverJamesUK My friend got gay married. I died, twice, and my wife lost the ability to kiln pottery Where's my support group? PC gorn mad
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 01:16:27	@cupofcrow You know it's grim when the client deserves a negative Doge Meme. Time for a beer?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:55:34	@whorephobia EAT? WHAT!? You mean you cannot live on whorephobia and smug self satisfaction? You amaze me! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:51:29	@FollowBDT YES! I've done the whole brave thing. Luckily I eventually realised I was being a prannock! That saved my life.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:27:23	@BipolarBlogger @debecca No. Really. Honest. Didn't happen. And no one has photos they are still using to blackmail me with to this date.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:26:47	@BipolarBlogger @debecca My problem with JD is not because I over did it + made an arse of myself at 18 (Just 18, Louis?). That's right out
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:22:57	@BipolarBlogger @debecca WIMP! One has to push through the Cider Barrier. No pain no gain. ;-) (I have a similar problem with Jack Daniels)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:21:28	@debecca ENVY!!!!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:21:17	@BipolarBlogger @debecca Mind you this route is only for the dedicated Surly Drinker. There is a minimum Swearing At Strangers Quotient.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:20:04	@BipolarBlogger @debecca At least the interaction with the Offy owner could be surly and silent. I hear good things about gutters these days
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:19:36	@BipolarBlogger @debecca Well you could go the Advanced Route and get Super Cider from an offy and languish gently in a gutter. Ah memories!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:15:18	@BipolarBlogger @debecca YIKES! FLEE! Flee to a darkened corner of a pub and commence Surly Drinking. Oh wait, that's my method! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:06:19	@BipolarBlogger @debecca ..made me feel better rather than worse. ACTING on that knowledge in a rational way has not been easy. I fail a lot
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:05:31	@BipolarBlogger @debecca ...I feel your pain on this one. It's a horrid old cliche bu probably the majority of the time the social has...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:04:56	@BipolarBlogger @debecca I've really struggled to get back to being social, I'm spectacularly paranoid and self loathing at my worst. So...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:03:40	@BipolarBlogger The last one is at least a good reason! (Okay the others are too)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:01:07	@BipolarBlogger And YOUR company is always appreciated, you're an inspiration, even though it might not feel that way right now to you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:00:40	@BipolarBlogger So I'll try to do better than normal and offer you these Internet Hugs and hope it all gets a lot better soon.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-28 00:00:14	@BipolarBlogger Cold pain? Urgh. Massive sympathy. Also, no crying, you know it makes us men all crap and flustered. We say silly things ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-27 23:47:31	@BipolarBlogger Depressive numbness? You have my profound sympathy. Wish I could do some good. Fancy pixie dust and internet choocies? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-27 23:44:37	@JackofKent True. Perhaps we get the enemies we deserve. No one dare put a foot wrong, our OverPersons are interchangeable Corporatists
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-27 23:41:38	@JackofKent Wait...you WANT them to be *competently* illiberal? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-26 22:01:08	@Mammals_Suck @drugmonkeyblog Weird, my boss' flow chart had "GET BACK TO WORK" in all the boxes. He was such a sweetie {twitch} ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-26 18:33:30	@paulcoxon Google? Meh. DuckDuck Go! Wait...I've missed something important haven't I? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-26 04:35:43	@bmagnanti Oh I dunno. I have a deep seated (and shameful) need to have something to point and laugh at. Perhaps I'm a bad bo... ...no no!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-26 04:20:50	@EtonOldBoys @stevescullion Sir, you shock me! Look at my shocked face! I shall have my man servant call on you to refute such allegations!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-26 04:17:09	@EtonOldBoys @stevescullion Now then, what's all this fact based lark? How will we blame nassssty leftiessss Preciouses if we tells truths?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-25 17:13:59	@ProfFrancesca @UniofExeter As is right and proper. Use this power to crush all who oppose you. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-24 16:17:09	@tkcarter82 @clarebalding I fear the toilets!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-24 16:16:57	@tkcarter82 @clarebalding Then there's pinned against the wall by a torrent and discovered by hotel staff in a compromising position clean.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-24 16:13:44	@clarebalding The one on the right looks like it lifts you off the seat. It has to be that one first!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-21 04:25:44	@GeorgeHrab Except the latter works. Spinal Tap proved it... ...wait...I've missed something haven't I? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-21 04:16:00	@rbhu7 You'd be right to do that!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-21 01:41:28	@whorephobia A freebie? #banfreebies I assume everyone wants to give me a blow job. I am near universally wrong, but also an optimist! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-21 00:21:10	@LoriAdorable Shhh I'm trying to pretend I have thoughts that originate above groin level. Okay I'm fooling no one, but we can at least act.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-21 00:18:39	@LoriAdorable You are forgetting the intellectual demographic who are here for neither underwear pics nor cats. I'm sure they're out there!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 22:25:59	@oolon Cheaper now too! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 22:23:00	@rbhu7 I stress I never actually did that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 22:22:50	@rbhu7 Trolling is not trolling unless done in morning wear. ;-) Why I remember when I was trolling Mac fora about PCs I did in white tie
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 22:21:28	@GrrlScientist Indeed. I'm occasionally a fool, I'm only human after all, but dammit some people do seem to achieve lofty heights of fooldom
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 22:16:57	@rbhu7 We are being trolled by our government again.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 22:15:25	@GrrlScientist OH THE HUGE MANATEE! I wonder how I manage to have any despair left.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 22:13:37	@BipolarBlogger @Thorvid_HoliCow @g3reth At least. I go further and demand sprinkles and brightly coloured sauces.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 22:13:10	@BipolarBlogger @Thorvid_HoliCow @g3reth Some of medics/managers in the NHS I've dealt with think it's inevitable, some don't. All annoyed

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 22:07:31	@GrrlScientist Before I click the link and become horrendously depressed, tell me you're kidding. Please tell me you're kidding. Please.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 21:58:22	@oolon Oh AbsoLUYTely! One must be fucked by someone with a decent accent and proper schooling, dontcherknow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 21:54:04	@oolon ...but it is nice to be asked first.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 21:53:55	@oolon Don't get me wrong, the last lot (right wing Labour) screwed us, this lot are screwing us. The lot of the populace is to be screwed..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 21:52:17	@oolon It involves SURPRIEZ BUTTSECKS and poor people?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 21:42:23	@BipolarBlogger @Thorvid_HoliCow @g3reth Do you think break up inevitable? I sincerely hope not. There's movement towards user led ...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 21:37:28	@Thorvid_HoliCow @BipolarBlogger @g3reth ...millions, this is very possible. Very very possible. It's a case of political will not cash.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 21:30:16	@Thorvid_HoliCow @BipolarBlogger @g3reth ...is that such a place is well within the realms of possibility, cheaper than the effect of 2/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-20 21:29:50	@Thorvid_HoliCow @BipolarBlogger @g3reth I want to LIVE somewhere like that, let alone go there in crisis! The thing that drivesme wild 1/n

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 21:20:25	@bmagnanti Perhaps. March the 7th's cartoon springs to mind: http:// stephaniemcmillan.org / I'm not sure that activist grief is all bad for anyone
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 21:18:05	@bmagnanti Ha, yes! Of course, and that I unquestioningly support. I'm just a sad fan! With an inability to plan how many tweets I use!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 21:17:12	@bmagnanti ...but not exclusively, some of the tall trees help the shorter ones.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 21:16:57	@bmagnanti I've never believed that communication is a zero sum game. Sure, the tall trees crowd out the shorter ones some times 2/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 21:16:04	@bmagnanti I'm not pleased. I think your voice is a valuable one despite the reasons you give. Let a thousand flowers bloom, sayeth eye. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 20:30:42	@jennyeclair I watched the whole thing and didn't see you looking fat once. You were, however, very funny. As ever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 04:01:19	@SpokesGay ALL TIME BABBY KILL! I HEART SLUTZ!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 04:00:58	@debecca @cupofcrow Oh thanks! I read that tweet and have been resisting making stats jokes. Now my brain is filling with them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 03:44:56	@debecca @BipolarBlogger @BipolarTweets @Were_Horse I leave that as an exercise for the reader… ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 03:44:30	@SpokesGay Because he is IMPORTANT WITE MANS!!! Therefore best interpretation of words must be made or else SILLI WIMMINZ!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 03:43:25	@capnbobfrapples @debecca Difficult but not impossible. Excelsior!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 03:42:01	@BipolarBlogger @debecca @BipolarTweets @Were_Horse Be nice if I didn’t have moons orbiting my waist. No man should have moons.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 03:41:32	@BipolarBlogger @debecca @BipolarTweets @Were_Horse This is subject I know only too well! Personally or professionally. Take your pick. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 03:39:51	@IamAustinHealey Nicely done. Has your TL been filled with Welsh fans congratulating you on today’s result? Or tears and bitterness?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 03:36:12	@FuzzCookies I suppose, after all it wasn’t you doing the turd cutting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 03:35:22	@FuzzCookies Ah the good old days… …wrong emotion?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 03:21:24	@RevRichardColes Wait. It's possible to eat guinea pigs for sex reasons? This explanation I must read. Do tell, good sir. Do tell.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 03:18:13	@judeinlondon WHITE MEN IS OPPPREST!!!! {Dribbles} {Falls over}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 02:55:47	@SpokesGay {INNOCENT FACE}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 02:53:18	@SpokesGay Oh yes! It's tiresome to have to do it ALL the time. Once in a while is fun. Like pegging... ...let me start that analogy again
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 02:50:36	@SpokesGay I don't blame you. Some of those chaps are GORGEOUS.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-10 02:47:49	I am moderately pleased by the rugby result today. Wales played well (with some caveats) and England played better, ergo good result for me!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 19:51:42	I'd like to wish the Welsh Rugby Union team the best of luck. Obviously I want England to win, so I'm afraid the good wishes only go so far!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 19:49:34	Morning. Yesterday was International Women's Day and there seemed to be a lot of men upset by that. Well chaps, it's business as usual today
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 07:10:19	@Data_Jack @dELYSEious Undoubtedly. I saw a South American atheist make the arguments once. Wow! Just….Wow!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 07:09:30	@BarbB2013 @dELYSEious @Doubting_Tom Dear fuck no! I’ve seen the explanation. I don’t need to see it again. {shudder}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 05:10:05	@Harrison_Peter @Gammidgy This is a well known fact. They also control my brain through my fillings EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NONE! Spooky. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 05:09:00	@dELYSEious I am DYING to hear this "secular argument" Religious: God says women aren't proper people Secular: Women aren't proper people
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 04:22:21	@stephenfry Badum tish! I thank you. Are you here all week? Should I tip my waitress? Is the veal good? Should I try it?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 01:15:14	@stavvers Ah. Yeah. THAT will do it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 01:12:01	@ateisten @JenLucPiquant Damn, I always get that one wrong. That will explain the poor harvest then. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 01:11:26	@stavvers oooh I'm first (ish?) gen! Born there but came here v young. Do I get extra points and a copy of My Big Fat Greek Wedding? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 01:04:19	@stavvers Nice one. My Great Aunt used to spit every time she said the word Turk. The fact that half her family was Turkish = not relevant!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 01:02:27	@JenLucPiquant Wait...we don't? {Puts down virgin} But how will I propitiate the sun god?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 01:01:35	@stavvers Admittedly only for shits and giggles.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 01:01:19	@stavvers HAHAHA! Oh dear we're a bit too alike on that one. I do the exact same thing with coffee!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 01:00:43	@RugbyTigers @BrianODriscoll I have but one criticism of BOD. He never came and played for Tigers. Harsh....harsh... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:58:53	@stavvers Well of course I agree, but how do we tell everyone else? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:53:17	@stavvers I didn't know we shared this particular heritage. γειά μας!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:41:35	I genuinely thought it would go the other way given the tumultuous nature of England vs Wales tomorrow. My bad. I was wrong!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:40:31	Jingoism supplanting good natured banter during rugby = Bad International Women's Day = Good Result: Y U HATE MEN? Not: Y U HATE BANTZ?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:38:25	It says something about my naivety that I thought my tweets being arsey about jingoism would be more controversial than supporting IWD
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:34:33	@Slutocrat Well known fact: discrimination that I don't experience is, like, a really unlikely thing. Hmmm is there a word for this?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:30:39	@garwboy Externally validated too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:30:22	@garwboy No. That's the SOP for chip testing. It's been extrenally validated and everything.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:16:57	@HannahGrego Okay the temptress is me, I am wearing a very fetching ball gown.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:16:42	@HannahGrego I don't think it does that, it's a headline/title and by necessity un-nuanced. But yes, I see the point.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:13:55	@HannahGrego Likewise! Thanks for great convo. I have to confess to having lingered too long on Twitter because of it! Temptress! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:12:38	@HannahGrego Your day? No more than Nov 19 is mine. Not really about me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:11:48	@SpokesGay I agree. Grated baby Jesus with oregano oil and anchovies is a great topping for a rocket and tomato salad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:10:52	@HannahGrego ...an uncommon silencing tactic. We might not be intending to do that, but it can be the effect.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:10:29	@HannahGrego Focus on their tone is potentially part of the problem. Concern over HOW things are said rather than WHAT is said is not...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:09:52	@HannahGrego Okay, whilst you and I might agree. Who are we to police tone of people who perhaps have experienced more disadvantage than us?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:08:57	Brian O'Driscoll, what a total rugby legend. Congrats on your final home game. @BrianODriscoll
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:07:16	@SpokesGay Do you hate America and the Baby Jesus too?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:06:23	@SpokesGay BUT BUT He is a Big Important Man Person! Y U HATE ATHEISM!?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:05:15	@HannahGrego I don't believe I've used any weapon/war-like analogies in fact. I tend to think of things as tricks/tools for problem solving
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:03:53	@HannahGrego Stick? Arsenal? Unusually militaristic. Tools in toolbox would be my analogy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-09 00:02:31	@jailawrites @ingdamnit @SpokesGay I guessed you meant abortion clinic escorting. Was I right? If so, the coffee went to the right address!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:58:15	@HannahGrego ...that selection process exists (for whatever reason). It can be treated as a functional problem regardless of the niceties.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:57:44	@HannahGrego ...somehow selected for special disadvantage then it isn't the fault of the people working against that disadvantage that...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:57:15	@HannahGrego As for the groups divide not unite, of course. In the most obvious way, the tyranny of esssentialism. BUT! If one group is...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:56:16	@HannahGrego The problem is it's a crappy point because much more than special recognition is going on.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:55:47	@HannahGrego IF (big if) special recognition was the only thing going on. IF it wasn't one trick amonst many. Then maybe that's a good point
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:48:11	@HannahGrego I should say, not seen fair points apart from yours. My bad!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:47:18	@HannahGrego I have to say I've yet to see a fair point today. What point was it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:45:56	@HannahGrego ...irrelevant claptrap from dishonest interlocutors. Criticism of IWD as a thing does not originate there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:45:19	@HannahGrego You also missed that the Q is how IWD hurts. Hint: it doesn't. The whole premise is that the bawling about IWD from many is...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:44:32	@HannahGrego You missed "whatevers". Big category.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:43:53	@HannahGrego ..and mild. Sometimes mean and nasty. They both work in appropriate situation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:43:29	@HannahGrego Let me put it this way, I'm not the world's most sympathetic person to concern about tone. I'm a pluralist. Sometimes meek...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:42:55	@HannahGrego No glee at deriding questioners. Deriding dishonest interlocutors. Read again. I'm sensing your CONCERN about TONE is the issue
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:42:09	@SamanthaNBurton Deary me. I'm very sorry! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:38:01	@HannahGrego ...honest interlocutors don't exist and no one has claimed it does.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:37:43	@HannahGrego Tragically not everyone is an honest interlocutor willing to consider their own biases etc. It doesn't follow that...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:36:57	@HannahGrego Did anyone say critique was unfair or IWD was ultimate ideal? No. Did anyone say bulk of crit etc came from usual muppets? Yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:32:10	@logymichelle Ahhhh okay! I suppose traditional Oxidation/Reduction sequence inappropriate too? Far too acidic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:23:27	@BipolarBlogger @HannahGrego In other words, what Charlotte already said! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:22:58	@BipolarBlogger @HannahGrego Whilst we argue the niceties, the simple humanity of millions is questioned, derided and abused. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:22:32	@BipolarBlogger @HannahGrego One thing also to remember, and I oft forget, is peoples' very lives depend on some of these "debates". 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:21:33	@BaroqueChic Quite. Quite. {Puffs seriously on pipe. Bubbles come out}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:21:03	@BipolarBlogger @HannahGrego It is easy (for anyone, me incl) to forget/turn blind eye to more serious plight elsewhere. Def of privilege
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:19:56	@BipolarBlogger @HannahGrego Very much so. I totally agree.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:19:36	@HannahGrego I think there is reasonable room for reasonable dissent on most complex, social issues.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:18:58	@HannahGrego They don't. But nice to paint a full picture, in which they are a part...sadly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:16:44	@HannahGrego Sorry if what I said insinuated you were a newbie. Was trying to make distinction as general (not personal) point
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:14:58	@BaroqueChic Deary me! Diplomacy!? On TWITTER!? What next? Cats and dogs living together! Mass hysteria! ;-) Have a good one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:14:13	@HannahGrego @BipolarBlogger We were fighting? Dammit I thought we were being nice! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:13:39	@HannahGrego @BipolarBlogger ...and the occasional false positive. Not always but does happen.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:13:22	@HannahGrego @BipolarBlogger ...difference between genuine newbie and someone trotting out the standard tripe. Sadly this breeds cynicism...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:12:42	@HannahGrego @BipolarBlogger One problem is this is not a new debate. Some "old hands" have seen it all before and become adept at noting...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:12:02	@BaroqueChic Noooo! No worries at all. Terse request due to 140, not tetchiness on my part. You're fine. I have low dumbass threshold! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:11:11	@HannahGrego @BipolarBlogger ... IS sexism (or part of it). Big difference.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:10:50	@HannahGrego @BipolarBlogger Critical thinking NOT dismissed as sexism. Endless repetition of same tropes and disproven faux "critiques"...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:09:42	@HannahGrego @BipolarBlogger ...complex and nuanced understanding of feminism (and many other things) than is presented in popular press etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:09:17	@HannahGrego @BipolarBlogger *WE* do not pitch any such thing. It's a straw man. If you haven't, read up on intersectionality. It's a more..

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:04:45	@HannahGrego For example, I'm a sexist. I do sexist things. Can't help it. Grew up in sexist society. Have sexist ideas. The principle is...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:04:00	@HannahGrego oh and as for "us vs them" it's just not like that. As you say. There's no "them" for starters. Hence why my Q tongue in cheek.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:03:08	@HannahGrego Oh hells yes! As does 140 chars. I'm a) a gobshite and b) heavily into detail. This isn't the best medium for nuance. Fun tho!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:02:21	@BipolarBlogger @HannahGrego Yup And it is a statistical picture, not individual one. Princess Beatrice=more advantaged than me (on average)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:01:07	@BaroqueChic @EverydaySexism @CountDeadWomen I have a limit for dealing with doofuses. Once demonstrated to be beyond basic reason...*poof*!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 23:00:30	@BaroqueChic @EverydaySexism @CountDeadWomen Doesn't shock (as in surprise) me at all. Sadly. Although I'd be grateful if I could be @d out
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 22:57:13	@HannahGrego Look at it this way, I take it you (like me) strongly favour meritocracy? A situation where people succeed primarily on merit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 22:56:28	@HannahGrego I confess my q was more than a little tongue in cheek. The muppets are coming thick and fast today.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 22:55:55	@HannahGrego I too am hesitant. And I can't tell you if you're sexist or not until you do something sexist! What you said? Not so sexist ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 22:42:55	@Doubting_Tom @SpokesGay Oh absolutely. I don't want any of those fiscally irresponsible babies around me. They need to earn their rusks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 22:42:20	@Doubting_Tom @SpokesGay Sorry I got that wrong. Not "WIMMINZ" but "SAMELLY SLUTTY SECKS HASING WIMMINZ". My bad.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 22:17:13	@catrionax It's a more complex picture than presented to be sure. But then nuance, evidence etc. Not the strong point of these folks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 21:58:23	@hartfordwolf Wonderful. Thanks for letting me know. I'll sleep better knowing that, like him, you've missed the point of it all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 21:25:13	@Ox_22 Naughty person! I question your personal habits, breeding and general humanity!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 21:22:41	@Ox_22 Well dammit that's no fun! ;-) Can't we call each other names and stuff instead?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 21:16:52	@RobotNerdGirl @stuxnetsource @aperfectbalance There's a quote by G Greer about permanent revolution. Whatever else she's said, that's good
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 21:11:05	@stuxnetsource My feminism fucking well isn't! ;-) (Insofar as I am feminist, men describing self as feminist is potentially invidious IMO)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 21:03:23	@gingerdisco99 @Herring1967 Nov 20th?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 21:01:34	@Ox_22 It just amuses me that some people can't rise above zero sum thinking. If we reduce injustice X it doesn't stop anyone reducing Y
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 21:00:37	@Ox_22 ...eg along axes of class, colour, poverty etc. It's demonstrable that, statistically, comparable women are more disadvantaged 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:59:00	@Ox_22 AH! I missed that one. Mind you, I've seen these "stats" before. They miss the point. Painfully. OFC some men are disadvanted too 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:56:43	@WritersofColour Allowed to choose!? NEVER! YOU MUST WORSHIP ALL MY IDOLS! Dissent not tolerated. Heretics will be punished by UNFOLLOW! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:53:11	@VagendaMagazine And everyone knows we can't get women to check their breasts without tits on Page Three... ...wait. Waaaaait. Oh we can.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:52:01	@Ox_22 Not sure I understand what you mean by that. Care to elaborate?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:37:31	@misscassyL I'd actually agree with that point about acheivement. The rest? Good to know you started with an open mind. {eyeroll}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:36:01	@misscassyL Is that objectionable?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:35:54	@misscassyL Feminsim, at its core, at its base, is the radical idea women are people. Deserving of full equal rights and opportunites to men
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:35:08	@misscassyL Positive disccrimination is one possible tool in a whole toolkit, agree with it or not. And I get the patronising angle btw
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:34:39	@misscassyL Not really, totally misses the point. But hey, given your profile and how you arrived at this convo, I'm not surprised.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:30:54	@misscassyL And you're welcome to do that. Care to guess why?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:29:43	@WritersofColour I really don't like her support of pseudoscience etc but Oprah is an inspiration. She conquered a racist, sexist media
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:27:07	@sjfaulkner82 I've been told I am naughty for Doing Feminism just now, I'm suitably chastened. I shall be dragging my knuckles in penance.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:25:35	@Nick_d_Williams Awww is the diddums having a tantrum? I think you're beneath my contempt. Upgrade my au revoir to an adieu.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:25:04	Tell me misogynists/sexists/MRAS/whatever, how does having a day to focus of the demonstrable injustices perpetrated against women hurt you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:23:22	@sjfaulkner82 It's hurting me to do this even ironically/mockingly. I've lost feeling in the left half of my cerebrum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:22:22	@sjfaulkner82 KITCHENS ARE WHERE SAMMICHES COME FROM!!! {falls over}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:21:56	Oh and anyone dumb enough to not get the joke in the last tweet, please unfollow me. No, really.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:21:36	I am to pre-telling everyone I disagree with I am unfollowing them because it will really burn that I, an utter non-entitity, am doing that

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:13:15	@ThomasGrant85 @Herring1967 It took me the first 20 tweets to realise it... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:12:41	@sjfaulkner82 Yeah, sorry, I saw that and couldn't get it across in my 140! Need more practise! ;-) Totally not the place for that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:12:14	@Herring1967 You're secretly enjoying mocking the misogynists aren't you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:11:34	@sjfaulkner82 Why people can't get through their heads that once a year there's a day to think a little bit more about women is beyond me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:10:07	@sjfaulkner82 ...good idea. Eq parenting for abusive, abandoning muppets (overwhelmingly male sadly), much less good idea! ;-) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:09:37	@sjfaulkner82 Oh I dunno, interesectionality and all that. The problem in MRA analysis is typically shallow. Eq parenting = generally 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:07:23	@logymichelle @RealTimeChem Others have got there first, but seconding the radical approach. For benzylic halogenation it is the way to go
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:04:11	It's seems (looking at several timelines incl my own) that the MRAs and assorted morons are out in force for #IWD . Erm, yay? :-(
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:02:21	@Nick_d_Williams benightedly clueless respond to anything like IWD with "what about men?". It's missing the point. Not a zero sum game n/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:01:24	@Nick_d_Williams to note that. It's also not orthogonal to women's rights to help disadvantaged men. As just one example. Only the most 6/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:00:40	@Nick_d_Williams HGence why I mentioned intersectionality. Men ARE disadvantaged in many circumstances, it is not orthogonal to women's..5/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 20:00:04	@Nick_d_Williams The opposition to you is not some political opposite, but a different approach to evidence. I.e. respecting it. 4/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:59:41	@Nick_d_Williams The hypocrisy is not unnoticed. Amusingly the evidence based community are happy to correct their views on new evidence 4/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:58:46	@Nick_d_Williams at odds with the general claims made about economic meritocracy. You cannot cope with an intellectual meritocracy. 3/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:58:06	@Nick_d_Williams to articulate your judgements of others without criticism. As if your opinions are beyond analysis. It's fundamentally 2/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:57:24	@Nick_d_Williams You know what I find most hilarious about social conservatives and apologists for the status quo like yourself? You want1/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:56:39	@Nick_d_Williams It was regardless of whether you think so or not. Look into the history of social critique, not what your buddies tell you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:54:53	@Nick_d_Williams Irony!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:53:20	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter As if dialectics and social critique began with Marx. Tell me another one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:52:30	@LouisRedux @Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter Are you finished? Or shall I mock you some more? Intersectionality as Marxism, forsooth!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:51:20	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter glad to make you smile. A little more joy in the world.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:50:54	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter no ad him, learn what it means, just insults. Anyone daft enough to miss the point of #IWD worth it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:49:31	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter No attempt. Success. I do condescend to people like you, and with good reason.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:48:49	@Sixetyseven @RealTimeChem They didn’t! Worst acronym fail since the Central University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:47:58	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter I love the fact that not wishing to waste too much time on the eternally clueless is a bad thing
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:46:10	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter HAHAHAHAHAHA! Oh I love you guys.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:44:58	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter Ahhh I see. You're clueless. Thanks for playing. Au revoir.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:43:58	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter Oh and if it waddles like a duck, quacks like a duck, chances are it's a duck. Your tweet? MRAesque
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:43:02	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter Did anyone say it did? No. So LOL at YOUR clueless assumptions.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:42:13	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter Go read up on intersectionality. And keep your "wah what about men" to yourself for one day
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:40:39	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter The picture is more complex, and largely not in favour of women, than your lovely pictures represent
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:40:10	@Nick_d_Williams @Glinner @lauracwinter Oh how sweet my first MRA! Trying to improve the lot of women does not preclude helping men
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:38:04	@Glinner When I found out it's #IWD my willy fell right off. Just like my marriage broke when gay folk got married Oh no wait didn't happen
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:33:50	@markthomasinfo Ah the @fakedansavage approach to Santorum applied to The Nigel. I approve. It's a great way to do things. Nice one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:32:32	@Glinner But but but men are SO disadvantaged by these terrible women trying to be granted full human rights and not generally disadvantaged
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:31:25	@mjrobbins Selfish. I don't even have a writing gig and you want a whole day. The fact that I don't write and haven't tried is irrelevant.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:25:30	@robinince Imagine their disappointment when they discover it doesn't mean that there are lots of available women for exploitation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:24:37	@stavvers Ewwwwww...a musical! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:24:19	@rbs_6_nations @Nigelrefowens This comment from Nigel is the best thing in rugby reffing. Hell, it's the best thing in sport.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:23:03	It's like toilet training when a toddler. Eventually you learn to stop shitting your pants. Eventually you learn to stop shitting on women.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:21:34	So here's a moderate message of hope to all the young, slightly clueless young men (like I was) out there, you can learn not to be sexist!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:20:31	I suppose the difference is between being a bit of a clueless muppet due to upbringing in sexist society and being an active misogynist
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:19:46	despite being a (young, naive, clueless) sexist git (in terms of comments etc), the idea that women weren't disadvantaged was clear crap 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:18:11	Even when I was not described as feminist, I never understood why feminism was a "bad thing". I was ignorant but always supported women 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:05:30	But (and you knew there was a but) the nationalist hate/baiting aspect really pisses me off, and it is ever present in Wales v England 2/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-08 19:04:50	Sod it, I am just going to say it: I love banter between rugby teams etc. Good natured give and take is a joyous part of rugby. 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-07 21:57:32	@ool0n @stuxnetsource I'm going to have to opt for an "erm what?" om this one. I have no idea what you're talking about.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-03-06 21:16:45	@dana_sudo okay, I can accept that. I guess I mean that, to an outsider like me with v limited knowledge, it looks brave. Either way…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-21 21:40:46	@Giliell Good plan, I've got ten likely victims for that, and only two cocks. My time in Chernobyl was not wasted. (Tweet contains lies)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-21 21:39:37	@judeinlondon You did. But they never listen.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-21 21:38:02	@Giliell ...I am looking at my winkle in a worried way though. I've grown fond of it over the years and don't want it to fall off.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-21 21:37:29	@Giliell Cars and hoovers are nothing to worry about. No sadness needed, although a hugi s always good. But bad things happen in 3s...1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-19 07:22:37	@FuzzCookies A reasonable response. With or without concomitant rooftop dirty protest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-19 07:21:25	@FuzzCookies It is bad. Have you considered a killing spree or campaign of bombing? Those responsible must pay.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-18 06:59:30	@mjrobbins Big Media? Are they the ones who sell the pills I make in Big Pharma?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-18 06:58:17	@rbhu7 She’s in the Clarkson box (although at different level obvs), has unpleasant opinions for money. Can be dismissed easily.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-18 06:56:01	@rbhu7 She is…. Conveniently having odious and reactionary opinions for money very effectively isn’t she? That’s as kind as I am capable of.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-13 20:05:52	@Giliell @CarlieP If it's okay with you, I am extremely relieved! (And I agree, donkeys are cool)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-13 20:03:48	@judeinlondon Are you here all week? Should we tip our waitresses and try the veal?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-13 20:03:11	@Giliell @CarlieP Donating to a donkey sanctuary? Or an terrible attempt to get me to make an inappropriate joke?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-13 19:29:12	@CarlieP You too? Which week are you winning? I wouldn't want to clash
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-13 19:02:48	@CarlieP Just reminds me that we're no way near Utopia and there's a tonne of work to do. Pisses me off I have no magic wand! n/n

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-13 18:54:34	Not "NEWs", BBC article on France's treatment of Roma people reminds me that Europe's most discriminated against group still faces horror.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-13 18:30:54	@Markgatiss Yup, it's a wonderful bit of broadcasting and equally wonderful sentiment. From Texas too, I'm checking my bit of sky for swine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-13 18:19:42	@professor_dave @BBCMOTD THAT was brilliant. Brought a tear to my eye for all the right reasons.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-12 23:43:52	@tessakendall Okay NOW I'm getting paranoid! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-12 22:52:32	@paulcoxon You've just described what I have ready for Valentine's Day. I think I need to take a long, hard look at my life.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-12 22:08:03	@tessakendall I am choosing to take that as a compliment. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-12 18:38:45	@hotpatooties Okay, I need glasses. I glanced at your tweet and saw "I want a sheep for a month" and my mind went to places it shouldn't.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-12 18:32:30	@friendsofdarwin Isn't it Merry Darwin Day? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-12 18:31:11	@stevyncolgan I'm very glad you gave us sufficient detail there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-12 16:49:31	@tessakendall It did me no harm. {twitch} For given values of “no” and “harm”.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-12 16:47:31	Merry Darwin Day! Or is it Happy Darwin Day? I always forget. Either way may your banks be entangled and your selections natural and sexual
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-12 16:37:25	@DMReporter But what about UKIP? Will they be controlling weather by alternately encouraging and oppressing gay people?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-12 02:32:16	@dELYSEious That is a divorce level offence, I agree, but frankly I don't think it goes far enough. Have you considered defenestration?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 19:16:24	Also, it's a bit damp outside and underfoot. I hope everyone affected by the floods and adverse weather gets the help they need and is okay.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 06:50:17	@docfreeride @curiouswavefn THE PAIN!! THE PAIN!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 06:47:34	@scalzi This is true. I try to remember, when someone I like does something stupid, that I screw up on a daily basis. They’re human too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 06:41:23	@ScottMadin @docfreeride My face. It is in my palm. I can assure you my face is not the usual occupant. This makes me unhappy. I blame fools

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 03:58:31	@rebeccawatson You cannot buy talent like that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 03:28:53	@igmurray @EverydayAbleism That said, i tend to append "wilfully" to "stupid". Stupidity is fine. Making effort to be stupid is different.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 03:26:34	@igmurray @EverydayAbleism It's going to be a judgement call. Whilst the etymology is clear, there is linguistic distance. Heed Wittgenstein
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 03:18:55	@FeministaJones @judeinlondon Something to do with a lack of spoons or knives isn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 03:18:21	@DMReporter As I look at this photo I see Clegg saying "get orf moy laaaand", Cameron: "I is a new white rapper", Farage: "Because gays LOL"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 03:05:05	@michaellegge That mouse is taking the piss. Abandon veganism for a few minutes and get a shotgun.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 01:57:50	@Sectioned_ …downright invidious, counter productive and, and I mean this, evil.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 01:56:43	@Sectioned_ It’s a serious problem. Infantilising and patronising people with MH issues is endemic. Origin is obvious, some MH conditions…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 01:53:59	@Glinner @BoyceWP Oh but the poor dears are so terribly persecuted by nasty nasty gays being all human and reasonable right in front of them
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 00:33:06	@DMReporter Farage also manages to look like the biggest fuckwit of the three. No mean feat.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-11 00:02:34	@bmagnanti It was fed to lions? That's actually a really good outcome. Well, it is one of a series of possible less shitty outcomes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 21:40:01	@RevRichardColes That is simply rude. A gentleman's supermarket purchases are his private kingdom. Not to be sullied by the touch of others.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 21:38:52	@MoreThanChem Lock them in a cupboard for a day, let them out, tell them how they feel about you = gratitude. False, but you get a quiet day

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:23:45	@rbhu7 I want to be a good person and disagree with your terrible rhetoric. I'm not. I can't. Okay I can, but it's really tough. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:21:25	@BipolarBlogger @MindsLikeOurs ...a system stacked particularly against people with MH issues at all levels. 3/3

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:19:41	@BipolarBlogger @MindsLikeOurs For example, a nanny + health insurance would be amazing, and req serious cash. But if H ins inadequate 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:18:02	@BipolarBlogger @MindsLikeOurs Undeniably, and I am not in anyway diagreeing with you. I'm expanding the point that even with pockets 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:16:13	@BipolarBlogger @MindsLikeOurs I'm in a similar boat, although no way near as bad. I've lost 10 years to BP with flaky career etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:15:02	@BipolarBlogger @MindsLikeOurs The point I'm making is that even for privileged folk it can be about more than money (up to a point).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:13:41	@BipolarBlogger @MindsLikeOurs Challenging any form of privilege is controversial. It needs doing, and you did it spectacularly.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:06:42	@BipolarBlogger @MindsLikeOurs And just that, in current climate, makes access to psychological therapy v different for me than for him 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:05:59	@BipolarBlogger @MindsLikeOurs Absolutely. This is a very key fact that the stigmatisers forget. I don't have anything like Fry's cash. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:05:12	@MindsLikeOurs In fact, like you, I think he's been a very accurate voice He's described the (forgive me) highs and lows of his journey well
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:04:29	@MindsLikeOurs Absolutely. He has spoken with eloquence about the difficulty his MH (and his reluctance to accept treatment) has caused him.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:03:37	@MindsLikeOurs I agre, but our chums the MH stigmatisers do love to trot out "successful" folk as a counter to "normal" folks' hardships.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:02:24	@MadisonMissina ...fairly "serious" stuff. And then occasionally up pops a cock shot! Bloody hilarious. Keep up the amazing work! 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 20:01:19	@MadisonMissina I love following you because 99% of my TL is to do with science, activism (SW activism in your case), and generally... 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:58:55	@brianmoore666 @aurosan I'm surprised, given Fox's politics, that so many of them are women.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:53:40	@MindsLikeOurs Because people get faced with "why are you not Stephen Fry then? Bipolar hasn't hurt him.", for example. Which is asinine!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:52:57	@MindsLikeOurs Although I say "normalisation" with some caution. It can (and does) backfire. Celebs out about MH helps, but also hinders 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:52:05	@MindsLikeOurs I think in addition to education, the "normalisation" of MI and MH issues in general is one of the ways to combat stigma.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:51:15	@MindsLikeOurs The idea that *I* could be "mad", with all the internalised stigma associated, is a powerful incentive for bigotry.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:47:42	@MindsLikeOurs Definitely true. Although I think in my case denial was no small part of my reaction. Looking back all the signs were there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:45:22	@T0m0akl3y YOU CAN NEVER HAVE IT! Just like I can never get the £50 spent on cowboy boots during that period of life back. Bear the shame!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:43:37	@MindsLikeOurs I know, prior to my own MH issues I was one of them. The gods of irony got me good though! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:41:49	@DocHackenbush NO DICK JOKES? The world needs dick jokes. Of course, as a purveyor of same, I may be a teeeeensy bit biased.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:40:01	@MindsLikeOurs One thing about MH stigma is bigots try to have it both ways. MI itself makes you "bad" and MI is not real, so bad for faking
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:37:48	@MindsLikeOurs Or how about: being "mental illness doesn't really exist"? As if people with mental illnesses are somehow trying it on.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:36:49	@MindsLikeOurs I have more! Mental illness is necessarily a life sentence. a) depends on the disease and b) remission/recovery is possible.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:18:48	@paulcoxon This is a death penalty offence. Minimum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:18:23	@SLSingh Hi Dr Singh, is it best to contact you directly or management to entice you to do other SitP events? (I'm starting Maidenhead SitP)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:16:57	@MindsLikeOurs That people with mental illness are "different", "unreliable", and best of all "violent".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:15:03	@robinince I'm trying to get ~6 months worth of speaker sorted so there's no immediate rush

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 19:09:15	@mjrobbins @noodlemaz I don't know rights/wrongs of case, but scientific explanations tend to be ignored in favour of jerked knee as we know

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:59:32	@robinince ...as we are getting started we're very flexible. If another date suits you, we'll accomodate. 1st weds of month is the ideal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:58:57	@robinince I'm just starting Maidenhead SitP. We only have one speaker (March) confirmed, so dates from April open. 1st Weds of month but...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:55:35	@MCabournSmith During?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:44:22	@cupofcrow Did you fail to sacrifice you personal dignity on an altar to C*thy Br*nnan or something? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:23:40	@robinince Hi Mr Ince, is it best to contact you directly or management for a Sceptics in the Pub Talk (seeing as they are a bit informal)?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:17:26	@mjrobbins Are you in a flat (and hopefully above ground floor)? Or a house?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:13:09	@mjrobbins The words "oh" and "shit" spring rapidly to mind.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:12:08	@mjrobbins I've just checked my house too. luckily I'm far enough away from the rivers/reservoirs...I hope. Are you suitably elevated?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:05:03	@Fire_Pretty You are bravely skiving so others don't have to. Shit...does this mean I have to do some work?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:04:08	@Fire_Pretty Solidariskive?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:02:41	@Fire_Pretty I'm a lefty (UNDERSTATEMENT), if I can't berate others for their lack of solidarity how the hell will they know they are scum?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 18:00:46	@Fire_Pretty Don't shout "scab" at people? Fuck off indeed! That's the best bit!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 17:50:29	@rugbyschedule @annahkirsteeen Absolutely 100% behind this. Booing kickers, booing players, is not a suitable act in the rugby ethos.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 17:42:36	@GeorgeMonbiot @EricPickles Bloody right! Pickles' conduct in this has been disgraceful. Not unexpected though. The blame shifting is odious
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 17:22:33	@almurray By/In. Your word/The Thames' word.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-10 17:20:52	@JohnRentoul @mjrobbins Ah yes, "the ladder must be pulled up behind me" attitude. Can't have Romanians coming over here, taking our jobs...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 23:15:19	@Oglaf Oh don't rush, and I hope I am not rushing you. I'm just a dedicated Oglafist pining away in forlorn hope. Keep up the stunning work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 23:14:20	@zzzedkat In other words, if this is how you're feeling, you have my utmost sympathy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 23:14:02	@zzzedkat Horrible isn't it? I am amazed that for much of my life I never did this. Then WHAM mental illness and it's all I can do not to.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 23:12:24	@indiaknight I hate Big Brother, X-Factor and almost anything of the format "X on Y". I demand TV be stopped and we return to the old ways.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 23:09:29	@Oglaf I know you must get asked this all the time, but when, if ever, is the Apprentice character coming back?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 23:00:38	@Heresy_Corner @Maggie_McNeill Oooh Oooh! I know! Miss! Me, Miss! Pick the people who have never done SW but have an ideological bias. No?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 22:59:41	@ShappiKhorsandi Is it an all male panel show being quite unbearably (but sadly commonly) sexist towards women? Or something to with kids?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 20:04:03	@thus_spake_z @AllyFogg Don’t be ridiculous. I, a man, am confused. Surely that’s worse. (Hopefully obvious I am joking)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 18:51:44	@DrEvanHarris In other words: I believe this is naughty, so you have to too. How….tolerant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 18:28:15	@noodlemaz That’s true re: “less right” views. Maybe I’m feeling intolerant and dictatorial this Sunday. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 18:26:22	@Neuro_Skeptic Twitlonger saved my life. You can have it when you prise it from my cold dead hands! ;-) I may be exaggerating.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 18:22:15	@noodlemaz What a charmer, eh?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 18:19:58	@noodlemaz I’m not a fan of the BBC “balance” model of dealing with complex issues. That said, I’m not sure I have a better programme idea.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 18:16:51	@noodlemaz Brave. Very brave. BBCTBQ tends to give me apoplexy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 17:58:24	@noodlemaz Some might say that missing out on wittering Vatican apologists was a good thing. I’ll watch it for you, but will hold my nose!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 17:56:37	@KevanJonesMP @LabourLeft Shortly after Satan skis to work. A green-washed govt? Admit responsibility for poor management of env? Unlikely!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 17:53:25	@Fire_Pretty Better idea!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 17:51:41	@Fire_Pretty Ask nicely? Poke with sticks? Frowny faces?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 17:51:06	@DrAliceRoberts Arguing with creationists is only ever briefly entertaining. Their arguments are suspiciously poor and largely obfuscation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 17:48:45	@professor_dave @RachelReevesMP Your last sentence does not need a question mark. Marr et al are unusually soft on Tories too, not just men.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-09 00:19:33	Ireland looks good this year for the title. Two oddly lacklustre performances from a normally stellar Welsh team. Ireland out-thought them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 23:29:09	@there_runsMary @EnglandRugby I have some standards. Low standards. But they do exist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 23:26:53	@there_runsMary @EnglandRugby No! “Swing Low Sweet Chariot” contains a line about angels. Robbie Williams, forsooth!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 23:12:32	@there_runsMary @EnglandRugby Isn't there a song about that? #AHostOfAngelsComingFor Me {Does actions to song}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 23:08:12	@Pa_Dmcshane @there_runsMary @Nigelrefowens Yup. I'm also always amused by the contrast of a 5'8'' ref full on bollocking a 6'10'' monster!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 23:07:23	And by "pixies and angels" I mean the @EnglandRugby team and management. Harr harr harr. #COMEONENGLAND
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 23:06:28	I am not a religious man, but please can all the little pixies and angels make @EnglandRugby win the #CalcuttaCup today please? 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 23:04:40	@Pa_Dmcshane @there_runsMary My favourite line is from @Nigelrefowens when he tells players "This isn't football" (soccer) Damn right!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 22:54:27	@stevyncolgan Time for beer, crisps, rugby and moderate to intemperate swearing. I'm getting ready for the England match.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 05:36:19	Tigers determined to give me a heart attack this season I note. Many matches down to wire. #Tigerslive #Tigersfamily
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 05:19:21	Is it just me or, amazing though he is, does Goneva lose a lot of ball? #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 05:05:39	Is it too much to ask that Leicester crush all before them and the opposition roll over for a few games? Just to guarantee top 4 #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 05:03:39	I am a) impressed by Worcester’s skill and grit, and b) sufficiently distraught by Leicester not smashing them to eat my pubes. #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 02:13:50	@RevRichardColes Look, if you're going to make comments that can easily be mistaken for euphemisms you are going to get bad jokes you know.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 02:12:31	@hotpatooties @laurenlaverne I see the tweet following this is from a dating cmpany. It pleases me the word "merkin" triggered this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 02:10:31	@laurenlaverne @welltbh That said, I do worry that we are looking at the world's most bullied child.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 02:10:07	@laurenlaverne @welltbh This person is my new fashion guru. Slavishly following others is for the weak. Bravely breaking new ground FTW! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 02:07:26	@claspcharity @stevescullion @Redruthmason @AlysColeKing @davehardy73 Thanks very much. Keep up the inspirational work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 01:49:43	@AshleyGraf101 {Raises sympathetic and empathetic glass of something soporific in your honour and out of solidarity}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 01:19:29	@zaranosaur @davidwearing @docfreeride NOT FAIR! I didn't get a sword. I want one. {sulks}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-08 01:13:26	@rebeccawatson Is there no end to your wickedness? I ask because I want tips.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 23:08:57	@ImprobableJoe Oh the humanity!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 22:52:32	@ImprobableJoe Time to start drinking?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 22:49:40	@ImprobableJoe Good morning? I'll be the judge of that. (Things an ex boss used to say)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 22:49:10	@saspist @Dr_Teacake @VagendaMagazine I had Ben and Jerry one evening. Sorry, that should be Ben and Jerry's. My bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 22:25:45	@AdamRutherford I'm just starting M'head SitP, so you'd be one of our first speakers if willing. 1st Weds in month generally. Flexible tho
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 22:12:57	@l_wang_cen @SeeArrOh @Dereklowe My serious point is such knowledge is not necessary neutral or innocently used, I am scpetical of need.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 22:11:54	@l_wang_cen @SeeArrOh @Dereklowe ..knowledge as stick to beat employees with. I'm getting dangerously socialist and union friendly I imagine
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 22:10:54	@l_wang_cen @SeeArrOh @Dereklowe One thing I will add is it really biases the worker/employer relationship. Unethical bosses can use...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:51:40	@AmyDentata That said, perma weight gain is unusual + shocking. I sympathise entirely, personally (weight gain due to MH drugs) and prof.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:45:29	@AmyDentata It's just a bit tough to get all the data/nuance into a tweet. I need more practise!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:45:08	@AmyDentata Indeed. Even though I'm an evil (ex-Big) Pharma-ist, I'm certainly no apologist for the excesses of the industry. So I do get it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:44:14	@AmyDentata Ah that was when it was still within patent then Can I confess that the evils/virtues of Big Pharma are tough to discuss in 140?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:43:18	@l_wang_cen @SeeArrOh @Dereklowe ...I did what any good wage slave would do, which was shut the hell up and work hard! 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:42:53	@l_wang_cen @SeeArrOh @Dereklowe In my case I was bemused and a little upset tbh. But I had the job (a dream job at Big Name Pharma) so 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:41:51	@AmyDentata I confess your specific doc's/US situation may be different from my UK-centric perspective though. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:41:26	@AmyDentata Speaking for Big Pharma (Boo Hiss) olanzapine is off patent now IIRC, so Lilly isn't making the big bucks off it. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:37:59	@Dereklowe @SeeArrOh ...whilst I'm sure was hilarious, wasn't very relevant to 32 yr old me. 3/2+n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:37:29	@Dereklowe @SeeArrOh Vastly more than my refs, and IMO more than was necessary to screen me for suitability. Knowledge of 19 yr old me 2/2+n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:36:23	@Dereklowe @SeeArrOh Absolutely. When I worked for *BIG NAME PHARMA* I found after I'd started they'd done a big background check 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:34:47	@AmyDentata There's a worse when it comes to that old shit? ;-) Olanzapine is renowned for weight gain issues. Docs should be v aware.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:32:48	@SeeArrOh @Dereklowe At the very least consider an ex employer with whom there was blameless interpersonal conflict. Danger Will Robinson!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:31:06	@SeeArrOh @Dereklowe I'll confess it strikes me as creepy. I understand why it would be done, obviously, but it's fraught with pitfalls.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:01:59	@frockdoctrineuk Only reasonable response.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 21:01:15	@frockdoctrineuk EWW! I'll raise you one better: Michael Gove + Eric Pickles MMF romp
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 20:58:07	@frockdoctrineuk I have disturbing mental images involving sex, scottish independence and quite what England thinks it's bloody doing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 20:57:13	@frockdoctrineuk Agreed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 20:56:05	@frockdoctrineuk Oh hell yes. Creepy over involvement is def not my thing. I'm not sure this analogy is working re: Scotland though!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 20:53:28	@frockdoctrineuk Yeah. I confess I shouldn't have an opinion on this, I know too little. I guess I'm a lover, I hate to see break ups! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 20:52:44	@frockdoctrineuk And the Tories/England have historically (recently) treated the Scots v poorly, so I do see an argument for independence
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 20:51:07	@frockdoctrineuk Can't argue with THAT downside! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 20:50:47	@AdamRutherford Maidenhead (45 mins out of Paddington). Travel expenses, beer etc covered!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 20:22:13	@frockdoctrineuk Only due to FPTP system (shitty thing it is). I like the Scots and want to make up for centuries of shit by keeping them!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 20:21:04	@stevyncolgan You're being hijacked by squirrels. Hand over the Topic bars and any Snickers you have secreted about your person.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 20:19:55	@frockdoctrineuk It's reverse psych, he wants them gone. Fewer Labour voters = Tory rule forever in remaining UK. STAY SCOTLAND!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 20:18:42	@garwboy Oh but he has. No Scotland will be good for Tories. Think of all those Labour voters gone when Scotland leaves the union.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 19:52:20	@jearle Oh the humanity! (Best of luck)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 19:17:49	@AdamRutherford Hi Dr Rutherford, if I wanted to get you to do a Sceptics in the Pub talk, is it better to ask you or go via management?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 19:13:06	@robinince If I wanted to beg you to do a newly minted Sceptics in the Pub talk at some point in the future, do I contact you or your agent?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 18:28:04	@stevyncolgan Crikey, it must be terrifying! ;-) (And thanks)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 18:25:55	@stevyncolgan What does a boy have to do to get you to come and speak at his (soon to be) newly minted Sceptics in the Pub?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-07 00:34:00	@jonronson If you were a fan of the first series I would say "yes definitely". I'm not sure if series 2 is as strong, but it is worth it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-05 19:38:19	@ArfurSmith @Jo_Caulfield If a man speaks in a wood and no woman is around to hear him, is he still wrong? My wife's answer: Yes.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-05 16:34:59	@CCriadoPerez I am married to a woman. This means I'm expert on feminism and have magic powers that protect me against sexism. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-05 16:30:41	@AWTaylor83 @professor_dave We all need coffee! ;-) The mandate thing might be debatable depending on your position re compulsory voting etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-05 16:21:49	@laurenlaverne I'm with you on "Non Traditional Sexual Relations"... ...wait, that doesn't sound like something I should tweet to a lady.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-05 16:20:57	@AWTaylor83 @professor_dave Surely "total possible vote" =/= "vote [at] last election". Poor voter turnout thus equates to poor mandate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-04 20:39:48	@BipolarBlogger Me either, but got to be worth a shot!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-04 20:35:48	@BipolarBlogger You’ll be grand. Given what you’re training to do I reckon you’re due an OBE! Shall we start a write in campaign? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-04 20:32:39	@BipolarBlogger You’re having a rough old time of it of late mood-wise? I hope everything gets better and diazepam does its job.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-03 06:45:07	@EmmaK67 No. They made me feel that way too. Walt's a very easy anti-hero to love. I'll spare you spoilers.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:31:34	@leyton_rees @IamAustinHealey Sweetie, I’m a fan of the sport. I enjoy Wales’ success. I loathe negative ABE morons. So which are you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:29:24	@WillGreenwood @EnglandRugby 100% agreed. Excellent play all round from Care. Superb to see him in form.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:25:36	@leyton_rees @IamAustinHealey Awww sweet. It tweets a match it once won. Congrats!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:23:17	@there_runsMary Wing Chun for me. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:22:55	@IamAustinHealey The ABE contingent are always pathetic. Ignore them, they’re bitter, lesser wankers. Harsh but fair. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:20:49	@louistheroux @NietzscheQuotes So do dolphins. I think dogs laugh too IIRC.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:19:58	@there_runsMary The last tweet comes with a very large winking smiley.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:19:36	@there_runsMary Actually I’m horribly aggressive, hence why I work very hard not to be. Apparently punching everyone you want to is naughty.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:09:10	Care at pace is terrifying. I’m a Leicester/Youngs man through and through, but Care is superb at his best. #CarryThemHome #RBS6Nations
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:06:13	@IamAustinHealey Sadly not. Gutted. But England can do it. #RBS6Nations #CarryThemHome #bbcrugby
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:05:18	@RespectSexWork Very true I do shudder a little (okay a lot) at the admittedly minor stupidity of youth. The stupidity of middle age however
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:02:06	@FuzzCookies @davechalk Well you know, normally it would….
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:01:46	@willcarling And when they have it, hold it. Too many unforced errors. Too much deer in headlights. France need a good thrashing!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 02:00:54	@EnglandRugby #CarryThemHome COME ON ENGLAND!!!!!!! You can do it. You have the talent, personnel and drive. Stuff the Frenchies 2nd half!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:59:45	@FuzzCookies @davechalk Awww nasty. Look, I am watching France beat England ATM. I don’t need soap stars’ wanking faces in my TL! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:57:43	@IamAustinHealey Definitely agreed Austin England gave the talent, personnel and grit to do it. The question is not whether they can it’s if
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:54:36	@martin_crowson Eminently possible win for England. Need less deer in headlights/errors. Battering French defence on occasion.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:53:21	@RespectSexWork If bigots never changed I wouldn’t be where I am now. 19 year old accidentally sexist me is not 39 year old feminist me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:51:44	@LewisMoody7 @dannycare @mikebrown_15 Aggressive, brilliant grounding from Brown. Loved it. He really deserves his spot IMO.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:49:47	@IamAustinHealey I am a huge fan of Mr Owens, but even I was frustrated at that last phase or two of play. But generally Mr Owens is great.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:48:42	@bobbyllew I have the same issue. My family think I am the Cyber Warrior, in reality I can just about spell “computer”.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:40:23	@WillGreenwood Tell me, Will, does lacklustre anthem singing indicate lack of passion/commitment? Today’s anthem was less than enthusiastic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:38:58	@WillGreenwood @EnglandRugby They need a Cockers/Fergie style hairdryer experience at halftime. Seasoned performers doing deer in headlights
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:32:05	@WillGreenwood @EnglandRugby Granted, but this is a touch woeful from England. We have the talent, we have the personnel. Come on England!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:20:25	@there_runsMary Yes, my lapse in concentration is really the problem! ;-) and England are getting a kicking at the mo too. No gloating.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:19:36	@there_runsMary Exactly. But with a certain style, no small amount of panache, and with the faintest whisper of garlic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:03:23	@WillGreenwood Fucking right now after the fucking French fucking scored.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:02:45	@there_runsMary Incidentally, I am an ardent Francophile in all matters….except during the rugby. I’m very English when it comes to rugby.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:01:51	@there_runsMary ouch!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 01:00:31	@there_runsMary Agreed. No anthem passion. Always a bad sign. Except for one thing: COME ON ENGLAND!!!!!! #CarryThemHome #6Nations
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 00:59:35	COME ON ENGLAND!!!! #CarryThemHome
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-02 00:57:18	COME ON TIGERS!…..erm…. I mean COME ON ENGLAND!!!!!! #RBS6Nations #Tigersfamily #bbcrugby

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 20:58:24	@rbhu7 @there_runsMary I believe it. Ballet is rock hard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 20:57:41	@ool0n Is this what the scourge of the FREEZE PEACH interwebs is reduced to? Posting cute baby pictures? Impressive! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 20:51:36	@sueperkins You are about to criticise cat images on the web?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 20:51:01	@DocHackenbush Actually, you're right. That is an important distinction, I yield to Nanny Plum's obvious superiority.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 20:27:48	@DocHackenbush True, true. I will accept Nanny Plum is good, but she lacks the acid casualty loveliness of Makka Pakka.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 20:24:59	@DocHackenbush Fuck off! Makka Pakka. (Yes I am kidding around)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 18:41:19	@rbhu7 @there_runsMary In all seriousness I'd doubt they'd outrun anyone but the forwards (fatties like me!). Rugby backs are v fit + v fast
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 18:24:00	@mePadraigReidy It’s atherosclerotic fun all the way through! Mayonnaise and fried egg optional.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 18:20:46	@mePadraigReidy A chocolate digestive sandwiched between rashers of bacon. I could be wrong, but now I’m hungry.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 18:19:56	@there_runsMary I’ll let someone younger, fitter and much larger do it! This doesn’t narrow the field much!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 18:18:56	@Gabby_Logan I agree. Although if the pitches are actually flooded, well, it’s tricky to swim and spin pass at the same time!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:56:05	@Dr_PaulC That I sympathise with. After all, looking out of the lab window at sunshine is better than the alternative!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:52:27	@PastorScooby Ahhh procrastination. I know it well!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:50:25	@PastorScooby @OUstudents i have exactly the same day. Starting S104 today to be interrupted by shouting at the telly for a couple of hours.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:49:34	@there_runsMary It's not an uncommon feeling I understand. He's apparently quite arrogant. Although that's hearsay
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:46:20	@there_runsMary And by maimed I mean mildly, reversibly injured and out of the Leics matches! I'm too nice for anything else.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:45:37	@there_runsMary Oh on that I agree with you, just in the 79th minute of the last match. I'm a Tigers fan and Sarries keep beating us!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:37:08	@there_runsMary @rbhu7 Apparently. I have no idea who they are if I'm honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:36:50	@there_runsMary @rbhu7 Okay, not Man Utd. They are a bunch of over paid knobs who could not win a trophy if their lives depended on it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:35:20	@there_runsMary @rbhu7 1) Ireland, 2) England, 3) Wales and/or Man Utd.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:31:08	@Dr_PaulC Bitter about Valentine's Day or some other reason? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:21:01	@FuzzCookies Erm...not that I would know of course. A friend told me. Honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:20:40	@FuzzCookies Very VERY sensible choice.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-02-01 17:19:03	@FuzzCookies Now that WOULD keep you awake.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-22 19:52:20	@DannyJohnJules @mrjamesob Crikey! I'd have thought RD paid sufficiently after a series or two, shows how over the top prices got/get.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-22 19:41:26	@DannyJohnJules @mrjamesob Danny, does this mean that whilst you were filming Red Dwarf you were still at home? (Or have I misunderstood?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-22 05:10:37	@CCriadoPerez But if a penis haver does not tell her, how will she know? I must now tell people things, because penis. Excuse me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-22 00:32:32	@CarlieP I will drag my Man Flu ridden self over there. Thanks

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-19 03:40:31	@RugbyTigers Tigers are doing it again aren’t they? They’ll win in the 79th minute to mess with my heart rate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-19 03:00:31	@judeinlondon I never doubted it. Do potential husbands require a thorough medical?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-19 02:59:39	@judeinlondon A reflection of his weak heart or your awesome or both?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-19 02:57:26	@RevRichardColes Some people pay good money for that… …allegedly. The bishop told me. Honest. Oh look! Is that a diversion?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-19 02:54:21	@trevorlarge @RugbyTigers @RugbyUlster_ Tigers every time. Because…erm…just because all right? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-19 02:53:23	@RugbyTigers @RugbyUlster_ Which I have been assured is air tight. @WelfordTheTiger told me. {innocent whistle}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-19 02:02:03	@LeicesterTigers Come on Tigers! (Slightly muted due to having the lurgy)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-19 01:45:58	I am sat on the sofa waiting for kick off. Tragically I have the lurgy so I won’t be celebrating the inevitable Tigers triumph with beer.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-19 01:43:19	@DrMRFrancis Had last TV for ~17 years, it was a CRT + a weird badge of honour. Replaced it last year, wonder why I waited. Flat Screen FTW!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-18 19:35:16	@stevyncolgan @lizloz Took me ages to work it out as well. It seems I'm in greater danger of voting UKIP than I thought. THE HORROR!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-18 18:44:12	@harpistkat Hurr Hurr “conference”… …I don’t get it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-18 18:41:46	@stevyncolgan The great Gdo TYPO strikes me again. All praise be to his corrective fluid and the unnoticed autocorrect of holiness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-18 18:40:17	@stevyncolgan And that would be brain damage. Oh no! It’s started already!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-18 18:38:42	@stevyncolgan That high? ;-) A vote for UKIP can, for me, only come after severe begin damage and torture in a reeducation camp. So soon!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-18 18:36:30	@stevyncolgan Hmm credibility or just voting for someone who reflects the same petty bigotry? Nasty, malicious “protest” votes? I never know
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-18 18:34:22	@stevyncolgan They had credibility?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-18 18:31:41	@brianmoore666 I bet they’ll give it 110% too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-18 18:29:18	@MCabournSmith I thought he made cheese.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-18 18:25:23	@Fire_Pretty I thought it was hurricanes? I know boobs cause earthquakes and atheists cause wars. Why can’t the bigots make their minds up?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-17 17:00:15	@bryankaplan ...powerful out of all proportion. I guess, although I love horror, I shouldn't write it! ;-) 6/far too many.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-17 16:58:33	@bryankaplan ...security issue. Better locks etc, fewer serial killers! The only thing that scares me is petty malice. It seems to be 5/n

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-17 16:55:07	@bryankaplan Flippancy aside, I rally tried to think of something that would put me in the foetal position. Standard horror tropes like 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-17 07:08:08	@AllyFogg Q1: Who diddles hard working families more, corporate tax evasion or benefit fraudsters? Q2: Who has the better lawyers?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-17 06:01:12	@bryankaplan Tax returns, mothers in law and existential angst.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-16 21:29:46	@jearle Is that Merry New Laptop Day or Happy New Laptop Day? I don't want to cause offence.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-16 21:00:21	@StereochemQuiz Crikey! I'll behave myself and enter serious answers then.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-16 20:24:16	@StereochemQuiz Oh is this an automatic quiz where one question leads bot like to another via Twitter?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-16 20:23:10	@lovebombmusic You had to remind me of their existence so no I don’t know who the insignificant babbler is. Probably another pointless hater
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-16 06:36:02	@scalzi Does it have, perhaps ironicaly, "NO GURLZ ALOWD" in it anywhere?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 17:11:51	@StereochemQuiz Oh no! Has my precoffee brain let me down. I guess it's back to the drawing board! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 17:08:39	@StereochemQuiz They are known as Brian. To their friends. Or Stereoisomers to their casual acquaintances.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 16:08:24	@robinince @jonmsutton @MitchBenn Atheism = belief. Check! Atheism is due to something bad. Check! Standard theist shit, back to sleep.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 16:04:44	@IamCarrieeeeee @MelNaray2nd In time I will find a way to live with this. It may involve beer. ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 16:02:11	@CCriadoPerez Two words: back dated pay for all now! Okay, that’s not two words. I need coffee.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 16:00:30	@marcuschown I have words. Granted they are mostly very naughty words….
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 15:58:52	@Glosswitch Oh great! Now I’m sitting around furious. I need two coffees before contemplating George.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 15:58:11	@melb4886 @tobymutz101 @NHAparty Which whilst a bit odious and naive, is ripe with comedy. Mind you, that is the humorous view, not factual.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 15:57:19	@melb4886 @tobymutz101 @NHAparty It does seem from the outside that French political corruption is aimed at getting older men legovers tho.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 15:55:35	@SamCoatesTimes @NHAparty They go over there, taking their jobs…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 15:54:16	@futilityfiles @BathysphereHat Well you see this is because of your Pink Fluffy Lady Brainz. Management of your life is better done by penis
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 15:48:06	@IamCarrieeeeee @MelNaray2nd Always leopard print. Always. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 07:07:25	@garwboy Ridiculous! People on Twitter expressing legitimate opinions. The very idea.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 02:26:54	@FuzzCookies Yup. I was about to say "and we call these people 'misogynists'".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 02:25:51	@FuzzCookies Some people will do ANYTHING to distract from or deny women's testimony.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 01:42:35	@gingerdisco99 I've failed this already. Practically every day of my life.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 01:20:41	@y_alibhai But of course. It's inherent in our Britishness. Why there are songs about it and everything. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 00:53:08	@WhatsOnStage @CarlieP I bet the old charmer played up to it something rotten too! Good on him if he did.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-15 00:29:47	@rbhu7 I feel the same way about Carry On films. Great examples of British Lechery. (Something you should search YT for. Funny)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 23:05:02	@EverydaySexism @itunes Dear iTunes. please reconsider marketing this game full stop. It's pretty damned horrendous.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 23:04:12	@rbhu7 The fact that there is a vicar involved serves only to reinforce this. What next, a matron?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 22:59:07	@rbhu7 You do realise this whole thing is predicated on me deciding you are the reincarnation of Sid James for the day, right? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 22:48:05	@rbhu7 I'm so old I remember when porn was something you found under bushes. Etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 22:47:37	@rbhu7 The porn part or the mags part? :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 22:46:46	@rbhu7 Post...1970s expression of lust...I'm guessing porn mags. I'm right aren't I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 22:46:02	@PolycrystalhD I decided to take that as a compliment because it was in fact v organised and productive! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 22:45:40	@PolycrystalhD When I was doing my PhD (synth org chem) we had school kids tour the lab. I was told my hood was best because was "cluttered"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 22:23:34	@EmmaK67 Self reflection and awareness do not appear to be strong suits for this lady. Either that or she has a hide like a rhino.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 21:54:49	@pari_passu @david_colquhoun But but the free market will discriminate against bad business because... .oh I can't even make jokes about it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 21:53:52	@FuzzCookies Dont take it likely. Some of those knob jokes take, ooooh, 3 or 4 seconds to come up with.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 21:52:42	@FuzzCookies We also supply an excellent line in knob jokes and general rudeness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 21:50:33	@LoriAdorable 1) You are not a perma fuck up, 2) missing 1 class does not ruin academic careers, 3) explain to adviser they should be decent
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:46:49	@frockdoctrineuk As a parent I could have saved cash and told them this! ;-) when the spawn is smearing shit on you, happiness is far away
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:43:21	@stevyncolgan We’ve entered the 1970s comedic farce mode now haven’t we? Naughty!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:41:48	@pwk2013 @Independent ^ not the least. Curse autocorrect!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:41:21	@pwk2013 @Independent Oh, and for him to call anyone “Harry Potter poofs” is painfully ironic. He’s to the least campy, wizardly character.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:38:21	@pwk2013 @Independent I couldn't possibly comment, Your Honour. However I am lead to believe he has had success in the comedy and film arena
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:37:22	@WillGreenwood Yes, and I'm saving my pennies for a booking.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:36:46	@garwboy Make yourself feel better by reading the comments under a YouTube video. Wait...I meant worse didn't I?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:34:17	@DMReporter It'll cause cancer next week, you mark my words. Cure it the week after.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:32:22	@pwk2013 @Independent Personally, if anyone cares, I find his liberalism a bit shallow and his advocacy of not voting dangerous.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:31:13	@pwk2013 @Independent I think the comic in question meant he looked unpleasant, contagious and generally liverish. I could be wrong. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:30:10	@frockdoctrineuk Yeah maybe, but your habit has a (tragically) stronger basis and isn't bad self protection. Mine is just because I'm a git!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:29:03	@frockdoctrineuk ...but I know a lot about mocking clueless bigots! Hence why I can take criticism of cishets like me easily and learn 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:27:53	@frockdoctrineuk It's a bad habit of mine, I'll try to be a bit more telegraphed in my supportive humour. I don't know much about trans..1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:26:50	@BipolarBlogger ZOMG WOMEN'S THINGS! THE TERROR! Doing calories for brunch too. Today is Full English day. It's been one of those mornings.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:24:55	@frockdoctrineuk Not a problem. I tend to err on the side of tweeting people happyish, agreeableish, jokish things out of solidarity.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:22:16	@frockdoctrineuk I meant you and I taking the piss out of the clueless btw. Did I do it wrong?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:21:24	@pwk2013 @Independent One comedian described him as the walking embodiment of hepatitis. If that helps.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:20:23	@BipolarBlogger Morning. Tea? Sympathy? Trip to nearest pub? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:18:30	@frockdoctrineuk I have both in the house, so sure. Does this come with side order of mocking the clueless?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:16:06	@frockdoctrineuk If we're not miserable can we change to English Breakfast?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:09:28	@garwboy Time to go and check for old, misdirected post?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 19:07:30	@TomPowdrill @MitchBenn 24!? They could staff a small company with that. Will no one think of Hard Working British Family Traditional Jobs?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 18:57:25	@Chemistry_Kat That is amazing! Well done for going for it. It is a fun molecule isn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 10:22:21	@MsMayaMidnight @mistressmatisse Really? Must get some in then. I wonder what it will do for men?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 10:19:17	@Cybren @Jenny_Trout Coming from a professional, yup. Coming from some random, it's just big standard ignorance and prejudice.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 10:09:39	@Jenny_Trout The problem is people are depressed in other bits of the world. They die from TB, malaria etc first. MH denialists piss me off
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 10:07:33	@felixslp @DumpyStig @debecca @FuzzCookies Not mine, sadly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 10:06:45	@DumpyStig @IDS_MP That is, of course, one interpretation. Personally I would have put Jeremy Hunt in the spunk bubble.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 10:02:25	@DumpyStig @IDS_MP I will grant you it looks a bit of a crap penis, and parallels thus abound, but really! There's not even a spunk bubble.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 09:57:47	@mistressmatisse I've been paying attention. Lemme see, 1st rule of not being a muppet is listen to the people you're talking to. 2nd = same
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 09:55:58	@mistressmatisse You did smack them very well. Why, it's almost like you do something similar professionally.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 09:55:16	@DumpyStig @IDS_MP How dare you insult the noble penis by comparison with Iain Bowel Syndrome or whatever his name is.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 09:48:20	@DumpyStig @felixslp @debecca @FuzzCookies I *almost* want it for the annual piss taking events that are guaranteed in perpetuity.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 09:47:00	@felixslp @debecca @DumpyStig @FuzzCookies That contains much awesome!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:56:12	@WowbaggerOM @SallyStrange Spoilsport. I was going for ridiculous tweet of the year.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:54:53	@BipolarBlogger Me too, although not sure if I regret this yet! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:52:42	@SallyStrange Vaginas = Berlin Wall? This is why my wife has gun nests on her knees and Checkpoint Charlie up her bum It all makes sense now
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:50:44	@BipolarBlogger I'll keep working as long as there's jobs for me, and to keep my hands dirty! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:49:53	@BipolarBlogger Sure. Doing an OU degree in biology, retraining to get out of pharma and do biomedical research into mood disorders.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:49:04	@DumpyStig @FuzzCookies oh we'd all do THAT if we could!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:48:45	@BipolarBlogger If there's no (potential) side effects, it's not working. Receptor redundancy is a pain in the arse. Mother Nature is lazy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:47:22	@FuzzCookies The man presents himself as a bit of a knob end though. I hope in real life he's a bit more decent.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:46:39	@BipolarBlogger Lol. Not pharma for long...changing careers ATM. There's not much pharma left in the UK.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:45:50	@Lord_Sugar "Pond life" is surely a bit strong, wouldn't you say? At worst the chap's guilty of woeful comic timing and being a bit crass.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:44:13	@FuzzCookies I'm sure he cries into a big pillow made of cash because we mere mortals think he's a bit of a joke really.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:37:00	@BipolarBlogger Yup. But in many ways we're still in the dark ages with good MH drugs. (You know this is what I do, right?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:34:06	@BipolarBlogger I'm of (v. mixed) immigrant stock, so this is just amazing to me. I don't burn unless I really try to be dumb. Sounds awful
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:32:41	@BipolarBlogger Ha, yeah. When you're "well" or managing, who knows. Tempting to find out, but usually a shockingly bad idea to try.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:05:45	@hijinksensue @wedgex Sad? But the song tells us that tequila, it makes you happy. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:04:51	@FuzzCookies We at LouisCorp Try to cover the little details. It's what sets us apart.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:04:11	@BipolarBlogger Precancerous lesions? Whoa! Side effect of lithium (I'm thinking of the skin issues it can cause) or just something else?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:02:49	@rebeccawatson Thankfully I can now go to sleep, comforted by that knowledge. No. Really.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:01:47	@FuzzCookies Smart move. Do you have a van preference? Any thoughts on the greasiness of the large gentlemen?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 08:00:48	@pourmecoffee @edyong209 Needs more rapey necrophiliac mallards.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:59:51	@FuzzCookies Both. Mixers for the Southern Comfort or is that heresy?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:59:28	@BipolarBlogger Yikes! I saw you say you'd taken the antipsychotic drugs late. I imagine that's a big factor.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:58:33	@FuzzCookies What flavour Doritos? This is important stuff.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:57:47	@debecca @BipolarBlogger I am the very model of decorum and restraint. I have barely made any sex jokes at all. Apart from all of them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:56:09	@mistressmatisse Actually it's not true...that just sounded creepy even to me!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:55:50	@mistressmatisse Oh that's just mean. True. But mean! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:55:13	@BipolarBlogger I'm doing the same thing. #BedTweeting
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:54:13	@FuzzCookies Okay, some large greasy men, a van, then a cheeky trip to nearest boozer. Any preferences?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:52:03	@mistressmatisse I've been giving away freebies again. I'm part of the problem. {SHAME}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:50:46	@stavvers Rimjob Racist!!!!! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:01:59	@debecca @DumpyStig @FuzzCookies Ah yes...I should have triangulated tweet knowledge. My bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:00:44	@FuzzCookies @DumpyStig @debecca Like the best of us do!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 07:00:22	@DumpyStig @FuzzCookies @debecca Proof!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:59:31	@rebeccawatson @tkingdoll @OpheliaBenson And you might hurt his Important Man FeeFees. Or deprive him of vital feminist cookies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:58:26	@FuzzCookies @DumpyStig @debecca You would prefer to report for Disapproval?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:57:49	@kausikdatta22 @stephenfry I'm a fan, but Self Approved Sauces? Ungentlemanly!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:57:05	@FuzzCookies @DumpyStig @debecca Your guilty feelings prove you are a deviant. Report to your Local Deviancy Centre for Approval.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:55:27	@DumpyStig @debecca @FuzzCookies BTW PBCW is brilliant and I shall, with the aid of my beleaguered Mrs, be giving it a bash.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:54:44	@DumpyStig @debecca @FuzzCookies I don't know her well enough to comment... ...But yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:51:31	@kausikdatta22 @stephenfry This is true, but only Approved Sauces. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:50:32	@Izaakson Advertising slogan: Crocs: for when giving up totally just isn't enough. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:48:21	@DumpyStig @debecca @FuzzCookies True, true.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:48:07	@TheNickHelm About to watch it now, am expecting big things.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:45:59	@DumpyStig @debecca @FuzzCookies I remember that scene! Most disturbing bit of American Horror Story S1.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:44:57	@stephenfry Does sir like a Hollandaise? Oh you wicked, wicked man. I bet you're right up for a Marie Rose aren't you? Deviancy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:42:42	@caitlinmoran Righty ho! But would you want to walk in on it...actually, that's not a great question is it? :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:41:17	@drlfarrell @elinlowri @wordpressdotcom @djnicholl Sorry we don't use the words "in praise of the DM" even as sarcasm. They don't get it ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:40:11	@DumpyStig @debecca @FuzzCookies Yeah, talking about cry wanking, getting us all tearful and excited.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:35:08	@debecca @DumpyStig @FuzzCookies I'm sowwy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:34:31	@Chemtacular @Chemjobber Well if he means our next King it means waffle on about buildings, love homeopathy and charge too much for biscuits
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:32:39	@DumpyStig @FuzzCookies @debecca Is that a famous person over there? {points} {runs} {in no way vanishes for a cry wank}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:31:26	@debecca Don't blame me for THAT mental image! I'm innocent, guv.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:30:01	@debecca {Hugs} I hope it all goes well for you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:29:19	@DumpyStig @FuzzCookies @debecca Depends on whether it's "make" or make I'd guess.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:28:27	@caitlinmoran {Raises hand} Erm, Miss. I'd like to have 258953 creepier possibilities taken into account, ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:25:37	@DumpyStig @FuzzCookies @debecca That's just not good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:25:16	@debecca @FuzzCookies @DumpyStig I'm male, if I cry when I come it's out of sheer gratitude.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:24:08	@FuzzCookies @debecca @DumpyStig Celebrate Thatcher Day because it's inspiration for doing it better next time. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:23:45	@FuzzCookies @debecca @DumpyStig Celebrate Guy Fawkes because we need to do better next time. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:21:38	@FuzzCookies @DumpyStig @debecca I have to admit the crying wank is impressive work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:11:51	@Chemtacular @Chemjobber Yeah. You're clearly not thinking hard enough. Now concentrate, think big alveoli and bronchioles.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:09:49	@FuzzCookies @debecca Thatcher day, because Guy Fawkes night is too far away and I need to set fire to shit. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:08:25	@girlonthenet Hahahahahahahahahaha. No. Sorry but due to financial and reality deficiencies the current govt will not allow that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 06:05:41	@Chemtacular @Chemjobber Ok so I'm not in America, but I do love the "don't get sick" one. I'll get right on that. {Thinks very hard}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 04:13:51	@Chemtacular I love a good follow! ;-) I think it's a subtle manipulation of Twitter manners. A follow is a nice thing, good advertising.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 04:02:34	@Chemtacular Definitely. We chemists need a right good compensating. Some more jobs around wouldn't be a bad start.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 03:51:17	@Chemtacular I will. Although, I do feel the world need more Latina chemists in fiction. Accurately portrayed of course!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 03:44:27	@Chemtacular BUY MY BOOK! Erm, I have no idea.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 01:03:41	@jesswynn93 ...I learned to knock that nonsense off pretty fast! Luckily!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 01:03:25	@jesswynn93 I remember when I just started A-levels and saw -COOH written down as a functional group. I thought that my textbook was wrong..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 01:00:22	@simonpegg I thought that was Scorpio. Must be, I've always thought astrology was bullshit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 00:59:29	@TaraFlynn I was just thinking that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 00:57:41	@TaraFlynn I WILL NEVER KNOW!!! ARGH!!! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 00:57:15	@AmandaMarcotte But these are busy people with opinions. How dare you expect them to read before cramming their opinions down your throat?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-14 00:56:26	@TaraFlynn So, erm, what are the other seven things?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 21:04:29	@RevRichardColes If it's not one thing, it's your mother.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 20:29:32	@RugbyTigers All good things to hope for, and yes, the Tigers squad certainly has the talent to take Sarries. I'm just a bit wary.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 20:22:34	@RugbyTigers Sarries = scary. They battered us last meeting, there's something about them this season. I would not put the double past them
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 05:59:44	@Jo_Caulfield @Smytheo @IanClem @misterheeley @andro1317 @MatthewMclane @Cariaddraig Nothing says hilarious like celebrity amoebic dysentery
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 05:44:45	@Jo_Caulfield By being on Celebrity Big Brother they've all already lost. So much. So very, very much.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 05:35:59	@RichardWiseman The one with the curly hair. The male one who looks a bit like an otter. I think. Frankly I think it's none of them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 05:25:59	@bmagnanti We men must be placated with cookies otherwise we go feral or something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 05:24:46	@RevRichardColes I shall have you know I sleep in red flannel sleeping garments to discourage Conjugal Unpleasantness. Dangerous stuff that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 05:20:55	@bmagnanti Lots of men have complimented me on my feminism. Nearly as many as the white folks who've told me I'm not racist. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 04:38:46	@zzzedkat That boy needs a cookie so bad I am tempted to bake him one to shut him up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 02:38:29	@ZachWeiner Because capitalism. Why do you hate FREEDOM and AMERICA? (And yes, I am joking)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 02:35:39	@HughSoutheyQC I fully agree. My comment was questioning whether some of these people have the intellectual honesty or desire to self inform
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-13 02:20:28	@HughSoutheyQC I thought the immigration "debate" was well over. Immigration is net benefit economically + culturally. From info available.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 22:07:03	@rhipratchett I realise a lot of people will assume name gets undue rewards, I sincerely doubt it does.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 22:06:30	@rhipratchett Oh I wasn't assuming (or stating) this was the case, just asking if it happens like I guess it might.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 22:06:02	@robinince @DrEvanHarris Some people's religion is "threatened" by the mere existance of disagreement. Rather a flaw for an omnipotent being
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 22:01:47	@Youngsy1989 @call_me_cockers It's a wonderful mental image!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 22:00:07	@Youngsy1989 @call_me_cockers Oh I don't know if that's the appropriate answer. I'd assume she was focussed on own work out. Must be it. :-P
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:58:23	@Youngsy1989 @call_me_cockers The chest puffs out a bit, the pace increases... ...she utterly fails to notice. Depressing innit?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:55:08	@Youngsy1989 @call_me_cockers I saw a guy trip on a treadmill and fart loudly due to watching a flawless blonde once. Dangerous things gyms
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:47:25	This photoshopping makeup onto Tory politicians etc, am I wrong in thinking it's a mite misogynist and transphobic?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:35:10	@rhipratchett The name might open a door but you're expected to hit higher standard because of it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:31:33	@alicebell Is the ATM really just some bloke with a bunch of tenners? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:28:28	@stavvers @AllyFogg But I *am* only in it for the sex. The lovely lovely sex. Any minute now. Annnnnny minute. Annnnny minute... {sob} ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:26:44	@paulcoxon @michelleoyen It sounds absurd to me too. I wonder if there is more to it than there appears. Eg a rule observed in the breaking
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:23:18	@brianmoore666 @JackofKent Whoever loses, the lawyers always win eh? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:22:42	@DMReporter @stevyncolgan That metadata is very carcinogenic though. Drs have found all sort of cancer in BP metadata.... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:21:31	@OwenJones84 @brianmoore666 I suppose my pedantic point is that trolling used to mean something specific + individual, not just abuse etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:20:25	@OwenJones84 @brianmoore666 At best trolling (not abuse) can be satire. It's almost never at its best. Sadly. Harassment/abuse =\= trolling
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:18:35	@brianmoore666 @OwenJones84 Steve Kardynal is hilarious though. I think his comedic trolling (in the proper sense) of Chatroulette is brill.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:13:46	@DrEoinCl Why it's almost like there is some sort of agenda to dismantle the NHS and place it in the hands of Tory cronies... ...Wait...erm
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:12:47	@DrMRFrancis @upulie Absolutely. Every aspect of my curiosity is 100% professional. Especially the really nosy bits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:11:48	@TruSWFacts Complete with massive 80s bush/perms for added comedy effect.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:09:34	@DrEvanHarris Ah how easily we forget the authoritarian agenda of the previous govt when it came to civil liberties.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:08:09	@HughSoutheyQC ...it might be a little uncharitable of me, but these are not traits/abilities I commonly find. Bloody hard to do oneself!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 21:07:17	@HughSoutheyQC Honest debate requires each participant to consider they might be wrong, and the merits of their opponents' arguments....1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 19:19:56	@robinince The Labour MP was, actually, briefly good (David Lammy), as was some Muslim secularist I don't know Otherwise, much to swear at.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 19:19:00	@robinince Apologists, waffle, cacophony, shallow drivel, and an all round, all encompassing, pathetic bag of wank. Business as usual.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 19:03:11	@AdamWagner1 @JackofKent When it's dodgy?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 19:02:48	@ool0n You...you...you hate me? WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 19:01:43	@professor_dave I love the smell of people colluding in their own oppression in the morning.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 16:52:05	@bryankaplan @HauntingMelissa But of course. I did last time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 06:48:07	@SpokesGay Boy! Come over here and help Momma with her Thighmaster. {shudder}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 06:47:03	@LilCowgirlElle @AdultVoyeur @MadisonMissina Tsk. Big black rubber cocks these days. They don't make 'em like they used to.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 05:04:18	@digitalcinemaCa @HauntingMelissa Better be better than probably for that sequel. Get going on number 2 Haunting Melissa people. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 00:47:01	@professor_dave It's "work harder, not smarter!". Which is...let me think of Professorial word....bloody stoopid!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 00:15:53	@professor_dave Oh of course. There's a lot of machismo, which I think excludes women as one example of consequences.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 00:02:34	@professor_dave Which is obviously not a good thing. The attitude that to hit a duck you have to heave a lot of bricks persists.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-12 00:02:01	@professor_dave I agree it's untrue and def counterproductive, but I think it varies between fields Synth Org Chem def has an hours culture
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:26:20	@pwsw4 @mistressmatisse Ha! That too!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:26:08	@pwsw4 @mistressmatisse You know that. I know that. All sensible people know that. Anti SW folk...? Not so much perhaps.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:21:20	@RugbyTigers @LeicesterTigers Much improved 2nd half. My heart rate dropped precipitously. Game won before 79th min! Nice. #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:17:39	@RugbyTigers Stoic twerk? Oh the mental images I have now!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:16:15	@RugbyTigers How about a slightly pleased tango?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:09:16	I am over the moon to see Mafi and Allen back in superb form #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:07:32	@WillGreenwood Oh ye of little faith! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:05:02	@martin_crowson Maybe.....maybe....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:04:46	@RugbyTigers I maintain there should be a statue to Mrs Tuilagi outside Welford Road.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:03:38	@indiaknight @emmafreud Crikey! The things you read on Twitter!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:02:43	@RugbyTigers I thought it was Dave Penalty...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 23:01:57	It's Steve Mafi. A welcome sight. A penalty try, converted. Another welcome sight. #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:58:27	Come on a Tigers! One try every ten mins for us = bonus point win. Luvverly jubberly. Make it so. #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:54:47	@WillGreenwood Calm down! We're not that far behind and we're turning up the heat. {crosses all things}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:52:45	Hello! Tigers are turning up! This is better. Am I sensing the results of a half time Cockers hair dryer treatment? #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:45:26	Mele's on early IMO, but let's hope he raises Tigers' game. And great to see Anthony Allen back in action. #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:43:07	@RugbyTigers Ayerza pulled down by poor bind I would guess.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:40:48	@RugbyTigers Kicks can't lose you the game but they can win it. As Cockers said. Last week kicks were the big difference.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:39:27	@RugbyTigers As an ex forward I can only agree with you! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:24:23	@martin_crowson Seconded!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:23:56	@RugbyTigers On that occasion definitely. I meant that ref has idea that Treviso are dominant in scrum over the match.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:14:47	@leftferret @HenryBTam @rositastef @Rugbymum2015 @Puffles2010 I fear the money's just not in it. Perhaps my cynicism is too high.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:13:57	@RugbyTigers Refs tend to go with dominant scrums...and we're unusually below par I think.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:12:27	@HenryBTam @leftferret @rositastef @Rugbymum2015 @Puffles2010 Very few MPs want to be execs of schools. Possibly a factor....sadly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:11:00	I have seen these players do better. Come on Tigers! Step it up! You can do it! #Tigerslive 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 22:10:15	This is the most consistently, terrifyingly inept defensive display from Tigers in the ~20 years I've been watching them #Tigerslive 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 21:55:09	This is horrifically porous from Tigers #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 21:49:03	@marcuschown @OliverJamesUK That's because moats, helicopter pads and duck houses have come tumbling down in price due to public subsidy.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 20:44:03	@robinince The joy of arguing against religion or any form of woo. It's not restricted by reality. Correcting everything takes space + time.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 19:24:37	@judeinlondon The most bloodless rift ever!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 19:21:40	@judeinlondon I'm never sure of Twitter ettiquette. Is that like calling your friends over with a "Hey! Look what this douche is saying!"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 19:19:58	@judeinlondon Do we have a massive Twitter spat/falling out now? I mean this is serious stuff!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 10:06:00	@futilityfiles Which is my way of saying thanks
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 10:05:39	@futilityfiles I bow to your superior googlage. I need to improve my Punjabi. I heard a t in there, and it ain't there dammit.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 10:03:10	@futilityfiles ...I.e. The Punjabi word for corn based rotis. Saag and corn rotis is apparently the most Punjabi meal ever, however spelled.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 10:01:26	@futilityfiles My wife's family are Sikh Punjabis, so they get meat AND booze (outside of the gurdwara). I'm not sure how to spell mahkati..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 09:57:17	@futilityfiles @SurlyAmy @SpokesGay Nothing beats mummyji's saag paneer with proper corn roti. My mum in law is a dab hand at it. Hungry now

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 08:21:57	@futilityfiles The important thing to note is I am not bitter. Not at all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 08:21:39	@futilityfiles My second fave is imparted wisdom As if knowledge is the problem. I'm fat am I? Well thank fuck you told me, I hadn't noticed
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-11 08:20:47	@futilityfiles My personal fave is the "advice". Advice that is a) trite bullshit and b) not actually advice just shaming.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 21:28:17	@DannyJOShea Everyone's done the one. Well, I say "conversation". I mean 20 minute swearathon followed by mild defenestration
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 21:24:29	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee I have no idea, but dammit I am going to try! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 21:16:26	@IamCarrieeeeee @BipolarBlogger I need this training too. It is my mission to be more FABULOUS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 21:13:52	@bmagnanti 50% solution. They need to be English too sadly. And of the right class. And preferably male. Wait! I'm seeing a pattern here...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 21:12:08	@DannyJOShea It's a possibility. Have you been leaking oil, craving input and trying world domination whilst saying "I'll be back"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 21:11:08	@bmagnanti These people are forgeiners. Those previous people were English and had a flag. So that was okay.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 20:56:41	@DrMRFrancis @rstevens I saw them supporting Inadvisable Mohawk at the Apollo in '83.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 20:55:34	@Chemistry_Kat Yes, K C Nicolaou and colleagues have made significant efforts. To name just one group. http:// pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.102 1/ja801139f …
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 20:52:04	@Chemistry_Kat It wasn't a serious suggestion! 2 mins work with the ring tool on Chemdraw, 3 years work with the stereochemistry tool! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 20:46:48	@Chemistry_Kat Maitotoxin? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 20:45:18	@DannyJOShea @Nigelrefowens Refs are PEOPLE? You go too far, sir! (Okay, not serious)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 20:43:56	@noodlemaz I have a friend who swears by her homeopath. I informed her she was using the wrong preposition.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:22:30	@BipolarBlogger @edelweisstwice @IamCarrieeeeee I'm off too. Have great days all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:22:06	@BipolarBlogger Without my wife I'd be dead. Yet another reason to note the privileges we have and to try to extend them to others. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:21:07	@BipolarBlogger Oh that's terrible. I forget how lucky I am to be in a stable marriage with a very tolerant wife who works too. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:19:43	@_BipolarProject With great bloody difficulty! ;-) The only way I have made change is with proper planning for prodromal phases.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:14:14	@noodlemaz Or, for example, the City, the House of Commons...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:13:01	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee ...and therapy. I'd be boned without a job.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:12:35	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Yikes. I got 11 week self management course/therapy and a few sessions of CBT. My pay goes on childcare...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:10:09	@BipolarBlogger @edelweisstwice @IamCarrieeeeee True, but it sounds like a bedside manner fail to me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:09:24	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee How long until next availability?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:06:00	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Yup. I have similar experience. Sublimating fears makes me a paranoid wreck within days.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:04:56	@BipolarBlogger @edelweisstwice @IamCarrieeeeee ... {ahem} "robustly negotiate" my treatment. ;-) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:04:13	@BipolarBlogger @edelweisstwice @IamCarrieeeeee I did once walk into a doc's office with a stack of scientific papers and proceed to... 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:03:05	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Bloody right. That is a very bold step.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:02:48	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee ...be treated to lovely lovely sexism! ;-) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:02:30	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee I think it's a bit luck of the draw. You've missed out on the "joys" of mental health bigotry only to 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 18:00:12	@edelweisstwice @BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee With Docs I have been EXTREMELY lucky. I think it helps that I speak the language.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:59:21	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Well I think you're brave and inspirational anyway, so there! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:58:55	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee ... With anyone on the receiving end, naturally, but she's never seen it herself. Weird. 3/3

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:57:30	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee This is interesting, I was talking to my wife last night about sexual harassment and she says she's not 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:56:11	@Nigelrefowens ...if only to tell people it's not bloody football! ;-) Don't listen too closely to the haters. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:55:07	@Nigelrefowens I'm a Leicester fan, and I think Aus and others are way WAY off base if they think you should not be on here? You belong 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:53:55	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee ...and therefore treat you poorly on that basis alone. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:53:36	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee True, but I've not found lack of knowledge a hinderance to bigots who know that it's a mental illness 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:52:02	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Ahhhh but you can throw a book at the next door neighbour's cat, which is cathartic. Allegedly. {cough}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:51:08	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Absolutely. I can't emphasise how much planning for the "foothills" of fluctuations in mood has helped me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:50:06	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Being Out (as you brave folks sensibly are, I'm getting there) do you get people prejudge you occasionally?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:48:37	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Definitely depends on who...which reminds me I have to go to therapy this morning!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:47:03	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee ...very occasionally because I am out of whack, not just because they are a prannock. ;-) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:46:29	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee And there's a good lesson. For all my loathing of being patronised etc, if someone else has noticed it's 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:42:48	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Am allowed one small killing spree if someone says that to me again? Just a small one. No one would notice
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:41:20	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Before diagnosis my hypo habit was to not eat/sleep, then when desperate kebabs and Red Bull at 4am. Clever
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:38:53	@IamCarrieeeeee act being seen as part of disease when it ain't. 3/3
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:38:14	@IamCarrieeeeee being patronised and gaslighted by certain meatspace people, I.e. No one here, re: my mental health. I despise it when 2/3
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:37:01	@LouisRedux @IamCarrieeeeee Incidentally, I know this is a bit of an irresponsible thing to say, it's a joke, I'm a bit fed up with 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:35:58	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Teach is right! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:35:05	@BipolarBlogger @IamCarrieeeeee Yeah I get same results (I.e.inability to do it) but the act of trying helps me a bit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:32:31	@IamCarrieeeeee I know. Every bloody thing does. But we must be good little mentals mustn't we. {does angelic face}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:28:23	@IamCarrieeeeee Low stimulus + Diaz...Urgh. Not often had the Diaz bit low stimulus days drive me crazy (haha) when I'm hypo. Good luck!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:19:52	@louistheroux Ah the "they'd be cool to have a drink with" phenomenon affects even those in the (sorry) "celebrity" world.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:15:49	@IamCarrieeeeee Not tried yoga, I'm at the stage of trying to see my toes, let alone touch them. Got to get my mindfulness habit going again
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 17:13:35	@IamCarrieeeeee Sounds familiar. And fun. THIS MUST BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY!!! ;-) You know what to do, so I'll just ask if you're okay.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 04:26:48	@btsportrugby @IamAustinHealey @BenKay5 My money's still on Big Benny Kay. Although Austin might lip him to death.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 01:05:07	@Fire_Pretty I am currently working on a cross internet crotch puncher if that helps....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 01:03:46	@Fire_Pretty Mensch is reliably unreasonable. She's one of those people for whom it is okay to take the opposite position automatically
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 00:50:59	@mjrobbins The one in the Oxo tower?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 00:44:42	@DrMRFrancis @27andaphd @TheCollapsedPsi I understand that you all give your respective mothers flowers etc (Said of Kray Twins. Hilarious)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 00:40:10	@MCabournSmith I demand 50% of the profits, or at least the right to travel to Edinburgh and buy a ticket. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-09 00:33:50	@MCabournSmith Are we to see you sporting the full Dennis Healy come the spring?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 22:23:24	@DrMRFrancis @TheCollapsedPsi @27andaphd Oh and I will bring up ligand field theory if pushed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 22:22:57	@DrMRFrancis @TheCollapsedPsi @27andaphd This is, to use street parlance, a knock down drag out nerd fight.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 22:22:19	@DrMRFrancis @TheCollapsedPsi @27andaphd Remind physicists that they used to call it "unclear magnetic resonance" before chemists sorted it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 21:36:41	@stfumisogynists The facepalm is strong here.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 20:07:35	@OliverJamesUK He's amusing, but I do think Stewart Lee nailed him. i.e. Clarkson having his controversial opions weekly for money.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 09:18:27	@OliverJamesUK 'Course no one would ever make a career out of that sort of thing would they? {looks at Jeremy Clarkson....coughs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 09:15:38	@OliverJamesUK That would be fun, but dangerous. A cynical person could perhaps exploit Daily Mail readers retweeting bigotry.. {Lightbulb}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 09:12:43	@OliverJamesUK I was really impressed until I saw how many followers you have. Then I was, erm, well, just really impressed by that actually
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 09:10:07	@CarriePoppyYES And if I've learned anything from the Intarwebz it's that that is unpossible.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 09:09:29	@CarriePoppyYES Of course not. For those to exist there'd have to be a series of complex interacting social phenomena aimed at shaming women
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 09:04:25	@Aggerscricket I'm no cricketer, nor do I play one on TV, but something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Where Denmark = English cricket.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 09:00:08	@gingerdisco99 Damn! There goes my plan for world domination by means of really interesting chem lectures and vague socialism.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 07:28:29	@gingerdisco99 I'm staying well away. With my interest in chemistry and social justice, I'm one terrorist away from being on MI5's hitlist!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 07:22:53	@stfumisogynists The second one is more stressful and hard. I'm not joking. I did a few months of stay at home dad between jobs. Never again
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 07:20:51	@gingerdisco99 Does the government dub his tweets into a different font?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 07:19:13	@gracedent @sarahditum I am trying not to. We are but days away from the words "Davidson" and "reach around " being in close proximity
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 07:15:51	@GroovyBruce Presumably because, as you are Bruce Campbell, there is something you and your boomstick could accomplish.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 07:14:15	@ool0n YT recommends a The Amazing Atheist and Thunderf00t to me. I think YT is either taking the piss or is just bloody evil.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 07:11:09	@bmagnanti It was Warhammer what did it for me. That and sacrificing babies on an altar made of kittens and puppies. Naturally.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 07:09:14	@CathyReisenwitz @Maggie_McNeill Preposterous! Corporations have lawyers, poor people don't. Simple! {Sigh}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 06:59:32	@wmarybeard The harassment is hideous, and as per usual, the people behind it are not monsters but very, depressingly ordinary.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 05:53:40	@photonharvester I have a pristine, new, secret email address just so I can have an empty inbox to look at and fantasise about. Worrying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 05:48:59	@marcuschown That's still less nepotistic than Cameron's coiffurist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 05:47:03	@mevans86 @Free_Radical1 The photochemistry of light struck beer alone is the basis for a reasonable couple of lectures.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 05:45:57	@rbhu7 I understand that these are groups of soccerists who commit heinous acts of footballism. Don't the police know?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 05:43:27	@rbhu7 Oh in that case I cannot approve. Football based antics are bad enough, but adding racism to them is just rude. There should be a law
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-08 05:36:32	@rbhu7 Is this further footballism on your part? I presume this Poyet is some species of soccerist.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 06:17:09	@SarahMillican75 ENVY!! I has it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 06:09:36	@frockdoctrineuk Fair enough. I'm holding my nose and going for a look.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 06:07:26	@frockdoctrineuk Who is the bully? I'm not sure I can bring myself to look.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 05:59:00	@SexKittenParty No worries. I have pre-disappointed my wife just in case. Standards have to be maintained. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 04:11:47	@notquitedandy Of course. I once said something that could be construed as a bit feminist. I now hate all men and have cut my cock off.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 04:08:22	@notquitedandy Sorry, sorry. I was channeling the joys of the internet, where even mild expressions of like/dislike are met with fanaticism
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 04:03:26	@notquitedandy PERVERT! KILL THE HERETIC! [whisper] I don't hate the current Sherlock series [/whisper]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 04:02:30	@ZachWeiner We'll get you back into the Imperial fold. We'll get you all back. Mwah ha. Mwah ha ha ha ha haa! {Twirls villainous moustache}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 04:00:17	@NickDoody Killing is usually cheaper. A bit tricky legality-wise mind you. Have you considered a professional standard masturbation spree?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 03:57:20	@stephengdavey That menu reads pretty, does it taste any good? (Also, ENVY!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 02:54:42	@SexKittenParty Page doesn't exist. Either that's a joke and I am going to disappoint my wife AGAIN this evening, or your IT is poo. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-07 02:44:22	@Neuro_Skeptic Good! Those fools never understand my work. They will rue the day. Oops. Revealed too much. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-06 20:17:27	@john_s_wilkins You should be proud. Good philosophical tradition. Donkeys up minarets etc. Muppets in washing machines = modern equivalent.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-06 20:14:50	@paulcoxon 2? Show off! I've looked at my list. Then put a coffee mug on it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-06 20:11:03	@EmmaK67 Oh come now. Not all of us are this bad. Some of us pride ourselves on being far, far worse. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-06 20:07:28	@stevyncolgan Good isn't it? Perhaps that's the problem. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-06 19:30:52	@stevyncolgan In fact, in the name of accuracy, I hurled myself off the wagon bodily and with no small amount off venom. Directly into a pie
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-06 19:30:01	@stevyncolgan Sounds painfully familiar! The only reason I put weight back on is because I did not so much fall off the wagon as hurl myself
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-06 19:29:04	@mistressmatisse @WilsonKM2 Every time I think about exercise I go for a lie down until the feeling passes. (Quote, not mine sadly.)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-06 19:27:34	@stevyncolgan I'm in a similar boat. What was your method?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-06 02:33:24	@MMFlint Yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:58:07	TIGERS DREW. I HAS A HALF SAD.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:55:18	@CarlTSpeak Always....always.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:53:39	the difference was the boot. Sad, hard, but there it is. #Tigerslive

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:49:21	@CarlTSpeak Wait...it's obvious I'm taking the piss, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:48:54	@CarlTSpeak Big fan of socialised medicine. Helps to punish hard working families which is a good thing obviously.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:47:39	@CarlTSpeak Sensible. Costs less.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:46:36	@CarlTSpeak Very likely. I definitely have a predisposition to believing in drunkenness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:44:44	I'm also going to say that Tom Youngs is practically my favourite player ever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:42:38	@somegreybloke @MolliDesi I doubt it, her experiences do not fit the desired narrative.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:42:02	I've had 8 beers during the rugby. I have found that alcohol taken in sufficient quantities produces all the symptoms of drunkenness
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:37:31	I love Cockers #Tigerslive @call_me_cockers

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:14:48	@WilsonKM2 My arteries furred up looking at that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:14:13	Double Buggeration! Come on Tigers, sort it out. I know it's tough. I know they're good. But you can do it. #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:11:46	@judeinlondon It was also called the war to end all wars. And you'll notice there weren't any wars after it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:09:00	@OwenJones84 I'd pay it happily. Okay I'd have to earn £100k, but I feel that's a minor detail.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 23:01:58	Come on Tigers! Sort it out, smack Bath out of thus second half. You can do it. #Tigerslive

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 22:03:59	@Fire_Pretty Rapey at worst, clueless and arrogant at best. Not good either way.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 22:02:42	@Fire_Pretty If I may translate from the vernacular, I believe it refers to engaging in coitus with as many ladies as humanly possible. Ahem
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 22:01:26	@Fire_Pretty Isn't he a sweetie? Just a dreamboat. Or, you know, not.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 19:52:27	@thus_spake_z @DrEvanHarris @Neuro_Skeptic Thanks! I shall enjoy them. I did fall off my chair when James said human babies are blank slates
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 19:51:21	@DrEvanHarris His panicked tap dancing after he realised his error was hilarious. The presenter let him off. The jugular moment passed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 19:49:11	@DrEvanHarris Oliver James is a reliable source of utter horseshit. I would not trust the man to adequately describe a well observed rock.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 08:18:44	@UpTheWorkers @marcuschown @NHAparty ...a consequence of the free market fetishising ideology that has dominated since the 80s
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 08:17:56	@UpTheWorkers @marcuschown @NHAparty Oh definitely My point was the destruction of the NHS has not merely been party political. It's been...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 08:16:41	@Tamsyn_E @MolliDesi I am ashamed to admit my freebie problem. My wife gave me another freebie yesterday. I have put her in counselling
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 08:12:54	@UpTheWorkers @marcuschown @NHAparty Yup. It's the significant social advance of the last century. Any backwards step is by definition wrong
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 08:09:51	@UpTheWorkers @marcuschown @NHAparty The only difference with this current bunch of muppets us that the damage is open and celebrated
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 08:09:11	@UpTheWorkers @marcuschown @NHAparty Yeah. What scares me is that this process was not halted under the last "labour" govt. It accelerated.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 08:05:48	@UpTheWorkers @marcuschown @NHAparty Given what even one so full as I can see, we don't need to wait 30 years.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 08:02:23	@DeborahJaneOrr @guardian In other news, grass is green, water is wet and austerity measures cause more harm than good.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:56:00	@BipolarBlogger That day is needed. Follow Friday is weak. We need more truly shit advice. (No. No we don't.)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:53:36	@SpokesGay The Godfather. Don't worry, I was being silly. You had {Italian Thing} on the stove. I assumed it was person and you were Mafioso

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:44:31	@LoriAdorable But I am super critical. If I don't tell everyone HOW WILL THEY KNOW?????????
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:43:31	@garwboy Fuck Dave Allen, he was a shocking neuroscientist! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:42:06	@daraobriain If you'll forgive the toadying whilst I am a fan of Dave Allen, you're not so shabby yourself. You're on my "always watch" list
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:38:13	@flyingparchment This is what worries me, flippancy aside, some people you just can't reach with reason. It's depressing. For you, worse
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:35:48	@flyingparchment Hmmmm tricky. I doubt asking very, very nicely would work. And speculating about violence is not my bag, nor trouble free
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:33:58	@jimalkhalili You'd stop talking science to attempt to understand which accent Crowe is trying to use? Brace.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:33:00	@flyingparchment "Having a word" doing something? Or just having a word doing something?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:31:22	@jimalkhalili Was that inversion at nitrogen? Never sure which phenomenon was demonstrated first historically.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:30:17	@BipolarBlogger You know we are SO having a bipolar peeps night out right? It just has to happen. We'll be very well behaved and drink water
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:28:27	@BipolarBlogger So on that basis I am just going to place this supportive Internet hug here, for use at your discretion! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 07:27:51	@BipolarBlogger 1) I have one kid and a superb wife, I'm knackered, how you feel must be beyond reason. 2) when they sleep it's always good!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 04:03:29	@ChillaxYhuBatty @rbhu7 I get this one from my parents. "It doesn't affect you, you're not gay". I AM A FUCKING HUMAN BEING THOUGH!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 03:58:18	@BipolarBlogger NOT ENOUGH CATS!!!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 03:33:39	@cimota @jearle I think there's no need for "platformism" ;-) What works for you with a platform works. I like all available reading media
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-05 03:32:00	@robinince Filming? Are we, your adoring public, to get a DVD (possibly via Go Faster Stripe)?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 22:43:12	@buttons_37 I'm sure you do, and all of us in this boat need mutual sympathy and support. No worries about having a pop at me I'm a big boy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 22:39:03	@buttons_37 Whu? Lesser mortal? Hardly! Books/awards mean someone worked hard and someone else liked it. They are not marks of superiority
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 22:38:08	@buttons_37 Does it show I'm not a fan of opinions (even mine)? They're what we all have in the absence of done thing better and more useful
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 22:37:17	@buttons_37 ...opinions (even mine!) only go so far, they are not binding on others. They're also not always useful.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 22:36:28	@buttons_37 As criticism goes it was extremely mild. And yes people are entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts. Also...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 21:23:52	@BipolarBlogger Bloody good reaction. The "sex and travel" response is always good! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 20:44:05	@markthomasinfo I was in bed by 10pm on NYE. I'm so disappointed in myself my new year's resolution is to take up crack.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 20:42:14	@BipolarBlogger Did they block you? (Sorry, I confused!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 20:41:50	@BipolarBlogger ...bloody irresponsible. I loathe remote diagnosis over the web, it's bad, wrong, and dilutes real problems, also does harm

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 20:37:57	@BipolarBlogger Exactly! I worry about my suitability as a BP dad so much, I can only imagine it's worse for mums (social pressure etc)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 20:36:36	@BipolarBlogger I saw. Is this someone physically near you? Or remote, i.e.on the web? I assume latter because you mention DM

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 20:18:27	@BipolarBlogger That's even worse! Rule one is you don't feed into the ideation, which "worst case scenario" discussions do. Crikey!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 20:16:01	@BipolarBlogger ...should be more than able to pick up on. Why do people forget that any therapeutic process is a collaboration?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-04 20:13:41	@BipolarBlogger That is shockingly poor "bedside manner". Downright intrusive and patronising. I understand the need to check on people...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-03 17:36:07	@caitlinmoran @BBCNews @EnvAgency It will be fine. Decent hard working families will pull themselves above floodwaters by bootstraps. Right?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-02 22:03:18	@mjrobbins Bora's return has been ill-managed and is distinctly problematic. I have other worries though and am struggling to phrase them.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 23:11:45	@imaginarystars @stavvers You mean "again", right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 22:58:06	@sousan50 I went to Spain once, not one of the natives spoke English and they insisted on feeding me greasy foreign food. It's a disgrace.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 21:05:23	@stavvers Because alcohol?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 21:05:10	@EVB_Now NY optimism destroyed by bozos within hours shocker!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 21:02:11	@DeborahJaneOrr Oooh cunning. They come over here, being invisible and unacknowledged. I could do that job.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:59:38	BULGARIAN SIGHTING!!!!! No, no. Just rain again. Bloody Bulgarians, they come over here masquerading as water, forming puddles.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:57:26	@DeborahJaneOrr Racist. You forgot Bulgarians too. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:57:02	@Whoozley "well god would want...." Sorry, stop. I am only interested if you can tell me how you know. (Works every time)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:56:02	@paulcoxon @MailOnline #outrage I caught a Romanian hiding in my jar of British jam trying to covert it to some heathen foreign muck. Swine!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:36:27	@caitlinmoran How the word action got in there I do not know. I blame Romanians. And autocorrect.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:35:25	@caitlinmoran She clearly has taste. She was already high in my estimation action for comments about celeb body shaming, this is bonus stuff
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:32:37	@OwenJones84 @WalterSobchak_ Curse them for their quick work. I have a Romanian friend who has been here 20 years and has kids. Sneaky...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:31:09	@caitlinmoran @davidpotts My university had a pubic library. Well, one corner of it seemed to be very pubic judging by the graffiti.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:29:53	@cosmicgenome Seems reasonable. Can we also recruit some of the billion Romanians fretted over by the Mail to run the study? Seems fair.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:27:41	@cosmicgenome Properly blinded of course. I'll go and get blind drunk, you phone Goldacre for tips.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:24:38	@cosmicgenome You're doing that thing banks do and rewarding new customers. It's political correctness gone mad, or health and safety.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:20:46	@SexEdUKation I often thought my PhD should have been sponsored by Red Bull.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:17:15	I'VE SEEN A ROMANIAN!!!!!! Oh no. No. False alarm. It was a unicorn wearing Faberge egg earrings and carrying a wizard. More common in UK.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:14:33	@notquitedandy Might actually be rain. Not sure. Daily Mail sure it's immigrants.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:14:10	@notquitedandy Indeed. It's immigranting like hell outside. Immigration forming into deep puddles. There'll be hell in the roads.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:12:00	@notquitedandy Tragically, no. I blame someone.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:11:32	@MitchBenn I must say they are doing a fantastic job. Just look at all the front line services they've cut.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:09:26	@jamiesont @MitchBenn Now that will be an impressive thing to works to the show's overarching narrative.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:08:10	@ProfBrianCox Hurrah! Agreed. And may you have a wonderful New year too! Brian.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:04:01	@caitlinmoran And Romanians have a better chance of breeding...quick! Inform the Daily Mail so there can be mass panic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:02:08	@StripperNotes I...I... {dies of envy}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:01:34	@noodlemaz Tradition dictates you propitiate your phone by sacrificing a goat on it. For vegetarians a tofu goat will suffice.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:01:00	@markthomasinfo Have a superb 2014, Mark.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 20:00:22	@caitlinmoran That is not Romanians, that is rain. The Daily Mail is confused. As usual. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 19:59:13	@zeno001 Ohh Ohhhhh I know!! Sir! Sir! Pick me! That would be because of gullible twats and wishful thinking, sir. (Okay, harsh)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 19:57:44	@niallpb @Neuro_Skeptic In other news, grass green due to some sort of light absorbent molecules.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 19:56:43	@BipolarBlogger It's positively underwater out there. I remain unamused by this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 19:55:09	@michaellegge I read it somewhere. Probably in the Daily Mail. Mind you given the standard of their reporting I'm not sure I should trust it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 19:53:56	@professor_dave I saw a Romanian once. Great big thing it was. Might have been a tiger. Still, it was over here taking zoo jobs from badgers
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 19:52:45	@mjrobbins Dating young folk? Pervert! I shall have you reported.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 19:52:12	@FullCommujism @Conservatives @David_Cameron I demand Romanians!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 19:51:21	@RevRichardColes It is a tad moist. Verging on damp.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 19:50:46	@kankurette @thus_spake_z Bastards, They come over here making good use of the everyday things folks leave behind.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 18:22:41	@pwk2013 @EdwardTufte ...might be tougher to communicate. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 18:22:05	@pwk2013 @EdwardTufte Yeah. I tend to err on the side of more information being a general good. Although, the context of the article 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 18:18:39	@pwk2013 @EdwardTufte Something of that ilk. Perhaps as simple as article being open access for 48 hours.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 18:11:02	@pwk2013 @EdwardTufte @TheEconomist I hope so, that's the sort of thing I had in mind.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 18:10:29	@pwk2013 @EdwardTufte ...could be made open access for a period of time due to wider public interest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 18:10:07	@pwk2013 @EdwardTufte Very much agreed, wasn't really focussing on that aspect of the debate, more hoping that articles in mainstream news..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 17:53:37	@garwboy Bulgarian tuna no doubt.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 17:43:15	@EdwardTufte @pwk2013 ...I could go on! The journals needs to do better too in making articles available.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 17:42:27	@EdwardTufte @pwk2013 Link to article, state conflicts of interest, check with independent scientist their coverage is remotely accurate...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 17:35:59	@thus_spake_z Yes. Just like Doreen and Gladys.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 17:35:39	@thus_spake_z Shhhh I’m of immigrant stock. I’m one of them subversive lefties too. I’m stashing Romanians in my trousers for a revolution.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 17:34:30	@thus_spake_z I saw a Bulgarian wresting the handbag out of the hand of a pensioner who served in WW II today. It might have not happened.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 17:32:43	@hughlaurie How very dare you! The presumption, the gall! the sheer brass ne… …actually that’s rather decent if you. Happy New Year to you!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 17:14:57	Happy New Year everyone. I am surprisingly un-hungover. I do not trust this healthy peace. My liver must have done something clever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 17:12:28	@EmmaK67 Steady! Ohhhhh you meant the year. Yes, that, erm, forget I said anything. I agree. Erm…whoops.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 17:11:25	@RespectSexWork YES!!! THIS!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 05:11:24	@culturevultures Yes. Very yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 04:56:09	@TheLewisBlack Happy New Year! I have worried for years that your comedy is my inner monologue. So, erm, thanks for that! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 04:55:22	@CCriadoPerez Happy New Year. I hope it is at least as productive and about a million times less harassy for you! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 04:36:17	@RebeccaFront I…errrr….yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 04:33:27	@BipolarBlogger Now there is a title worth bragging about!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 03:41:41	@BipolarBlogger DON’T TEMPT ME WOMAN!! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 03:25:18	@AskDrRuth @Racheldoesstuff Why make it either, why not both? Does that sound like I am bragging. I’m not. Just deluded! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 03:09:00	@Crommunist Wait…are you saying my every thought does not deserve universal love and interest? Why that is sexist. Or racist. Or something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 03:05:29	@noodlemaz I hope 2014 is a much improved year for you. One that involves bacon and chocolate in the proportions you deem suitable. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 02:59:14	If I forget due to my being drunk, as I surely will be, may everyone have a lovely New Year. May many wonderful things happen for and to you
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 02:52:50	@BestoftheMail That is a paragon of cheer and goodwill. I have never seen anyone more in desperate need of a shag and a pint than that chap.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2014-01-01 02:51:13	@BipolarBlogger Aw thanks very much. I have to say I am much indebted to you for your help, friendship and kindness too. Your blog is superb
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 17:47:10	@SexKittenParty Before I read the link, does it have anything to do with Tabasco on the willy. Because that really hurts. Apparently.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 17:46:27	@niallpb Ah, one of THOSE news days. Yeah, it’s a bit tragic when Bill Hicks’ description of the human species as a “virus with shoes” fits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 17:38:26	@thisisamy_ @FullCommujism Ohh ohh I know, I know!! Miss! Me, Miss! Pick me, Miss! That would be the bit with the poor people in it, Miss.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 17:37:28	@caitlinmoran @RevRichardColes It is worrying the amount of joy that would cause. I suggest a national holiday for the occasion.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 17:32:12	@SexKittenParty No worries, my diabolically feeble sense of humour gets me into all sorts of trouble. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 07:14:20	@hemantmehta Goodwill towards sexual deviance? Bravo! That’s a thing to be proud of.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 07:09:44	@campbellclaret @ShippersUnbound I was wondering about that myself.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 07:08:02	@prodnose Then they are not nearly drunk enough.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 07:02:18	@flyingparchment oh well, swing and a miss. I was referring to the jokes about oolon and myself failing to manage this, but hey I goofed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 06:56:06	@flyingparchment Can we follow you to learn how to organise a piss up in a brewery?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 06:53:16	@paulcoxon think yourself lucky, my Nobel prize is still in the post. Just like Del Boy’s road tax.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 06:18:58	@SexKittenParty I’m thinking you missed the joke. The joke is about how MRAs are stupid, not women.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 06:18:07	@SexKittenParty You realise I was mocking MRAs right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 03:44:04	@SexKittenParty “Tricksy ladies with their lying vags. Were hates then, Precious.” All MRAs, everywhere.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 01:20:49	@bmagnanti Highland fire last year was it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 01:19:34	@bmagnanti An improvement on hosting animals and taking in stray reprobates?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 01:19:10	@judeinlondon @preciosatt “Uppity” and “excitable” were always the one’s directed at me. I was told once I “didn’t know my place”. Nice.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 01:18:05	@bmagnanti What are you really up to this year? Wild hi-jinks? Please tell me it is, I’m stuck with quiet night and need to live vicariously
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 01:17:06	@RevRichardColes I think Ms Rowling did stupendous work. The odd sense of Britishness of the whole thing is very familiar. Nostalgia making.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 01:15:51	@RevRichardColes Haha! Indeed. Similar for ex-boarding school boy. Latin, odd teachers, strange buildings, constant fear of something weird.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 01:13:32	@SimonBuckden @PaulJRethink Bloody terrifying to do in my experience.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 01:13:11	@RevRichardColes You’re really taking this Harry Potter immersion seriously. Have your opinions radically changed?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 00:41:06	@lousycanuck Comical with a side of irony.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-31 00:34:41	@halfabear @IslaBoag I failed to make it past the first line: Feminists, Y U DO FEMINISMS RONG??? Another irony meter broken.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-29 23:40:22	@FullCommujism @QueerStudiesOSU Do I have to kill them? I’m favouring looks of withering disdain and medium tutting at the moment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-29 23:36:03	@FullCommujism @QueerStudiesOSU And there I was thinking white and whiny was the new black. Does this mean those white guys misinformed me?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-29 22:18:59	@AshleyGraf101 We can never leave. We are stuck in the Twitterverse forever. Always under threat of being unfollowed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-29 22:18:19	@RevRichardColes There’s a campaign to prevent people putting things in cheese. I support it wholeheartedly. With a terrifying fanaticism.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-29 21:49:32	@noodlemaz It’s always time for fish and chips, and a pint (or two). This might explain why I have things in orbit around my waist
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-29 21:47:57	@judeinlondon Each set of modules equivalent to one academic year is ~£5700. OU is v flexible and well respected.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-28 16:58:50	@StripperNotes That was a terrifying level of “I’m White Knight and must FIX YOU!”. Because as we all know, strippers need fixin’ {eye roll}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-28 16:47:30	@FullCommujism oh I don’t know, wandering about with a headache and a hard on makes work tricky. I had to knock the headaches off.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-28 16:46:08	@StripperNotes Two Disney Princess references? RUN, FORREST!! RUN!!!!!!!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-28 06:33:59	@_BipolarProject Okay, cool. Is it okay if I take a longer look in the new year and submit something for your perusal?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-28 06:29:37	@_BipolarProject This I can help with! What do you want me to do?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-28 05:40:52	@CCriadoPerez No no. Sadly not. We humans have a spectacular tendancy to be total shits. Mind you some of us are lovely. Allegedly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-28 05:39:45	@BipolarBlogger Yeah I know the drill (well, intellectually, not on lithium). I sympathise, it's a rough treatment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-28 05:36:26	@BipolarBlogger Still not better? That's horrid. I'm wishing huge quantities of menthol and sundry nice smelly things your way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-28 05:34:53	@ImprobableJoe I know. It's my rock star lifestyle that makes me the envy of the other children.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:41:50	@AskMissAlice about tricksy womenses stealing their Precious. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:40:48	@AskMissAlice Dead giveaway: his taxes are in any way equivalent to your bodily autonomy. It’s misogyny 101. MRAs the world over whine 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:39:32	@AskMissAlice he’s unaware the data do not fit his armchair “reasoning” (for reasoning read anti woman hate)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:38:32	@AskMissAlice He’s the shallow sort of fool that thinks banning abortions reduces abortions. So he thinks magically numbers go down = lives!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:37:10	@SarahMillican75 Gary Delany? That name’s familiar. Isn’t he your lovely fella?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:35:54	@AskMissAlice Really? Oh it’s horribly common in my experience. Especially from libertarian Americans/Tea Party people.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:32:43	@paulcoxon Did the haggis bombs go down well….eventually?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:31:41	@AskMissAlice I have no words for the degree of contempt those people arouse in me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:31:05	@AskMissAlice A certain type of make scumbag thinks their wallet is equivalent to, or more important than, a woman’s boldily autonomy. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:29:28	@AskMissAlice I know. Incidentally I am overjoyed to talk to you! but that Milton bozo is pointless.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:28:49	@AskMissAlice @Milton_Phoenix Any chance of @Ing me out please? I need to waste time on a deluded twit like Milton like I need turd soup.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:18:17	@marcuschown Are you fucking kidding me? This is barking even for Murdoch.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:15:50	@AskMissAlice Call me an old meanie pants, but I have very little sympathy for anti woman foetus fetishists. When the standard drivel 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:14:34	@AskMissAlice After all, permitting people that stupid to wank on my timeline is too generous. Foetus fetishists are beyond reason. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:13:20	@AskMissAlice I have zero tolerance for anti woman bozos, and even less time for their ridiculous crap. I blocked that Milton turd. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:07:44	@soozaphone it is always thesis writing time! Even when there is no thesis. THAT’S HOW EVIL THEY ARE!!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:05:20	@Milton_Phoenix @AskMissAlice @LouiseMensch @gabyhinsliff @TimMontgomerie I support any woman’s right to abort. Saves women’s lives overall.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 17:01:52	@Milton_Phoenix @AskMissAlice @LouiseMensch @gabyhinsliff @TimMontgomerie Not avoiding it at all. More women die if abortion is restricted.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 16:56:09	@AskMissAlice Yeah, probably because of those strange things called “facts”. Like safe, legal, available abortions save lives.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 16:54:14	@Milton_Phoenix @AskMissAlice @LouiseMensch @gabyhinsliff @TimMontgomerie Nice! Stay classy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 16:52:31	@AskMissAlice Yay! Two bigotries in one! Anti woman and ableist! Try to get them to throw in a third, you get a prize from Twitter for that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 16:51:22	@AskMissAlice The anti woman crowd appall me at every turn, it doesn’t surprise me that some shithead thinks his pocket book > your body.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 16:44:45	@scooterheyer @Whoozley Say no more!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 08:21:40	@Sectioned_ is it okay to just offer you some sympathy? I know sort of how you feel, but then have suffered far less it seems.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 08:19:45	@Whoozley {cough} I am given to understand that some people find the bit ~9 months before the birth entertaining.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 08:18:45	@Whoozley Sounds reasonable enough to me. Don’t listen to the “female destiny is birth” lot being child free can be cool. Horses for courses
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 02:53:59	@RevRichardColes Tilda Swinton makes everything right.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 02:48:13	@danbowden_ NICE!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 02:47:45	@RevRichardColes I wouldn’t know. I rely on your expert entertainment industry knowledge. I am reasonably reliably informed that films cost
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 02:46:45	@bmagnanti That I’d heart wrenching. I didn’t know. If it were possible you just went up in my estimation. I reckon you must be pretty tough
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 02:40:11	@RevRichardColes Controversial. Bold casting, have you talked money?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 02:39:26	@RevRichardColes Weird Al is an interesting choice, better than Default Clooney.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 02:35:45	@RevRichardColes Who plays you in the film?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 01:55:44	@SusanCalman I will be interested in your views on the conclusion.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 01:55:07	@RevRichardColes Lightsabers and various lasers would surely be the instruments of choice. Perhaps the Force is involved.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 01:54:09	@FullCommujism Don’t tell the Internet that! It’ll be “pix or Neva happen” before you know it. And then where will we be? Chaos!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 01:52:26	@somegreybloke @thomaswetherall A well drawn dickbutt is a thing of beauty. Allegedly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 00:27:13	@somegreybloke A hilarious polemic knitting sensible atheism, reasoned socialism and a trenchant critique of the Jonas Brothers’ last album.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 00:22:10	@paulcoxon That actually sounds spectacular. I confess I’m a little disappointed. I was hoping for the inclusion of actual haggis.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-27 00:20:51	@RevRichardColes On Boxing Day? Heaven forfend! I would never shoot a peasant out of season.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 23:51:11	@RevRichardColes After all, if one cannot make comically socialist remarks at Christmas time, when can one?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 23:50:07	@RevRichardColes I’m enjoying the joys only possible with very right wing parents. All faux complaints aside, I’m rather loving it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 23:47:14	@RevRichardColes An acceptable substitute, I’m not a fanatic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 23:46:29	@RevRichardColes Indeed. Are you self harming via the medium of film?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 23:45:21	@paulcoxon What’s in a haggis bomb? Is there a prep for them?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 23:44:16	@RevRichardColes And I have it good authority that the correct mindset can be achieved with gin.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 23:43:39	@RevRichardColes They’re the rip roaring yarns for the young of today. If you can watch them with the mind of a ten year old you’ll be fine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 21:05:15	@mjrobbins Good luck. Drinking is wise.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 20:06:35	@mistressmatisse I see you are bi-soft furnishing too. Kinky.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 20:04:50	@judeinlondon @TimMontgomerie I don’t menstruate, but would you mind sending him a couple from me. I despise anti-woman foetus fetishists
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 20:03:37	@notquitedandy Don’t be ridiculous! That would be like shutting down an A and E department or something…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 19:59:40	@notquitedandy Ah yes, the filter that blocks educational websites and helplines. Genius move “concerned” folk. One shot, no feet!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 07:25:00	@AskMissAlice Deary me, upon reflection I think I knew what I was aiming for in that tweet, but I find myself very drunk. Apologies
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 07:21:25	@AskMissAlice Well he’s a bit of a bit for it, lesser known scripture apparently.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:40:27	@TigersLizzie @call_me_cockers that is gorgeous, I want one!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:39:36	@AskMissAlice Very sensible. Many of my best friends fear eggnog.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:36:26	@AskMissAlice Well of course not! The very idea! such scepticism at Xmas, the baby Jesus will widdle in your eggnog.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:35:18	@ImprobableJoe oh all right, I confess. Tales of my curmudgeonly nature may have been exaggerated. I’m a teddy bear really
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:32:19	@BipolarBlogger I offer these consoling Internet hugs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:31:27	@AskMissAlice Someone be offensive? UNPOSSIBLE!!! People are paragons of light and virtue.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:29:56	@ImprobableJoe When your cynicism gland is the hardened shell mine is, it’s bordering on a Christmas miracle!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:29:10	@garwboy All done yet? Why not? Pfff these electronic gizmos are useless, with computer power you should be done by now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:27:47	@pzmyers How you arrive at a conclusion is as important as the conclusion itself…PRECISELY!!!!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:20:36	I have eaten more than a village, received more gifts than anyone deserves and I am eyeing some trifle in an obscene manner. Must be Xmas.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:17:36	@ImprobableJoe I’m feeling well disposed towards my fellow man. It took a bit of work to get there. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 05:16:46	@Esteleth I made up for it later, honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 03:18:06	@Mummy_Mayhem @SarahMillican75 I’m donning a gentleman’s eating trouser for the occasion

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 01:02:32	@CarlieP That was breakfast. Merry Thing to all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 01:01:53	@ImprobableJoe I’ve moved to gin. Things are smoothly blurring.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-26 01:01:03	@sousan50 My apologies. Immigrants are so much nicer!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 22:52:08	@CarlieP Yes. And beer.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 22:48:57	I am drunk. It is Christmas. People may survive the latter because of the former. My tetchy bastard gland has been acting up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 22:47:15	@caitlinmoran Agree with all except the Blurred Lines. That, and Thicke, can be obliterated by fire thanks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 22:45:41	The world seems a better, if slightly blurrier place.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 22:45:23	I have been to the pub. Today’s tally is a bottle of champagne, four pints of Ringwood Fortyniner, one pint of Ringwood Porter and a double.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 22:44:26	@jailawrites I shall make you one in my capacity as FEMINIST ALLY!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 22:44:03	@sousan50 Crikey! That sounds awful. I hope it resolves itself sharpish. I thought you expats escaped weather and sundry nasties.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 19:09:31	I’m off to the pub. Falalalala la la la la! I’m going to have a beer. Deck the halls with bows of whassname! Then a rum chaser. Ding dong!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 19:02:54	@SlenderLiaMan @FullCommujism I cannot be happy that Thatcher is dead. It means she lived.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 19:02:18	@stavvers I know! It’s so hard to masturbate to anything else at Christmas. Or am I just jaded? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 19:01:05	Champagne and a bacon sandwich have had their restorative effects. Merry Christmas to one and all, and I hope Santa brings you all wonders.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-25 19:00:10	@rbhu7 @there_runsMary I have substantially warmed to the day. I swear it’s nothing to do with the half bottle of champagne I have consumed.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-24 07:53:46	I think we as a nation need to stop hiding behind autre temps and have the backbone to acknowledge our past bigotry explicitly 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-24 07:52:18	Turing pardon is insufficient. M’learned friend assures me pardon is legally meaningless, and 75k+ unremembered people go on unpardoned. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-24 07:05:54	@garwboy Only if she’s a Nintendo. Sony women need a bit of R1 and L2. Honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-24 07:03:16	@noodlemaz Infection without snogging? I’ll start the http:// change.org petition, you get a letter into Amnesty. That’s outrageous.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-24 05:22:01	@sousan50 I am very glad you're feeling better by the day. That good news
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-24 02:46:43	Don't forget the previous Blog. http://www. poaj.net/cray-cray/
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-24 02:46:07	@sousan50 You are one of the more empathetic people I know. You don't need to shut up! You need to speak up!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-24 02:45:36	Yet more blogging! Crikey! http://www. poaj.net/a-fine-kind-of -madness-2/ …
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-24 01:31:27	@sousan50 I doubt you need to be more careful. It's just one of those things that comes up from time to time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-24 01:14:59	Finally a new Blog Post. I know you've all been waiting for it. http://www. poaj.net/cray-cray/#mor e-131 …
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-23 23:36:47	@jesswynn93 dealing WITH. My fingers don’t work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-23 23:35:58	@BRSM_blog Never assume. If only for comedy purposes. The labiality of Esther, for example.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-23 23:35:03	@jesswynn93 Are you dealing Daily Mail reading family too?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-23 23:34:35	@christheneck Agreed. Mine initially read your tweet as “Just been called an acrostic…” and was about to sympathise.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-23 23:27:11	@Gaylussite @leydon I have made over three jokes in my time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-23 21:46:56	@ehdannyboy You...you...love me? Be at my place at 7. Bring flowers and lube.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-23 21:44:26	@Gaylussite @leydon It's the best thing ever and makes everything funnier?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-23 21:21:50	@notquitedandy Borrow? Compensation? SOCIALIST!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-23 21:16:57	@notquitedandy SECONDED! I'd also like to ask for: done all your own science, built your own road network and bootstrapped your own infancy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-23 21:10:01	@BoyGeorge I have neither the look nor the sound but I do have the smell!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-23 20:37:30	My brain does not function without caffeine. My fellow sufferers, retweet this in solidarity! #CaffieneAddictsOfTheWeb
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:35:20	@BipolarBlogger Ah, yes, THOSE. I remember those. They’re a good idea aren’t they?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:34:17	@Nigelrefowens Electric, thermal pants too I’d say.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:33:39	Anyway, I’m off for a sulk. Tigers got battered by Sarries. I am sufficiently male to be pathetically distraught by my team losing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:31:54	@rbhu7 Shit! How much will that cost?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:31:20	@BipolarBlogger Don’t cease your rant! All your rants are great. More rants!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:30:26	@rbhu7 Well shower with you and sing about women’s genitalia
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:27:56	@stavvers …for very little reason that I can see. I see the erasures (harmful) etc, but the hate behind them bemuses me. It’s ridiculous 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:27:07	@stavvers Whatever the disagreement I think you get a lot of shite that is utterly undeserved. Mind you these twitter spats get vicious 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:24:57	@rbhu7 is it a war about homoeroticism? Because we win.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:24:31	@judeinlondon whatever the disagreement, this sort of thing crosses the line, surely. Come on, you’re much, MUCH, better than this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:23:05	@rbhu7 Footballism is a stain on humanity. Come the revolution,you will be purged. Report to your re-education camp
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:20:41	@martin_crowson Damn they are good. Solid basics no ugly win, real direct rugby. They out Leicestered Leicester. We’re all to cock this year

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:17:13	@rbhu7 Of course! I refuse to tolerate footballism and soccerists. Perverts and scum to a man.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:15:03	@rbhu7 a real sport. You wouldn’t understand. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:14:05	I think Sarries played well. Not brilliantly. They have done the basics. Tigers by contrast have overlaps, indiscipline etc. #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 01:06:58	Oh for fuck’s sake, Tigers! #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 00:48:41	@martin_crowson Not a good decision. We need a little more understanding and a little less pedantry from refs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-22 00:13:21	Okay, Tigers, if you do win in the last minutes I’ll forgive you even though I will be dying of a heart attack like last week. #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 23:44:18	@martin_crowson @LeicesterTigers I’m greatly saddened by the loss of Flood. I hope we can recruit Burns and really develop him.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 23:39:17	It upsets me to say this but Sarries look the better, more cohesive team so far. Tigers need to shape up. #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 23:33:02	Dear Tigers, please could you win this game earlier than the last 2 mins of the match for the sake of my heart. COME ON TIGERS!! #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 11:02:16	@piersmorgan STOP SAYING THINGS I AGREE WITH! It makes it awfully hard to loathe you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 10:15:48	@john_s_wilkins Probably for the best. Birthdays have distressing mathematics associated with them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 09:45:05	@SexKittenParty I now want to make a joke about "record setting". I'm a bad person with an over-active joke gland. I'm just going to sign.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 09:27:14	@john_s_wilkins Also, Happy Birthday for our birthday. I missed it.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 07:40:31	@Xanthe_Cat @ool0n This obsession about RW is getting a little bit, you know, orf. (Major British condemnation)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 07:17:22	@ool0n Yeah, that projectionist needs to adjust the focus a bit. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 07:15:40	@ool0n I mean, at some point there really has to be something better to do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 07:15:22	@ool0n True, true. But you'd think simple things like going to the toilet would get in the way of obsessional drivel.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 07:13:42	@ool0n Where do they find the time?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 07:12:26	@ool0n The usual suspect re FtBullies etc? Or do you have a new love interest?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 07:11:02	@ool0n You kicked a fake Twitter puppy? ZOMG!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 07:07:49	@ool0n What have you done now? Have you murdered a Twitter puppy or something?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 07:04:10	I have an hypothesis that the order of guests on Graham Norton's sofa is a reflection of societal prejudices.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 07:00:44	@notquitedandy AMAZING innit?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 06:57:51	@notquitedandy So not only are the MRAs criminally damaging a much needed reporting system, but they're doing it ina racist way? Stay classy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 03:17:34	@tkingdoll @mjrobbins People afraid of the emerging sexuality of their kids want them kept in the dark. These people believe ignorance helps

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 03:09:47	@bmagnanti Crikey! You’re really in the back of beyond. I’m envious!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 03:07:35	@bmagnanti They’re not? Given the English attitude to Scotland on occasion I am surprised.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 03:02:44	@somegreybloke I take great offence at the implication that it is ever not time for a drink. (Hic) ;-) Have a wonderful drink!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 02:57:58	@somegreybloke Exactly! My motivational area has low standards, why can’t other bits of my brain (like the self realisation bit) keep up?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 02:54:35	@somegreybloke I admire your dedication, sir.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 02:38:33	Frustcrastination (n): That annoying feeling that you have work to do, energy and will to do it but you avoid it for some damn reason anyway

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 02:08:03	@flyingparchment Okay, point taken.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-21 02:03:42	@flyingparchment I was being facecious you realise? I agree with you, from one definition of gender roles etc btw.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-20 23:16:46	@notquitedandy Yeah, that's a good bit of the joke.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-20 23:12:19	@notquitedandy I’ve been told I bear a striking resemblance. In both physiology and drinking habits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-20 23:09:05	@notquitedandy And now I am worried you will take the jocular dismissal more seriously than the more factual admiration. I’m such a worrier!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-20 23:06:07	@notquitedandy Okay, not you. (Sorry, couldn’t resist. Low hanging joke etc)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-14 20:22:11	@RevRichardColes And the spirit of goodwill to all men was in the air. Until there was only one pair of discounted knickers left.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-14 06:24:44	@soozaphone @mjrobbins Bugger! Now I have to think of one in a sufficiently short time to appear witty. Can we just pretend I did?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-14 06:22:56	@soozaphone @mjrobbins okay then, calling Martin a troll? What’s next? Me making a terrible joke about Conan Doyle believing in fairies?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-14 06:19:18	@soozaphone @mjrobbins calling me a troll? What’s next? Believing in fairies? Tchoh.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-14 06:18:05	@mjrobbins @soozaphone Yeah. Telly is never quite right when some joker writes it all down and tries to make it all literary.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-13 07:17:13	@ool0n I always go AFK and miss the intersting stuff. What's the block/twitter discussion about this time?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-12 02:40:29	@flyingparchment Was it a white, middle class bin that could feature in a Daily Mail article? Because I hear those bins are, like, oppressed

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-12 00:04:27	@isoglyph @jon_trickett I can understand it. Not a fan of Labour either,
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 20:14:23	@jon_trickett It's incredible? No, it's very credible. It's blisteringly nasty, unpleasant, ideological, economically unsound, and crooked.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:53:45	@garwboy Non, rien de rien, non je ne regrette rien...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:51:33	@stavvers Oh the knives we hide deep come out fast in my experience. Especially over (relatively) petty issues. Sad really.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:46:12	@stavvers actually fucking harmful.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:46:03	@stavvers I confess, I fid the general tenor of the opbjections to the feminist tenner a bit daft. But then I thik the "smugsexual" thing is
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:37:09	@stavvers Ah, that makes more sense. Like most of my jokes, easily misunderstood though! You might end up explaining yourself endlessly. :-P
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:36:27	@stavvers I'm not a fan of slut shaming, however it's packaged.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:35:16	@stavvers Ah. Are you just trying to wind up a slightly different type of feminist then?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:34:47	@stavvers ...I 100% support anyone's right to being open about their sexuality etc. And if I understand "smugsexual" right, I'm not a fan.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:33:04	@stavvers ...mode of disagreement. I don't think your tweet was sexually aggressive regardless of whether or not I agree with you....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:32:27	@stavvers Annoyingly for me (because THAT'S important) I disagree with your dismissal of the feminist tenner, but 100% agree with your...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:19:29	@notquitedandy By definition choosing one candidate excludes others. It's not an important problem, and a very minor complaint.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:19:00	@notquitedandy True, but no candidate could ever replace/represent the set {women}. I think it's illogicalto assume any one woman could.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:17:31	@notquitedandy Wait, inclusion of a woman on the tenner is an erasure of women?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:17:01	@j0sswhite ..be done by those with that desire and ability. I'm not that guy! Far too short tempered! There would be bodies. ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:15:41	@j0sswhite Very VERY true.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:15:20	@notquitedandy ...a presumably desired point Z requires we move through a number of other points I don't see the problem with this as a step
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:14:28	@notquitedandy Possibly, possibly. It's nbot without problem, that I get, but it's also part of an extant system. Going from point A to...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:13:45	@flyingparchment THAT is obviously a problem. And obviously argue the hell out of those problems.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:13:09	@j0sswhite Well, I'm having to retrain at 39 to do bioscience (from chemistry) because thereare no/v few jobs/progression atm.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:11:52	@notquitedandy Says this idealist! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:11:38	@notquitedandy Nothing ever is.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:06:45	@j0sswhite Probably!? LOL yeah, definitely am trying now. I cannot claim the same for my 19 year old self, but did learn, so some virtue!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:04:43	@j0sswhite Oh we could. But, youm know, on quiet days... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:04:22	@j0sswhite I confess though, as a man, it really is best for me to stay the hell out of those arguments I'd just get (rightly) murdered! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 19:01:22	@j0sswhite Feminism is a political movement. There will ALWAYS be petty arguments. That's how political movements progress. It's a pain.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:58:54	@j0sswhite There are a million different "styles" and "tactics" (understatement). And the vast ajority are appropriate for SOME context. 1/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:57:26	@j0sswhite Sounds good to me. I'm an atheist too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:55:26	@ool0n @flyingparchment @hyperdeath128k Genius!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:55:13	@j0sswhite Ah yes. THOSE. I know about THOSE. (Although I think the feminist wrangles within online atheism are very relevant and on point)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:53:52	@RefugeCharity You're very welcome. I confess I altered the order of my #feministtenner s for comedy purpose. I'm weak like that! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:52:29	@adambvary @rafsanchez @notquitedandy Thank you! Hence why I am an ardent fan, and user, of the Oxford comma. It's simple logic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:51:31	@CCriadoPerez @RefugeCharity I confess the fourth #feministtenner will be handed over to the bar person with a significant look though!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:50:25	@j0sswhite Do you mean bitter infighting over percieved slights and (relatively) small differences? Because that's the tale of all politics.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:48:24	2) Third goes to @RefugeCharity . because OBVIOUSLY! Fourth goes to the pub. I'm no angel. #feministtenner

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:44:57	@RichardDawkins @NotungSchwert @EricROlson I find it risible that umpteen years on, the most vocal critics of TSG still focus on "selfish"

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:37:13	@BipolarBlogger Mind you, never published a book, so no idea how the process goes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:36:55	@BipolarBlogger Surely a proper publisher will find your book suitable. Lot's of MH books out there, your bound to be a good one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-11 18:34:30	@ool0n @flyingparchment @hyperdeath128k You're not going to eat it? I suppose kicking puppies and punching kittens is too good for you?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 05:37:35	@AskMissAlice Our conspecifics can be, erm, “impressive” at times can’t they? I can’t claim to be happy about this unfortunately.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 05:31:25	@AskMissAlice That is impressive Bigot Density. Maybe they need an award. One way trip to the moon?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:56:15	@noodlemaz MISANDRY!!!! Y U HURT MY MAN FEEFEES???
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:55:30	@noodlemaz {Does manly pose} {Is actually miles away and thus useless}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:53:25	@helenlewis As parodies/satires of real life go it isn’t a subtle one is it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:52:39	@garwboy Ah aspirational names. I wanted to name my kid Nobelprize or Massiveknob. My wife laughed at both and vetoed them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:51:19	@RevRichardColes It’s a shocking film. I’d sue if I thought it would help.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:45:35	@fakedansavage Always has been hasn’t it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:27:21	Okay, The Conjuring is scary. I don’t believe in a single aspect of the supernatural etc, but these sorts of films get met every time. Nice!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:09:08	@ryan_lamb It was a beauty as far as I’m concerned. Superb playmaking.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:07:12	@judeinlondon More PEOPLE, full stop. And in a far more serious way than “Hurr Hurr sex”.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:04:35	@Jo_Caulfield Phew thought you were referring to Conjugal Unpleasantness. I don’t bother my wife any more, the begging and crying upsets her
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:02:10	@judeinlondon Agreed (in toto). I confess I am bemused by this whole wrangle.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 04:00:42	@CCriadoPerez I think I’m a few years older than you, I’m giving presents to kids and consoling divorcees. My wedding days are largely done.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 03:59:21	@judeinlondon Jokes apart, you are right. Sexual expression, esp female sexual expression can always be used in a radical fashion.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 03:57:32	@CCriadoPerez All weddings are evil. Except mine, which was ace. Honest. Easy location, no moving around (atheist, no church), free bar.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 03:47:07	I am watching The Conjuring, on my own, in a dark house. Yes, yes I am trying to properly terrify myself for no good reason.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 03:44:27	@sousan50 Okay, that IS old! ;-) Old is not a bad thing though. (I keep telling myself this)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 03:30:51	@sousan50 Although Shilton was before my Leicester days
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 03:30:22	@sousan50 I’ll forgive you the wrong sport. You’re not that old, I remember Shilton.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 02:59:46	@sousan50 Haha! Any time you want babbling Tigers obsession, just ask. I’m an endless source.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 02:59:09	@sousan50 I lived right on the doorstep of Welford road for a few years. I am…erm…obsessed.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 00:49:27	I cannot believe it! Montpellier keep coming back from nowhere. Mostly from Leicester errors/breakaways.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 00:46:45	@martin_crowson I’d second that. Lots of breakaway brilliance and threat out of a blue sky (well, red sky) but much less cohesive phase play
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 00:43:28	@LeicesterTigers Don’t punch anything or anyone Lamby #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 00:42:49	Oh goody! I will not believe this game is over until 10 mins after it’s finished. Montpellier keep coming back #Tigerslive

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 00:20:05	Come on Tigers! Get another try or two and knock Montpellier out of this game! #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-09 00:13:36	@martin_crowson Nervy game I think. A few errors keeping things edgy and Montpellier really up for it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-08 22:59:07	COME ON TIGERS!!!!! #tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-08 09:00:17	@ZJemptv @lousycanuck Which is why I restrict 99.99% of what I have to say about trans people to “I know fuck all and will be shutting up”

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-08 02:20:21	@RevRichardColes Might I just offer some hideous toadying by saying you were fantastic on QI the other night, Reverend?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-08 02:11:30	@ryan_lamb Never found Barnes to be the best commentator. He's no Leicester fan, which immediately damns him in my eyes! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-08 01:54:57	It is satire. Oh thank the Fates!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-08 00:00:48	@rbhu7 Yeah. You were being a complete Cowell.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 23:57:40	@rbhu7 Oh now that is too far. Calling people, human beings, Piers Morgans. That’s beyond the pale. UNFOLLOW!!!!! Wargarble!!!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 22:56:12	@beccybutcher @BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ I see my suggestion was not well appreciated. I agree with the description though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 22:15:36	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ Haha! Fair enough. Warm flat coke? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 22:01:27	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ Maybe the stronger flavours are beyond reach for now, but possibly fruit teas etc?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 21:59:21	@BBCRadio4 Vital, considering he came out as BISEXUAL and 99% of the media kept referring to him as being gay. Bisexual invisibility again.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 21:55:47	Apparently the older you get the more secure in yourself you feel. I saw an advert that told me so. Today I strongly feel that is horseshit.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 09:18:07	@zaranosaur I think it’s a reference to “brewer’s droop”. {delicate cough}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 08:52:37	@johannahamilton Yeah definitely a second date type question
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 08:50:37	@johannahamilton It’s probably not the done thing to enquire about your preferences regarding a purchased winkle
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 08:47:00	@zaranosaur Blanket forts help, so I would be amazingly grateful. I may sit in it and swear at people whilst drinking tramp strength cider
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 08:45:18	@johannahamilton True, true. Nothing like a well purchased winkle.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 08:44:22	@johannahamilton Well, I should cuntity-fucking well hope so.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 08:43:34	@johannahamilton I might be able to winkle myself out of the pit somehow. There’s probably a winkle based joke that could help there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 08:42:06	@johannahamilton Fucking probably.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 08:41:06	I may say “fuck” rather a lot though. 2\2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 08:40:45	Bugger. I am definitely cycling into a deep depression. I’m already in the moderate phases. I’ll do my best not to bang on about it. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 08:32:04	@stfumisogynists Since I am rapidly disappearing up my backside and into the dark, shitty cave of depression, let me know when you make it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 08:06:27	@stuxnetsource Drawback?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 05:11:25	@mike_feldman End sounds good to me then!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 05:04:14	@ZachWeiner I had a similar experience with crystallography and group theory. {Shudder}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 05:02:49	@dELYSEious I should point out my problem is with the concept of "leader" not "sceptic", lest I be misunderstood,
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 05:02:15	@mike_feldman Because after I blocked one utter fuckwit, you miraculously appeared. So I can cheerfully block more fuckwits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 05:01:40	@mike_feldman And on an unrelated note this is a) getting in the way of my evening anf b) exceedingly boring. Now end? Or block? I'm easy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 05:00:38	@mike_feldman No no, my bad on that one, didn't think it through. Was chatting to wife at same time. Ignore it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 05:00:03	@mike_feldman It's not a rule, but it is called "not being a hypocrite". basic standard of intellectual honesty. Try it sometime.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:44:40	@mike_feldman Try this: "I want to protect you from X" {Does X} This is a bad plan! Hypocrisy/dishonesty at worst, delusion at best.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:42:37	@mike_feldman Can you actually follow an argument or is your defensiveness preventing you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:42:20	@mike_feldman Not mutually exclusive. You made claim about nature of tweet. Tweet made no such admonishion. It was compare/contrast.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:40:14	@mike_feldman It's all a little bit....desperate and defensive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:39:56	@mike_feldman criticising the actual wrongdoing/error/whatever under criticism.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:39:33	@mike_feldman What makes you an apologist is your willingness to criticise a mild and valid criticism by going after the critic and not...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:38:47	@mike_feldman Elyse's point, which she clarified, was that this is a PR problem. Not necessarily earth shattering, but definitely bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:38:15	@mike_feldman ...within the context of the article linked, referencing similar (if not identical) acts by other orgs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:37:46	@mike_feldman ...point. JREF fucked up in a manner that many do. It looks like a (to me minor) fraud, as described by the relevant person...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:36:53	@mike_feldman ...it also helps then when "our team" (yuck) fucks up, we go after them just as assiduously as the wooists etc. That was the..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:36:18	@mike_feldman ...sceptics are going to "protect people from scams" then we need to be squeaky clean. Or at least it certainly helps....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:35:39	@mike_feldman No the original tweet did not admonish sceptics to go after JREF/Dunning scams! LOL! It was compare/contrast. If we, as...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:32:21	@mike_feldman What did the Broward person describe the act of the other org as? Similar act, different extent.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:23:25	@mike_feldman If you're going to see that mild a criticism as some stinging "grenade lobbing" at JREF you;re off your rocker.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:21:42	@mike_feldman ...scale. JREF's act = small beer and readily paid up (a point in their favour I've mentioned 3 times now. I'm such a hater)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:21:00	@mike_feldman ...as perpetrating fraud, the JREF committed similar type, but lesser extent of fraud., Which goes back to my point about...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:20:19	@mike_feldman Either way the act is the same, JREF doesn't pay for N years, other institution doesn't pay for N+M years and is described...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:19:06	@mike_feldman You're right, the JREF thing was "for over 2 years", my bad. Personally though I think the "fraud" can be read to apply to all
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:16:20	@hyperdeath128k @dELYSEious Damn right.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:13:33	@jonronson Don't say anything a bit sexist during it. That's where the last guy went wrong.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:07:41	@dELYSEious It's days like this I think I should become a sceptial "leader" just so I can commit genocide and bask in the adulation ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:06:29	@dELYSEious Also: IT'S NOT FRAUD BECAUSE WAH! and ELYSE IS KNOWN HATER WAH! Rational. Way to deal with any form of fact or argument folks
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:01:48	@dELYSEious Remind me never to offer mild criticism of the JREF based on a news story again. Some fuckwit hath done blown his load about it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:00:51	@OccupyCheck You're the one with the floods of Tweets about how evil any JREF critic is. Projection much? You're too tiresome to bother with
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 04:00:19	@OccupyCheck HAHA really? You're the person who cannot cope with mild criticism of JREF and I'm the loon? They fucked up. Big deal. Move on.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:57:44	@OccupyCheck But let's not call a spade a flatish implement for digging the ground with just because you lack the integrity to cope
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:56:57	@OccupyCheck And I'm seriously glad they won't be prosecuted. They've also paid up in a timely fashion, a major plus point IMO.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:56:32	@OccupyCheck And since when is the definition of fraud that it must be prosecuted? Broward County apparently can't make the law retroactive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:55:28	@OccupyCheck Yeah *I'm* the dolt. Do fuck off.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:55:16	@OccupyCheck An 8 year transition? The Broward County person described it as fraud. I've already said there are a spectrum of frauds etc....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:54:23	@OccupyCheck But hey, make this all about someone else, that'll successfully deflect attention. Not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:53:52	@OccupyCheck Your whining is simply because you dislike the source of the links to those articles and you can't take valid criticism of JREF
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:53:16	@OccupyCheck I mean, you can't even form a simple syllogism. Whether or not I support the JREF is unrelated to the content of those articles
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:52:10	@OccupyCheck Piggybacking? You mean reading the news articles linked? Pfff you're a hilarious little fuck up aren't you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:51:42	@OccupyCheck You also seem to miss the point that even if Elyse was some evil anti-JREF monster, the criticism of their fraud is still valid
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:51:07	@OccupyCheck You might be surprised by what I do or do not know, but still you provide no evidence, and thus can be ignored.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:50:35	@OccupyCheck ...support. But enough that if it was combined with other things might be.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:50:03	@OccupyCheck I expect them to do better and be squeaky clean. This was a fuck up on their part. Not so big to me that I'd withdraw my...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:49:34	@OccupyCheck Oh and you do not know the definition of concern trolling. JREF is an instituion I support (financially as well as other ways)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:48:46	@OccupyCheck ...Elyse in the absence of evidence and thus asked for it. (and got it)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:48:29	@OccupyCheck Says you. And I am not remotely inclined to believe you in the absence of evidence. Just like I was not inclined to believe...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:47:36	@OccupyCheck The whining from you and others only started for me after I read those news reports.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:47:08	@OccupyCheck Has it been clear? Since when? As I said to Elyse, I'd seen nothing about the claims she made until she linked the news stories
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:38:37	@UnknownEric @dELYSEious You have high standards for internet wrangles. I approve and wish you the very, very best of luck! I want that too!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:35:40	@OccupyCheck Now, a favour, fuck off and stop bothering me or actually come up with something worth talking about. Personality politics=dull
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:34:34	@dELYSEious YOU TOO! I was Hitler for ages. Then I disagreed with someone else and became Stalin I'm hoping for Pol Pot to make the trifecta
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:32:55	@OccupyCheck Projecting your notions of preconceived bias onto a critic is a bit patheitc, especially when you are avoiding the criticism.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:31:50	@dELYSEious Yeah sorry about that! ;-) BTW I just said you were Hitler. Well I didn't, but I am sure someone will say I did! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:30:57	@OccupyCheck Again why you drivellers think you're fooling anyone is beyond me. The JREF fucked up, go talk to them about it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:30:08	@OccupyCheck ...would still be true. Interestingly, like the wooists, you're trying to attack the critic Big sceptic points there. Do better
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:29:18	@OccupyCheck ...ot hose sceptic orgs that are trying to oppose fraud. Thats a valid criticism whoever makes it. Elyse could be Hitler and...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:28:20	@OccupyCheck ...plan to commit fraud/act fraudulently. It gives irrelevant ammo to the loons for one, and undermines the credibility of...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:27:19	@OccupyCheck Elyse's point was, to me, very clear: if we (as sceptics) are going to promote ourselves as opponents of fraud, it's a bad...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:26:34	@OccupyCheck 1) Elyse asked to @'d out of our convo. 2) I asked to be @'d out of any convo about this with her about this 3) You read minds?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:23:02	@OccupyCheck Or even, I dunno, why don't you ask what the point was? The point I got (and made) is the JREF should be better than this. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:21:57	@OccupyCheck Rather than continuing conversations with people who are not fooled by and are bored of your schtick, why don't you read? 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:15:08	@dELYSEious But the important thing is that this factless drivel is really nothing personal. How you put up with this I'll never know.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:13:49	@dELYSEious They're talking to me about what you (allegedly) said (you didn't!), not what I said. You want out. I want out. Boredom abounds!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:12:17	@OccupyCheck @Mowgli @TheImprovateer Then if you're not talking about what I said, @me out of the conversation becvause I am uninterested.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:09:24	@OccupyCheck @Mowgli @TheImprovateer No it isn't. So stop getting your knickers in knots because you cannot cope with mild criticism of JREF
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:08:32	@dELYSEious @OccupyCheck @Mowgli @TheImprovateer Sure. Apologies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:08:20	@OccupyCheck @Mowgli @TheImprovateer ...described by the relevant Broward County official. Is it a big fraud like, say Madoff?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:07:26	@OccupyCheck @dELYSEious @Mowgli @TheImprovateer I didn't easily throw any word around, the actions of the JREF were fraudulent as...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:03:41	@OccupyCheck @dELYSEious @Mowgli @TheImprovateer Or are people forever condemned by their past crimes/mistakes/whatever?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 03:02:47	@OccupyCheck @dELYSEious @Mowgli @TheImprovateer Which is a valid criticism of her past actions. Does redemption/change occur?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 02:58:48	@OccupyCheck @Mowgli @TheImprovateer @dELYSEious How come? Because I don't take you seriously?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 02:47:24	@dELYSEious @OccupyCheck @Mowgli @TheImprovateer OH NO! You changed your mind?! You do realise you must now be burned at the stake, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 02:42:43	@OccupyCheck @Mowgli @TheImprovateer @dELYSEious ..of an attempt to reflect things back to Elyse. Gosh it's like there's this pattern!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 02:42:18	@OccupyCheck @Mowgli @TheImprovateer @dELYSEious I will say I find it "interesting" that two newish/relatively inactive accounts are part...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 02:40:20	@OccupyCheck @Mowgli @TheImprovateer @dELYSEious Elyse were you a tele-psychic?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 01:58:53	@ProfBrianCox @DrAliceRoberts In a just world. This is the world in which homoepaths are forced to use only homoeopathy. I'm feeling mean.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-07 01:49:56	@DrAliceRoberts @ProfBrianCox A contentless spray of shit from a creationist? Steve Green no less? Say it ain't so!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:38:05	@Maggie_McNeill @bmagnanti ZOMG PSEUDONYM!!!!!!! Sorry I got all excited there. I thought you were going to ask me to publish something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:29:46	@mike_feldman @delYSEious ...nature of the criticism. It's not very impressive of you, and a rather obvious smokescreen/rhetorical gambit
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:29:12	@mike_feldman @delYSEious You're quite obviously lying about critics, the Tweets show it, and making up overblown nonsense about the...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:28:08	@mike_feldman @delYSEious ...previously fraudulent acts. Fraud covers a spectrum of activitiy, nowhere has anyone said they are Madoff.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:27:10	@mike_feldman @delYSEious Which is a plus point for the JREF, but that still does not mkae them beyond reasonable criticism for their...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:26:44	@mike_feldman @delYSEious And anything the JREF has done is the former, i.e. small beer at best, something they have (almost entirely) paid
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:26:16	@mike_feldman @delYSEious ...of the JREF as fraud, as you'd know of course if you'd bothered to read. Granted there fraud and there's FRAUD
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:25:42	@mike_feldman @delYSEious Oh and you are misrepresenting what happened, the Broward Property Appraiser's Office described the actions...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:21:43	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious and if “oh FFS do better” is lobbing grenades, you need to get a sense of proportion
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:19:59	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious …them for the wrong they did do. Thinking is hard for you too it seems.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:19:32	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious …After all they are mostly paid up, and appear to have done so reasonably fast, it’s wrong to criticise them …
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:18:50	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious So in an article about institutions evading their tax responsibility, an article the JREF comes out of WELL IMO…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:17:42	@bengoldacre I skate (roller) places. It’s a bit incongruous as a fat nearly 40 year old, but I do it well! Fight the norm, keep skating!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:12:59	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious Not American, not self employed, so unlikely. Nice try though. So you have evidence JREF’s accountant made error?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 23:03:46	@onesarahjones I'm waiting for white people to claim he was white. It's surely close given the level of appropriative bullshit so far
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:56:55	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious Not the imagined/invented weakness of others. Yeesh what a muppet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:56:37	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious ...this was somehow something people were doing before actual convictions not after them. Police your own weakness
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:56:04	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious Another weak thing from you is whining about people "convicting" admittedly/demonstrably guilty parties as if...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:55:19	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious ...the fact that you make things up to attack critics. Nowhere did anyone say that JREF was phony, nor imply it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:54:28	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious What's weak is your focus on the critics of people doing bad things, not the people doing bad things. And...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:53:38	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious You missed the words "more likely" and "if so". These are indicators of the conditional tense. Reading is hard!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:37:01	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious ...to be there so you can whine about unfair persecution isntead of dealing with the actual wrong doers. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:36:36	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious A fact you are weaselling around because you seem incaable of reading what was said instead of what you want 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:35:48	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious They fucked up, and it is not unfair criticism to say so and hold those responsible accountable. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:35:19	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious Dishonest critics of scepticism and defenders of woo are not shy of a tu quoque. JREF didn't need to do this. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:34:12	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious ...acting in good faith. It's not a hard concept, I wonder why you are trying so hard not to understand it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 22:33:42	@mike_feldman @dELYSEious ...behave scrupulously. These are examples of failure to do that, which in turn make it harder to be seen to be..

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 07:46:43	{Sigh} Reasonable scepticism about the sincerity of some previous opponents of Mandela is not denial of his brilliance. It’s recognition 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 07:38:11	@angelasmithmp @FullCommujism … denial of Mandela’s brilliance, it’s recognition that even in the face of greatness, some will be unmoved

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 07:33:21	@mjrobbins *IF* real views are negative! then exposing yet further hypocrisy is not mere partisan bashing! but refusing to be fooled.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 07:30:14	@TheSimonEvans Exactly! DC’s not in a position to give his “real” views, whatever they are, good, bad, or indifferent.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 07:28:42	@mjrobbins …scepticism is claimed to be mere point scoring. Claiming passivity not reconciliation as Mandela’s legacy would be the error 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-12-06 07:27:35	@mjrobbins If that is all that is going on, then fair enough. But if continuing to hold those in power to account, with reasonable 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-09 01:05:17	@flyingparchment It's the misanthropy that afflicts me after a working wek and can only be cured by alcohol. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-09 01:04:45	@flyingparchment Don't mind me, it's Friday and I'm being sarcastic about labels. Actually, I'm being sarcastic about everything.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-09 00:58:57	@flyingparchment Yeah, but you're a super special sparkly snowflake unicorn individual just like everyone else, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-08 17:00:54	@marcuschown In the words of Rowan Atkinson, I would not trust this bunch to sit the right way around on a toilet.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-06 08:26:58	@mistressmatisse Deeply agreed! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-06 08:25:28	@mistressmatisse Are men not spending money on SWs again? We do that a lot. There's no way for me to get safely out of this joke is there?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-06 08:11:12	@robinince It's a personal favourite. It's distinctly British in a rather wonderful way.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-06 07:20:04	@TimHeal8193 I googled. I cried a little and some wee came out. I think I can do this. There may, however, be swearing. I'm out of beer.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-06 05:24:56	@docfreeride @Chemjobber I think my point is there is insufficient ill informed hysteria about this. Come on Twitter #BadCoatOutrage
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-06 05:21:53	@docfreeride @Chemjobber 1) think of the terrorists using this ZOMG, 2) I bet they still try to charge fat people for extra weight. Evil.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-06 00:43:30	4) A puddle of my own urine/vomit and an attempt at comedy swearing is all that can save me now. My eyebrow is off my head it is so raised.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-06 00:39:50	1) Right. That's it. It's only Tuesday and already I am moving for the double strength cider and shouting at strangers from a gutter option.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-05 21:07:30	@Chemistry_Kat The joys of the SA catalogue. I remember when it was a book you know. I had to cover one side of the page to get that feeling
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-05 21:04:20	@rbhu7 You know one part of that is really not okay, right? The guy makes me want to punch kittens, but his fatness is deeply irrelevant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-05 21:00:44	@rbhu7 Because of political reasons or just because he’s fat?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-11-05 21:00:03	@professor_dave Aren’t there some truly lovely people out there? For very, very broad values of “lovely”.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-31 18:28:37	@rbhu7 I always do. And Felicity Kendall. Someone needs to keep an eye on her. She's up to something. It probably involves Space Lizards

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-31 17:42:18	@Peston Also, could you do me a small favour and slap George Osborne the next time you see him. Nothing too violent, perhaps use a fish. Ta.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-31 17:41:31	@Peston I'm no economist, nor do I play one on television, but the last century or so causes me to think the answer is "no". Emphatically.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-31 17:39:04	@BipolarBlogger Haha! Yeah. Problem is life tends to be n=1, not very repeatable overall! I realise the odd Buddhist diagrees! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-31 17:37:54	Failing that, there's always the quiet watch of the odd inspirational thing on YouTube. Is it bad I have a playlist for this?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-31 17:36:38	I may have to have a corrective look out the window at some nature to sort me out. A brief bit of tree and bird should put paid to mardiness
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-31 17:35:40	I blame Robin Thicke, libertarians, KFC and meetings. The word "meetings" should be said with some venom.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 18:17:44	@mjrobbins There are also typos afoot on my twitter. I blame a conspiracy of space lizards.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 18:17:19	@mjrobbins Oh and incidentally there's movement affot on the Maidonian sceptics front. I'll email you an update this week.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 18:15:24	@mjrobbins It appears rooftiles are very in this season.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 18:15:11	@mjrobbins My car is wearing a rooftile and roof capstone at a jaunty angle. I am most amused.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 18:14:26	@mjrobbins Have you been affected by the weather at all?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 17:36:15	@CarlieP Cheers. I'm trying to figure out if stuff from the house landing on the car is one claim or two! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 17:34:23	@CarlieP And of course, thank you for your sympathy. Have you been unaffected up there?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 17:33:17	@CarlieP We get crap storms here though nothing like those ones in the USA. Everything's bigger there dontcherknow (I met a Texan recently)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 17:32:27	@CarlieP Meh, Ordure Occurs! ;-) I'm hoping the excess won't be expensive and my day is not embuggered by endless old times on the phone.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 17:31:14	Car windscreen and bonnet demolished by raining rooftiles and capstones. #ukstorm
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 17:30:22	But surely raining rooftiles and capstones is taking the piss a little? 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 17:29:57	Opened the door, discovered a decent part of my roof had landed on my car. Into every life a little rain must fall. This I understand 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 16:51:41	I have had a weekend with my in laws. It was pleasant Thus the 637 tweets of mother in law jokes I was about to make have been cancelled.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-28 05:09:42	@mjrobbins It is a bit moist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-25 16:14:03	@brianmoore666 That was always my reaction when they tried to sell it to me. "Really? How innumerate do you think I am?"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-25 16:13:20	@professor_dave Please be aware you will now get 100s of humorous tweets from people claiming to be various species of "artist". Many solo.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-25 15:44:41	@Clisare I suppose a stern “thus is not a valid screening method” wouldn’t stop the gits in their tracks?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-25 15:43:21	@TaraFlynn @nikkihegarty THE HORROR!!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-25 15:42:44	@mrjamesob The Mail might not always be wrong. They get the day right for example. But you can rely on them to be almost universally awful.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-25 15:41:28	@brianmoore666 How could anyone think that? I’ve performed extensive tests on claret this morning alone. Tastes nothing like mint.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-25 15:38:14	@CCriadoPerez Nice one! Good to get some positive recognition, eh?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-25 15:37:04	@JamesBlunt @stevyncolgan @MigsterMMA I read that Mr Blunt stopped WWIII. I confess I’ve not heard his music but that’s impressive #confused

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-22 19:20:01	@judeinlondon Oh I know. I have the same problem. I suspects it’s that everyone else has such terribly erroneous standards. {haughty sniff}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-22 18:44:50	@judeinlondon You fuck things up completely too? We should start a training seminar. It would work but the first session would be hilarious.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-22 18:32:36	@frockdoctrineuk That’s fucking impressive… …damn!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-21 22:50:04	It's even causing typos. I blame this Tory government.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-21 01:04:23	@SpokesGay And we Brits are importing that terror for a variety of really bad reasons. Not least because it couples to our shitty libel law.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-21 00:57:10	@Sectioned_ @BipolarBlogger My mistake, I think. I was trying to be cool in case someone was watching on the internet. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-21 00:55:39	@stfumisogynists Ewwww. No internet? Sex is nice though. I've heard good things. I'll mention it to my wife.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-21 00:51:48	@Sectioned_ Would a tiny url to the actual post do? I'm learning this malarky, have no idea how to simplify the url without changing title
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-21 00:50:14	@Sectioned_ @BipolarBlogger A lady at my bipolar self help group refers to people without BPD as "muggles". I know it's bad but I laugh.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-20 17:09:36	@BipolarBlogger Your blistering scorn is hilarious. And since when is OJ a luxury? Move on from the 70s hotel people!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-20 17:07:18	@culturevultures 1) No. 2) With me it’s always passion, enthusiasm and a genuine desire to see someone else enjoy this cool thing I’ve found

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-20 16:50:20	@robinince Psychotherapists etc are merely people too. Something that everyone occasionally needs reminding of.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-20 15:39:35	@john_s_wilkins True, true. Well, not that anything really is true of course...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-20 15:33:07	@john_s_wilkins Well, you're the proper philosopher, but I see a lot of amateur sollipsists around the place. Maybe I have slacker standards
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-20 15:10:55	@_Ex_Astris_ @frockdoctrineuk @ool0n Indeed. Do you know who was also all for consent? Hitler. (Well he wasn't, but it follows the meme)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-20 14:10:23	@mistressmatisse It’s blooming true though! It’s the dictating of sexual mores that is the problem. That it comes from men is due to history
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-20 14:08:42	@john_s_wilkins Well we could try, but I’m pretty sure it would never work.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-20 00:08:37	@splendisaurus @ool0n @jedfort If there are I'd be genuinely interested to find out. My suspicion there aren't, but I've been wrong before.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-20 00:07:24	@ool0n @jedfort I missed that! I "read over" the error. Perhaps a typo? Polygit? A git in many ways? No! Naughty Louis. No mocking!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-20 00:04:29	@jedfort @ool0n Well you're not alone there. But you know what, it's "interesting" that this specific neologism is the problem isn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 23:59:48	@JenLucPiquant Yeah it does. Women are fucking terrifying! With their huge teeth and claws and pride structure... ...wait! That's lions.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 23:40:38	@jedfort @ool0n You're objecting to a neologism? So you're not a bigot, just a pedant?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 23:38:30	@ool0n @jedfort Oh but of course. They have been given to my wife, she keeps them in her handbag I'm allowed them at weekends to play rugby
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 23:35:27	@ool0n @jedfort A woman once told me I was wrong about something once and the world exploded. It got better.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 22:10:38	@ool0n That is worryingly impressive work. Worrying because I am 38 and would struggle to make anything that good.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 21:45:25	@stfumisogynists I ask because I've been a naughty bugger with my valproate this last few days, so I feel like a zombie. I am a bad monkey
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 21:44:26	@DrJaneChi @SallyStrange Who knew the marriage between the academic, postmodernist left and the antiintellectual, bigoted right would work?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 21:38:02	@notquitedandy Absolutely. I would not want to stray into harassment or bullying. My swearing drunkenly at passers-by is intended to be 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 21:37:12	@stfumisogynists Dumb question alert: Are you taking them "early" enough? I.e. Sufficiently early so that they don't mess up the *next* day
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 21:35:46	@indiaknight But they're so tasty! I've missed the point haven't I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 21:34:35	@notquitedandy True true. I have mapped the more comfortable and salubrious gutters in my locale for just these occasions.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 21:17:56	@xpinkpixie I'll give it a go. Apparently the combination makes it look like I am about to go for the jugular though! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 21:17:21	@notquitedandy The chances are I'd end up in a gutter somewhere swearing at passers-by
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 21:16:51	@notquitedandy Very, VERY tempting.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 01:25:48	@lapsangsusie @THORPEPARK @MerlinEvents Error? Correct? What is this?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 01:25:25	@SurlyAmy To be honest I am surprised you haven't done it already given the number of clay feet that have stomped on you on occasion. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 01:24:25	@BipolarBlogger @THORPEPARK And isn't that a lovely attitude to take to one of society's most vulnerable and misrepresented groups?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 01:23:48	@BipolarBlogger @THORPEPARK Doubtless they are well aware that the rope is so common, and the prejudice so widespread that no one will care.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 01:10:44	@CCriadoPerez Now I wonder why THAT level of description rarely happens to men. Couldn't be part of some wide ranging social phenomenon...?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 01:03:48	@markowenmartin @MicroWavesSci Wholeheartedly agree. Patterns of behaviour like the most recent example are very problematic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:59:23	@MicroWavesSci @markowenmartin Obviously appropriate to transgression. E.g. one time crassness =/= continued harassment
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:58:43	@MicroWavesSci @markowenmartin By "forgiveness" I mean being aware of repetition but no pursuit of individuals after lessons are learned
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:56:26	@MicroWavesSci @markowenmartin Self correction/error reduction/education coupled to appropriate, willing "forgiveness" builds communities
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:53:43	@SassAndScience @GrrlScientist @gregladen @BoraZ @ScienceBlogs Of course not. All men will be sent to Maoist reeducation camps Ok maybe not

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:46:42	@SimonM31 It *could* work. Never thought I was hedging my bets! Interesting perspective. I shall think on this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:42:12	@SaintdavidE @stephenfry decent regulation of the industry as the improvement it is. Quacks and hucksters, less so. 2/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:32:04	I need to do some serious tweeting as opposed to banter based tweeting with occasional dips into serious. This might involve chemistry
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:30:42	@MicroWavesSci @docfreeride I think a pub quiz/competition post panel to find the least sexist table could be made hilarious however.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:30:11	@MicroWavesSci @docfreeride It's only one idea. Just trying to figure out how a potentially dry and serious topic can be rendered "fun"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:27:59	@docfreeride @GrrlScientist In other words I think it's why people fail so badly. Myself included I am sure!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:27:32	@docfreeride @GrrlScientist Not boo hoo woe is me btw! Just reality!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:27:16	@docfreeride @GrrlScientist Yup. I confess it's not easy to consider other people's perspectives, though, when one is awash with privilege
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:23:14	@docfreeride @GrrlScientist 3) Why? Because our mistakes (if mistakes they are, most charitable interpretation) have ramifications

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:20:13	@docfreeride @GrrlScientist 1) This whole thing, because I am a bit of a cheeky bugger, scares me a) Oh it is SO all about me ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-19 00:00:33	@notquitedandy @stephenfry ARGH! The Competition! Burn the heretic! But seriously, better, more effective regulation of pharma helps us all
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-18 23:58:44	@Sectioned_ @Rethink_ @THORPEPARK Have they worked out it's not about nebulous (and subjective) "offense" yet? If not, wake me when they do
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-18 23:56:56	@stephenfry Speaking for a significant subsection of Big Pharma, we're working on less villainy and welcome more and better regulation.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-18 20:25:57	@tkingdoll @mjrobbins Of course not, and nor would I. Nor would I draw any parallel between this behaviour and similarly litigious antics.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-18 20:22:32	@tkingdoll @mjrobbins I am given to understand the person in question is particularly litigious.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-18 19:47:29	@THORPEPARK @BipolarBlogger Offence isn't an issue. It's a red herring in fact. Contributing to an extant culture of stigma and hostility...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-18 19:42:47	@whorephobia Perhaps to spend that time in silent contemplation of their errors. Humility seems to feature in their writings after all. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-18 19:42:00	@whorephobia Love the Catholic Church though I don't, they really should shut the fuck up about any social policy for a couple of centuries.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-14 23:30:42	@BipolarBlogger @stfumisogynists Sorry my ability to remain unsarcastic in the face of blinkered entitlement is very poor. I'm a bad boy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-14 23:29:17	@BipolarBlogger @stfumisogynists And my favorites are allies who tell people that if their FeeFees get hurt they will stop being so nice 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-14 23:28:27	@BipolarBlogger @stfumisogynists Allies are always perfect. To suggest otherwise might hurt their FeeFees. Which are IMPORTANT DAMN YOU! 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-14 23:25:09	@BipolarBlogger @stfumisogynists Because, haha, you see, haha, misuse of MH language does not, hoho, contribute to stigma in any way {sigh}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-14 00:05:44	@Gammidgy @ReadingSITP I think I should pop along to a Reading SitP for a chat, probably the most convenient for you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-14 00:04:14	@Gammidgy @ReadingSITP Thanks very much, obviously we'll be doing it on a different night from Reading event to maximise attendance at both
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-13 10:16:12	@Gammidgy yeah, I’d like to. We were going to do a couple of socials, test the waters, and kick off in the new year if at all possible.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-12 17:08:31	@guardian It’s not snobbery when, you know, it’s actually true that the Mail deliberately appeals to anti-intellectual bigots.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-12 09:26:18	@banfreebies @whorephobia I FEEL DIRTY! (And judging by the tweets of a certain sex researcher tonight, probably AM)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-12 09:21:19	@banfreebies @whorephobia i...I...I went to one of these freebie sex venues. I "pulled" a lady. We had sex. I AM SO ASHAMED!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-12 06:27:15	@rhysmorgan @jennifurret I have learned that Rhys is a media master. I opted for iTunes Breaking Bad, he was snug with Netflix a day early
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-12 06:24:40	@whorephobia it’s one of those things I, as a non SW, have no idea about. Clients per day etc. And yes 3 hrs = 1 month wage is good!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-12 06:22:37	@danbowden_ You played a blinder tonight, all Tigers did, I think a couple of minutes on the clock and someone would have gone over!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-12 06:20:24	@whorephobia Good as in good business? Or good as in acceptable balance between work/life? I.e. More than that can be onerous perhaps
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-12 06:14:49	@david_colquhoun Supplement hucksters? Oh you mean Expensive Urine Enthusiasts!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-11 00:32:16	@saspist Inscription reads "Roses are red Violets are blue I am mental So are you" Okay, it's not good, but it's a start. Too dark?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-11 00:00:55	Okay today is World Mental Health day. Tuesday was Bipolar Awareness Day. Did my wife get me a card? A present? No. OUTRAGEOUS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 22:03:40	@MJowen174 Frequently and with relish. oh, sorry, I see...erm...yes!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 22:02:14	@MJowen174 Yeah but they aren't as good as the new, old farts.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 20:16:46	@Sectioned_ @TimetoChange to clarify "phobia" does not simply equate to fear. Phobia implies physiological response etc, not just "fear of".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 20:15:12	@Sectioned_ @TimetoChange No, "phobia" dignifies the bigotry behind mental health stigma.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 18:02:40	@stfumisogynists @stavvers Not unpopular here You’re making very good points. Sorry I missed tone earlier. Need more coffee + less dumb! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 18:00:25	@stfumisogynists And earlier, I missed you were being sarcastic about coming out. You are right though. My bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 17:59:37	@stfumisogynists And rich brown people! I’m aware of my privilege though. I get to be mad in relative secret because of it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 17:46:45	@stfumisogynists …enlightened. I’ve sussed their views out “subtly” and don’t want to be subject to them. N/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 17:45:29	@stfumisogynists …less stressful than the current stress of living inauthentically regarding my wider family. They’re not what you’d 3/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 17:44:02	@stfumisogynists …not sure that being gaslighted CONSTANTLY and being subjected to the Daily Mail’s understanding of mental health is 2/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 17:42:46	@stfumisogynists Out myself? Hmmm. I HAVE been thinking about coming out to parents/in laws (I’m lucky enough to live far away) but I’m 1/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 05:23:44	@stfumisogynists I don’t want to brag but I can aim with mine. Wait…do you mean like a prehensile thing? That requires a semi. TMI?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-10 04:20:15	@tessakendall knowing scientists as I do, I am sure your contributions were welcome.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 21:08:12	@HoustonMargaret Very true very true. Bus stops, for example, are, as I discovered, not productive or appropriate venues. {Cough}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 21:04:41	@ool0n @aratina @VitaBrevi Ah. Lovely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 20:54:11	@ool0n @aratina @VitaBrevi Hacked or comedy?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 20:52:26	@HoustonMargaret Also, I would never describe Gove as a wanker. Wankers are giving someone pleasure and produce something of potential use.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 20:51:22	@HoustonMargaret Good point. I confess you can cut my rants down by 90% or so if you remove "fuck" and cognates. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 20:44:28	@abstex @helenlewis See also: Ian Duncan Smith, David Willetts, George Osborne, Teresa May, David Cameron... ...oops outed myself as a lefty
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 20:43:06	@curiouswavefn My parents were uninterested in my work until I worked on a little drug from Pfizer that is now a blue pill. I wonder why...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 20:40:56	@FollowBDT When and if I can manage to actually do mindfulness meditation, then yes, it helps immensely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 20:39:03	@HoustonMargaret 10 mins? My spleen has only warmed up by then and not even a teacher! I have run out of British swears by that point tho
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 20:34:02	@abstex @helenlewis I would not put Gove in charge of a cup of lukewarm piss, let alone a major governmental department.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 19:48:13	@brianblessed Happy Birthday!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 18:20:49	@ChemistryWorld I'm writing to them as I tweet. Okay I'm writing in crayon, but that's not a disquaifier, surely?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 18:19:53	@ChemistryWorld Maybe I'm just feeling bitter because I've been overlooked AGAIN. (Outrageous) ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 17:59:58	@GeorgeMonbiot Oh Oh I know! That would be anyone familiar with the available science. What prize do I win?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 17:58:48	@ChemBark LOL yup. But try explaining QM to a non technical audience. They have to wave their hands to fan people awake! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 17:54:10	My two choices for 2 of the 3 "serious" prizes* (Higgs and Karplus) won. Good year for me! *I am a biased scientist, deal with it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 17:52:58	@ChemistryWorld Simple! LOL. "If I could explain it to the average person, it wouldn't have been worth the Nobel Prize" R P Feynman
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 17:49:57	Superb, and well deserved (IMO Long overdue) Nobel for Karplus (especially IMO) Levitt and Warshel.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 09:59:39	Can’t sleep. Too angry. Racing thoughts. I fucking hate this shit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:45:23	@HadleyFreeman @KathViner @mjrobbins Predictable. Letbe honest, it's not going to be fact based is it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:26:50	@mjrobbins Please see 2007/2008. No?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:26:18	@WowbaggerOM Misogyny is everywhere. I hoped "we" were relatviely immune. We're not. Knackers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:25:29	@stellacreasy @IanMurrayMP @tobyperkinsmp @IainWrightMP @ChukaUmunna @LiamByrneMP @Labour_BIS_team @CCriadoPerez R U h8d by the Daily Mail?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:24:30	@SianLSanders Stop! Stop saying "Marxist feminism"! You're getting me all excited. It's not fair. That sort of language can cause unrest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:20:33	@garwboy I thought a similar thing. But Iwas too busy bleaching my eyes to be witty about it. Honest. No. Really. #LespritDeTwitscalier
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:18:56	@stfumisogynists Well you deal with misogynists wonderfully. Which amuses me. How else can I put it? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:16:01	@stfumisogynists Well make sure that you are dammit. Not enough superb people like you on Twitter (or in the world) :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:14:16	@judeinlondon Never understood why it's an insult. I am aware of slags and greatly admire their body of work. I count myself amongst them!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:13:15	Look if you spambots and/or slightly pervey people (of whom I approve) are going to do this sort iof thing can you at least make it credible
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:12:29	GODAMMIT! I just got added to a hashtag that says "mytwittercrush". Click profile, clearly a spambot (or incredibly new and pervy user) 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:10:38	@CCriadoPerez Twitter people not so useful today? I mean the meeting folk. IIRC you said you were meeting with them. Have I got wrong stick?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:09:19	@stfumisogynists ... British. Thus I can only look constipated and vaguely take the piss out of things. ;-) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:08:47	@stfumisogynists You seem to be going through it a bit at the mo. I want to reach out and be comforting and helpful but I am male and... 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:07:57	@mjrobbins Sounds like you're living in my old flat!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:07:22	@stfumisogynists And yes that was a feeble attempt ar Radiohead based levity. Look, I'm trying really hard! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-09 05:04:55	@stfumisogynists That's funny, I'm a creep + weirdo I know a song about that! From the band I call "happy Radiohead"! http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=XFkzRN yygfk …
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 22:32:36	@CCriadoPerez in your absence I increased in loveliness and helped an old lady across Twitter. And gave her flowers. Honest. No. Really.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 22:28:04	@alicebell I think they should have, personally. It would have broken tradition, institutional science prize win, but should have happened.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 22:26:47	@alicebell But surely Putin is a …{snicker}…. Shoe in? Okay I can’t say that with a straight face.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 21:28:51	@jonmbutterworth @JohnWomersley Given the underfunding of science and that Higgs did his work with pen and paper, we're due more cuts
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 19:18:40	@ool0n @frockdoctrineuk @stuxnetsource @seebiscuits I thought that...but then I read and laughed at myself!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 19:12:19	@soozaphone I haven't seen it yet, so AFAIK you win the internet!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 19:07:29	@DrTonyPadilla And, IMO, CERN. Half prize to theorists, half prize to experimentalists
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 18:53:52	@OwenJones84 My wife did her PhD in cell transport, and knows yesterdays winners, I have decided this makes me a partial winner in law! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 18:53:02	@ProfEdCopeland Agreed, sad for Kibble. I thought prize would be split between Higgs/Englert (half) and CERN (half) in break with tradition.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 18:52:06	in part to CERN (Peace prizes have gone to institutions but no science prize IIRC). so Higgs/Englert half prize, CERN half prize.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 18:51:05	I confess I thought Higgs and Englert would definitely get the prize, but that Nobel Committee would break with tradition and give prize 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 18:47:45	HIGGS AND ENGLERT!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 18:24:18	@WillBlackWriter @zoesqwilliams Nah, Tommy Robinson is too intelligent and too liberal for the Daily Mail.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-08 01:12:22	@AllyFogg @Commentisfree Miley who?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-07 19:15:49	@BipolarBlogger Of course. And I avoid them like the plague. I go for the Undeserving Innocent Telegenic Victims.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-07 19:15:15	@BipolarBlogger I wonder, does it show I am feeling cynical, annoyed and bitter about this?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-07 19:13:52	@BipolarBlogger I'm very efficient. Just to help, they were all newsworthy, pretty, middle clas, white, cis, women. I'm good like that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-07 19:10:47	@BipolarBlogger But we mad folk are running amock. Amock I tell you. Why I've killed 100 people this morning alone. Or, you know, not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-07 18:15:15	@garwboy It's a race to the bottom.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-07 08:14:47	@john_s_wilkins I think psychs etc use gorillas specifically because they are well camouflaged in all environments. Teech Teh Controverseh!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 23:48:10	@tkingdoll I had nowt to do with the game, but HEY! I resemble that remark! Help help come and see the misandry inherent in the system! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 23:20:56	@sciliz @drugmonkeyblog It's not so much a response as a full throated endorsement. I mean the act of polyamory is fine but the word? Yeesh!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 23:16:41	@drugmonkeyblog @sciliz Television: The word is half Greek, half Latin. No good can come of it (CP Scott).

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 20:15:49	@frockdoctrineuk A reasonable undertaking. I am going to eat some blue raspberry youghurt (okay I made it with blueberries too).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 19:58:08	@eithne_crow It is hilariously pathetic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 19:57:17	@eithne_crow Fancy a good old seeing to? Is this person British? I hope so because that is an awesome request in so many ways. Not all good
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 19:56:17	@danaequality Having a hard time? If so {insert relevant sympathy here}. Oh yes, impersonal generalised Internet sympathy FTW! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 19:43:54	@frockdoctrineuk PINK raspberry? Everyone knows raspberry is blue! Consider yourself unfollowed heretical scum! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 19:41:59	@bmagnanti but on her nudity/sexiness etc, nah. That’s small beer.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 19:41:31	@bmagnanti There’s plenty to have a go at Miley about (her mocking someone on the grounds of their mental health for instance) but 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 19:26:41	@y_alibhai It’s possible to agree with Peter Hitchens??? Wow. Who knew? I treat the imbecile as what he is: the weathercock of wrong.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 19:23:05	@bmagnanti The phenomenon of the old lecturing the young is only possible when the older person’s antics are not on video. Always odious tho
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 19:21:52	@bmagnanti But but but would you want YOUR daughter to grow up to be a sex negative, SW excluding, clue missing feminist?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 19:21:10	@bmagnanti Oh dear are some people under the illusion there’s one approved type of feminism again? Tsk haven’t they got over that yet?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 07:55:02	@wilw Yeah Wil. How dare you have an opinion or use your brain. Now dance for me enterntainment monkey boy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 07:19:20	@guardianscience The argument has to be had to be won. True. But it HAS BEEN HAD AND WON. I need to shout that. People not getting ti.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 05:49:59	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton Speaking as a parent, the ability to shoot out sexcrement is not a qualification. It just means you fucked once.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 05:49:04	@jkd56083 You know it's not strictly true, right? I was trying to look cool on Twitter... WHAT HAVE I BECOME? Fry will never follow me now

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 05:45:51	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 In so many ways I agree. In so many other ways, I disagree. It's wrong, but in all the right ways.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 05:45:01	I dedicate the previous tweet (a retweet of the excellent @PamAyres ) to my wife, who has just found me on Twitter when I should be working

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 05:42:50	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 It's okay. I took a while to figure it out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 05:36:12	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton It's all an act
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 05:36:00	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton I've stopped believing all these "runs" from Jo. a) I reckon she loves it and b) I reckon she wants to be caught

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 03:28:03	@rbhu7 HOW CAN YOU HATE BEN COHEN!!!!?!!?!?!?!!? I don't watch Strictly, which is probably a bad thing, but the man is a very nice gent.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 03:24:11	@rbhu7 OI!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 02:07:03	@IamAustinHealey ?Do you get this kind of nonsense often Austin? Undeserved mate. You’re The Leicester Lip, banter is expected surely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 01:59:13	@ingdamnit Yeah you were nice to someone who was pretending to be decent and it’s you at fault {eye roll}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 01:58:05	@MoreThanChem No no. Don’t choose the WRONG two int students and undergrad as co-authors ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 01:49:54	@ImprobableJoe @ingdamnit @Doubting_Tom @The_Block_Bot @MRA_Hater yeah being decent to people, everyone’s bad, don’t do it again.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 01:46:47	@Xanthe_Cat Dammit! Not trying to be wise after the event, I was fooled after all, but I had an inkling. Damn, I’m just too trusting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 01:39:20	@Xanthe_Cat @MRA_Hater @ool0n MRA_Hater, you’re an infiltrator?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-06 01:35:57	@stfumisogynists {Hugs} I know how you feel! I know it doesn’t feel like it but it is temporary, if you can remember that you’re 90% there
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-05 22:57:04	Don’t worry Austin, I still think you’re a decent bloke. #btsportrugby
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-05 22:27:18	@nuttytartjen Hey, I’ve got lots of work to do… later ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-05 22:18:41	Skipped a weekend at the in-laws with feeble excuses to watch Tigers…oh crap the Mrs is on Twitter #btsportrugby #Tigerslive #Tigersfamily
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-05 22:15:48	@nuttytartjen @premrugby @BTSport @LeicesterTigers I may have. Cunningly skipped a weekend at the in-laws to stay home and watch the Derby.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-05 22:14:44	@LeicesterTigers COME ON TIGERS!!!!! #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-05 22:06:39	@martin_crowson They’re right. I wish they weren’t it they are. Still, come on Tigers!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 21:33:44	@suzanne_moore Oh I don't know. Miley Cyrus is mocking Sinead O'Connor for having mental health issues. So we could talk about that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 21:27:24	@pzmyers Beautifully timed abridgement of tweet, PZ.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 21:26:48	@stuxnetsource So watch out. I might demand cookies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 21:25:29	@stuxnetsource Because apparently, being a decent person and wanting equality of opportunity for all is not an option. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 21:25:00	@stuxnetsource Oh and I got told (hilariously) the other day that I (and others) are only nice to trans* people for cookies and pussy. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 21:21:54	@stuxnetsource YOU DON'T LOVE ME! Don't worry, I am calling my own Wahmbulance. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 18:57:54	@Jo_Caulfield Holy shit I'm Scottish!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 18:21:38	@bmagnanti You must have seen the cartoon about Breaking Bad in a country with healthcare. Spot on.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 18:20:20	@bmagnanti Oh hells yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 18:18:25	@bmagnanti Charming! Why is it that some people demonstrate their odiousness so much that opposing them is the obvious choice?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 18:17:13	@bmagnanti ... meet me in the Dog and Duck lounge bar at 9. Ask for Walter. ;-) [/humour]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 18:16:44	@bmagnanti I have nothing to offer except sympathy. [Humour] And the chemical knowledge to make life "interesting" for some people... 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 17:29:13	@WelfordTheTiger I taught him how to drink.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 16:12:57	@5WrightStuff @judeinlondon No. These are easy ones.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 16:11:47	@5WrightStuff @judeinlondon Since ooooh 1945?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 08:40:34	I like how my timeline changes when Americans are awake and active. Some of them must be getting home from work soonish.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 08:30:16	@mjrobbins Has Quentin Letts been a bit of a tosspot on QT? Shocker! I so admired the man before..oh what's the use. This guy is a known tit
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 05:21:19	@noodlemaz I can't chat, I'm not here. I'm attempting to do some work. No. Really. Please. Please help me work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 03:12:30	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP @splendisaurus And I HAVE to vanish, or else no work will be done! ;-) Keep me in if you want I'll BBL.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 03:11:48	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP @splendisaurus is actually harmful to that person. It's not up to me to tell them to harm self for my goal 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 03:11:21	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP @splendisaurus For example, take mental health, sometimes treating people who demonstrate bigotry to MH issues 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 03:10:41	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP @splendisaurus I'd LOVE for everyone to afford BoD btw, I just appreciate not everyone is in that position.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 03:10:16	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP @splendisaurus BOD is something affordable or not. Again it's not up to ME to tell anyone whether to afford BOD 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 03:09:17	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP @splendisaurus I'm about to use a naughty word. This is a reflection of relative privilege. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:36:05	@RespectSexWork But but everyone IS beneath me. Are you calling my mother a liar? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:30:34	@MrAtheistPants @splendisaurus @CarlieP And you, have a good day!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:30:21	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP True true, but you asked for it by being an atheist... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:29:55	@MrAtheistPants @splendisaurus Agreed. I'm a pluralist. I am happy to let a thousand flowers bloom when it comes to tactics.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:28:18	@splendisaurus @MrAtheistPants I mean in terms of identity, not humanity. All are human, and deserve some compassion on that basis alone.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:27:39	@splendisaurus @MrAtheistPants I am very VERY happy to be divided from bigots, creationists, astrologers, but most importanly homoepaths 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:26:33	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP Oh and I know you know, but "Bigot? Moi? OFFENDED!" is a classic attempt at get out of gaol free card. Tu quoque
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:25:27	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP I know what you mean though. I loathe the "sides" rhetoric though. Eyebrow raises! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:25:03	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP Sides? Not a team sport for me. Might be more fun if it were! It's been sad to see folks I admire(d) debase selves.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:22:25	@MrAtheistPants @splendisaurus Is that the technical term? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:22:02	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP Very, very sadly!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:21:49	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP Far fewer false positives occur than accurate diagnoses. And the big problem=bigotry, not false positives. #MYpoint
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:18:59	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP It presumes, at least, that someone's atheism is an important unifier, when often it isn't.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:18:19	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP Fair enough, but why is it BOD seems to crop up most in discussions about bigots within atheist movement?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:17:52	@MrAtheistPants @splendisaurus engagement with some people is a waste of my time. And yes, my time is better spent by and large 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:17:00	@MrAtheistPants @splendisaurus You're job is, in large part, communications though, right? That's not universally similar. At some point 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:13:05	@splendisaurus @MrAtheistPants I'd say you're within your rights to set fire to them. But a) it's Thurs (see tweets passim) and b) I'm mean
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:04:54	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP But as ever, 140 not enough for nuance. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:04:40	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP If anything, as a group/society we are TOO tolerant of "bad acts". Too much that needs critique slides. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-04 01:03:42	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP Not so sure about that. If someone does something obviously sexist (for ex) critique is more valuable than BOD.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 23:23:49	@ATipplingPhilo @SITP We're starting up an SitP in Maidenhead (waves to Sid and Tessa), so we'll be giving you a call I'm sure. DM me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 23:22:52	@NatureChemistry @AkshatRathi This has always been the case. Physics is just maths for sociable people. Chemistry is where it's at! [/Bias]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 23:22:05	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP commenters. "Allies" or not. Women decide this, not us. 3/3
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 23:21:35	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP that they should look for good intent etc/ E.g. women don't have to look for good intent in ostensibly sexist 2/3
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 23:20:47	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP I have one caveat though: It's not up to me (or you) to tell someone who is the direct recipient of a "bad act" 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 23:17:00	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP Shhhh don't tell everyone, you'll ruin my hard rep!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 23:16:20	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP Only on a good day! By Thursday my ability to tolerate my con-specifics needs refreshing in many beers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 23:15:22	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP Mind you, saying that, I tend to use a 3 strikes rule personally speaking. I'm only really harsh with homoeopaths!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 23:13:10	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP Oh agreed. But as the amount of communicable info goes up, so assumption of good intent behind bad acts goes down
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 23:09:57	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP In other media, I am afraid I differ. Intent/supposed "ally" status is not enough. Actions matter. Claims don't 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 23:09:21	@MrAtheistPants @CarlieP If you're limiting your comments to Twitter, Mr Silverman, I agree, intent/meaning is hard to parse in 140. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:42:20	@splendisaurus It's possible to HELP F. Maude's image? I suppose the only way is up, in some kind of drunkard's walk perhaps.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:38:50	@rbhu7 Oh....THEM. {sigh}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:38:31	@SexEdUKation Exactly. I screw up ALL the time, but am more than willing to a) be told so, and b) learn. It's not tough (or virtuous!) thing
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:37:42	@marcusbrig @noodlemaz but we get quieter/more ignored outrage from what is, arguably, a far more harmful social ill. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:36:45	@marcusbrig Excellent point by @noodlemaz Recent Mail activity has appalled many, but we get daily misogyny, xenophobia and homophbia 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:33:17	@noodlemaz But you and I are FAR too nice to entertain a nasty, cynical thought like that....right? Right? Oh. We're not. Good! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:31:45	@noodlemaz Or I suppose I could take the cynical route and say well now they are attacking a rich, white man... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:31:02	@noodlemaz None. This is small beer for the Mail. But it is a good excuse to get on its case again. And again. And again. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:30:22	@SexEdUKation You're not OVERsensitive. You're right Misuse and misunderstanding of mental health terms are rife and contributes to stigma.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:27:04	@Chemjobber THAT is terrifying!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:25:32	@CharlieFelix England HAVE to win. The alternative is happy S-Hemi or worse, happy Welsh. (I stress this is banter, I like the Welsh really)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:21:37	@splendisaurus That said, the Tories coming out condemning it are also odious shits, so I can't exactly preclude any possibilities.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:20:40	@splendisaurus Very possible. I've seen too many articles proclaiming damage to the Mail based on some sense of British "fair play" I guess.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:19:41	@CharlieFelix @martin_crowson I hope so. I hope it's not "massively denuded by injuries".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:17:28	@bmagnanti Have you seen the first comment on the article? A man who values smart women who brew beer. It nearly brought a tear to my eye!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:15:59	@splendisaurus The Tories condeming the Mail are not kidding themselves that the Mail has been harmed?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:12:53	@rbhu7 WHAT!? Point me in their general direction!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:11:09	@markthomasinfo Can we get Piers Morgan in there too?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:08:47	its audience of people dedicated to shallow "reasoning" and comfortable bigotry Don't kid yourself. You might be "decent" the Mail isn't 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 21:07:11	No senior Tories, the Daily Mail has not damaged itself with the Miliband slurs. This is its stock in trade and exactly what plays with 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 20:46:55	@RichardWiseman @tessakendall I make no comment on the Prof's portfolio of poetry, but I've definitely seen worse.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 19:01:08	@danaequality YOU FUCKING WHAT? She did WHAT?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 08:24:35	@dELYSEious Look, we can't have women wandering about like uncovered meat...oops...property...oops, erm, I'll get back to you. {eyeroll}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 03:56:51	@Sectioned_ Or " Forced Lobotomy". Or "Let in Victorian toffs to laugh at the mentals" Ooops cynicism...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 03:39:51	@Sectioned_ There's a historical link, fine, but personally, whatever agreement, I'd go another way. We have many options.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 02:25:03	@PeterAttenborou @talkoftigers Summa Cum LOUD!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 02:24:08	@GeorgeMonbiot Well the Mail is a bit lower class, and thus despised by some senior (posher) Tories. Useful Idiots perhaps?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 02:20:28	@MitchBenn Reality has always been the bane of the satirist. Occasionally it throws up something that melts the irony meters.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 02:19:24	@PeterAttenborou @talkoftigers Haha. Indeed. Probably taken a course. I suspect he doesn’t need to though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 02:13:37	@culturevultures http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statler_a nd_Waldorf … Statler and Waldorf
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 02:12:16	@PeterAttenborou @talkoftigers Never leave a player unbollocked! I agree this is an excellent policy. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 02:01:52	@PlioceneBloke @garwboy No use Daily Mail for toilet roll, nasty words wipe off on anus. Make anus right wing. No one like right wing anus
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 01:57:41	@PeterAttenborou @talkoftigers I’ve never thought of Cockers as someone daft or soft enough to recruit total wrong ‘uns. ;-) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 01:57:03	@PeterAttenborou @talkoftigers He’ll be out the door sharpish if that’s the case. TBH if he was total wrong ‘un he’d never have got in. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 01:48:06	@talkoftigers @PeterAttenborou Granted, not uncritical support… ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 01:44:50	@Sectioned_ After all, they can hardly claim THAT name/term exists in a vacuum now can they?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 01:44:22	@Sectioned_ I think it’s the usual sensationalist stigmatising bullshit we can expect from the media on average when dealing with MH issues.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 01:41:56	@PeterAttenborou @talkoftigers After all, I’m of the mindset that when a player is a Tiger, you back them until they’re not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 01:41:27	@PeterAttenborou @talkoftigers Talented but troubled players. I really doubt they would find a home at Tigers. I’m willing to give Lamb time
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 00:32:45	@Jo_Caulfield I can only approve!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 00:10:22	@bmagnanti @vanbadham Sensible about porn? IT MUST NOT BE ALLOWED! (Goes off to read)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 00:09:47	@talkoftigers Haha! Now THAT is a mental image. I've got Cockers snapping on a latex glove in my head. And that's the best of the images...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 00:06:35	@campbellclaret REALLY!? Why is it that conservatives of many points on the spectrum are incapable of understanding irony?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-03 00:05:35	@talkoftigers If Cockers said "I'm disappointed in him and I'll deal with that internally." of me, I'd be remarkably scared. Hairdryer time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:59:18	@bmagnanti From the available data I have no idea how they can win anything (admittedly I am ignorant of law). Whole thing clearly nuisance
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:57:09	@niallpb Ahhh this! Thanks a lot. (Relevant to my interests! ;-) )
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:55:07	@bmagnanti {facepalm} Lovely! Ever get the feeling you're being messed about?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:51:13	@niallpb I've missed this, dare I ask to what it refers?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:44:44	@bmagnanti Dare I ask how's it going? Dare I guess "painful, slow, frustrating and possibly humiliating" is the answer?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:39:24	@notquitedandy @stephenfry It's almost a cliche that they do fuck up in science fields! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:33:52	@notquitedandy @benjamincohen @stephenfry Looks like Peace *IS* different (or this is a pub. stunt). I'm just going off the science stuff!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:30:49	@notquitedandy @benjamincohen @stephenfry Here you go, secret for 50 years: http://www. nobelprize.org/nomination/nom ination_faq.html … (I'm checking to see if Peace is diff.)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:27:56	@notquitedandy @benjamincohen @stephenfry ...know if they were nominated for decades after the nomination.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:27:32	@notquitedandy @benjamincohen @stephenfry Sorry if not clear, I mean that the nomination is secret. I.e. unless someone wins we don't 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:24:25	@stephenfry @benjamincohen I am not sure it is the same for the Peace Prize, but aren't nominees secret for a matter of decades at least?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:18:38	@stuxnetsource @PGPBOARD @LouiseMensch @gerge42 In simple terms: bigot is as bigot does, not as bigot claims to "intend"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:18:09	@PGPBOARD @stuxnetsource @LouiseMensch @gerge42 No hostile intent? Sodomites? Would you say "no hostile intent" and use the word "nigger"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 23:15:54	@ProfBrianCox Not just in academia either. When I worked at Pfizer Sandwich it was well known to be best site per research $ in company.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 22:52:30	@BjarteSF But in all seriousness, yes you're right.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 22:49:19	@BjarteSF No No No. Climate Change is like the soul. It only affects things if you believe in it and thus it's okay to argue about it. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 22:39:48	@rbhu7 Neither could I. Googled it. (Actually, got it right first time, but googled to check! ;-) )
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 22:39:20	I am in a mood. Unthinking conservatives, bigots and sundry muppets will suffer my sarcasm if I am pushed. Doing this for fun is unadvisable
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 22:37:17	@IDS_MP Well we know this. The political differences between the two are minimal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 22:36:14	@rbhu7 Goebbels surely! After all, the Daily Fail is the mouthpiece for the more odious conservative forces.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 22:35:09	@Jo_Caulfield Capt Observant here noticed you have an album out on iTunes. Bought it. I hope the tiny fraction of it you get goes on booze
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 19:14:13	@Jo_Caulfield Which I should point out is a good thing. {cough}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 19:13:59	@Jo_Caulfield Well one never knows with you big star types off the telly. It's all limos, champagne and cocaine with you lot, allegedly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 19:10:56	@Jo_Caulfield Wait, so we can come to your shows and get drunk with you after? This sounds like a good idea!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 19:10:15	@marcusbrig Oh oh! I know! Playing to common prejudice, pandering to xenophobic ignorance, and lying. What do I win?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 19:06:42	@judeinlondon To be fair I never actually switched on, I was just hoping to see the vid! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 18:55:28	@judeinlondon I switched off!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 18:55:07	@marcusbrig You looked into his eyes didn’t you? There’s nowt genuine about this politician or many others. Occasional exceptions aside
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 18:51:40	@stfumisogynists LDRs **SUCK**! Did one across the Atlantic, it only worked by defrauding AT&T the cost of so e seriously pervy phone calls.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 18:48:39	@EPSRC You’ve been on Twitter too long when you read that as “attention pornography enthusiasts” and thought “Crikey, they’re branching out”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 18:47:09	@stfumisogynists If there’s free weed…I could become less stressed about it. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 18:45:29	@judeinlondon interstitial = intestinal Autocorrect is not anatomically aware.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 18:44:38	@judeinlondon Apologies if that caused interstitial discomfort. I am not in a Tory friendly mood today. I’m feeling a little militant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 18:43:37	@judeinlondon Or even listening to a rabid dog gargling bleach out of a dead rabbit’s anus. I’m feeling graphic this morning.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 17:41:17	@SarahMillican75 You're always getting your flower out on here. I approve. It's a lovely healthy pink colour. Is it a rose?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 17:38:45	@frockdoctrineuk But but they create job...err...wealth...err something. Maybe. Apparently. Look just pay the rent okay!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 17:37:59	@robinince Yes. You're welcome. (It's been done a few times since the 70s btw. This isn't new bullying. It's old school)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 16:55:16	@stfumisogynists But it's never too early to be rude to them! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 16:51:47	@TintinnyTins @stfumisogynists @judeinlondon I said cults....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 16:10:09	@stfumisogynists @judeinlondon @tintinnytins Aren't we beyond cults of personality yet? Or is repeating the mistakes of the past de rigueur?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 16:03:06	@caitlinmoran Don't encourage them! Do we really need to add misogyny to antisemitism, ad hominem and lies? The Mail is already bad enough.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:54:07	@Pablito999 @campbellclaret @BBCNewsnight But also SACRED. ZOMG! It’s a religious conspiracy. I bet that Carey chap is involved.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:38:02	@NivenJ1 Brilliant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:37:01	@Ian_Murphy Nope, sounds like the most fun coup d’état ever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:35:56	@IslaBoag @ZaraBain I’m hopelessly positive. After all we as a species invented beer. Nothing can be all bad with beer.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:24:35	@stfumisogynists oooh nice sparkles!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:22:50	@stfumisogynists I thought you were doing Dadaist poetry. Was I wrong?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:21:51	@bats87 I agree with the quote.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:21:17	@IslaBoag @ZaraBain oh I dunno, I’m sure some of them are nice. Lord Avebury redeems the species a bit in my book. But otherwise…yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:15:14	@bats87 I am not John Stuart Mill. That was a quote.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:14:15	@LifeOfARugger Please may I draw sir’s attention to Jordan Crane’s excellent kick in Leicester Tigers vs Cardiff Blues in the Heineken Cup
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:12:34	@ZaraBain @IslaBoag I’d vote for ‘em
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:11:47	My last tweet is for you Daily Mail. You dumb bunch of odious, disingenuous, ordure gobbling drivellers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 06:10:37	I never meant to say that the Conservatives are generally stupid. I meant to say that stupid people are generally Conservative. JS Mill
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 05:56:36	@OwenJones84 You and I fervently wish. Tragically the fear and ignorance of millions of people will sustain him.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 05:52:38	@indiaknight it’s the UK equivalent of the Usa’s “liberal intellectuals” and sundry dog whistles
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 05:49:23	@culturevultures All publicity is good publicity… …I just threw up in my mouth a bit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 05:48:01	@stfumisogynists They’re in the post. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 05:47:42	@stfumisogynists I am no way near informed or brave enough to comment on your sexual favours, but drugs for cat gifts is a fair trade.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 03:47:55	@BipolarBlogger The best is when you keep the laugh going for just that bit too long. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 03:46:57	@BipolarBlogger @stfumisogynists F.I.N.E. = fucked up, insecure, neurotic, emotional. So it could work….on the right day. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 03:45:21	@stfumisogynists My fave is for anyone who uses weight as an insult: “Fat? NoOo! I’m allergic to fuckwits. I’ve swollen up for some reason.”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 03:41:40	@stfumisogynists I’m always tempted to answer “mad as a bastard, thanks, and you?”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-02 03:40:05	Isn’t it amazing that one weekend with familial energy vampires just put paid to the start of what could be an amazing week? #mardarse
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 21:11:18	@Sectioned_ I need to be more shameless. Your shamelessness is an inspiration! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 20:45:35	@daraobriain Try the women chemists at Edinburgh Uni. Particularly Polly Arnold. All good, but she's amazing IMO as a chemist. More chem!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 18:50:27	@AllyFogg Oh I don’t know, the beer is good. And much of the coastline is gorgeous. I’ve done quite well combining the two.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 18:44:55	@michaellegge Ween? You have made me obscenely happy. I thought I was the only one who likes them!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 18:44:12	@GameOfThrones WHOA! When’s it screening in the UK?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 18:41:01	@Giliell Yeah women. We know it’s shit, but can you stop going on about it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 18:33:18	@gogreen18 Been there, got the T shirt. You have my sympathies!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 09:27:28	@NickDoody Ah of course. How could I have forgotten. I saw them live once. Supporting Dexter’s Crap Finale at the Odeon in ‘87.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 09:25:36	@NickDoody Me too. And Sex Banana? What was all that about?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 09:24:59	Just seen the Breaking Bad finale. And it was good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 07:51:09	@frankieboyle @SarahKSilverman Possibly the best one ever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 07:47:27	@campbellclaret Oh come now! Dare could never have risen to Obergruppenfuhrer! Tsk, such exaggeration! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 07:26:05	@drugmonkeyblog True. But they tutted disapprovingly, which is what matters. Look I’m trying to think of good things here. It’s not easy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 07:24:27	@drugmonkeyblog Weren’t they a bit anti-Nazi. Occasionally. Sort of?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-10-01 07:23:31	I’ve seen some utter toilets in my time, but the Daily Mail really takes the biscuit. It’s rare thing when I run out of words for my disgust

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-30 22:53:45	@PluckyChicken @docfreeride LOL!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-30 22:52:49	@femmissgeek Luckily, as a baby eating atheist I also kick puppies and drown kittens so those bits of the internet are off limits to me! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-30 22:49:03	@femmissgeek I'm waiting for the iTunes release tomorrow. I am looking at very small parts of the internet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-30 22:27:17	@MRA_Hater You came out as a fan of the Block Bot? Yes, I can see how that is shocking for some. #MajorMisunderstanding . ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-30 21:08:35	@CCriadoPerez Hope you had a nice break. Taking it slow is the right thing to do. Very happy to see you back. The world needs more you!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-30 20:20:27	@indiaknight I'll see it tomorrow. I subscribed via iTunes (fool that I am). I am avoiding spoliers like the plague.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-30 20:19:26	@jearle I'm taking that as a good thing. Muggins here subscribed via iTunes. I'll see it tomorrow!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-30 20:18:50	@pervocracy @jailawrites You're much nicer than me. I think they should spend ten minutes inside a volcano.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-30 20:17:55	@jearle Good? It HAS to be better than the Dexter finale. Please tell me it's better than the Dexter finale. Please. Please.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-30 18:43:53	@lapsangsusie @zoesqwilliams I share this naivety. I can but hope. Personally I favour ridicule. Go on stage, poke her softly with stick?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-30 18:42:26	I am avoiding all mentions of Breaking Bad until tomorrow. The Dexter finale was terrible. Hoping this is decent.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 21:02:44	@K07A07S82 The words of the poet Larkin never rang truer.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 20:47:54	@K07A07S82 Exactly, it's a process that is, IMO, deliberately harmful to vulnerable people

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 08:09:08	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton Would that make Jo laugh, or….
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 08:06:14	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 Tsk. It’s all sex sex sex with you people.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:57:10	@CarlieP KILL EVERYTHING WITH FIRE!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:56:33	@mistressmatisse Fucking busty alien babes? Who with the what now. Details. I crave set details!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:54:03	@robinince OMG It has posted this twice now with very slightly different degrees of spelling… Sinister.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:53:00	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 It seems to be my mission to terrify you tonight. Apologies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:52:22	@LifeOfARugger No it is fucking not! #ThingsISayInResponseToThatALot ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:51:16	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton Dive on in. Story of mine. #TMIThursday
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:50:28	@rebeccawatson @MattLech Oh Rebecca are you using words to describe things again? Because that’s like so much worse than the thing itself.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:49:36	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! Oh, wait, crap, the Mrs is on Twitter. Erm. Who are you strange lady who I don’t know at all?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:48:28	@IslaBoag 1) Happy Birthday (sorry I’m a bit late) 2) there never be enough 18th century lesbian feminist communes. Or chocolate. Hurrah!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:46:15	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 Well everyone knows oral sex goes up to eleven.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:44:39	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 Ahhhh wouldn’t you like to know. Actually I was going for comedy rant countdown because I was doing comedy sexism
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:42:51	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 I knew you would be? Oral sex is terrifying stuff for noble ladies of delicate sensibilities.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:42:16	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton Well you see Jo is like a delicate flower, as indeed are all women, and they can be frightened by the oral sex 3 2 1
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:39:46	@zeno001 @HealthCanada Yes…yes…that was it. {self aggrandising cough for cover}. Although I have read that story before. Oh Canada…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:37:51	@mistressmatisse I have one requirement on my dating list: I won’t date anyone with a dating list.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:36:48	@robinince The phone is evil and must be punished.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:36:05	@zeno001 I read that Canada and Fake Illnesses. I need more sleep.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:35:22	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 Very much agreed. Knobheadery is universal. It can be done by anyone.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:34:40	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton Well I am too, and therefore love it, but I was trying to be all proper so as not to scare Jo and you ruined it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:33:10	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton We’ve all been knobheads. The trick is to stop. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:32:34	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 WHAT!? I’d be positively underdressed. Only my valet sees me in such a state.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:32:05	@Jo_Caulfield @Stevecathutch Mucky cards are excellent. Bridge takes on a whole new meaning when one of the suits is “Happy Ladies”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:30:34	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 I mean. The oral sex? On a lady? And me, British? The very idea. {adjusts monocle}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:29:02	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 Nooooooo! It were an joke!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:28:41	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 Oh so many reasons. Oh so much dumb. See comments about rugby, drunk and 18. I grew out of it. Well the 18 part.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:28:02	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton Oh that can be FUN. I prefer to chat up the husband. Then offer threesome. Much more amusing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:27:19	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 …been making up for that ever since with good cooking and fab nights out. And the oral sex. Always the oral sex
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:26:35	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 …instant coffee in an attempt to sober self up. Date had to be foreshortened due to me feeling sick as parrot…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:25:59	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 The first date was an awesome fuck up on my part too. I came back from rugby drunk again (see a theme?) and ate…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:24:06	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 I was 18. Knobbery is permitted when you’rethat young
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:23:42	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 …really long legs. I then realised I’d been a dick and scurried off. Spent the next week apologising charmingly-ish
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:22:55	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 Staggered up to her whilst she was on the phone having come back from rugby drunk as a beast and told her she had…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:21:47	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 …slightly drunk the first time we met and made an utter arse of myself.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:21:09	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 I confess it took her a week or so to succumb to my charms and fall in love with me. I may have been accidentally…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:19:59	@Jo_Caulfield @jojosutherland Ah I see you are playing the eight of cocks onto a five of nice abs. Clever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:18:42	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 Guilty as charged. Although it was a surprise. I’d been following the “callous shagger” mode until that point mostly
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 07:16:18	@rbhu7 Instantly. I saw my wife across a sunny university courtyard 20 years ago. I saw her laugh, her hair move in the wind, I was smitten.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 06:57:27	@indiaknight UNPOSSIBLE! I was not invited… Oh. OH! Well that’s just mean! {sobs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 06:49:27	@tkingdoll @lecanardnoir It depends on the type of research. Participatory…perhaps no. Anthropological with Attenborough VoiceOver. WINNING!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 06:45:40	@tkingdoll @lecanardnoir Whoa whoa whoa. Actual sceptic orgies exist? This I need to see. For….erm….purely research purposes, obviously!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 06:43:11	@john_s_wilkins I was really happy about his McArthur grant. Nice to see org chem get recognition. (Yes, I am biased)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 06:42:12	@lecanardnoir More fun than SitP. If it exists I don’t want to know of such wanton debauchery. Bad experience or humour?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-26 06:31:47	@notahappyhooker @stavvers I come onto Twitter and you lot are doing filth again. Shocking. Terrible. Horrendous. Can I join in?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 22:50:19	@dcorsetto Moving car?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 22:47:39	@bmagnanti Unless whoever modelled for that is very poorly hung, that's one hell of a rock. [Notices the important things]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 22:42:53	@WstonesOxfordSt @MitchBenn Dammit I'm buying as many as I can! (Including Mr Benn's book)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 22:40:26	@rbhu7 @lamborghini I can see that! Lambos do fill a 7 year old boy's technology void in me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 22:37:34	@rbhu7 @lamborghini What do they have on it? People making VROOOOM noises? Because every time I see a Lambo, that's what I do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 07:15:28	@VirtualAstro Sorry about that. Brussels sprout curry for tea, still, beautiful stars, eh guv'nor?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 07:14:00	@paulfoot Cunning. Put them off the scent, Master.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 07:09:00	@marcusbrig Don't worry, I’ve always found you one of the world’s most hilarious people. Even though I am sure the pac-man joke is mine. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 04:52:31	@Sectioned_ I’m not touching that question with a barge pole. My imagination is far too dirty to answer legally!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 04:39:47	@Sectioned_ Aaaaaah! THAT kind of Splashback. Tell the filthy animal to control the stream, and clean up after himself. Possibly slap him.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 04:36:36	@Sectioned_ Splashback smells?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 04:35:57	@SpokesGay @_Ex_Astris_ @WowbaggerOM @MRA_Hater @Doubting_Tom @jailawrites Just remember Jaila’s an asexual chair and I am of Teh Ghey.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 02:58:27	@whorephobia You get some fool to pay me, I'll join up! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 02:58:07	@SpokesGay @ingdamnit @MRA_Hater @_Ex_Astris_ @WowbaggerOM @Doubting_Tom @jailawrites OPPRESSOR!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-25 02:48:49	@MRA_Hater @SpokesGay @_Ex_Astris_ @WowbaggerOM @Doubting_Tom @jailawrites Pfff I just saved 300 million by not doing what I wanted to.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 22:46:14	OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE TUILAGI IS INJURED!!!! I am less than amused.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 22:44:19	@bmagnanti Pepys could spell and write grammatically. Mr Morris, not so much.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 22:36:18	@pwsw4 I HAS ENVY!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 22:06:06	@BoyGeorge I am hoping more of my childhood 1970s icons have kept it in their pants frankly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 22:05:06	@notquitedandy Ahhhhh. Good. I am not a Crackberry fan! My wife swears by, and mostly at, hers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 22:04:30	@notquitedandy I've heard tales of Androids breaking a lot.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 22:04:12	@BipolarBlogger I confess mine's not a toy either. I have a lot of apps I use for work. There are really good chemistry/science apps for it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 22:03:09	@notquitedandy Ah now that is a feeling I know. Are you reverse engineering them? Managing them for a company? What do you do with them?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 21:59:04	@notquitedandy You have a stack of iphones? I think I just did a sex wee in my pants.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 21:57:49	@jailawrites @SpokesGay @_Ex_Astris_ @WowbaggerOM @MRA_Hater @Doubting_Tom Yeah you total chair! (WTF was THAT about? letter substitution?)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 21:57:16	@BipolarBlogger We're bad people Charlotte. We love the toys! THE TOYS! THE SHINY SHINY TOYS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 21:56:44	Q: How do you know your friend has an iPhone? A: He tells you. You may now all slap me for the daft tech obsessed knobhead that I am.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 21:56:00	I am a geeky nerdy weak arsed hypocrite of a man. But I am a geek nerdy weak arsed hypocrite of a man with an iPhone 5s. My precioussssss.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 21:49:41	@SpokesGay @_Ex_Astris_ @WowbaggerOM @MRA_Hater @Doubting_Tom @jailawrites Me too, but it was 3:30 when I decided to biff off.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 16:16:04	@RevRichardColes This is the minimum I expect from a clergyman. More weird please!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 10:35:09	@johannahamilton Dunno, I have to be up in 3 hrs. Shall we both promise to go to bed?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 10:23:58	@LouisRedux Apparently I am Gollum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 10:23:22	@WowbaggerOM @_Ex_Astris_ @SpokesGay This William chap is the boundless muppet that keeps on giving. Bored yet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 10:21:23	Hot damn that was a good episode of Breaking Bad. I cannot wait for next weeks's finale.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 09:15:14	@InManibusDei @ingdamnit @MRA_Hater @Doubting_Tom Well fun as this has been, Breaking Bad has downloaded, so I’m off to watch that. Toodles.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 09:13:24	@MRA_Hater @InManibusDei @ingdamnit @Doubting_Tom At least. Probably some armed bears in there too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 09:08:49	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 I am enjoying low quality nutterage. It’s an indulgence, but remarkably low calorie.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 09:08:11	@InManibusDei @MRA_Hater @ingdamnit @Doubting_Tom Oh no, I only abort white, straight, men. I have a special detector.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 09:07:36	@jailawrites @InManibusDei @ingdamnit @MRA_Hater @Doubting_Tom I know. I saw one once.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 09:07:02	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton I’ve discovered the joy of illiterate American pro lifer. I’m not getting much sleep.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 08:59:54	@amandapalmer @MrRobertMcGrath How about: world learn to deal with people’s sexual self expression sympathetically even if it’s a bit naive?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 08:58:15	@InManibusDei @ingdamnit @Doubting_Tom @jailawrites @SpokesGay @vexorian0 I severely doubt it. I’m not his type.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 08:57:40	@jailawrites @InManibusDei I’m wondering can we get trans phobia, ableism and classism out of him within 3 minutes?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 08:56:50	@LouisRedux @jailawrites @InManibusDei I checked, yes he has! So we have homophobia, racism and misogyny. That’s not bad for a first attempt
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 08:54:23	@jailawrites @InManibusDei Shhhhh he’s on a roll. Don’tinterrupt him with facts. He’s going for the full bigot card. Has he done racism yet?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 08:49:06	I am downloading the new Breaking bad episode via iTunes on this thingy. Now I am not saying iOS 7 fucked everything up. But it did. A lot.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 04:42:58	@sousan50 Happens to the best of us. I've done a few howlers today!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 04:40:20	@sousan50 Shhhh everyone will want one! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 04:29:54	I did done a blog about today's Consensus FAQ-up muppetry: http:// poaj.net/oh-for-fu/ I so proud.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 04:24:51	@BipolarBlogger Yeah, recognising the potential high is a good sign (as is the sleep etc)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 04:19:43	@BipolarBlogger Phew! That's the strong stuff too! (Professional comment! ;-) ) As long as you have a plan, all will be good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 04:17:00	@BipolarBlogger Yeah. If I had THAT MUCH going on, I'd be worrying a few people. Me included. Obviously your mileage may vary.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 04:14:39	@BipolarBlogger Yowch, that's a lot! The argumentative + everyone else is too slow are two of my big ones too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 03:55:13	@BipolarBlogger {Hugs} if you want them. I hope this phase passes and you feel more secure again.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 03:47:01	@noodlemaz @xojisokx Muller Corner did girl vs boy yoghurt recently. Who are the marketing panels? The people who organise Consensus?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 03:14:16	@Sectioned_ Yup. And the corollary with other people is there is a fine line between helpful concern and gaslighting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 03:06:15	Now THIS is funny: http:// skepchick.org/2013/09/entang led-bank-provides-more-evidence-men-not-funny/ … See? This is how it is done.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 02:59:03	@nagarvadhu @notahappyhooker Yikes. Steel underpants at the #banfreebies conference then!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 02:58:30	@nagarvadhu @ksej @notahappyhooker I have a series of documentary videos that suggest this is wrong. I'm holding them for a friend. Honest
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 02:52:23	@mjrobbins BBC "balance" = turning away from a genuine expert to a frothing bullshit vomiter. It's not about data, it's about shouting loud
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 01:41:55	@LorraineJohnson @RevRichardColes 'Twas my second choice! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 01:23:58	@chrisofarabia @bmagnanti I'm on Laphroaig which is an Islay if memory serves. Will it do?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 01:12:50	@chrisofarabia @bmagnanti Maybe if I used homoeopathic whisky! {ducks and runs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 01:12:25	@chrisofarabia @bmagnanti I'm pouring it down my USB port, but it doesn't seem to have helped Dr Magnanti. I assume whisky makes hate worse
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 01:09:41	@chrisofarabia @bmagnanti Large whiskies all round.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 01:09:04	@RevRichardColes I'm unwell. I was struggling to read the first hashtag as "cunning as serpents". I just though you'd mis-spelt "repents"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 01:07:32	Updated blog post about Consensus organisers' unfortunate FAQ-up, taking into account apology: http://www. poaj.net/oh-for-fu/
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 01:06:31	@bmagnanti Whisky?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 00:13:04	@Minxy_Lydia @notahappyhooker Guilty as charged, ma'am.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 00:06:14	@RichardWiseman As apologies go, not terrible, and I know we evil feminists are never satisfied, but it was a terrible joke. I should know!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 00:04:57	@RichardWiseman Cool! Maybe I'll get to spend the cash after all... ...because that's the important bit. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-24 00:01:47	@tkingdoll @garwboy I done a blog about today's Consensus muppetry: http://www. poaj.net/oh-for-fu/
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 23:59:10	@notahappyhooker @AllyFogg I'd start paying for it but my wife is an ardent freebieist. She won't come quietly. What I meant was...oh balls
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 23:57:33	@AllyFogg HAHA! I have no idea if that hashtag is safe for this level of piss taking. We might tread on the odd toe! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 23:56:55	@ksej @nagarvadhu @notahappyhooker Hmmmm. Tricky. After all, you could both be billed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 23:55:36	@AllyFogg I feel your pain, brother. I've been known to take advantage of freebies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 23:54:51	@nagarvadhu @notahappyhooker Are you saying that men can't be freebieists? MISANDRY!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 23:54:21	@notahappyhooker I think this ban freebies thing could go full circle. When do we get to "reclaim freebies"? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 23:51:02	A post on today's Twitter discussion of the Consensus event's FAQ-up. http://www. poaj.net/oh-for-fu/
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 23:49:35	@notahappyhooker Before I met my wife, I gave freebies to a few ladies. Am I some sort of serial freebieist? #banfreebies
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 23:24:01	@garwboy @soozaphone @jonmbutterworth @Sim0nRedfern @robinince Name dropping is perfectly fine according to my friend Stephen Fry. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 23:04:19	@robinince @soozaphone Newsflash: Robin Ince says agreeing with feminists massive waste of time. More lies at 11.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:50:17	@tkingdoll Thanks! Sausage fingers + autocorrect = lots of propitiation of the Great Gdo Typo.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:41:15	@robotincognito @eithne_crow Oh come now, Wilders is vastly more reasonable... ...I can't believe I just used those words.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:39:37	@higgyC It's amazing how unpleasant the sexism wars in the sceptic/atheist community have got. Not from feminists so much, from the knobends
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:36:22	@jonmbutterworth Yup, a bit gutted tbh. Still, there are a lot of other events around (not quite as glam and glorious perhaps).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:33:43	@cisnotdirty I DID NOT THINK THE SAME THING!!!!! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:32:33	@jonmbutterworth I've emailed to let them know I'm keeping my ~£700 for two premium seats and dinner. Need to find new b'day pressie!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:31:43	@cisnotdirty Well, we can't necessarily hope the Dawk feels that way... Sadly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:31:12	@higgyC What guts me is we (wife + I) have been looking foward to it. It's a few days after my b'day and has some of my favourite speakers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:29:49	@cisnotdirty I did. Two seconds too late.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:29:28	@higgyC The blasted thing does not do French unless I tell it. It does do bloody irony though doesn't it. The cheeky swine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:27:16	@cisnotdirty @BillBailey @RichardWiseman Shit! If you're cc-ing me to the rich and famous mention the spelling error was due to autocorrect!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:24:39	And before anyone else tells me, I know I "de riguer" is not spelled "de rigour", autocorrect got me as I submitted. THAT is irony!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:23:47	@higgyC Oh you're right, and don't I know it. Autocorrect got me just as I submitted... IRONY!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:23:08	@noodlemaz @garwboy And they're so flighty too. They want to speak, then don't want to share a stage when we call them bitches. Tchoh!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:18:20	@garwboy @tkingdoll Note the completely deliberate spelling error that did not happen by accidental autocorrect...that is right out
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:16:52	@garwboy @tkingdoll Well, speakign as a scientist: https:// twitter.com/LouisRedux/sta tus/382131012786212864 …

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 21:03:00	@tkingdoll Consider it? I'm doing it as we speak. I've been saving for this too, wanted to do the Linnean Dinner thing etc. Birthday treat
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 20:59:06	@tkingdoll Just scoured your tweets to find what event you're talking about. Gutted, I was going to go. No way will my cash support bigots
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 20:37:22	@mjrobbins @richardwiseman @soozaphone @tkingdoll Holy crapola Batman. Where's that drivel from?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 18:39:21	@jailawrites I know! I have being oppressing women by not paying for sex. This supports the MRAs, PUAs etc who see women as sex objects.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 18:25:55	I am so ashamed. My wife and I have been having unpaid for sex with each other for 20 years. We even have a kid. We’re monsters #banfreebies
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 18:05:19	@AskMissAlice @notahappyhooker After all, it’s called a blow JOB. Kind of a hint.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 18:04:53	@AskMissAlice @notahappyhooker Indeed. The scales have fallen from my eyes. How could I have gone through life thinking sex was not work?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 18:02:59	@AskMissAlice @notahappyhooker and of course my wanton lusts too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 18:02:46	@AskMissAlice @notahappyhooker implications of my wanton lists. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 18:02:24	@AskMissAlice @notahappyhooker I'll never look at a woman again and think about unpaid sex. I promise to only think about the financial 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:52:19	@notahappyhooker I am very ashamed, but determined never to do it again. With help and time I’ll break this cursed addiction to free sex.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:51:09	@Greg_Callus Let me guess, Labour being hawkish to appeal to those who favour a lurch rightwards?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:47:20	@stephenfry Careful Mr Fry. If you attend some Torygraph journo will accuse you of not making your own cakes. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:46:17	@notahappyhooker I am ashamed how much I have contributed to the oppression of women by having freebies. It’s been at least twice. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:44:00	@notahappyhooker Oh fuck! I’ve just imagined Eric Pickles and Michael Gove as the ministers responsible for testing. Argh! Brain bleach!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:42:42	@notahappyhooker Imagine the test! Govt trained shag inspectors. “”Your missionary was fine, but you were suspect under reverse cowgirl”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:40:51	@notahappyhooker But but but…. {opens wallet} {weeps}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:40:06	@notahappyhooker “”I’m at least a band 4!” “”Mate you snuck into 3, your government approved shag will be along in a minute, now shush”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:27:02	@DumpyStig @Sectioned_ @niallpb That’s a great picture. Enviable talent on your part!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:26:19	@Rubywax I hope this is a short “visit” from the black dog and you are back to safe mood soon. Thanks for all you do for us all, best wishes
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:22:43	@campbellclaret Awww. I had visions of you being escorted across the globe due to your national value! Ugly fact slays beautiful idea again!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:18:26	@notahappyhooker NOOOOOOO! My blow jobs!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:17:35	@notahappyhooker Mind you, banding freebies would be awesome. “”I’m sorry you’re only a band 3, please join the other queue”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:16:46	@notahappyhooker And that would be ban. Damn these sausage fingers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:16:27	@notahappyhooker Please don’t band freebies! They’re all I get! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:15:54	@campbellclaret Do you have MI5 security for life? If so, isn’t that a bit terrifying, or are you used to such things after being in govt?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:14:09	@stuxnetsource Oh come now, we must have SOME bigotry or else nice things will happen… {sigh} Even sarcasm isn’t helping this morning.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 17:06:08	@Sectioned_ I’ll try, but I’m really well dressed today, happy, and incapable of finding a silhouette of myself looking downtrodden @niallpb
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 16:58:27	@Sectioned_ @niallpb I went to work once. Clearly I’m faking this bipolar disorder thing for fun and attention. ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 07:34:50	@suzanne_moore You too huh?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 07:23:41	@mapledaroni Reasonable. I blame women, Jews, Space Lizards, the Illuminati, men, Nd mostly my old mum.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 07:22:09	@mapledaroni Ah arseholes. Too many in the world, and they keep increasing. I blame Malthus.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 07:20:57	@whorephobia I’ve been utterly disgusted with the anti SW rhetoric and actions of #NWC2013 . No reason, no excuses can cover their bullshit
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 07:18:30	@mapledaroni Of course I say this as a smart person. {polishes trophies, buffs medals, realises he is a total doofus!}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 07:15:45	@mapledaroni Yeeesh. Just goes to show, “smart people” can be dumb as old shit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 07:15:03	Okay. It’s 12:13 am, I’ve had a few beers, done manly DIY, had a post DIY shower and am now horny as all hell. This is unfair! I blame you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-23 07:12:22	@mapledaroni they can get it. It’s not a matter of ability, it’s matter of desire. Challenging your own preconceptions and privilege = hard
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-22 07:58:12	@notquitedandy @mapledaroni The other one is men get to be traumatised by damage done to THEIR women? Urgh Urgh.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-22 07:56:24	@mapledaroni @notquitedandy BTW if you are following me, I just tweeted one example of feminist parody of blurred lines.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-22 07:50:00	@mapledaroni @notquitedandy EVERYWHERE! There is not virtue in not seeing the original, I haven’t even able to find it in amongst takedowns
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-22 07:48:15	@mapledaroni @notquitedandy I maintain my pride that I have only seen feminist mockery of the vid, not the actual thing.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-22 07:43:17	@helenlewis There’s loads of stuff we men can enjoy without women crying about sexism. Everything. Just do it without being a sexist muppet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-22 07:37:14	@helenlewis Oh no! Do you need a hug? Some tea? Hard drugs? I went in the comments once…I’m now a banana.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-22 07:31:22	@OpheliaBenson @somegreybloke Does she not know of the side effects? What a monster!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-22 07:29:27	@OpheliaBenson @somegreybloke IKR. That Watson lady really is beyond the pale. I heard she flayed a man alive once, just to wear his skin.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-22 07:27:57	@mistressmatisse If banter about using massive black strap on cocks to peg people with is wrong, I don’t want to be right.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-22 07:12:56	Said it before (previous tweet) but it seems it bears repeating as some SW haters have missed the point. Stand up for the marginalised.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 23:25:33	@Asetisis It's one of those things that, whatever your views, excluding people is the wrong way to deal with it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 23:24:46	@Asetisis Happy to help. Con in Nott today has religious anti-SW groups discussing SW whilst SWs are outside barred from entry. Not on!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 23:21:28	@Asetisis So my point was an intersectional one, i.e. the problem of the realtively more privileged group debating issues of the less....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 23:18:56	@Asetisis I've learned those are the terms most commonly used here on Twitter by people more in the know than I.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 23:18:14	@Asetisis No worries. I'm a learner myself! Antis are "anti sex work campaigners", SW = sex worker. So a wide pair of categories.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 21:12:21	@stuartfield2 Can we do this thinking in pubs?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 21:11:34	@stavvers What REALLY suprised me is it seems it is not a TERF con, by their own language, and in my ex TERF usually in cahoots with SWERF
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 21:10:42	@stuartfield2 Cut the Christians part. Stick humans in. It's part of the human experience not to think sometimes. We all do it. Me included

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 21:06:45	@stuartfield2 I know of Lennox, but would have to read more.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 21:06:06	@stuartfield2 I disagree about McGrath, he's not a scientist and his arguments are AWFUL. Collins appeals to the numinous, no rigour...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 21:05:18	@stuartfield2 Speaking as a professional scientist, no that's not true. It simply never comes up. Honestly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 21:04:41	@stuartfield2 You need to speak with those who identify as Christian and writes that rubbish, not Dawkins et al, on that one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 21:03:52	@stuartfield2 I think you missed the point of that tbh. "Jesus loves you, but you will burn in hell you sinner. Love Bob" is pretty ironic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 21:03:22	@stuartfield2 That's not misrepresenting at all.That's funny! People claiming love/moral superiority sending out hatemessages. Hilarious!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 21:02:34	@stuartfield2 The conflict is not "science vs religion", it's "reason vs faith". It is an epistemological "conflict" (don't like word)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 21:01:41	@stuartfield2 For one thing it wouldn't be "balanced" they are very much in the minority. Also...erm...how am I going to get this into 140!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 20:57:43	@stuartfield2 It's a more intellecutal, and much kinder (dare I say donnish?) book.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 20:57:15	@stuartfield2 And the thing with Christian scientists is this: the science is, and def should be, separate from anyone's faith (or lack of)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 20:56:15	@stuartfield2 MIsrepresents THE faith? He might not be representing YOUR faith, but he is hardly misprepresenting the faith of others at all
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 20:53:37	@stuartfield2 @MitchBenn @davidmarriott ...I agree it wasn't great. Have you read Mackie's The Miracle of Theism? Not a bad book.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 20:53:09	@stuartfield2 @MitchBenn @davidmarriott Ah the Courtier's reply! The Dawkins thing was aimed at what he encounters. Not apologising for it..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 20:51:27	@stuartfield2 @MitchBenn @davidmarriott Out of the pop stuff, I'd prefer Dennett and Avalos. But then pop stuff is incomplete by necessity
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 20:50:35	@stuartfield2 @MitchBenn @davidmarriott I'd have gone the other way (slightly), I found the Hitchens' one execrable. 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 20:31:05	@stephenfry There's good precedent. R Feynman did "secret talks" for physics enthusiasts. Secret so the Nobel didn't attract too many people

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 19:34:49	@femmefauxpas @everydaysexism I love jokes and humour. I'm a comedy enthusiast of the most slutty kind, I love everything. Rape =/= humour.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 19:31:30	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Confirmation bias is a bugger! It affects us all. When you have an idea, you nconsciously fit things to it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 19:30:40	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie It helps we live far apart. I love them, but I do not need the Daily Mail's take on MH rammed down my throat.2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 19:29:49	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie I am off to the family next weekend. I'm "in the closet" wrt my BPD. I've managed to avoid them when bad. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 19:28:41	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Families: You can pick your nose, but you can't pick your family's nose. Trufax! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 19:27:59	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie Days of wobbly...urgh. I know the feeling. Do you get this one: Sat on the sofa feeling "overcharged" buzzing?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 19:26:48	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Tragically the full moon thingy has been well disproven. Ugly fact slays beautiful idea again!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 18:49:00	@BipolarBlogger I sympathise entirely. I had a slight wobbly day yesterday, maybe it's the air pressure! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 18:04:14	@frockdoctrineuk Yup. And I'm a little ashamed I sort fo knew these were shabby words and "forgot" (need coffee, my excuse! ;-) )
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 18:01:26	@frockdoctrineuk Ha! Don't we all! I'll keep an eye on my tongue...fingers...for the "m-word". Thanks for pulling me up on it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 18:00:19	@frockdoctrineuk Yeah we all slip up...esp me! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:59:19	@frockdoctrineuk ..I don't think it has the same potential splash damage.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:58:55	@frockdoctrineuk The problem with moron/retard is misue of medical terms (AFAICT), and fuckwit has never been such a term...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:57:06	@frockdoctrineuk REALLY! Oh my lack of god! What word can be used for those deliberately acting stupid if not that?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:55:53	@clinteas @WowbaggerOM Was sir under the affluence of incohol?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:55:21	@frockdoctrineuk And I didn't know that about the word swap either. I'll amend the internal lexicon accordingly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:54:47	@frockdoctrineuk Good point. My bad. Can I retroactively substitute "fuckwit"? (I always forget this thing with that word It needs erasing)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:52:00	I'd spend it on really useful things like scientific research, helping poor people and getting fucked out of my tiny mind...a bit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:51:14	I won £3 on the Euromillions last night. Look. dear Fates, that's not amusing. £86 mill up for grabs last night, and I am the best recipient
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:49:35	@clinteas @WowbaggerOM Rorschach, what did you do? Have you been mean to the clueless and bigotted again? What did I tell you about that?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:48:13	@frockdoctrineuk Morons exist, ergo I am mean to them. Is this really so hard?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:47:55	@frockdoctrineuk What "nice" people don't get is that if everyone was actually decent then I would not have to be such a tetchy bastard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:47:04	Good morning Twitter. Today will be mostly spent gardening and making my office look like it is inhabited by a human not a pissed off chimp.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:45:52	@frockdoctrineuk I was nice. Once. Didn't like it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:45:36	@BipolarBlogger Glad you had a decent sleep. The rapid cycling throughout the day sounds horrendous. Hope you're feeling on a more even keel
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:43:44	@mrjamesob It's easy to laugh at UKIP. They're a bunch of pointless, shallow bigots. What worries me is so many people don't get the joke.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:37:50	@hyperdeath128k @WowbaggerOM @The_Block_Bot @notahappyhooker And like Lennon and McCartney did in the 1960s. Trufax.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:35:55	@notahappyhooker @WowbaggerOM @The_Block_Bot Oh nice. Can I have my FREEZE peach shaved into flakes and drizzled with raspberry sauce?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 17:33:39	@WowbaggerOM @The_Block_Bot @notahappyhooker UNPOSSIBLE! Use of TBBT must be FEMINAZI Stalinist oppression of Freeze Peach. and is misandry
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 16:56:11	@LeicesterTigers {sobs} I can’t make it today. I may have to go for a bit of a lie down and a restorative shandy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 16:01:12	@LeicesterTigers Is today's game televised anywhere? Or has BT let us down?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 01:47:55	@kausikdatta22 @sondosia @SallyStrange We do try, but we're still no way near. Even UKIP are better than your average Republican.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 01:09:10	@sondosia @kausikdatta22 @SallyStrange I will grant McSorley's isn't bad. We have better wine. Cheaper too. And fewer guns + Republicans.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 01:03:42	@virgiltexas @SallyStrange There is nothing about Beck that surprises me more than it terrifies me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 01:01:48	@kausikdatta22 @sondosia @SallyStrange And also the pizza. I CAN SPELL
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 01:01:29	@kausikdatta22 @sondosia @SallyStrange I will however grant you the izza. Ours is crap.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 01:00:59	@kausikdatta22 @sondosia @SallyStrange It is An Well Known Fact that Americans cannot do bacon or beer. I know, I've tried both. A lot.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:57:53	@kausikdatta22 @sondosia @SallyStrange LIES! We have better bacon.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:53:55	@sondosia @SallyStrange Funny that, all my friends from NYC say the same thing. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:52:43	@sondosia @SallyStrange I DO miss NYC...but it's a little difficult to be relevant in London! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:52:15	@SallyStrange @sondosia Okay, I'm stoopid, but not THAT stoopid. I didn't know Miri's Tumblr was a continuation of Brute Reason But now I do
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:18:59	@BipolarBlogger {Does hero dance} Go Charlotte! Go Charlotte! Go Charlotte!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:17:30	@stavvers Salt mines you say? Better that than Bognor Regis!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:16:01	@stavvers Pineapple on pizza is good! Anyone who disagrees will be first against the wall when the revolution comes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:09:06	@stavvers @Ellwynnnnn I look remarkably like Idris. Except I'm not black, toned, or gorgeous. Apart from that the similarities are endless!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:07:10	3) I am feeling simultaneously proud of self restraint, ashamed of ease of geek-splurge, and ashamed I have not given the money to charity
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:06:21	1) I am reading reviews of the iPhone 5s and dribbling. 2) Payday is Tuesday, I am being DISCIPLINED. I am not using my savings or c-card.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:01:23	@Esteleth And that was, like, totally not a stalkerish thing to say
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-21 00:01:05	@Esteleth I WILL FOLLOW YOU!!!!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 23:52:58	@Esteleth ME! I'm not going to be worth following as I have my own blog. http:// Louisredux.tumblr.com
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 23:23:28	@BipolarBlogger I want to pinch their little cheekies and say "Awwww who's an adorable little numbnuts then?"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 23:20:07	@BipolarBlogger That had not escaped me. Aren't these bigots just the gift that keeps on giving?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 22:57:06	@DavidFutrelle STOP STOP! Don't tell me any more about MRAs etc. I'll still recovering from the misandrist chair!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 22:54:15	@ladygarden69 @Cliterati1 @bmagnanti I'm reading this at the moment and it is blooming brilliant!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 22:53:11	@BipolarBlogger The BongoBongo Buffer at work I presume? He is a "deeply lovely" human being. For negative values of "deeply lovely".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 22:51:55	@laurenlaverne Is it a bad thing that I read the first two words and my brain went: OOH SIR PAUL NURSE, NOBEL PRIZE WINNER?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 22:10:42	@SallyStrange @sondosia No worries, being a new boy I just typed in Sondosia to tumblr and got some fashion thing. Not, I am guessing, right
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 22:05:02	@BipolarBlogger Do not offer blog services I may well take you up on! ;)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 22:02:56	@BipolarBlogger Yeah I read your tweets about that, give your dad my best, that must be horrid for all of you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 22:02:18	Dear BT Sport, You are not showing the Leicester Tigers match this weekend. This is a disgrace Put it on the red button for us fans #BTsport
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 22:00:45	@BipolarBlogger ACCOUNTS!? I'm struggling with one!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:58:07	@BipolarBlogger Yeah, it's all a bit noddy, but I supoose it helps someone. Annoying for experienced folk like you I bet.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:57:24	@splendisaurus I'm an old hand on the web but a bit of a curmudgeon, these new fangled things can get off my digital lawn
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:52:26	@BipolarBlogger {whispers back} Me either but I wanted to follow Stephen Fry, so I signed up and now it wants things from me. I'm scared.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:51:16	@SpokesGay Thanks and done!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:47:47	Please tweeps, please advise me on decent tumblrs to follow (I already have Mr Stephen Fry...I'm not a total dunce). 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:47:09	I've just signed up to tumblr, I need 5 blogs to read apparently, and my initial searches are revealing mightly levels of Crapola. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:38:39	@somegreybloke I can only approve! (And yes feculence is superb)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:38:19	@somegreybloke We've mentioned the necessity of Latin before! ;-) There is something deliciously pompous and extra insulting about its use.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:33:37	@somegreybloke He also uses the Wodehousian suffix "excrescence" which is sublime in the hands of Mr Fry and one of the world's best insults
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:31:34	@stephenfry I have now read. Good work!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:25:05	@stephenfry Has sir been indulging in catharsis?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-20 21:23:00	@Sheridansmith1 I would have thought it more likely that YOU could buy ME this car Although I fear explaining that to the Mrs might be tough
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 23:28:03	@professor_dave @Jess_chemgeek @TheLadBible It is one of the tougher three syllable words at 5 letters...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 23:21:16	@professor_dave @Jess_chemgeek @TheLADBible Please be irony. Please. For the sake of my tattered faith in humanity...it's not irony is it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 23:18:47	@K07A07S82 NOOOOOO!!!!! WANT TO REPLY!!!! MUST NOT USE TEH TWITTERS!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 23:00:54	@EverydaySexism THAT is a great line. Who wants “oh all right” when “OMG LET'S DO THIS” is available?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 22:47:20	@MichaelLCrick @Puffles2010 If his remarks are anything but "You are a bunch of pointless, denialist bigots" he is wasting his time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 22:46:24	Dear Twitter, Please stop me procrastinating as I polish this talk I am giving tonight. Yes I said talk not turd. Naughty Twitter.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 22:45:47	@K07A07S82 Anyway, tell me off! Stop me tweeting, I am finishing off a talk I am giving tonight and cannot be distracted. Damn you Twitter!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 22:45:16	@K07A07S82 ...evaluating. I don't know how I could establish if this was the case without some kind of survey. Which I haven't done!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 22:44:24	@K07A07S82 I'm with you on the "distrustful" part, me too. It helps I know Oolon a bit. I wouldn't be so sure about "most people" not...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 22:42:42	@there_runsMary @rbhu7 Congrats on getting funding (may pick your brains on that one day). Are you able to find the email and thus cash?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 17:06:14	@notahappyhooker Being paid for wanking is like the Olympics used to be. It corrupts the amateur ideology of a good one off the wrist! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 17:05:07	@RichardDawkins It's not exactly a tough path to walk, Prof. It's possible to be anti-sexist on this issue without succumbing to racism etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 17:03:10	@stephenfry Everyone to Sweden for a Mass-turbate! Just make sure we all look in different directions at inanimate objects/middle distance.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 16:07:48	@LargeRugby @martin_crowson Oh no I disagree Xmas shopping at 4pm on 24/12 is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. This ERC lark? Not so much
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 16:01:51	@BjarteSF @Xanthe_Cat @aratina Yeah, read that the other day. Tragically it interrupted our burgeoning banter relationship! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 15:54:16	@BjarteSF @Xanthe_Cat @aratina OH I understand why she left, totally. I am selfishly sad. And yes, those people are odious scumbags.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 15:52:35	@paulcoxon I've been to India a couple of times and this is normal. Honest. EVERYTHING is "curried". Just make believe!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 15:49:08	@Xanthe_Cat @BjarteSF @aratina It's v sad to me too that CCP went off twitter. She's ace.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 15:45:21	@GeorgeMonbiot Not really. He is not the shiniest cabbage in the allotment. Extreme privilege and rhetorical felicity are not intellect.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 15:15:40	@rbhu7 I get the new iPhone next week I’ll be twittering that motherfucker all up in everyone’s shit Or something. I’m not very good at this

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 15:08:39	@salihughes I’ll add my voice to the cacophony of support you’re getting. This is as bad as what poor @mrchrisaddison is dealing with! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 04:05:49	@tkingdoll It's a personal favourite. I must have NUTS AND BERRIES Cavepersons in my past because I'm very fond of pink.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 04:04:13	@tkingdoll Have you been liking pink things BECAUSE NUTS AND BERRIES again?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 03:28:14	@K07A07S82 If you're there, this is what I do. Others do things their own way, I'm easy with it. If it gets out of hand, then I know what...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 02:12:23	@K07A07S82 Rather than knee jerk "taking issue", why not ENCOURAGE people to educate themselves? Why not support those people who use it...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 02:09:16	@K07A07S82 This does presume that those who benefit from a positive result are dishonest. Cui bono is a rule of thumb, not a law. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 02:08:25	@K07A07S82 The problem is, there are 24 hrs in one day, and I have to spend some of them working! I cannot oversee all interactions with bot

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 02:05:46	@K07A07S82 Now you and I, rightly, check stuff as far as we can go. That good, rational, reasonable, sceptical way. And (back to the res)...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 02:04:01	@K07A07S82 ....abilities of the reviewers. (Honestly, professional knowledge, etc), this is a necessity. Not an option.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 02:02:54	@K07A07S82 Now that involves, in part, trusting the people involved in that system, peer review works (for example) because of the...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 02:02:20	@K07A07S82 Which is fantastic. But at some point you reach the end of what you can reasonably do, and have to trust to some degree
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 02:01:44	@K07A07S82 Your trust is, wonderfully, based partly on investigating as far as you are capable given the limitations of time/resources etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:59:45	@K07A07S82 @borngeek @ool0n @mapledaroni I sat on a misandrist chair once. MY BALLS STILL HURT!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:57:45	@K07A07S82 ...and my expertise. At some point we have to trust. Not unknowlingly, or without reservation, but just to a reasonable degree.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:57:12	@K07A07S82 Either way...we've drifted a bit, my point is that one person cannot be an expert on everything, there is a limit to your....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:53:19	@K07A07S82 ...from a pharmacotherapeutic perspective
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:53:05	@K07A07S82 If someone has told you this they are SUPREMELY misguided, because they're vastly different diseases and are treated differently
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:51:08	@K07A07S82 ...nigh on impossible for drug treatments simply because they turn out shite results (i.e. meaningless gibberish).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:50:12	@K07A07S82 I was talking about their use in one very specifcally studied disease. Not lumping. nd getting borad funding as you describe is..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:49:30	@K07A07S82 So when I was talking about the "no more effective than placebo" use of antidepressants in mild to moderate depression...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:48:45	@K07A07S82 Clinical depression. Apologies if that was not clear. The point still stands though, things are not lumped the way you describe
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:48:02	@K07A07S82 You might get COMORBID diagnoses, e.g. PTSD + clinical depression, or bipolar disorder + bordeline personality disorder...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:47:09	@K07A07S82 You see that's just untrue, they really don't get lumped into a bundle like that. That's not how diagnoses work at all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:44:44	@K07A07S82 Have you read the DSM? They really do not have the same diagnoses!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:43:18	@K07A07S82 you have to be very, very targeted. Especially initially. Trying to hit too many targets at once = guaranteed failure.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:42:40	@K07A07S82 Well, this is what I do (I work in pharma drug design...short version) and it's the other way around. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:40:15	@K07A07S82 Haha! I want exercise to work because then it improves my mind and my lardy arse! Two birds one stone. I do a lot of exercise ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:39:36	@K07A07S82 I'm just curious what the basis for these claims are.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:39:09	@K07A07S82 Really? You think people try to develop a single drug to deal with many diseases/presentations at once from the outset?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:36:38	@K07A07S82 Anyway, on what basis do you think the relevant studies "lumped different types of depression together"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:35:45	@K07A07S82 I have a vested interest in exercise being the cure all! (okay not the cure all...you know what I mean!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:35:17	@K07A07S82 Oh exercise is one of those "it's complicated" areas, I was just hoping the Cochrane review would turn up something glowing. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:32:14	@K07A07S82 How do you know the studies weren't tailored to "specific types of depression"? Have you read them?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:29:30	@K07A07S82 Actually there was an interesting review (Cochrane) recently about exercise and depression. It was...haha...depressing!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:27:28	@K07A07S82 SO what do you think of the data that shows that for mild to moderate depression antidepressants are not much better than placebo
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:24:25	@K07A07S82 Indeed. Anyway, back to the res. What do you think about the use of antidepressants for mild to moderate depression?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:20:42	@K07A07S82 You have my profoundest sympathies. I would be in prison!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:19:14	@K07A07S82 Same here....but you know, the internet, there's some scary folks out there! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:18:12	@K07A07S82 And I agree with this ENTIRELY btw
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:17:41	@K07A07S82 PHEW! I thought I was dealing with...well...one of THEM! (for a second!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:15:40	@K07A07S82 What precisely about the wakefield vaccine thing? You're not a Wakefield fan are you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:12:08	@K07A07S82 No worries, I am working away and then I'm off out, I have stuff to do, dammit (and you've helped me avoid it...thanks!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 01:11:36	@K07A07S82 Crikey! Really? It's a deeply flawed process. Just to be sure, you trust no individual scientist?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:58:01	@K07A07S82 No worries, just curious. Do you trust the scientists who write those publications to any degree?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:49:40	@K07A07S82 That's not my term btw, just something I've seen it called.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:49:22	@K07A07S82 The point I'm going to make is about trust, and something called (pompously but accurately) the distribution of cognitive effort
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:48:44	@K07A07S82 Ha! I'm not planning to go difficult. Not really into willy waving!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:47:28	@K07A07S82 Anyway, since you know chem/bio this will be easy, what publications etc do you read to decide about which meds you'll take?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:44:22	@K07A07S82 I do not doubt that for one second!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:42:43	@K07A07S82 You would have had 4 separate undergrad degrees?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:42:26	@K07A07S82 So if you understand chem and bio to degree level this will save a lot of time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:40:47	@K07A07S82 Ah okay, of course. Good work. SN kids are hard work...well kids are hard work!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:40:12	@K07A07S82 You have degrees in those subjects? if so WOW! That's a lot!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:38:08	@K07A07S82 I ask because I am a scientist, and so it might help if I can shortcut the basics! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:37:10	@K07A07S82 Really? I'm genuinely curious, what's your science background?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:31:08	@K07A07S82 In other words do you have the technical knowledge to truly know what is happeneing when you take these drugs?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:30:37	@K07A07S82 Cool, I'll explain relevance. Are you a scientist in a relevant field of research? A clinician/nurse/pharmacist?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:26:57	@K07A07S82 Pics aren't good enough, I need links for full context. Are you going to answer my question btw?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:25:47	@K07A07S82 BTW there is a very good reason I asked you about pharma drugs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:25:12	@K07A07S82 You're spending a LOT of time complaining about one, and not, apparently here where I can see you, the other. Curious.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:24:44	@K07A07S82 And MORE than that, is a block bot really such a MAJOR evil compared to...oooh let's say MH stigma and the use of MH as insult
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:24:05	@K07A07S82 Many fine systems are corruptible. And? Have you evidence of corruption? Or just evidence of disagreement?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:23:32	@K07A07S82 As for "making up their own minds", tell me, do you use pharmaceutical drugs?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:22:54	@K07A07S82 ...on some basis, have used certain insults, or harassed certain people, i.e. fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the list.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:22:25	@K07A07S82 By who? I don't believe most people on the list are "bad" by any stretch of the imagination. Just that they either abuse people..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:20:24	@K07A07S82 You don't like the bot, so don't use it. Some other people like it, let them use it You don't get to decide what burden they take
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:19:49	@K07A07S82 Not at all. Some people don;t want to criticise, just to avoid. You're not even thinking now, just knee jerk hating something
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:18:34	@K07A07S82 If you agree with the list criteria, subscribe, if you don't, don't. I haven't subscribed. I don't need to.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:18:01	@K07A07S82 People are not blocked by ME or YOU voluntarily. Subscription to the list is the voluntary part
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:16:56	@K07A07S82 No one is dictating anything. CRITICISING the use of certain terms in certaiin ways/contexts is NOT censorship
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:16:17	@K07A07S82 Since the bot is something one signs up to oneself VOLUNTARILY, then no, the bot is not censorship
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:13:21	@K07A07S82 Did I say what I quoted were your first comment? No. Did I say they were relevant. Yes. You're not even reading.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:07:37	@K07A07S82 https:// twitter.com/K07A07S82/stat us/380307894920806400 … Oh and you @'d in CaptnAtheist. Still sure you don't know what he said?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:05:46	@K07A07S82 Would you like me to link to where you claimed bot is censorship and harmful? You made those FACTUAL claims, not mere opinions
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-19 00:05:19	@K07A07S82 I'm not sure you even understand what YOU have written let alone what I have.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:59:41	@K07A07S82 Not taking sides by complaining about the bot being censorship etc?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:55:39	@K07A07S82 Then why did you comment on @ool0n 's use of the bot to block this guy at all?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:54:52	@K07A07S82 The reason I was @'d in, 3rd time of telling you, was because @ool0n added some guy to block bot for misuing MH terms as insult
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:54:13	@K07A07S82 You're moving the goalposts. You started decrying the block bot as harmful. You are chucking herrings and straw to disguise that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:53:34	@K07A07S82 We're dealing with abuse of MH terms used as insult on twitter, not psychotherapy. Your application of principle was misapplied.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:52:58	@K07A07S82 Balls! You were saying teching people to deal with abuse is part of psych which is red herring, we are not even dealing with that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:50:56	@K07A07S82 ...that this was "censorship" (it isn't) and that it was harful because it prevented people from toughening up
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:50:16	@K07A07S82 He was discussing adding some Capn Atheist chap to the block bot for using MH terms as insult. You were disagreeing on grounds...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:49:31	@K07A07S82 This started with you defending the use of MH terms as insult. It's there in black and white. It's why @ool0n @'d me in!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:46:58	@K07A07S82 Abuse =/= a toughening process. It's just abuse
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:46:40	@K07A07S82 Even in general use of MH terms as insult is indefensible for reasons I gave
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:45:57	@K07A07S82 The bot is a tool people can use voluntarily. Personally I don't use it. Still irrelevant to using MH as insult, like that Capn
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:44:24	@K07A07S82 But you're trying to. I'm advocating pulralism, you;re saying this Capn Atheist person has right to misuse MH terms to insult ppl
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:43:53	@K07A07S82 Or am I being too harsh? If you think I am, THINK ABOUT THAT.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:43:28	@K07A07S82 That's not demonstrating you care, that's demonstrating you miss the point utterly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:43:05	@K07A07S82 You say you care but give this person a free pass to abuse MH issues. Why? You claim your experience/strategy is binding. Why?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:41:58	@K07A07S82 ...assume you care more about one than other. So don't play oppression olympics with me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:41:38	@K07A07S82 You misunderstand, you are, here, on twitter, focussing on a bot, not this Capn person's abuse. It is a reasonable thing to...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:40:57	@K07A07S82 And much more than that, bullying, abuse, othering, is not part of psychotherapy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:40:13	@K07A07S82 And why I was explicitly clear about what I was talking about from start to finish
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:39:43	@K07A07S82 You were, @ool0n @'d me in about the mental health insult by that Capn chappy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:39:09	@K07A07S82 you do like red herrings! Misuse of MH terms by ignorant non professionals =/= psychotherapy. You're misapplying a principle
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:32:33	@FollowBDT Each to their own of course!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:32:19	@FollowBDT No. That was easy! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:31:45	@ScepticPaul Incidentally, he has nothing to do with the bot, and v little to do with A+. You do know that right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:31:07	@K07A07S82 Ha! Oh yes! My rants rarely fit into 140000 chars! (Bad habit)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:30:38	@ScepticPaul He does that to a lot of people I notice.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:30:16	@K07A07S82 Pluralism works. Let a thousand flowers bloom. Some people can learn by being ostracised, some by engagement, some by other thing
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:29:37	@K07A07S82 This is true for you, and to an extent for me. Great. Your choice, my choice IS NOT BINDING ON ANYONE ELSE. Is this hard for you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:28:48	@K07A07S82 Why are you defending people who misuse MH terms in order to abuse others?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:28:21	@K07A07S82 Not at all, people don;t have to put up with abuse on the off chance the other person is not abusive all the time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:27:16	@K07A07S82 Oolon, the target of the insult and this guy are friends? With a known relationship and suitable interpersonal understanding?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:26:11	@K07A07S82 ...is impossible, he was using the terms as an insult. If it quacks like a duck, waddles like a duck, it's a duck!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:25:35	@K07A07S82 Context? He is not an MH professional, he is not an M Illness sufferer AFAIK, he is unqualified to diagnose, remote diagnosis....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:24:47	2)... assume that you care more about that issue than another.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:23:56	1) If your behaviour demonstrates that it spend more effort on one issue than another, it is not unreasonable for an outside observer to...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:22:26	@K07A07S82 ...butters absolutely no parsnips with me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:22:12	@K07A07S82 So forgive me if your apparent concern over a bot on Twitter and your apparent LACK of concern about a real social problem...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:21:37	@K07A07S82 more than that, the endless repetition of MH terms as insult, and their ignorant use is a VASTLY greater social problem than bot
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:21:00	@K07A07S82 And people's individual choice to use a bot is THEIR choice. I don't use it, other people differ. Each makes their own choice.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:20:02	@ScepticPaul They can easily criticise you in your absence (block) and vice versa. Are you another bot obsessional?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:19:17	@K07A07S82 The bot is 100% irrelevant to anything I was saying. I am criticising an egregious misuse of MH terms as insult by a non MH prof.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:17:37	@K07A07S82 ..of remote diagnosis viaa twitter is a genuien problem, one he should rightly be called on.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:17:11	@K07A07S82 So sorry, but that chap's misuse of a term as an insult, and his lack of qualification for diagnosis, and the inappropriateness..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:16:32	@K07A07S82 That's a blanket claim that is simply not representative of the full picture. Also abuse on twitter is not a safe class on coping
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:15:02	@ScepticPaul Other people also have that same prerogative, as you use it to criticise others (rightly), so may they use it to criticise you
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:13:52	@ScepticPaul Oh it is absolutely your prerogative, anywhere and everywhere, and long may you exercise it. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:04:06	@ScepticPaul As for arseholes... meh...Person A thinks Person B is an arsehole, wake me when it matters! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:03:25	@ScepticPaul Again, it's a first approximation, not very nuanced, made on Twitter. Not an epic damning detailed essay.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 23:02:56	@ScepticPaul If q/n > p/n it is not an unreasonable inference that issue pertaining to q is cared more about than the issue pertaining to p
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 22:59:39	@ScepticPaul is the {ahem} "interesting" bit.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 22:57:47	@ScepticPaul It's not the most nuanced description, but then a) this is twitter, and b) it's accruate to at least a first approximation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 22:53:34	@ScepticPaul I don't use it, I'm small fish! No one bothers me too much.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 22:53:03	@ScepticPaul True enough, but right or wrong, I begrudge no one a tool they use to make their environment more conducive to their needs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 22:42:53	@ArfurSmith No idea, but if you find out let me know. I'm working from home today and have subjected myself to sustained sexual harassment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 22:41:01	@pzmyers @ScepticPaul My observation, admittedly anecdotal and thus limited, is that q/n > p/n in the few weeks I've been on twitter.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 22:40:23	@pzmyers @ScepticPaul then count tweets objecting to block bot (q). if q/n > p/n you've got a starting point for PZ's characterisation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 22:39:08	@pzmyers @ScepticPaul Take n people who object to block bot. Count tweets objecting to conduct that made bot necessary for some (p) 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 22:30:27	@splendisaurus @ool0n It's one of those things that's easier to say than do. Like...erm...quite a lot of other things.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 21:55:26	@splendisaurus If you liked that Brit, then yes it's me, if you hated him, then it's some other guy. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 21:47:41	@Maggie_McNeill @ninaland @bmagnanti I understand the victory dance can be in quite poor taste! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 21:46:22	@K07A07S82 @ool0n 14) End rant! 140 chars in Twitter is not the place for any form of nuanced discussion.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 21:38:57	@K07A07S82 @ool0n 5)... a rampant straw man. So we can cut that out. Last, the use of something as an insult is a direct, unambiguous...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 19:09:00	I despise the fact that a programme forces me to tweet that I am using it. Is monitoring your own social media to understand better it bad?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 18:51:15	@jailawrites oh the hash tags are what make it for me I’m guessing they’re just a set of troll/abuse tags that lead to nasty folk on twitter
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 18:47:36	Hahahahahaha! What a total fuckwit. These misogynists and sundry bigots amuse me. Not a spine or brain between ‘em. https:// twitter.com/BiIIyCIinton/s tatus/380280645986959360 …

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 18:21:41	@ool0n @DoggySpew @CaptnAtheist I do too, I'm writing a talk for tomorrow, with ironic coincidence it's about mental health! So I am 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 18:19:19	@ool0n @DoggySpew @CaptnAtheist Obviously if you don't want, I'll @out happily. But there is a genuine issue here to address if interested.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 18:10:26	@ool0n i KNOW YOU DID THAT DELIBERATELY IN ABID FOR WORLD DOMINATION.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 18:02:32	@ool0n Oh THANKS! That was SO not what I meant!. Looks like I'll have to use the bot after all. Bastard! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 18:02:00	@bmagnanti The only problem is that now I agree with you, I am now a pimp, whore, john and trafficker. {Sigh} And I have so much work to do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 18:00:52	@bmagnanti I want to thank you for opening my eyes on this issue (and others). It's nice to see facts behind the manufactured controversy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:58:45	@ool0n Is this this Atheist superhero person? I'll have a chat with them. Let's see if they can manage it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:58:06	@mapledaroni @ool0n Yup. I am a man, I know all about Man FeeFees (Important). They are Important. Y U NO RESPECT MAH MAN FEEFEES?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:54:10	@ool0n That is true, I might. But the question really is, given the number of really good convos out there, do I really need one with...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:52:38	@ool0n I confess I wonder, if I piss off enough misogynists, when will the point where my using the bot become necessary?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:51:44	@ool0n It's like telling me that "Hey asshole stop stamping on someone's face" and stamping on someone's face are suddenly equivalent
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:50:16	@ool0n I find the irony in the fact that I don't use the BlockBot but have no problem with it or people using it and thus I am evil, funny
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:35:39	@WowbaggerOM @louisredux @oolon And great pic btw. I shall steal it with no shame!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:11:15	@WelfordTheTiger I agree, but a) this is a fantastically arrogant Sarries wind up tool. Top gamesmanship, and b) Bath beat us at the weekend
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:10:22	@IamJadehawk 3) and my eyebrow, it lifts off my head. It's days like this when I think pot should not just be legal, but compulsory.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:03:00	@IamJadehawk I ALWAYS want to hear about your weekends in rural North Dakota. But that's only because you write about them so well.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:02:31	The irony being that I made a grammatical error in my plea for less fuckwittery and fewer fuckwits. Clearly this is my own fuckwittery.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 17:01:18	2) So if you could see your way to stop inundating me with it I would be very grateful and might not go on a killing spree with a banana.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 03:06:47	@ninaland @Maggie_McNeill @bmagnanti That's a very good point. Even though I am tempted to go for the comedy answer of "speak for yourself"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 02:40:02	@Maggie_McNeill @ninaland @bmagnanti Not that I am doubting this at all, but erm, how does one ask, is condom rash a problem for other SWs?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-18 02:35:37	@bmagnanti Health and Safety should get onto that. Getting an ass filling whilst eating a baguette could be a choke hazard. Irresponsible.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 20:48:42	I realise a lot of peoples' days were being held up by the lateness of that announcement. I won't let it happen again.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 20:48:03	I should point out, to all those who care, I have now had coffee and feel like I am human. Yay Twitter! This important info must be known.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 19:23:13	@WowbaggerOM @The_Block_Bot My laywers Mssrs Sue, Sue, Grabbit and Runne are on the case. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 19:23:02	@WowbaggerOM @The_Block_Bot However, I will be complaining that Mr Fry has censored me and caused me emotional distress. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 19:21:52	@WowbaggerOM @The_Block_Bot I should clarify, the previous tweet was An Joke. I love Mr Fry and would never call him a cunt.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 19:21:11	@WowbaggerOM @The_Block_Bot Stephen Fry has not only not followed me, he hasn't replied to a single one of my tweets calling him a cunt.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 19:20:14	@somegreybloke "A gentleman need not know Latin, but he should at least have forgotten it." Being a gentleman, = overrated! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 19:13:47	@somegreybloke "You are stupid" "AD HOMINEM WARBLE GARBLE!" I too miss the days when simple logical fallacies were used correctly. {Sigh}

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 16:01:49	@BipolarBlogger Do you ever do invited talks at less salubrious venues like self help groups etc? (expenses covered etc obviously)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 15:53:02	5) I've read worse things than the Mail, but then I have read Mein Kampf. The Mail is almost only ever incidentally, broken clock-like right
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 15:51:32	4) publication that stirs more moral panics than a propaganda minister dedicated to purity of ideological output and behavioural engineering
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 15:49:33	3) This would be the egregiously misogynist, former Nazi supporting, outright racist, so right of centre their economics looks Friedmanesque
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 15:47:42	2) "Mel will keep writing: all she needs is an outlet that is less middle of the road." A less middle of the road outlet than the Mail!?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 05:07:50	@Doubting_Tom I think the concept that cats and mice are two different things is confusing the...well, I'm going to have to go with fuckwit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 05:06:59	@bmagnanti Psshhh Some of THOSE women are brown. Or poor. Do you know how much they lower house prices?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 05:06:20	@jailawrites I bet it's a lot nastier than Shit My Dad Says. After all your general god, not averse to the odd bit of genocide.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 05:04:12	@bmagnanti Quick! Say the Scottish Sun used "cunt" as an insult. That'll get the SWERFs et al going.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 05:03:05	@jailawrites Decent of you, but if you did die, this tweeting thing has a greater reach than I imagined.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 05:01:42	@jailawrites @DearAnia I'm sowwy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 04:27:36	@Doubting_Tom I like pickle, I also like cheese. I like two things. I like pickle and cheese. Cheese is not pickle. DIS AM HARD
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 04:24:41	@Doubting_Tom But but this makes me better than everyone else. HOW DARE YOU SUGGEST I CAN BE WRONG ABOUT ANYTHING. THIS HURTS MY MAN FEEFEES

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 04:19:41	@Doubting_Tom I knew those facts and generally scientific and sceptical attitude would get me into trouble.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 04:17:34	@Doubting_Tom @aratina Turing tests? I think most of them would fail APGAR tests.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 04:16:49	@Doubting_Tom Do = So. Sausage fingers
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 04:16:28	@Doubting_Tom Really? Do I read all those books for nothing? If only I’d known sooner!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 04:15:49	@Doubting_Tom But but but I like Greta and Ophelia and Skepchicks and I think women are people and maybe we should do something about sexism
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 04:14:37	@dELYSEious @Keith_the_Nerd Have you been taking babies again? For delicious atheist purposes, or evil feminist ones?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 04:13:23	@Doubting_Tom THIS IS NEW INFORMATION! I wrote a whole (dull, don’t bother) blog post about atheism. Does this mean I’m the Pope now?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 04:10:53	@Doubting_Tom Are we not allowed to like atheism now?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 03:38:11	@james_earley @FreddieBurns Thi is genius from Manu.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 03:27:17	@danaequality @bluehost And why aren't Bluehost going to do it for you any more?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 03:26:38	@danaequality @bluehost I just set up a blog with iPage as provider for everything. I'm new at this though, so take that with pinch of NaCl.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 01:45:26	@wilw UK iTunes doesn't deliverit to me until tomorrow. I have the jitters. This is silly, it's a TV show. A good TV show, but still...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 01:43:49	@rhysmorgan Incidentally I get my Breaking Bad via iTunes and I usually get it Tues. How are you getting it Monday?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-17 00:19:44	@zoesqwilliams Most upsetting thing for me about the vans? My DMail reading father approving of them. My 1st gen immigrant, brown father. Ug

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 23:44:49	@dELYSEious SPOILER ALERT: YOU MAY ACTUALLY HAVE TO READ THIS WITH SOME EMPATHY AND ACT WITH COMPASSION!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 23:44:06	@stavvers @notahappyhooker I am terribly sorry. Would "derriere" or "fundament" be preferable? Gosh, I just said bottom to a lady on t'web!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 23:43:15	@dELYSEious Of course, it's not like someone could forget trivial details of a TV show. That's proper Man PTSD that is, not that lady stuff.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 23:42:22	@notahappyhooker @stavvers Also: Bottoms are Naughty. Well known fact. 1970s British comedy proves this beyond doubt.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 23:41:17	@dELYSEious I'm now wondering if I could have made that more sarcastic?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 23:40:53	@dELYSEious But of course! Spoiling my BB fix hurts my Man FeeFees (IMPORTANT!) but TWs are for girls and people who can't handle real life.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 18:16:02	@JodieMarsh I used to keep snakes as pets, know my. Snakes, def grass snake, and let it out of the box, it’ll go away by itself.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 18:14:51	@JodieMarsh And I don’t think you’re any form of ignorant or vulnerable!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 18:13:52	@andNickMullins @CrumbiePodcast I might be biased, but could we pinch some of Bale’s salary to fund the Heineken Cup and stop the wrangling?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 18:12:56	@JodieMarsh It’s a grass snake, and if it’s raising its head, leave it well alone, even non venomous snakes bite and it can hurt.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 18:11:42	@andNickMullins @CrumbiePodcast @IamAustinHealey And as I am a one eyed Tigers fan, I enjoy the presence of the Leicester Lip, keep him!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 18:10:07	@JodieMarsh It’s deffo a grass snake, they’re pretty gentle, shy creatures, it’s just out for a bask. You’ll scare it just by approaching.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 18:06:36	@LellyMo @SusanCalman My wife made me put it on over strenuous objection. Where do I fit on the chart? Is it a binary state? Off/on?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 18:05:31	@mjrobbins After all, One Direction? Simply a poor man’s Blue.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 18:04:49	@mjrobbins Not a question of being down with the kids, which I am, yo. It’s a question of having taste and enough self respect to not care.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 18:03:17	@andNickMullins @BTSport @CrumbiePodcast 2) this is why Tigers lost. I am suing for emotional distress and exposure to pre watershed soccer.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 18:00:38	@stavvers @notahappyhooker the article is spot on. So much anti rhetoric boils down to patriarchal insecurity about female sexuality. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 17:59:14	@stavvers @notahappyhooker Well they do say sex makes your day and anal sex makes your hole weak. Apart from that excuse for a crap joke 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-16 05:53:20	3) It's been only ~5 days, but seriously, this is the ONLY 5 consecutive days I have felt good since almost as far back as my 30th birthday.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 23:26:23	COME ON TIGERS!!! #tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 23:23:52	@will_peachey @EmmaK67 That’s genius! Why did they ban you? If it was my franchise I’d have paid for your meal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 23:22:21	@CrumbiePodcast that was an amazing scrum though. Regretting earlier optimism
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 23:21:04	Okay, I’m a 1 eyed tigers fan but I am seeing flashes of brilliance from Tigers, they just need to be tied together and not broken by pens.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 23:16:47	Dear Tigers, could you please win this match. I’ve moved on from dodgy tea to lager and hard drugs. Think of my liver! #tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 23:10:41	18+ point swing to Tigers, initially a man down, 4 tries + no losing bonus point to Bath. Possible. Okay. What’s in my tea? #tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 22:57:07	@markthomasinfo Matching jacket?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 22:56:35	Lucky I’m a Bath fan… …oh wait. I’m not. Shit! #Tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 22:39:14	Come on Tigers, sort it out. I’m on water and may have to move to tea, or even lager to drown my sorrows. #tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 22:37:01	Sloppy. And bugger. #tigerslive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 22:21:28	And as I say that handbags breaks out and stuffs Tigers’ penalty. {facepalm} #btsportrugby
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 22:20:34	Bath pack good, but writing off Cole/Youngs et al is a big mistake. I think Tigers might surprise the pundits. #btsportrugby
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 22:16:14	BT’s financial splurge is very welcome, but get the roundball scores off the top of my screen. Rugby should not be sullied by divers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 22:13:45	@call_me_cockers Come on Tigers!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 22:13:02	@CrumbiePodcast Granted vs Worcs we were not stellar but I have say I don’t understand being written off. Good Bath pack but not galacticos
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 22:08:00	@tomcroft6 Gutted for you Crofty. Look after yourself. My sister in law is also gutted, she knows nothing about rugby, but does fancy you!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 22:05:39	BT have splurged tonnes of cash on their coverage it’s almost worth not travelling to Bath. Almost. #Tigersfamily
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 19:11:25	@pwsw4 @whorephobia Which I should like to point out hurts my FeeFees, which are important Man FeeFees.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 19:10:59	@pwsw4 @whorephobia Well they're misandrist AND heterosexist AND shaming because I am forced to look at other mens' much larger willies
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 19:04:20	@pwsw4 @whorephobia I've heard tell of this thing called a misandrist toilet. Uncomfortable, no tampons etc. What if I want to roller skate?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 18:15:52	@whorephobia @pwsw4 Tom Martin is or of nature’s special little snowflakes isn’t he? My bum has barely healed from misandrist chairs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 18:13:21	@whorephobia … like THAT I’m not surprised that disabled SWs get hideously patronised about their agency. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 18:12:33	@whorephobia SWs are usually women, SW is seen as desperate choice of vulnerable, Disability is seen as being “lesser”. With prejudice… 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 06:25:25	@jimalkhalili DAMN! I was competing on an equal footing right up to the moowalk part.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 06:24:25	@mjrobbins And why are you looking for racist pottery on eBay?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 02:32:13	@jennifurret You too? Gee I thought that was PZ and Rebezza Watson (it's all her fault)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 02:21:28	@notahappyhooker YAY! @pwsw4 @Minxy_Lydia
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 01:44:50	@Sectioned_ @DumpyStig I don't know, it's never happened to me. {flutters eyelashes}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 01:36:46	@Sectioned_ That said, I am DEEPLY sarcastic. It's a bad habit. Sort of.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 01:36:19	@Sectioned_ I don't know if this person is an idiot or not. So far they have been too confused, but it's hard to get much from 140 chars.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 01:31:21	@SusanCalman Can we all come?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 01:19:54	@notahappyhooker @pwsw4 @Minxy_Lydia Damn! Good point. Back to my campaign for Whores Who LIke Thingy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 01:19:19	@notahappyhooker @pwsw4 @Minxy_Lydia I love my son, but there is a reason the comedian Richard Herring calls kids "sexcrement"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 01:13:24	@pwsw4 @notahappyhooker @Minxy_Lydia True, but it will confuse SWERFs and therefore amuses me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 01:11:59	@notahappyhooker @pwsw4 @Minxy_Lydia Can we start a "Whores against, you know, thingy" campaign?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 01:11:36	@notahappyhooker @pwsw4 @Minxy_Lydia Quite right! Have you SEEN the mess the little swine can create? Don't even get me started on cost.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 00:43:38	@pwsw4 @Minxy_Lydia @notahappyhooker Shocking {waves everyone closer} I had, you know, thingy with a lady once. We have a kid. Never again
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 00:36:06	@sousan50 I've been meaning to do it for a while but lack the courage. Hell, sometimes a boy just has to grow up.(And thanks! ;-) )
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 00:20:17	@SpokesGay Read it. See these sympathies? They are yours.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 00:06:47	@SpokesGay Have you got Man Flu too?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 00:06:05	@Minxy_Lydia @notahappyhooker @pwsw4 Agreed, I've been a fan for a while. Does that out me as some kind of deviant? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 00:05:25	@LouisRedux http://www. poaj.net Points on a Journey. Went for cheesy. Goal acheived.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 00:04:51	I have a blog. Yes, I realise this means I have something in common with everyone and have disappeared up my bottom. It will get better.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 00:03:44	@DeborahJaneOrr Which is mainly because I am a dangerous, drunken, champagne socialist. Or something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 00:03:18	@DeborahJaneOrr Sometimes tea, biscuits and crap telly are the way to deal with things. Mind you, I'm home from work early and on martini.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-14 00:00:44	@DeborahJaneOrr Women are sometimes liars because women are people, have a biscuit and a cuppa too? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-13 22:27:10	@bmagnanti One can but hope
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-13 19:22:24	@RevRichardColes He's onto you. Run! Isn't it more fun to assume he's part of some comedy anti-vicar conspiracy than he's just incompetent?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-13 19:10:39	@bats87 @Sectioned_ Back from the dead? Crikey! That's a good trick! Get well soon.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-13 05:33:46	@bats87 @Sectioned_ Crikey, that's a bit of tweet necromancy! Any particular reason or just looking for an argument?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:37:44	@kainedamo @pzmyers If that comparison was the point that is.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:37:11	@kainedamo @pzmyers For example, I could compare two instances of foul play in professional rugby, without mentioning my playing career
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:36:40	@kainedamo @pzmyers perhaps unintentionally macho and thus hilarious
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:36:24	@kainedamo @pzmyers Really? Your involvement is tangential at best. Compare one instance of bigotry with another. Done. Your phraseology was
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:35:35	@judeinlondon @sturdyAlex WHAT THE EVERLOVING FUCK!? I am shooting Ms Jones one hell of a look right now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:32:56	@kainedamo @pzmyers It stands alone as pretty funny though. Don't be so defensive!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:31:27	@kainedamo @pzmyers An opinion it seems you are curiously vague about the underpinnings of. Seems better not to have an opionion on that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:30:55	@kainedamo @pzmyers In your opinion of course.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:29:34	@kainedamo @pzmyers Didn't you? After all surely the record of what people were objecting to, if the story is as you say, there to see.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:28:33	@kainedamo @pzmyers I got that. You do know that FtB and A= (separate entities btw) are not sectarian groups, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:26:51	@kainedamo @pzmyers On what basis? Mere words? Actual bigotry? Mere disagreement =/= removal of bigots for example.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:26:03	@kainedamo I'm sure a good sceptic like you doesn't need to be told to be wary of that!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:24:33	@kainedamo @pzmyers In other words, rather than FTB/A+ conspiracy, could it be honest disagreement with JV?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:24:09	@kainedamo @pzmyers Is that a true representation? Or is it because JV did something that caused people in those orgs to not invite him?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:23:23	@kainedamo @pzmyers like didn't get invited to a few conferences as a speaker. About right? n/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:22:43	@kainedamo @pzmyers you destroyed the career of this guy who said something you don't like, but the guy who said something PZ didn't 2/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:22:02	@kainedamo @pzmyers So the context is some guy said something PZ didn't like, some other guy said something you don't like, 1/n
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:13:08	@kainedamo @pzmyers Ah! Makes more sense. So who was the blocked guy?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:12:03	@kainedamo @pzmyers You wanted to compare this sectarian politician and PZ? On what basis?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:11:17	@kainedamo @pzmyers Who was this guy, out of curiosity.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:08:05	@kainedamo @pzmyers Oh I'd generally agree, can you supply some for me? I missed it. Thanks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:07:06	@kainedamo @pzmyers But are you being funny, there's the question. You seem a touch defensive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:06:39	@kainedamo @pzmyers Contex treally needed for "I've destroyed X on the web" type comments? Even if YOU'RE being funny, joining in = fun
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 21:04:09	@pzmyers @kainedamo That's nothing. I have destroyed potential civilisations IN REALITY with just some lube, imagination and toilet paper.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 20:43:03	@drugmonkeyblog Can say we did but, you know, not?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 20:42:36	@V_Saggiomo @Chemistry_Kat So glad you said it, I was itching at the keyboard! ;-) I'm trying to control myself in that way, though!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 20:10:55	There are some things that can only be said properly by a bunch of people dressed as monsters playing amazing comedy thrash death metal etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 20:09:49	The last tweet is dedicated to the government. It's okay, it doesn't really matter which one.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 19:00:32	@rhysmorgan Incidentally will you be doing The Queueing of The Privileged for the 5s in a week or so? I am tempted.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:57:55	@thisisamy_ @AllyFogg If I didn't know what friends and colleagues have been through, my jaw would have dropped. My ears are steaming though
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:51:42	@jailawrites NEVER mess with a uterus. Life lesson.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:51:26	@jailawrites I have a slight cough and am being {jazz hands} DRAHMAHTIC! I am afriad of your uterus of power and thus capitulate entirely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:50:39	@Independent What for? Not enough copies of the Qu'ran? Presuming this is the Southern USA of course.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:48:48	@jailawrites YOU ARE A WOMAN SPEAKING WITHOUT PERMISSION AND POSSIBLY AN AMERICAN! THIS WILL NOT DO! Prepare for Regime Change!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:40:31	@spaceygirl1602 Smart move, it's a gimmick anyway. I'll send the good stuff. Shingles demands nothing less.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:40:04	@jearle True true. Was it the hearts of newborn babes she required or just blood? I'm never sure.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:28:15	@jearle Tsk. Such poor taste. {Wanders off singing "Ding Dong..."} ;-) (Actually there's things to admire about the late Thatch. Erm....)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:22:09	@BipolarBlogger Yeah it seems that's the really controversial one of late. {Near fatal eyeroll at misogynists}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:21:39	@caitlinmoran I also stood by with a great deal of sympathy. And a little bit of joy that I did not have to put up with such things as a boy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:21:00	@caitlinmoran Indeed. My wife went through shops mail order companies the works trying to get good boots. I stood by amazed, uncomprehending
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:19:54	@spaceygirl1602 Tequila on the way. Tourist worm or no worm?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:19:37	@spaceygirl1602 Nothing if not a thorough piss taker my wife! No sympathy! As it should be. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:19:12	@spaceygirl1602 I still get a bit of neuropathic pain where the shingles were. A band around my chest my wife calls the bra area. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:17:59	@BipolarBlogger It was the "women are people" thing that tipped it over the edge wasn't it? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:17:38	@spaceygirl1602 Alcohol will be sent, four year old retained. Preferences? I have a rather good rum in. It doesn't go too well with lemsip
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:16:21	@jearle being made a DM hate figure would be hilarious. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:16:01	@jearle ENVY! I aspire to such lofty heights. Especially as my parents read the DM (and believe it....shudder). Love them though I do 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:15:23	Have I sufficiently pissed anyone off with my controversial views yet?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:14:54	Also, trans* people get to define their sex/gender/sexuality, we cis folk don't. TERFs can fuck off. Being mean to disabled folk is hideous
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:13:23	@jearle Disagreeing with Davey Boy Cameron isn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:13:08	@spaceygirl1602 I've had shingles, no trade. I do however offer you my most profound sympathies. Shingles is a nightmare.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:12:29	I also think women are people deserving of full equality and such like. Oh and can bigots just get over the gay thing now?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:11:48	@jearle Hmmmm Possibly. But I'm very sincere. Does that count for me?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:11:14	Also, this Tory led govt is absolutely wrecking the nation, just like the last Tory led govt, i.e. NuLab.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:10:23	Therefore I am about to court major controversy on Twitter. Although I am no musician, I don't think One Direction are very good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:09:28	I am confined to my domecile by virtue of not infecting 48% of the pop., and by a 4 year old boy who is too naughty for school (also ill).
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:08:27	I am dying from ENT infections plus lung cancer and throat AIDS. Or "Man Flu" as some unsympathetic people call it. I.e. a slight cough.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:04:34	@rhysmorgan Goddamn I am happy we crossed wires on this because I found out about the spinoff.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 18:02:17	@rhysmorgan ARE YOU SERIOUS!? {Faints dead from the awesome of this}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 17:50:25	@rhysmorgan Ah in that case, very reasonable. It was a good episode wasn't it? Or not finished yet? In which case I will shut the hell up.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 17:48:32	@rhysmorgan Has sir just had a special Gentleman's Sex Wee?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 17:44:31	@PencilBloke @zeno001 Why it's as if, when given absolute power to snoop, it corrupts people or something. Hmm there should be a saying.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 17:39:42	@tessakendall @mjrobbins I buy both of those. And on THAT mental image, I wish you both happy trips to the loo to vomit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 17:22:33	@OwenJones84 Missed headline: Thatcher not egregiously wrong about something shocker!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:35:36	@hotpatooties That said, some "celebrities" (a word I don't like!) will just BE role models. Like you for example.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:34:56	@hotpatooties No. Nor male ones. But tragically the haters will always use the role model excuse to attack people.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:34:12	@mistressmatisse labour, the more submissive (potentially) the act. I guess my naivety shines trhough eh? 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:33:39	@mistressmatisse Is the lack of desire for unsexy labour the point where the D/s fantasy dies? I'd have thought the less sexy the 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:15:10	@mistressmatisse Ah they’ll clean your feet but not the toilet. Well I learned something today! And yes, you’re right, hiring is cleaner :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:11:14	@Xanthe_Cat Damn! I wanted rid of them! Back to exercise! Anyway, the shoulder and ear, both friendly, are always there if needed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:10:01	@mistressmatisse oh that’s tragic! I know little of the D/s world but I would guess you get (inappropriate?) offers all the time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:08:58	@mistressmatisse Ah. I’ve only heard you speak on the Savage Lovecast, so finding you’re an introvert is a surprise. Understandable reaction
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:07:20	@Xanthe_Cat failing that, I’ll just offer you my sympathies, a shoulder, an ear, and pretend I understand.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:06:42	@Xanthe_Cat Strangely, being a chubby bloke, I have relative joy about my genitals and despair about my boobs. I’ll mail you the boobs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:05:01	@mjrobbins @rhysmorgan he’s right. Sometime within the next two centuries your chance of death is almost certainly 100%.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:03:40	@AdamWagner1 UN inspector foreign? Check. Could this lower house prices? Probably. Does it stop vilification of poor? Check. Mail gold. Sigh
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:01:29	@mistressmatisse I’d volunteer but not my bag, enough trouble with own toilet, and commute from UK a bit onerous. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 16:00:46	@mistressmatisse Internationally famous Dom and sex genius like you has no cleaning staff? Damn this economic downturn is harsh. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 15:59:10	@noodlemaz Scurry! Scurry!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 15:58:48	@bobbyllew It’s like no potential UK govt, especially the one we have, has heard of Keynes (John Maynard, not Milton)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 15:57:34	@MitchBenn Seconded entirely. Beliefs by definition derive from faith, faith by definition is a knowledge claim made in absence of evidence
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 15:56:20	Right, I am determined to court controversy today. That person you like? Yeah, they did something I consider feeble. Take that!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 06:41:49	@boobygraffoe How dare you! My mother was a saint!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 06:40:28	@Rog_w @NickDoody That’s scarier, I mean Jacko…think of the children….ALLEGEDLY.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 06:37:02	@daraobriain @edyong209 @AdamRutherford I was thinking along those lines
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 06:33:55	@Rog_w @NickDoody It isn’t normally?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 06:32:10	@there_runsMary Now THAT is a good idea. I confess I followed Delia to the letter. One does not deviate from Delia.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 05:16:54	I made perfect, and I do mean PERFECT, crunchy roast potatoes today. Goose fat and everything. It is not often a simple thing goes so well.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 05:10:59	@AdamRutherford You seem to have been hacked, for this is almost certainly bollocks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 04:31:42	@bobbyllew @DannyJohnJules Steady the old chap? That sounds rather like what you've been doing re: warming the hand...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 00:16:33	@sousan50 Do not blame yourself for me being a dumbass!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 00:08:50	@sousan50 What have I...or rather...haven't I done?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-12 00:03:15	@sousan50 Not a stalker? Damn! I thought I'd already made the big time and could retire before starting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 23:59:42	@sousan50 And the account number to where I send the cash for that outrageous flattery would be...? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 23:57:45	@sazza_jay @MuuPuklip @jearle @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 Hence my use of the word relatviely. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:58:42	@jearle @MuuPuklip @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 Ya. A great president, distracts loads of people, but not the froodiest. Hmmm parallels? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:52:15	@rbhu7 META!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:49:01	@MuuPuklip @jearle @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 Which is luckily what I do!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:45:04	@MuuPuklip @jearle @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 After all, he's right about so very much, it's just a few things he seems to havea blind spot for
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:44:33	@MuuPuklip @jearle @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 a) "both sides" are rarely if ever equal, and b) which specific Dawkinsian substance?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:34:51	@danaequality Anything that upsets TERFs is good, and I can still see you, so that makes me happy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:34:30	@MuuPuklip @jearle @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 I am a Dawkins fan which is why his relatviely recent descent into apparent bigotry is so annoying
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:29:13	And the question of doing so pseudonymously or openly arises if I do it. Do I risk everything from a vulnerable position, or do I brave it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:28:14	The more I think about it, the more blogging/trying to do writing on the side becomes attractive. I'm utterly delusional aren't I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:23:55	@jearle @AllyFogg @MuuPuklip @OwenJones84 I suspect the latter absence is due to us using words longer than two syllables. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:23:17	@jearle @AllyFogg @MuuPuklip @OwenJones84 Tragically we have yet to have a Determined Dawkinsian or any One Directioners. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:22:29	@MuuPuklip @AllyFogg @jearle @OwenJones84 Always happy for links to anything I might have missed though. I try to read broadly
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:21:55	@MuuPuklip @AllyFogg @jearle @OwenJones84 A couple. Agreeing that Pilger's journalism is more impressive than the Mail's =/= total agreement
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:14:30	@balkissoon @Crommunist Along with basically, literally, major, epic, legend, hero, awesome...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:13:20	@jearle @AllyFogg @MuuPuklip @OwenJones84 You also get a special pen with our logo on it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:12:20	@AllyFogg @MuuPuklip @jearle @OwenJones84 And what sane person does not prefer Pilger to the Mail? Rapiness and Wikileaks stuff = unrelated
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 22:10:02	@jearle @MuuPuklip @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 If due process is for immoral law/regime, dodging = good. Pretty sure that does not include rape
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 21:56:37	@cosmicgenome Then at least you can reject me on my merits! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 21:55:29	@cosmicgenome I'll get writing, then send you something concrete/serious as opposed to Twitter comedy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 21:54:40	@Rethink_ Impressively scary use of spectacles. Go team!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 21:53:49	@sazza_jay @jearle @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 Luckily that is a physical impossibility.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 21:53:29	@jearle @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 Very true, and of course, whilst I support the alleged victims Mr Assange has yet to be convicted of anything
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 21:52:52	@cosmicgenome Which is my way of saying I am seriously glad you have someone lined up. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 21:52:25	@cosmicgenome {Points vigorously at profile} Ahem, we non famous scientists are underrepresented. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 21:51:52	@jearle @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 That's about the size of it, although "a bit rapey" is an understatement of how odious I find that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 21:51:24	@sazza_jay @jearle @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 2) Does this make me the most controversial person on Twitter
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 21:50:51	@jearle @AllyFogg @OwenJones84 1) I am not a fan of One Direction, am annoyed with Dawkins' Descent, and think Assange did some good and bad
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 21:08:35	@cosmicgenome Organic and medicinal chemistry. So many myths, poor PR, lots of good work to do here.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 06:51:07	@robinince It’s the traitor brain for me every time. I’ve even tried sex, alone and with someone else. No dice.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 04:31:50	@hotpatooties Never leave the chorizo. For it is wonderful.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 04:29:45	@george_chuter Did Jordan Crane ever get his bunny back?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 03:46:12	@bmagnanti I confess I am still shy about asking people, but I am serious!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 03:45:45	@bmagnanti Sceptics groups? Hmmm, do you do tours and talks? (I ask because I'm in the process of setting up a sceptics in the pub)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 02:03:29	@rhysmorgan But can we send them to the NSA etc ourselves, just to save time. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-11 01:21:32	@gogreen18 AND YOU ARE NOT MARRIED?!?!?!?! Oh wait….that’s not a big deal. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 06:54:45	@tkingdoll Not an inbetweeners fan, eh? Spiceworld? St Trinians? Oooh Ishtar! A.I.?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 06:49:46	@markthomasinfo I a, going to try to make that 9. Or maybe 8.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 06:47:25	@judeinlondon I was spectacularly naive…and 11. I knew what oral sex was too (sex ed from older kids) but the connection wasn’t made.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 06:43:10	@tkingdoll Awww horror alone is great. Except The Exorcist. That film messes me up. I am terrified of ~12 year old girls.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 06:41:54	@DStrugg I’m obviously following the right people, you’re not drowned on my TL. ;-) #IGetSomethingRightByAccident
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 06:40:03	@judeinlondon Could be worse, I thought blow jobs were something done with a hair dryer. Wasn’t sure how willies were involved.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 06:37:34	@rhysmorgan Yeah! I’ve been upgrading on the S, they seem to figure the kinks out by then. Plus over 2 yrs it’s cheaper.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 06:35:26	@rhysmorgan Ah well, renewal/upgrade day for me is 14th, I can wait 6 days….maybe.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 06:34:03	@rhysmorgan Are we getting the 5s tomorrow too?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 06:32:52	@garwboy I can’t remember who, but some genius (not me) said it was nerd blackface. A very terrifying comparison. Laughing at, not with.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 04:04:12	@BipolarBlogger Luckily I knew the names of all my sprouts personally! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 04:03:36	@BipolarBlogger Yeah wind down for me too. Have a nice night.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 04:03:15	@BipolarBlogger No evidence an organic sprout (or whatever) has any merits a "normal" sprout hasn't.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 04:02:36	@BipolarBlogger Yup. Also, as I implied, a huge whack of it is drivel. Designed purely for social hierarchy and privilege ostentation.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 04:00:18	@BipolarBlogger The idea that 1 McDs is some sort of nutritional nuke is bonkers. Totally counterfactual.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:59:45	@BipolarBlogger Also, esp with young kids, diet is balanced across the WEEK. Eventually you just have to feed the little git SOMETHING!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:55:47	@BipolarBlogger Oh agreed. Extreme parenting are the right words for it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:51:53	@BipolarBlogger Yeah. Some anxiety can be healthy, but it doesn't take much to get out of hand.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:51:23	@BipolarBlogger ...go wrong. The path we all walk is surprisingly narrow.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:50:38	@BipolarBlogger What good mum ISN'T a bundle of nerves about all that? ;-) Okay so I'm a dad, but I know how easy it is for something to...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:49:52	@BipolarBlogger Oh wow, that's a harsh reality to cope with.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:49:33	@BipolarBlogger I get it, {hugs} if you want them. My son just started primary and I am watching for any sign of anything. (Unrealistic!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:48:08	@BipolarBlogger Oh hell, I can imagine that destroys you. My son is 4, so I hope that when I was bad, >1 year ago, he was too young to see
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:46:11	@BipolarBlogger It's okay, he was pretty young, so I think he survived okay. I am trying to make up for it now I'm well.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:44:42	@BipolarBlogger I have a tendency towards comic understatement. Self deprecation etc. I was in a similar boat re: childcare.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:30:20	@Crommunist Awwwwww yeah, well within the first standard deviation, baby.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:28:53	@BipolarBlogger I get you there. I wish I'd been less depressed during my kid's early years, I wasn't fun daddy. But I can do things now
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:27:07	@kausikdatta22 Their music is too loud and they have long hair. In my day... {blah drone waffle}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:25:51	@AmandaMarcotte The fact that it was an all human and not yoghurt jury that let Zimmerman go is pretty hard too!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:25:11	@bmagnanti I have to ask, your number of tweets goes down occasionally. Is there some clever reason for this I have missed? Privacy etc?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:24:31	@kausikdatta22 I know it's just my brain playing tricks on me. But I do want those kids off my lawn
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:24:08	@BipolarBlogger 2 lovely kids is a wonderful outcome from bad decisions. I have similar feelings, mistakes led me here which is pretty great
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:18:27	@BipolarBlogger {Cough} No comment, Your Honour. Nothing similar happened here...oh look what's that over there? A distraction! {hides}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:15:52	George Zimmerman, apparently a violent shtbag. Who knew? [Does this need a sarcasm tag? I'll put one on there but I'll think less of you]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 03:14:43	I'm going to say it: I'm nearly 39 and I feel like my life is over. Traitor brain. Can I be 17 again with my 38 year old knowledge please?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 02:55:56	@JeremyJHardy Oh you just HAD to tell us how it was going to turn out didn't you? I was looking forward to liberation and glittering prizes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 02:47:53	@mjrobbins Everyone on the internet is the same person. Surely you know this. It's all a conspiracy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 00:32:07	@TeleWonderWomen @jojosams @bmagnanti I hope so! At least finding trousers that fit will be easier.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-10 00:26:59	@stavvers Not a Bindel fan?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 22:14:12	@mrjamesob Oh James! That would be nuanced reporting. Why do that when a good antiBeeb witchhunt is in the offing?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 22:12:58	@bmagnanti Wow! That's...{tries to think of phrase without the word fucking in it}..."interesting". I think you can parse my meaning! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 22:11:24	@rbhu7 If I were not married to the most understanding human ever. My wife deserves some large medals. Preferably expensive!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 22:10:43	@rbhu7 I'm lucky lad, I don't have to rely on benefits, have savings etc, back in work. Sheer luck, not virtue. I'd be on the streets 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 22:09:30	@bmagnanti It hasn't caused enough outrage/page views/comments?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 22:07:37	@rbhu7 But of course the suspicion and rhetoric is all about "scroungers". MH stigma is rife, and people with MH issues are easy targets
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 22:06:55	@rbhu7 So far the reviews, all medically detailed btw, have all come back favourable. I.e. The people really are ill enough to need support.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 22:06:15	@rbhu7 And a number of people who have had their benefits stopped/curbed for 6 months, forced to live on a pittance until review comes back
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 22:05:33	@rbhu7 I know of at least two attempted suicides (I suspect a third), and the triggering (i.e. causing swing to depression) of a dozen or so
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 21:58:30	@rbhu7 Yup I go to/volunteer with a local mental health group for people with bipolar disorder. The stress ATOS put them under is horrendous
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 21:57:30	@rbhu7 And we're on lube before tea on Monday. It'll be santorum by Thursday and Dirty Sanchez by home time Friday. You mark my words.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 21:56:28	@rbhu7 Stuck? IMPRESSIVE! Also, I feel lube would have helped these people avoid the issue entirely. Lube, people, I cannot rate it enough.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 21:55:34	@ajhmurray I did the same thing last week for home and car. It makes me suspiciously happy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 21:52:22	@rbhu7 Oh come now, the posh just use a better class of cucimber from an organic farm where they know the name of the farmer.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 21:50:58	@rbhu7 Did you have an A&E "Bum Box" for items extracted from peopls' bottoms? If not, I have stories!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 21:48:49	@rbhu7 Excuses excuses. Let me guess, drunk, traffic cone up arse, regrettable tattoo, trophy kebab, handcuffed to goat. Wait...that was me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 21:45:58	@rbhu7 I've had Mondays like that. Okay not for a while I'm an upstanding member of society now dontcherknow. (Hopes noone I know sees that)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 20:59:26	@BipolarBlogger No worries. It's Monday, and thus early in the week for near fatal eyerolling in my experience! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 19:23:08	@BipolarBlogger Are you okay? Tragedy + MH stigma/bigotry is a “joyous” combination.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 19:21:35	@hshldsvt @stavvers It is a standard move. Like a basic opening in a game of insult chess. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-09 19:05:58	@hshldsvt @stavvers Lose the “no offence”. It’s the most offensive bit. Possibly go with “Dear Shitforbrans”.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 16:43:52	@damianobroin @CCriadoPerez If anything it’s a very generous response!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 16:43:21	@jembloomfield @Maoze775 @sykopaul @CCriadoPerez @PrimlyStable It’s hardly “judgement” to describe an observable action.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 08:09:42	@thereisnoproof FFS you DO have to. Your inability to reason is not binding. Any data to back up that 99.99% claim? Thought not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 08:08:50	@thereisnoproof You truly are as unintelligent and inept as you appear aren’t you? Thought you were trolling but you really are just stupid
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 08:07:24	@thereisnoproof I’m thick yet you’re the one using something as an insult and saying there’s nothing bad about it. Not much of insult. Think
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 08:05:58	@pzmyers @Crommunist @Matt_Dillahunty So e forms of evolution should be nipped in the bud. Cricket is far superior.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 08:05:08	@thereisnoproof You’re not really making your case are you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 08:04:56	@thereisnoproof Also, what’s the relationship between mental illness and intellect? Many very intelligent people have mental illnesses.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 08:04:13	@thereisnoproof I realise it’s an insult. Insult implies negative qualities, so answer the question, what’s bad about mental illness?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:59:37	@thereisnoproof So answer the question if you can. I suspect you can’t though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:57:30	@thereisnoproof My bad it was a typo, meant to write “then”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:56:50	@thereisnoproof No, not really. I have nothing against it though. Seems like a reasonable set of ideas. Why is that relevant?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:55:53	@thereisnoproof Great. Glad to read it. Ben why use mental as an insult? Or being in an asylum? Because that is what you did.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:55:12	@ool0n @thereisnoproof If that’s a troll it’s the weakest troll I’ve seen ever. Creationists have done better.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:52:17	@thereisnoproof And if you’ve answered me, what is wrong with being mentally ill? I missed it the first time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:51:44	@thereisnoproof I’m not offended, I’m curious. Hence why I am asking questions not running around. Or whatever people do when offended
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:47:33	@ool0n @thereisnoproof I’d reevaluate your assessment there, old bean.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:46:48	@thereisnoproof I know what google says. I’ve asked you a very simple question, you have been abusive and silly about it. Can’t you answer?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:44:46	@thereisnoproof Humorless? Hahaha, oh you really do know nothing. So the simple outcome is you can’t answer the question. Fair enough.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:43:59	@ool0n [Southern USA Lady] why bless his heart![/Southern USA Lady]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:42:47	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton @there_runsMary It does…DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT’S IN THE INK!!111!1!1!1!1!1
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:42:09	@thereisnoproof Also you keep saying politically correct. What does that even mean?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:41:50	@ool0n they are trying to wriggle out of using mental as a slur implying mental illness is somehow bad with me. Pathetic doesn’t describe it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:41:02	@thereisnoproof I am seriously suggesting that you are using the state of being mentally ill as an insult. Why? Can’t you parse that?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:38:24	@stuxnetsource WAIT! That am very complicumacated. Run that by my again!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:37:52	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton @there_runsMary I confess I am surprised the Mail doesn’t die of confusion based on its coverage of cancer alone.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:35:54	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton @there_runsMary Ah bellies. ADVANCED foreign policy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:35:31	@thereisnoproof You’ve told me what is so bad about being mentally ill it’s worthy of use as an insult?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:35:02	@ool0n You amaze me, such kindness after all this interaction with drivellers. Well done, sir! I am far from that nice!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:33:31	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 @there_runsMary These things are related to my interests!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:32:35	@thereisnoproof Banter? Not saving the world. Just asking you a question, hardly my fault you’re incapable of answering.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:32:00	@ool0n Oh that’s far too kind. Wilfully implies will which implies mind. I’m thinking…not so much. Just a raddled spine and keyboard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:30:04	@thereisnoproof So you can’t answer the question? Okay. No worries. Have a nice night.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:29:24	@ool0n I have that person on my timeline now. If I were to be cruel I would surmise they are not amply blessed with intellectual gifts.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:27:42	@thereisnoproof mental illness as an insult, hence saying mental illness is bad in some way, negative. I am asking you why that is 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:26:36	@thereisnoproof Okay, this is pretty simple, you are trying to insult oolon and indeed myself, by calling us mental. That’s using mental 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:25:20	@ool0n @thereisnoproof @Martiabernathey It’s clearly very hard for this person to converse like an adult. Even when dealt with politely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:24:43	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 @there_runsMary Nooooo! I mistyped. It was meant to say *I* went with the wrong call!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:23:42	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton @there_runsMary Oh now if THAT worked…. {drifts off into blissful anti-Mail reverie}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:22:40	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 @there_runsMary Dang! Went with the wrong call!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:22:23	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton @there_runsMary It’s midnight on Twitter, go with disappointed for laughs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:21:54	@thereisnoproof I’m just asking you a question. What’s your reason for using mental illness as an insult? I genuinely don’t see the problem
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:19:51	@thereisnoproof @ool0n @Martiabernathey I confess I’m not seeing the problem you have with the mentally ill. What’s the drama about?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:19:21	@thereisnoproof @ool0n @Martiabernathey What’s wrong with being a loony or a nutter, presuming again you mean having a mental illness?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:17:29	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 @there_runsMary A likely tale.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:17:19	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 @there_runsMary {gasp} SEXUAL OBJECTIFICATION!! Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:16:29	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton @there_runsMary Too long as a prop, thighs like tree trunks mixed race too though. We shall annoy the Mail together!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:15:13	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 @there_runsMary Hmmm dunno, Scottish people are a drain on Home Counties taxes, right? Or do you lower house prices?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:14:02	@ool0n @thereisnoproof @Martiabernathey mentally ill or in an asylum? 1 in 4 people will suffer a mental illness at some point. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:13:09	@ool0n @thereisnoproof @Martiabernathey Hi Border Atheist. You used “mental” and being in an asylum as insults. What’s wrong with being 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:11:14	@johannahamilton @rbhu7 @there_runsMary Foreigners or people with bad thighs? Shit I’M both! I just have to write to the Mail about myself
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:06:58	@rbhu7 @johannahamilton @there_runsMary Well it is true. Foreign people are far away, but ugly thighs…EVERYWHERE!!!!!11111!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:05:31	@johannahamilton @ActivistAtheist Eurgh, the wriggling annoys me, how you cope with it from these arseholes I’ll never know.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:04:50	@johannahamilton @ActivistAtheist As if a particular rape wasn’t “rapey” enough for them. As if they are the judge of someone’s rape 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 07:03:06	@johannahamilton @ActivistAtheist What terrifies me are the damned excuses. The grey areas some people look for around rape. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 06:31:01	@ActivistAtheist Maybe I’m jaded, but given a few high profile cases of late, I’m thinking consent is a hard concept for many.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 06:27:15	@ActivistAtheist Or alternatively, be an intelligent woman with a very, very slightly non-mainstream opinion in the public eye. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 06:25:34	@johannahamilton @there_runsMary @rbhu7 But did you see the thighs on {Insert celebrity here}? In other news, millions of foreigners died.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 06:22:32	@mitchhedbot @mrTonyLaw Think yourself lucky, there’s a stairlift in my old mum’s house.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 06:18:30	@there_runsMary @johannahamilton @rbhu7 Oh great, give me standards to live up to. ;-) {Slyly puts down copies of the Daily Mail and Nuts}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-06 02:56:33	Okay, leaving the "keep me logged in" box unchecked on http:// JustEat.co.uk is not going to make me thinner. CURSE YOU TRAITOR BRAIN!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-04 05:38:30	The “poor people with big TVs” meme is an excellent litmus test for clueless morons. I realise this is not news, per se. I’m just bored.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-03 02:14:13	@hoperiffic Ahh of course. I never was very good with my taxonomy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-03 02:13:36	@hoperiffic Might I say "likewise"? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-03 02:12:59	@hoperiffic You going to forgive me any time soon?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-02 06:59:40	@WowbaggerOM It’s like their agenda is not honest or something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-02 06:59:27	@WowbaggerOM ah but PZ has yet to comment or correct, so the slyme will claim victory on the basis that he is evil that way, surely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-02 06:57:44	@Puffles2010 Hello! I’ve missed this, chemical exports? Have you got a link to the manifest, or what have you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-02 06:36:25	@RespectSexWork @WilsonKM2 I know! I know! Because I need something to fertilise the soil in my garden with. Let’s face it, they talk shit.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-02 06:30:48	@MitchBenn Unless you have very acrobatic close friends.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-02 06:29:17	@boobygraffoe Very good. Now I’ve logged into twitter, gone back and read it. Definitely my joke of today.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-02 06:27:20	@MitchBenn Where do you get your suits made? Presuming of course this is what you plan to do with that…

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-02 01:57:24	@MelodyHensley @rebeccawatson @skepchicks Sorry been out all day. And I KNOW you folk are not harmless. I meant harmless in a very nice way

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 22:56:38	@rebeccawatson Ah, read it now. That’s plain and simple bullshit. If it’s not a prewritten requirement you have grounds IMO.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 22:54:47	@MelodyHensley @rebeccawatson @skepchicks okay stabbing wtf? Also kicked YOU out? You ladies are wonderful and harmless, why do that?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 22:46:45	@bmagnanti I see all the parallels. It’s silencing, tone policing, patronising crap. I’d expect feminists of anyone to know better.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 06:41:18	@CCriadoPerez Should I ironically RT that?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 03:29:13	@LegendaryFop Enjoy! I am a cantakerous old git who's had a gutsful of assorted misogynists. If they don't "get it" early on, it's bin time

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:26:28	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers 3) You can inform yourself or not, but I am done with you and your red herrings/straw men. Third strike. Bye bye.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:25:33	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers 2)..people than me. Your bringing these red herrings up means you haven't read/understood them. Nothing to do with PZ.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:25:04	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers 1) Okay, 3 incoming tweets then that's it: Police/law arguments have been had elsewhere by more qualified informed...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:22:05	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers No you are uninformed because you don't know why or how these arguments have progressed. That's the issue.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:21:21	@TheLewisBlack Happy Birthday, Lewis. Is it worrying that your comedy is my internal monologue?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:20:33	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers And I'll say "Bye" 2nd time. Not really interested in bandying words with illinformed whingers. Need this clearer?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:19:41	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers Straw man. And pathetic. Some Yewtree convictions originated as anonymous accusation. That's the analogous part.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:18:40	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers Disagreement does not mean uninformed, true. NATURE of disagreement, however, does. Clear enough for you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:11:12	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers It might help you if you minimally inform yourself about an issue before discussing it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:10:50	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers Anyway, since you have answerd my question of "reading or twitter whinging" by continuing to whinge I'll say bye.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:10:08	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers That is bullshit. And especially as you claim to know about Op Yewtree, you should know why it's bullshit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:04:42	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers I'll ask again, what are you interested in? Truth/whinging on Twitter? Effort put into latter needs to be redirected
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:03:43	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers Others vastly more legally informed than I (for example people at Popehat) have discussed this at length 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 02:03:04	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers Who said anything about someone saying they were going to win? You're drivelling. Like I said, go and read. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:56:35	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers HAHA! That is staggeringly naive! And also staggeringly oversimplified. Like I said, 140 ch cannot do justice, go read
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:55:23	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers You can either inform yourself about it or continue to demand others do it for you. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:54:54	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers My point is that the argument around "nothing credible" and "why not call the police" has been had at length. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:54:23	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers As for reading, there have been extensive discussions, Pharyngula is but one place. http:// freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/201 3/08/08/what-do-you-do-when-someone-pulls-the-pin-and-hands-you-a-grenade/ …
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:52:14	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers That's a bit...naive. Lawyers get paid, win or lose. (and I know you meant PZ)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:41:23	@CrankyStudent @docfreeride @studentactivism Exactly. In the good old days, teaching was a damn fine excuse to be evil and say no a lot. ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:36:08	@docfreeride @studentactivism I'm finding it hard to figure out why "DO NOT FUCK THE STUDENTS EVEN IF YOU REALLY WANT TO!" is not rule 1.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:33:04	@BipolarBlogger I'll read it after I cook the family dinner, a man's work is never done {theatrical fake sigh} ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:30:38	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers You could spend your time informing yourself. I wonder why you don't.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:30:05	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers Now, what interests you? The truth? Or being a bit of a sulky knobend on twitter? Bcoz those threads are there to read
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:29:20	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers Oh and FYI I know about McAlpine case I also know about Operation Yewtree. Perhaps you're not as informed as you think
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:28:33	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers is accept the null hypothesis. Which is very different from defending PZ. Mind you on this, I DO defend PZ. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:27:46	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers PZ has details I do not. He thinks the claim reliable. I can't make that judgement for him. What I CAN and DO do 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:27:00	@BipolarBlogger Oops missed the reference. It's just a dx that's been used for "uncooperative women" before now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:23:36	@BipolarBlogger It not I
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:23:18	@BipolarBlogger I can be a catch all diagnosis, and a bit troublesome. Very controversial usage IIRC.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:22:53	@BipolarBlogger Which is superb. As an aside have you ever had a dx of borderline personality disorder floated your way?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:20:55	@BipolarBlogger Yeah, BP drugs (mostly) just not good for foetus. Very dangerous time for BP mums. Did you have post partum psychosis?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:20:03	@BipolarBlogger I don't advocate running btw. But I do understand the mindset
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:19:34	@BipolarBlogger Ah, my bad, got the wrong end of stick from your tweet. It is pretty heavy duty. I don't blame people for running tbh.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:14:28	@BipolarBlogger And last 4 yrs have been focussed on getting well. It's a bit of a bugger though isn't it? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:14:08	@BipolarBlogger "correct" diagnosis. Didn't have same problem re: running from dx but then I had advantage of working in field. I kinda knew
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:13:23	@BipolarBlogger Misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, took about 5 years of different treatments (see: faile treatments) to get...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:12:42	@BipolarBlogger ...well with life etc, until ~ 30 when massive high became massive low, finally owned up to something be wrong, went to Dr.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:12:01	@BipolarBlogger Definitely more highs on and off until ~22 when had 1st massive low. Untreated because I was in total denial. Did pretty...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:11:08	@BipolarBlogger Interesting, not a million miles apart, well apart from babies! Those I cannot manage alone! ;-) Definitely symptomatic ~14.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:09:55	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers I think 140 chars too little to discuss complex issue. I've not made any claim re: Shermer so you are imagining things
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:06:35	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers Or that we hold positions you attribute to us, as opposed to our actual positions. Not interested in those games. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:06:05	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers You seem to be under the impression I, or someone else, am here to do your homework for you. Not the case. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:05:41	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers I believe this has been explained at length on Pharyngula in the relevant threads a few times, why not read them?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:04:56	@MrAtheistPants @Jepenceplus @pzmyers Smart move!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:03:28	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers @MrAtheistPants tough to get in 140 chars! But then I'm not jumping up and down and making non-provisional claim 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:02:32	@Jepenceplus @pzmyers @MrAtheistPants Me? Not personally, no. PZ has. As an outsider I have the null hypothesis. Which is going to be 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 01:01:24	@BipolarBlogger I'm a late comer, diagnosed in 2008 (at 34). Obviously some of the chaos prediagnosis now "explained". How long for you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:57:10	@BipolarBlogger Ha! Seconded for the pair of us...and everyone else as it happens!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:54:08	@SpokesGay I’m guessing that’s a good bit of the problem, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:53:51	@SpokesGay I’ll go look, I can definitely appreciate he has a powerful influence and it’d be nice to have more variety with such a profile
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:52:31	@BipolarBlogger Something better blooming well had! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:51:36	@SpokesGay Not a fan, eh?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:51:24	@BipolarBlogger Yes indeed. I’m finding that now as I am on the upper end of recovery I have the ability to put in much needed work too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:49:26	@SpokesGay What’s he done now?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:47:32	@BipolarBlogger I find inculcating a mindfulness habit tough, but it’s a hallmark of good health when I do. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:46:44	@BipolarBlogger done a bit of MBCT, not years yet sadly! Been doing general mindfulness for ~1yr, and DBT with mindfulness for ~ 2yrs. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:45:04	@SpokesGay @pzmyers @MrAtheistPants @Jepenceplus {GASP} OPPRESSION!!!!! ZOMG FTB THOUGHT POLICE!!! Or, you know, not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:43:22	@pzmyers @Jepenceplus @MrAtheistPants I’ve managed it for 38 years. It’s easy. I don’t even save to use blockbot! ;-) 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:42:08	@pzmyers @Jepenceplus @MrAtheistPants it’s simple, don’t rape, thus not a rapist. Don’t apologise for rapists, thus not a rape apologist 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-09-01 00:41:01	@BipolarBlogger I’m trying this mindful eating approach too. As you say, it’s hard. The self kindness is my stumbling block too
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:55:34	@martin_crowson Does it look like another concussion/ similar injury? Articles don’t say.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:41:19	@LeonLloyd13 DO IT!!!! You’ve probably lost a yard or two of pace since leaving Tigers, this could help with that! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:39:24	@Cliterati1 @HuffPostWomen Which of course we cannot have! Is that enough anti misogyny snark for now? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:38:48	@Cliterati1 @HuffPostWomen Damn, read the article now. And it’s sensible. With things like. This, wonder and joy might break out globally.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:36:50	@davcomcj @pzmyers @Xanthe_Cat @rebeccawatson @JamesMcCain7 Could be oil, weapons and palace ensconced scrounges… ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:35:54	@Cliterati1 @HuffPostWomen {does not read article} ooh ohh lemme guess, it’s not real, hard to find and women can’t orgasm all at same time?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:33:58	@danaequality @The_Block_Bot Well, in these fraught days of the interwebs, best to be clear! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:33:18	@SpokesGay @Xanthe_Cat @stavvers I think you’re right.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:32:19	@Xanthe_Cat @stavvers I’ve met non-TERF rad fems. I’m sure I have. I’m relatively sure I wasn’t hallucinating…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:31:09	@danaequality @The_Block_Bot Bye t o them, of course, not you. Just to make clear!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:30:49	@danaequality I don’t use it (yet?) because I have not yet found a need. I’m 99.99% sure none of my friends are TERFs, and if they were…BYE!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:29:32	@martin_crowson Given T Youngs off and Floody off for nasty tackles, mass subs looks like an insurance policy for top players.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:28:27	@stavvers And yeah, she’s the one I was thinking of. Some rad fems scare the bejeezus outta me. Can’t imagine what it’s like for trans* folk
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:26:50	@stavvers Thanks!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:25:37	@Doubting_Tom @SpokesGay @aratina @jaythenerdkid @ool0n No, I say, no shit, son! [\Foghorn Leghorn]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:24:46	@stavvers I have confess there are so many different types of feminist on Twitter it makes life fun for a n00b like me. Brennan = TERF? IIRC
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:22:57	@pzmyers @Crommunist @Doubting_Tom @rebeccawatson @vexorian0 Can you count to three and wrangle groupes?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:21:40	@davcomcj @pzmyers @Xanthe_Cat @rebeccawatson @JamesMcCain7 Think yourself lucky. We kept both royalty and wars.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:21:18	@hyperdeath128k @SpokesGay @rebeccawatson We have something of a cottage industry…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:13:32	@Xanthe_Cat @rebeccawatson @pzmyers @vexorian0 @JamesMcCain7 @SurlyAmy @OpheliaBenson it’s not fair that our opponents are so mockable.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:13:15	@Xanthe_Cat @rebeccawatson @pzmyers @vexorian0 @JamesMcCain7 @SurlyAmy @OpheliaBenson Okay, we’re have way too much fun with this. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:11:57	@rebeccawatson @pzmyers @vexorian0 @JamesMcCain7 @SurlyAmy @OpheliaBenson Typical bloody man hating feminist, stealing a man’s rightful spot
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:11:04	@SpokesGay @hyperdeath128k @rebeccawatson @The_Block_Bot they’re nearly as tasty as Christian babies and the tears of the baby Jesus.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:10:36	@hyperdeath128k @SpokesGay @rebeccawatson @The_Block_Bot …own flag. It’s the same as theirs, just on fire. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:10:11	@hyperdeath128k @SpokesGay @rebeccawatson @The_Block_Bot I do like to explain to my US friends that we, the rest of the world, have our… 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 23:02:30	@SpokesGay @rebeccawatson @JamesMcCain7 But but you were once nice to someone who uses the blockbot therefore you hate America. Or something
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 22:38:51	@pzmyers Aren’t you head of the Evil Atheist Conspiracy? Surely that brings in the big bucks. After all, just think of the puppy revenue.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 20:53:40	@judeinlondon Piss money? That beats the hell out of cystitis for pain I bet. Mind you, at least that way you can afford cranberry juice.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 08:12:50	@CarlieP That was like watching something for the early stages of quadruped evolution. I got shivers. It moved so much like a lizard does.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 07:51:26	@RespectSexWork Don’t commit a mullet, period. It’s a crime against taste, dammit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:31:59	@noodlemaz Picky is good!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:31:10	@MissLaraBelle @RespectSexWork Yay! I’ll tell my mum!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:29:09	@RespectSexWork But seriously, if you’re going to fuck Twitter, wear protection. I’ve got a condom on my mouse.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:28:22	@RespectSexWork I think we cross tweeted! I saw your tweet after mine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:27:46	@MissLaraBelle @RespectSexWork I want that line so much I am going into SW. Do you think fat ex-rugby players have a good market value?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:26:17	@RespectSexWork No. Your Twitter is pregnant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:22:00	@MissLaraBelle @RespectSexWork I AM LEARNING SO MUCH!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:21:39	@RespectSexWork I am contemplating listening to it to write a parody swapping magnets for SWs. Because of your sparkly magnet bits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:20:23	@MissLaraBelle @RespectSexWork The rocks must be a bit of a nightmare though
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:18:43	@RespectSexWork Isn’t over identification by clients a danger for SWs anyway?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:16:54	@RespectSexWork is a line from a song, and it has been much mocked.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:16:31	@RespectSexWork Me neither to be fair, they’re some USA band famed for their ignorance of….everything. “Fucking magnets? How do they work?”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:13:50	@RespectSexWork Sorry I am amused by magical sex workers with their glittering genitals that work like Sirens and drag we poor men to rocks
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 06:12:46	@RespectSexWork You’re magically attractive? You’re like what Insane Clown Posse think magnets are? Fucking Sex Workers? How do they work?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 05:39:58	@Doubting_Tom Take your phone off your balls.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 04:08:28	@DavidFutrelle @MelodyHensley @lousycanuck Pffff! I’ve yet to see an MRA that would recognise satire if it bit him on his under sized gonads
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 04:05:51	@ool0n @EstesTom @aratina So the get the response that was advanced in Arkell vs Pressdram. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 04:05:20	@ool0n @EstesTom @aratina I’m more than happy to be nice to a wandering parson. But the proselytisers have shot their bolt with me. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 04:04:16	@Queen_UK You too, Ma’am? I’m getting nicely stuck into a litre of Bombay Sapphire. What’s your preferred brand, dare I ask?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-31 04:02:54	@ool0n @EstesTom @aratina Does “fuck off” constitute useful advice? I remember T.Estes. His apologetics are weak. Testes by name and output.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 21:19:15	@mePadraigReidy Cricket eh? I’m going to have to find out abut this so I can have an OPINION aren’t I? Unless opinions can be fact free…
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 21:15:48	@mePadraigReidy Erm, who is Dan Hodges? Seriously. I’m relatively sure I don’t know, and thus cannot demonstrate my lack of caring.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 21:12:37	@mathof1 @jobeyG @DeborahJaneOrr Which strikes me as vastly more useful. Prompt military action is not the only solution
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 21:11:58	@mathof1 @jobeyG @DeborahJaneOrr Is it meant to? That’s a new one on me! It is meant to help move already displaced people to safety in part
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 21:10:58	@danaequality I can explain that to you of you’d like… {ducks} I WAS KIDDING!!!!! NOT THE FACE!!!! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 21:10:04	@lousycanuck Anyway, is it worth a response? Or is it obvious drivel?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 21:09:29	@lousycanuck Ah yes, I read that. Sorry, brain needs coffee. I was wondering when someone would misuse it. Should I be happy to be right?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:49:50	@lousycanuck And how did you manage to earn this? Actual rape? Or you, know, just being a bit of a feminist and thus upsetting them?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:49:07	@danaequality And the same would be the case if I had a private jet. Worse ways to spend one’s billions than hugging people in need!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:48:28	@danaequality I can see that going down SPECTACULARLY at work and with my wife. “Where are you going?” “Someone lovely needs a hug. STAT!”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:46:13	@EmmaK67 But you see they were nice, white, us-like people, not nasty brown them-like people. I’m guessing strongly worded missive.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:39:42	@jobeyG I do a good line in abuse if you’re struggling to find someone. I’m just very nice about it after! Like a post coital cig of lovely
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:37:19	@stavvers If you do find out, let me know, I’ll join you in shitting.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:36:40	@jobeyG Careful! Niceness might break out on the web, and we couldn’t have that! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:33:37	@gallagherbren @willcarling Yup, that would be my guess too. And IIRC from his other jobs, JL has that in spades.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:32:58	@willcarling @gallagherbren Although, with the WC in 2015, not too well until after that, eh. I want an England win. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:31:59	@DeborahJaneOrr @jobeyG Me too. 2million refugees need help now, not when the UN decides in X days time. The NGOs can do this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:30:07	@jobeyG @DeborahJaneOrr My ellipsis was meant to signify my thought that such a thing was unlikely. Tragically.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:29:04	@danaequality I know I miles away, anything I can do or say to help? It’s a bit of a commute from the UK though! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:28:25	@danaequality Are you okay NOW?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:27:14	@willcarling @gallagherbren I’ve always had the impression of him that he has a good business/organisational head. I suspect he’ll do good
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:25:30	@DeborahJaneOrr I wonder what a concerted humanitarian push would do via NGOs like MSF etc. a push with the funding a war would have….
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:24:49	@DeborahJaneOrr Oh very much so, and yes, that is the better perspective. I was limiting my comment to UK. But you are right. Bigger problem
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:21:16	@DeborahJaneOrr I think it’s one of these situations where we (UK) are pretty damned whatever we do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:19:58	@danaequality the world needs MORE people like you, not fewer. If you can feel better, please do. You do not deserve to have those thoughts
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:19:14	@danaequality Oh Dana, NEVER say that. I’ve experienced suicidality, and I would not wish it on someone I hated. And I don’t hate you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:17:38	@Sectioned_ AH! I was wondering about the connection. Ego? Undoubtedly. Public platforms can fluff egos. The pill stuff was harmful shit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:16:32	@danaequality That’s some abhorrent bullshit right there. I never get this “dress as a woman to rape” meme of the TERFs. It’s just nasty.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:01:40	@Sectioned_ I suppose my ignorance of being gob is showing! I can cheerfully blame some gobs who have daft opinions at convenient times.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 20:00:38	@danaequality Forgive my naïveté and ignorance, but what’s that about? A TERF site outing trans* people? By “outing” I mea misgendering.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 19:58:35	@Sectioned_ Of course it is. Journals have a few rent-a-gobs on speed dial. Not the fault of the gobs, but of the pressures of journos.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 19:57:13	@danaequality Come in for a virtual Internet hug. There, there, we all know TERFs are pointless shits. You stay here with us nicer folk.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 19:55:32	@RevRichardColes They did a very nice blue a few years ago. This could cause a rift in our anti-beetroot revolution of days ago couldn’t it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 19:51:20	@stavvers Add me to that list!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 19:50:50	@danaequality Okay, okay, you got me on the huggable. I am a diabolically huggable bastard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 19:50:15	@bengoldacre Apologies for the profanity, but WHAT THE FUCK? It is impossible to parody dumb if this nature.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 19:47:28	@danaequality You have shocking taste, I am a diabolical bastard! But I like you too. Dammit, if this carries on nice could happen on t’web
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 19:46:01	@CCriadoPerez What did you do NOW? You’ve been being a woman again haven’t you? I’ve told you about that! ;-) Seriously, have a quiet day.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 19:44:16	@danaequality Oh DAHLING! It’s very hard in my case, middle class, cis, male burden dontcherknow. {theatrically mops brow} [/sarcasm]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 19:41:43	@danaequality And ableist. We need an umbrella term, list is too damn long! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-30 19:26:04	@stavvers Quite. If we men had taken over feminism we’d have got it done years ago [/sarcasm] It’s amazing how hard “shut up and listen” is

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-29 22:56:57	@RevRichardColes Is that not a valid architechtural criticism? I believe Prince Charles favours that school of critique.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-29 22:02:12	@stavvers There's a butoon for abusing people on twitter? I wouldn't have thought it necessary! #MajorMisunderstanding

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-29 18:42:52	@bmagnanti @TheRealNebris Well worth a look
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-29 18:42:25	@bmagnanti @TheRealNebris J K Rowling gave a great Harvard graduation speech where she said there’s an expiry date on blaming your parents

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-29 18:08:53	@caitlinmoran @SarahMillican75 @JefficaHoons @emmafreud Nice tactic! But standard irrelevant response is “give them all your millions”! 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-29 07:46:05	@nataliereed84 And, that said, it doesn’t undermine your point about trans people being asked to wait “only” X years being wrong. Obviously.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-29 07:44:10	@nataliereed84 Although I confess, I am not sure about the extent of that similar resonance! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-29 07:43:44	@nataliereed84 Some of, unfortunately perhaps, do get different “only”s of our own. “Only”s with perhaps similar resonance to core identity
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-29 07:40:42	@Angiedaytripper @MitchBenn @budgie @NickDoody Hence why I think scrutiny is very much needed, at the least.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-29 07:24:32	@MitchBenn @cam1871 @budgie @NickDoody Because adults being gassed is not bad enough? Why babies all of a sudden?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-29 07:14:48	@mjrobbins it’s derived from the very middle class preoccupation with being able to make choices around food. It’s awfully paternalistic too

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 09:51:32	@shadipetosky @stuxnetsource @hawkgirlwins @fakedansavage Could you elaborate for me please.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 09:48:21	@shadipetosky @stuxnetsource @hawkgirlwins @fakedansavage Erm no! But either way, changing opinion’s not the same things, surely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 09:47:13	@shadipetosky @stuxnetsource @hawkgirlwins @fakedansavage well I’ve never met the whole community, so couldn’t possibly comment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 09:46:11	@stuxnetsource @shadipetosky @hawkgirlwins @fakedansavage I am happy Dan has changed his views since then, but this is not an identity issue
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 09:45:43	@stuxnetsource @shadipetosky @hawkgirlwins @fakedansavage Being trans* is not like having a bit of a dopey opinion in the past.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 09:44:48	@stuxnetsource @shadipetosky @hawkgirlwins @fakedansavage Shadi, I think your analogy, whilst well intentioned, fell wide of the mark. (1/3)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 09:43:24	@Esteleth I tried to go to sleep like a good boy. I really did. But I might have taken the piss out of a muppet or two. Don’t judge me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 08:47:48	@sofiaquintero @DStrugg Bo who? Surely braids were invented by Emilia Clarke for Game of Thrones? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 08:15:22	@MelodyHensley So misogynist muppet makes nice-nice with other misogynist muppets? This is news I can afford to miss! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 08:10:25	@notahappyhooker @Kelsblells Organic artisan bread at £26 a loaf with added artisan. What’s artisan? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:45:16	@Kelsblells @notahappyhooker 6 months? Oh don’t be silly. That’s two shops at Waitrose. A month, tops. And that’s with the odd meal out! Ya!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:37:30	@docfreeride Take it as a compliment that you’re better at them? Nah, it’s the rampant misogyny isn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:36:06	@SpokesGay Now sex IS referred to as “Conjugal Unpleasantness”. Far more serious and nasty than murder. Which is understandable if rude.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:34:44	@SpokesGay That’s a bit strong! Murder is “unfortunate”, or at worst “dashed inconvenient”. Especially if it delays one’s train.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:33:35	@docfreeride Thanks. I just read it. Nice comment. Superb final line. I’ll give you 1000:1 for a vaguely coherent response. Make it 10000.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:29:56	@docfreeride Which thread?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:29:16	@SpokesGay IANAL, so I’m not sure about the “nearly”. Seems criminal to me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:27:44	@SpokesGay “Annoyance” is comic shorthand for Twitter purposes, Josh. Come on!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:26:50	@SpokesGay I’ve said it before, the is a game for the slyme. It’s grabass and gainsay. There’s not a serious human near them.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:23:10	@SpokesGay Ain’t that the truth. Today I read about Avicenna’s recent annoyance. There was not enough forehead my eyebrow went up so far.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:20:38	@SpokesGay It’s that time again isn’t it? The time when my palm and my face come into contact at speed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:19:05	@Doubting_Tom @Maxx_Chaos I have watched 2 mins of the Waffle House vid. It’s bedtime here in the UK, and that muppet has caused heartburn!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:06:56	@Maxx_Chaos @Doubting_Tom This is one of those things that makes me shake my head and say “What the Actual Fuck?”.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 07:03:40	@Maxx_Chaos @Doubting_Tom This guy is seriously YTing his bans from fast food joints? This is real? Because I’m not giving that git a click
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 06:48:15	@jonronson Me too. I was only made aware of twerking by an hilarious web comic I follow. Twerking, it’s the new vajazzle. Apparently.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 06:46:03	@scalzi Victory hoops? Lemme at ‘em!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 06:44:43	@somegreybloke Yeah I was surprisingly impressed too. Pretty damn faithful to the source too, which appeals to canon nerds like me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 06:43:29	@notahappyhooker Bits of me are okay. And you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 06:41:25	@jailawrites Okay tired person. You’re. Getting an Internet hug too. And intravenous cake. Because cake.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 06:37:10	@danaequality May I offer you a remote Internet hug as some form of prevention of headsplosion?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 05:34:33	@DaylightAtheism @blotzphoto This is a team sport for these doucheweasels. It’s games on the web. Reality has fuck all to do with anything.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 05:29:04	@bmagnanti Damn. And I was just about to proposition several ladies of my acquaintance north of the border. Quick, all horny folk to Durham!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 04:56:01	@woodo79 @whorephobia Precisely the number of spoons that, if excluded, could save enough cash for a deposit on a big screen TV.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 04:52:31	@gogreen18 Because weewees and hoohoos and scary!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 04:49:19	@CCriadoPerez Ah well you never know. You might need to know how to make one! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 03:54:50	@Crommunist Ahhh wisdom. There speaks the voice of experience.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 03:52:34	@Million_Gods @Crommunist @pzmyers I've favourited a lot of many peoples' tweets. Does that mean I need slut shaming?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 03:51:15	@pzmyers @JonathanTondu @mr_mikefraser The Welsh exist. As can be attested to by the recent Lions series.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 03:50:15	@BipolarBlogger True. Okay, hope for one evening plus constant vigilance! Deal?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 03:49:02	@bmagnanti Can I substitute olive and halloumi bread?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 03:47:13	@BipolarBlogger I know, but dammit we can hope! Well...maybe! Okay, just for this evening. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 03:41:36	@BipolarBlogger That is wonderful news. Well done on your recovery and wellness. May it last forever! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-28 03:27:11	@bmagnanti The reason is spelling. And horses should rule over us. We are Yahoos after all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 23:07:54	@EverydaySexism I think we need a sustained granny pant campaign to bankrupt this bar using discrimination law.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 23:07:15	@EverydaySexism They want underwear for drinks? My dead gran's stuff is hanging around. Reckon I could exploit this policy for a few beers?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 22:21:49	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie You're braver than me with freelance! How does it work for you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 22:10:00	@bmagnanti I'm curious about something. Your profile says you have ~466 tweets, how can this be so tiny? Have I missed a trick?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 22:07:21	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Yeah, I confess, working in industry is "easier" in some respects. I am a human being here for starters!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 22:05:27	@dcorsetto This being the internet I would expect incoming jokes. You have my sympathy. Nice way to wake up though I imagine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 22:02:20	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger ... esp with funding issues, competition, etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 22:01:56	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger I flirted with academia before going totally potty (technical term!), hard enough in sci, can't imagine arts..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:57:41	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger {Eyeroll} Ah the joys of a joined up health service...wait...it's the other thing isn't it? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:56:16	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Wow! Something I am fascinated by but know pretty much nothing about. Also hard to get into I imagine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:55:38	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie Urgh, that's more than a little irresponsible. And I imagine frustrating for you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:54:11	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Btw, what's your PhD in?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:53:45	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger ...and this is where things can get a) scary, b) politically and ethically difficult, and c) see a)!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:53:08	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger ...whether the patient has sufficient insight to be directly involved in their own treatment to that extent...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:52:11	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Back to the serious stuff: Yeah, I agree here. It gets close to that dangerous area where profs have to see...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:51:37	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger It's a bit of a funny thing when steam cleaners say "chemical free", I know what they mean, but it's untrue!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:51:04	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Yes all elements are "chemicals" You're breathing chemicals (oxygen as you say), washing in it (water is chem)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:47:52	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Not CHEMICALS!!!! [insert professional chemical scientist eyeroll here] ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:47:03	@bmagnanti @stavvers @judeinlondon Bloody minorities. Trying to be proper people. Why must they be so demanding? {Eyeroll} [/sarcasm]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:45:44	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger THAT, speaking as an Evil Pharma representative, is bloody unforgivable.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:45:17	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie Yikes! It's stories like yours that remind me how offensively lucky I have been with my Docs.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:44:23	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger That must be very difficult. I go the opposite way, healthy diet etc is something I am not worthy of etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:39:01	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Perhaps. I'm v sympathetic all round here.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:38:05	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger I am surpised here at the profs, not you. Obvs!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:37:42	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Really? AN is not my field of study, so not expert but I thought the SH nature of AN was well established.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:31:33	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger AN or similar is WAY beyond my level of disordered eating. I'm sub-pathological, just not well controlled.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:30:21	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger Oh crikey yeah! AN is self harm via food. I'm careful not to appropriate that level of experience.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:24:39	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie Cool!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:21:44	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie ...and few/none have a genuinely worthy psych component.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:21:26	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie Yeah, the clinical data backs that up. It's those programmes with psych component that show most success...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:19:49	@jonronson @scribbles78 To a bigger plate of chips and cheese?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:19:13	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie That's an impressive range! I'm similar because I adhere well. But if the first slip is big, then I'm gone
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:14:34	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie Of course! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:13:57	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie How well do you manage rigid diets? I get the feeling safer part, I confess to being very bad at them though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:12:40	@BipolarBlogger @lapsangsusie I'm not (quite) all the way through your blog yet! I think we're on the same page re: eating though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:10:29	@RevRichardColes This is a practical solution. And with a training programme could fix unemployment. Well shall have to make this universal.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:07:58	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger 3) I take it from your response, Charlotte, that this is not unfamiliar to you too?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:06:52	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger 2)my actions around food are harmful and on occasion, deliberately so. Not always, but sufficiently to be bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:05:33	@lapsangsusie @BipolarBlogger 1) I don't want to appropriate "self harm" as a term from those who genuinely self harm, so forgive my caution
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:03:37	@RevRichardColes Excellent I think this is a workable foundation for a revolution. Do we meet in darkened bistros where good beef is served?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:02:01	@bmagnanti Yeah, I got it 2 seconds after I hit tweet. D'OH! Mi apologias.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 21:00:50	@BipolarBlogger Welcome to my world! ;-) I am a bit of a mess about food.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 20:59:41	@bmagnanti Balls! I read you the wrong way didn't I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 20:59:22	@bmagnanti There's suitably intersectional feminism out there isn't there? I am not an expert of course.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 20:48:49	@RevRichardColes Finally! A political movement I can get behind! What's the official position on liquorice?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 20:44:08	@RevRichardColes So when your time comes as global overlord, dill will be a thing of the past? I just want to get my ducks in a row early.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 20:42:22	@RevRichardColes Can we take that as an authoritative ex cathedra* pronoucement? * Yes I know it's the wrong church. Forgive me this sin!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 20:23:50	@Sectioned_ Mental health is too scary, too close to who and what we are. It's the last great taboo. Maybe I'm feeling pessimistic!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 20:23:04	@Sectioned_ Oh I don't know. I think 20-30 years behind is optimistic. Given the stigma and the ignorance behind that stigma I'd say 200-300
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 20:21:56	@BoyGeorge SILENCE MEAT UNIT! You will be processed by the Efficient Mechanical System and you will enjoy it. Until the rubber glove emerges

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 20:08:25	@Sectioned_ 1) Or Muslims, they're "popular" with the frothers too. Oooh Muslim paranoid schizophrenics!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-27 20:06:35	. @bmagnanti Because the conflation of class, sustainability, food miles and bullshit doesn't happen. Oh no! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-26 20:40:15	@tkingdoll Don't ask me, it's your fault I had to find out who Miley Cyrus was. I was shocked. Shocked I tell you.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-26 20:20:32	@caitlinmoran I wonder if it's been in before. Can you, as fully paid up journo person, search archives easily?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 08:46:08	@whorephobia I suspect though that those claims of my friends are privilege derived in large part
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 08:45:09	@whorephobia Definitely with you on the consent thing. Many of my friends say they would do SW for right money and ability to pick clients
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 08:43:44	@whorephobia But by the same token, if you are the person for the job, I can also see it being very lucrative
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 08:42:44	@whorephobia Ah, yes. I can see how SW can be a very good job financially, but hateful in other ways. I know a lot of jobs can be like that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 08:39:58	@whorephobia And by economic necessity I mean no real choice etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 08:39:25	@whorephobia 2) …hate it, so this could be a welcome way out? Or is that rare?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 08:38:44	@whorephobia 1) I can see how that is a problem for those who want to do SW. In your experience do many do it from economic necessity and…..

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 08:28:12	@whorephobia I’m glad you feel you get (some?) of what you pay taxes for. IMO the police and the rest of us could do a lot better by SWs
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 08:26:39	@PaulLoebe @onesarahjones Ah yes, everyone take note, it’s colourblindness for sex/gender. The first play in the clueless play book.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 08:25:00	@PaulLoebe @onesarahjones For all the wrong reasons too. You must be so proud. What an achievement.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 08:23:12	@PaulLoebe @onesarahjones shitty company + silence + a stated desire to troll + actual trolling/insult? Yeah that’s not just guilt by assoc.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 07:46:41	@onesarahjones 2) I think that sub communities, esp ones supposedly based on reason, as well as larger society can progress away from old
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-24 07:45:49	@onesarahjones 1) Yes it is possible. Western societies have got gradually, ratchetingly, more progressive and accepting of diversity.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-23 20:56:29	@danaequality @AlyDro which I have to say I’d the most soul destroying part I imagine. Being keen to be a bigot? Urgh.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-23 20:55:57	@danaequality @AlyDro And they seem really keen to come out, as if a rock star shouted “who’s a bigot?” And an adoring crowd shouted “I am!”
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-23 05:04:24	@jailawrites I have a friend who rides a motor bike to work. He has a small hole drilled in his visor for a spliff. He’s often very stoned
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-23 05:00:56	@jailawrites Of course as responsible law abiding adults neither of us would do anything like this. Obviously. But if it were legal here….
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-23 04:57:43	@jailawrites I know right!? Can you imagine breakfast?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-23 04:57:18	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ oh superb! Go pharmacist!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-23 04:51:36	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ If I skip sleep all hell breaks loose! As for meds, I find I’m getting awful hangovers with sleep meds. You?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-23 04:48:46	@SpokesGay Do I have to be white? None of my clothes will work for me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-23 04:46:26	@SpokesGay I meant existing but have fat fingers that upset my ipad
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-23 04:45:49	@Sectioned_ with me, yes. I have bipolar disorder, and sleep deprivation is strongly correlated with disturbance in mood.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-23 04:44:55	@SpokesGay Is it a problem or more of a solution to the e siting douche issue? (Not serious btw, my compassion is universal…ish)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 23:52:39	@laurenlaverne And yes I have just realised I misread salon as saton. D'OH!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 23:52:13	@laurenlaverne Lucky you didn't sit on hair treatments because that could have gone wrong. Proving once and for all truth > hair treament.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 23:50:36	@SpokesGay In all seriousness I think you're about my age IIRC. So 24. I AM 24! Still. Have been for nearly 15 years. I'm good at it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 23:49:09	@SpokesGay I thought you were {insert ridiculously young age here}.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 23:46:48	@SpokesGay You're not as old as I thought you were? It's your birthday? I gotta start paying attention! Happy Birthday DAHLING!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 20:26:26	@ool0n @Giliell I know. Truly these people are out of their depth in a puddle of spit. There is no beginning to their talents.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 20:24:34	@ool0n @Giliell HAHAHA! That might be funny. However, what's funnier is that it doesn't exist AND THEY THINK IT DOES!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 20:19:39	@Giliell @ool0n What, like your BREAST milk? So the BlockBot is antiwoman? ZOMG NEWS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 20:17:58	@Giliell @ool0n Oh and apparently Oolon your code automatically files DMCA claims/ flags on YouTube or something. Does it? Or conspiracy?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 20:17:04	@Giliell @ool0n Someone blocked me on Twitter once. I died. TAKE THAT ATHEIST +ers!!!!!!!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 19:26:07	@Xanthe_Cat @TransMediaWatch Salacious prejudiced stories designed to make capital on the hatred of minorities. Yay our media! Oh wait...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 19:20:23	@Xanthe_Cat @TransMediaWatch The Daily Mail manages to be right about something about twice a year, by accident. This is not one of those.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 17:18:21	@bmagnanti @notahappyhooker @mistressmatisse @ninaperez76 1) Great, now I have the ideas "faking it" "SW" + "Laser spectroscopy" in my head
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 16:57:58	@bmagnanti I must be following the wrong (right?) people, and thus blissfully ignorant. Who's flouncing now?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 00:24:45	@bmagnanti I say, do you have to tweet hard core faunography. There are children about, somewhere. It could warp their fragile little minds.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-22 00:22:26	@whorephobia All that thinking is hard! I save time and get all my opinions from the Daily Mai... ...Ok, can't even say it in jest!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 21:03:55	@FreeThinkingUK @bmagnanti 2) that might be inappropriate, esp given Dr M's stated wishes on charity. Agree on the fabulosity though. Shh!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 21:02:45	@FreeThinkingUK @bmagnanti 1) TBH I don't know how to answer this, I neither know (off twitter) nor am affiliated with Dr M, so feel that...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 20:56:11	@notahappyhooker Good article. Tragically, whenever I go dogging all I find are actual dogs. I think I'm on the wrong sites! Crufts, right?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 20:45:59	@sylvianorth @bmagnanti I suppose I am naive optimist, I'd rather assume honest greed than vitriolic abuse, revenge and pettiness.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 20:45:12	@bmagnanti WAY ahead of you on THAT one!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 20:43:06	@bmagnanti Is it worth a whip round? Fans of your books/blogs/column might be able to rally a few quid. Or is that not the done thing here?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 20:42:29	@bmagnanti I'm going with: Because Reasons. I'd ask what you saw in the ex if it wasn't ridiculously impertinent!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 20:39:00	@bmagnanti And dragging this through the press, totally not revenge. Nuh uh. Not petty. Nooope.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 18:11:59	@TaraFlynn If booze is not medication, then that. if it is, erm, urrrrh, mile high club? Trying to arrange that will take your mind off it.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 03:38:40	@danaequality Well in that case, I return to the original meaning. Gee, I better start making me some mistakes! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 03:33:10	@danaequality I should perhaps qualify the "being fucked" part! I meant being told off, not...you know. After all that's a reward!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 02:25:07	@bmagnanti Adventure? Sure. Tricky? Very.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 00:19:02	@jailawrites @SexismInAtheism 2) could involve racism and sexism and a whole slew of other things
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 00:18:34	@jailawrites @SexismInAtheism 1) For me it's the issue of "marginalised group speaking to less marginalised group". Hence why I think it...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-21 00:16:27	@SexismInAtheism @jailawrites That is true. I'm trying (possibly failing) to be aware of intersectional issues. It's possible I am wrong!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 23:29:14	@Jenny_Trout @bmagnanti That's right folks, combining antiquated sexism and modern day faux egalitarianism in one tweet!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 23:26:01	@boobygraffoe As you know, "Alternative comedy" largely stopped being alternative when punching up became less profitable than mocking chavs

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 23:07:02	@ThatJoelfella LOL No worries. I do a good line in beer/rugby/dick jokes too! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 23:04:53	@ThatJoelfella Very true. It just surprises me (and it shouldn't) that a computerised technique can offer solace to complex mental issues
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 23:01:26	@ThatJoelfella @EverydayAbleism 4) a "caring" therapy administered by a set of algorithms.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 23:01:03	@ThatJoelfella @EverydayAbleism 3) evidence that they can help people too. Which blows my mind tbh!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 23:00:45	@ThatJoelfella @EverydayAbleism 2) However, that "algorithmic" nature means some CBT courses are available over the net. And these have some
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 23:00:17	@ThatJoelfella @EverydayAbleism 1) It can be a bit like that. CBT is very formulaic, and needs the "hands" of an expert to use well 1 on 1.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 22:48:32	@EverydayAbleism Having experienced CBT, did anyone find it algorithmic? Perhaps that is due to poor therapeutic relationship in part
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 22:45:55	@jailawrites @SexismInAtheism 2) When a bigot is challenged, it’s not what is said that’s the issue, it’s that someone is speaking at all

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 22:27:24	Don't get me wrong Twitter, so far this is a positive experience and I love it, but deary me you could not pull me out of the lab for this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 22:26:55	What is it about sitting in my (lonely?) office doing "paperwork" that makes Twitter so appealing. I don't rush out of the lab to do this.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 22:20:36	@bmagnanti So it was about time some middle class, heavily privileged cis man let them know why. Because we just don't hear enough from us
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 22:20:05	@bmagnanti HAHA! Well I figured that the majority of the world now lets everyone know their views and lots of them are Wrong On The Internet

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 21:49:06	@bmagnanti Well, now you've done it! You've inspired me to start blogging. I can only apologise!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 21:29:23	@Acuity_Design @MarkOneinFour 2) is positively flying in the face of available evidence
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 21:29:05	@Acuity_Design @MarkOneinFour 1) Indeed. Assuming suicidality is ONLY MH based is a bad idea, but pretending there is no link for majority
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 21:27:07	@MarkOneinFour like, for example, financial pressure etc, are obviously needed too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 21:26:46	@MarkOneinFour 2) with some better MH care and education as this is the bulk of the problem. Interventions for other causes of suicidality
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 21:25:48	@MarkOneinFour 1) I should stress I am not saying all suicide is due to MH, obviously not. But an evidence based intervention would start
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 21:23:54	@MarkOneinFour To take one example of suicidality
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 21:23:34	@MarkOneinFour That's very true, but AFAIK (and I do read about a bit ;-) ) suicide due to mood disorder is the major cause in young males
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 21:21:37	@MarkOneinFour 2) Part of that has to be better education in schools pre 16 about MH issues and health issues in general.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-20 21:21:11	@MarkOneinFour 1) First step has to be earlier stage prevention. Fund better + more extesive mental health intervention.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:23:16	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ @wildwalkerwoman as working analogously to mansplaining It's about the axis of privilege as much as anything 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:22:32	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ @wildwalkerwoman perhaps because. Came late t this I missed the first bit. Sanesplaining makes sense to me 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:21:36	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ @wildwalkerwoman as you identified, it derives from the assumption of ignorance about someone else. So many axes
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:19:08	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ @wildwalkerwoman Read the second tweet, not muddied! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:17:58	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ @wildwalkerwoman Hence why I agree that "madsplaining" misses. "Sanesplaining" is better. It's the right axis
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:17:10	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ @wildwalkerwoman V true, but there are other "splains". Het, cis etc. just as real as mansplaining.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:13:24	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ @wildwalkerwoman Yeah, good point. I agree.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:13:07	@ateisten Oy vey! Such sceptics we are dealing with!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:12:52	@ateisten Who'd have thought it? Evolution is untrue because it leads to dancing or something. Feminism is untrue because it leads to asking
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:11:02	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ @wildwalkerwoman It's a bad habit when it comes to drugs etc, I work in the area, so know a bit. Naughty Louis!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:10:01	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ @wildwalkerwoman The"splain" part. Arrives the negative connotations IIRC
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:09:39	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ @wildwalkerwoman How about madstorming for the good kind of people with MH issues bashing ideas about?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:08:09	@stuxnetsource YES! The Overton Window needs shifting, and asking it to shift fails. The tone police must read MLK's letter from B'ham jail
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:05:33	@ateisten Are we talking rape accusations or evolutionary biology? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:04:35	@Sectioned_ @BipolarBlogger @wildwalkerwoman I was lucky, I was pointed in the direction of education and took it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 19:03:47	@damianobroin @sineadredmond Does it make me a bad boy that I enjoy it just a little bit too much?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:57:42	@damianobroin @sineadredmond Mind you, that's a reflection of my privilege I guess. So time to mock the misogynists!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:57:12	@damianobroin @sineadredmond You're doing a better job than I would. My block button would be steaming from use. Life's too short sometimes
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:53:49	@marliesanna @notahappyhooker This is so true it hurts. I really feel for kids today. They're growing up harder than last gen had to.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:52:27	@Sectioned_ @BipolarBlogger @wildwalkerwoman I knew nothing of feminism. Then I made mistakes in the presence of feminists. I learned. FAST!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:50:27	@Sectioned_ @BipolarBlogger @wildwalkerwoman That's just prejudiced! ;-) BTW BipolarBlogger, sorry for being a bit 'splainy yesterday
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:46:55	@stavvers It's fucking horrendous over there, the misogyny is rampant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:45:41	@TaraFlynn @_terri_jones Yup. Misogyny gives me the creeps. I checked the hash tag and...yuck. There's a lot of it over there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:44:17	@Sectioned_ @BipolarBlogger @wildwalkerwoman There's a party? Where's my invite? I washed and put on lucky pants and everything! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:36:59	@_terri_jones @TaraFlynn Firstly, what's wrong with "sluts"? Nothing. Women enjoying and having sex = good. Secondly, it's no one business
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:35:54	@_terri_jones @TaraFlynn Slut shaming is a concept I have never got...well I *get* it intellectually, but not why anyone would do it. V dumb
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:33:46	@Ringenberg @happybenzene If you have one, stick them in a vacuum oven overnight, nice and low pressure, nice and hot. (Precise!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:32:43	@ool0n @WDP_HeathGeorge @latsot I think we need a kickstarter to really bash stereotypes...that's right, I said bash...omahgerd Teh Violins!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:29:04	@JessTheChemist That's a retaliatory campaign of dry ice filled nitriles in their lab drawers, minimum. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:23:27	@EnjoyMaidenhead It's AUGUST!!! When the revolution comes, Xmas will be Dec 20th to 27th. Punishable by death. Or at least no cake. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:20:24	@tessakendall Get well soon, Tessa. I'd send chicken soup but it wrecked my USB port when last I tried.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:13:39	@SceptiGuy @thedoctor5869 Damn I was going to say that! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 18:06:17	@CrippledFox @there_runsMary Ahhhh. My irony settings were too high and I missed it, my bad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 08:17:54	@Fischblog @Chemjobber Oh okay it was Barry Nelson, but he's not as cool as Bob.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 08:14:45	@Fischblog @Chemjobber Oh and you missed the first Bond. Bob Holness. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 08:14:18	@Fischblog @Chemjobber Nice work, sir. Collect your Internet at the front desk.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 08:07:19	@Chemjobber THERE. ARE. FOUR. BONDS. [/Picard]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 07:55:07	@SpokesGay I've been drinking that tonight. It's been a night where there is not enough booze.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 06:28:13	@tkingdoll ZOMG that's practically pornographic
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 04:41:41	@Queen_UK You too, Ma'am?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 04:06:09	@tessakendall Lucky you. I hope you both have a great time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 03:34:45	@Cruella1 I was also pleased to note Zombie Stalin appeared. He forgot to mention modern Scandinavia...I wonder why?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 03:34:07	@Cruella1 Just watched the show on iPlayer. You got a fair crack of the whip....NOT! What a "nice" chap that Irish bloke was...{eyeroll}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 01:06:37	@notahappyhooker @whorephobia Haha! No worries. I wouldn't be ashamed if I were, just best to be very clear. Imagine the convos otherwise!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 01:04:36	@notahappyhooker @whorephobia I'll leave the approaching to others, the Mrs would kill me! But you've assuaged my worry that its tough to do
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 00:32:18	@SpokesGay We need a similar revolution on a ~5 yearly basis across the globe IMO.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 00:25:37	And I have to say @Giliell did all the hard work! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 00:25:03	@Giliell I.e. the slight feeling of shame/discomfort one gets from overindulging in the mockery of trolls, bigots and fools
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 00:24:31	With the invaluable aid of the wonderful @Giliell Trottelschande has been retired in favour of the more accurate: Klugscheißerbauchweh
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 00:22:43	@Giliell Whatever the German for LOL is...I'm doing it!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 00:18:22	@Herring1967 @THE_GSOL @markaugustyn @ajhmurray Malcolm Hardee eat your heart out. Who had the biggest balls?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 00:11:53	@Giliell My German is good enough for chats, but not neologism!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-19 00:07:05	@Giliell So trottelschande (which I could spell! ;-) ) becomes more accurately Klugscheißerbauchweh?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:59:25	@Giliell oooh, so you feel bad for being a smartass?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:57:31	@Giliell Like troll hooves going over a bridge.... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:57:17	@Giliell I thought "fool shame" (Trottelschande) would cover it, obviously I did a dictionary thing badly with trottel, but it sounds so ace
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:53:28	@Giliell No. Mocking deliberate trolls, MRAs, misogynists etc is not an arrogant act. It's shame at overindulgence that MIGHT annoy friends
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:51:30	@whorephobia Wow! I would have thought it far higher than that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:49:06	@Giliell Hmmm okay the Bauchweh part is good, not sure arrogance/hubris fits. It's shame at indulging onself after all
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:47:24	@EverydayAbleism @averrer Let's put that baby to the test! Or, you know...not. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:44:47	@EverydayAbleism @averrer How many per hour is that? I've been flying along today
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:43:55	@whorephobia Do you think the general existence of such sites makes life safer for SWs?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:43:36	@whorephobia The concept of a review site, in the current legal/social climate, strikes me as potentially very iffy. <----understatement.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:41:53	@EverydayAbleism I'm a scientist, and there's a creative/imaginative element to my work. Does my bipolar help? I have a LOT of ideas. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:40:41	@SpokesGay You do what you want, I'm having a pie! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:40:08	@Giliell I like it! Literal translation?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:39:45	@whorephobia Let me guess, groups of Johns "reviewing" SWs?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:39:12	@CarlieP YAY! Psychedelic brownies for everyone!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:38:46	@RespectSexWork IT'S A MIRACLE! Did it say WHICH god? Because I understand priestesses of Aphrodite...erm...I've drifted haven't I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:37:57	@whorephobia Very helpful!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:37:31	@whorephobia I'm too scared to ask what punting forums are [/naive]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:35:58	@whorephobia I was, but not out of need, out of interest in topic!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:35:09	@Giliell In this case I need a German Consult! I'm willing to pay big big internet bucks!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:34:30	@whorephobia Ha! Thanks, not looking for advice! ;-) I was being airy fairy ethical wossname! I realise it benefits the lurkers though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:33:31	@Giliell ...and thus possibly pissing off your friends. Also the word "trottel" sounds great
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:33:09	@Giliell DAMN! I want it to be the shame felt after indulging in mocking internet trolls/fools/bigots that LITTLE bit too much...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:32:22	@whorephobia I can imagine that mindset is not uncommon. Is that the case? The problem that strikes me is how to find an unexploited SW?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:29:39	@T0m0akl3y I should stress this is all for the purposes of comedy. Of course you still fancy Thomas the Tank Engine. We all do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:29:05	@T0m0akl3y A graphic designer? I pronounce you perfectly mentally healthy. No lingering Thomas the Tank Engine fetish and middle class mum
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:26:27	I have not seen much Trottelschande from tweeps today. [Suble shoehorning of personal neologism into twitter streams]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:21:24	@tkingdoll PAXMAN HAS A BEARD?!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:18:58	@BipolarBlogger Sounds like a good idea given what you've said. Sorry, did not know you'd been recently discharged.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:17:59	@BipolarBlogger Ahhhh. That makes more sense!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:17:16	@CarlieP If I pretend to be even more offended can they be pot internet brownies? Not that I would ever eat such a thing, honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:16:15	@BipolarBlogger There's a feeling I know. I am on a brick of Na valproate a day. It's like being coshed nightly. Quetiapine is worse I heard
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:14:40	@BipolarBlogger Hmmm that's...potentially unethical of GP. Can you get shrink referral at all? That might be a route...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:13:56	@CarlieP HAHA! You're totally fine! That was a good comment, but I am always up for brownies, so will pretend to be mortally offended! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:09:17	@BipolarBlogger Apologies if I came across a bit explainy! My bad. I hope this issue resolves itself for you ASAP. Rock on BP sister! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:08:15	@whorephobia Oh THESE I have to read! {Sits by fascinated}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:07:10	@BipolarBlogger Yeah. The market for fake breast milk would plummet!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:06:40	@BipolarBlogger ...biggest cause of non-compliance (hate that term but you know what I mean)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:06:20	@BipolarBlogger Get back down to one! Insist on seroquel. After all, drug compliance is a vital partof treatment and side effects are...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:05:33	@BipolarBlogger And there's no, AFAIK, reason for placebo/nocebo symptoms to go one way or another. It's a very odd area of study
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:04:51	@BipolarBlogger Have you read Ben Goldacre's book "Bad Science"? (Bad Pharma is good too btw). It has a really excellent explanation of this
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:03:22	@BipolarBlogger HAHA! Yes, that does strike me as a very...extreme psychosomatic reaction!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:02:08	@BipolarBlogger Can your shrink INSIST you get seroquel, not generic? IIRC they can.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:01:38	@BipolarBlogger My apologies then for rehashing old ground for you. Twitter's 140 can make sympathetic thing sound harsh.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:00:53	@BipolarBlogger .. can be found because of packaging/pill colour etc. I.e. def not drug effects. It's....complex! (But fun and interesting)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 23:00:16	@BipolarBlogger Yikes!It could easily be a formulation issue (as mentioned), weirdly though there's evidence that placebo/nocebo effects...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:59:31	@GreenpeaceUK 4)...release generic. Good luck. I do sympathise.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:59:09	@BipolarBlogger 3)... be different. So get your shrink to check formulation. Slow release seroquel, for example, is not the same as non slow
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:58:24	@BipolarBlogger 2) there have been, shall we say "less than fulsomely rigorous" behaviours from generics companies. Also formulation can...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:57:29	@BipolarBlogger 1) Ew. The brand of a drug should not effect you (other than via placebo). But (speaking as someone in the pharma industry)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:55:55	@Xanthe_Cat Sleep well and thanks for the lovely chat and great ideas. {Hugs}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:55:36	@Xanthe_Cat Minimum. I can't believe in this day and age of BAN EVERYTHING Mail is permitted to be circulated under hate speech laws! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:53:26	@SpokesGay Gayar'dib! Your Gay is powerful. Why have I suddenly gone into Gay Dune mode? Okay this is disturbing on so many levels.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:52:27	@SpokesGay For he IS the Kwizatz HaderGay!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:51:04	@SpokesGay THAT AM AN START! :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:49:27	@Xanthe_Cat I'll fly abroad to operate it though. And we need technians to dispose of it afterwards. We may need to kill the technicians.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:46:51	@jailawrites Thanks very much.The family are lovely really. Deeply homophobic, racist, sexist and generally ableist. But lovely.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:46:07	@SpokesGay In other words...thank you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:45:48	@SpokesGay Hugs? Only HUGS? Oh dear Virtual Internet Husband, to assuage such feelings I need MOAR THAN HUGS! (Getting self into trouble!)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:44:08	@bug_girl @paulisporin Bees are feminists? That's amazing! Of course...their matriarchal! (Inaccuracies in science are for comedy purposes)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:40:00	@Xanthe_Cat But but I'd have to TOUCH it! They don't build gloves thick enough. Otherwise an excellent plan
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:39:26	@T0m0akl3y Is that sexually arousing? Tell me about your mother? [/Freud voice]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:39:05	@T0m0akl3y YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED! Paraise the Baby Jesus and all the little pixies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:37:08	@vandeand Hate and bigotry so often stem from fear. I find myself alternately pitying and angry with bigots.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:35:48	@CarlieP Also, I think it's true for a lot of people with MH issues that (rigid) self discipline/care is one of the three legs of treatment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:34:22	@Xanthe_Cat HA! I'd LOVE to do that! We're dealing with Daily Mail readers who see information as a conspiracy and contradiction as personal
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:33:34	@CarlieP In the immortal words of the Prophet (not saying which): Faeces Occurs. Everyone has their stuff to deal with.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:32:56	2) My masulinity is more secure than your irrelevant and sexist marketing bullshit. Thank you, have a truly shite day.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:31:59	1) That reminds me: Yorkie (man choclate allegedly) and McCoys crisps (man crisps allegedly): Do please fuck off.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:30:09	@Xanthe_Cat I can but hope. I know full well what it will do to relations with family though. They'll use it as an excuse to gaslight
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:29:20	@CCriadoPerez @sueveneer @misogyny_online @helenlewis Does this mean I have to hand back my man card + testes, and stop eating McCoys crisps
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:28:39	@CCriadoPerez @sueveneer @misogyny_online @helenlewis 1) I've just admitted a) a woman knows more than me and b) another woman had an idea
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:27:27	@Xanthe_Cat Indeed. People do get....odd about it. Well SOME people do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:25:55	@Xanthe_Cat Yeah. I am however careful not to appropriate others' pain/struggle. Hence why I am a bit weird about "closeted".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:25:17	@CCriadoPerez @sueveneer @misogyny_online @helenlewis Thanks! I never knew that. All credit to Ms Lewis! It's a bloody good law!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:23:30	@Xanthe_Cat Does this parallel your trans* experience at all do you think?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:23:03	@sueveneer @CCriadoPerez @misogyny_online There's 'net Law that the comments on anything about feminism will prove the need for feminism
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:20:36	@bmagnanti It is superb. My wife just asked "Who's that sexy man singing 'Jolene'?". She remains surprised but amused!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:18:59	@Xanthe_Cat ...be rendered unpleasant. And the unpleasantness, gaslighting, stigmatising, denial, from those supposedly closest is harmful
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:18:19	@Xanthe_Cat Definitely. That's what I'm doing as best I can. The issue is a bit petty, but psychologically traumatic. All interaction would
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:15:07	@Xanthe_Cat Bloody right! There's being able to take a kick in the teeth and then there's going around asking people for one.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:14:02	@Xanthe_Cat But will safety ever come? The eternal question. I am always tempted to "rip off the band aid".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:13:30	@Xanthe_Cat Pseud for NOW. Louis is my real name, Redux, unsurprisingly is not my real name! I want to get a bit more "safe" then come out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:12:21	@T0m0akl3y Commiserations. I've been there. In the words of Winston Churchill: If you are going through hell, keep going.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:11:30	@Xanthe_Cat ...is utterly horrendous. I've been following a couple of hastags of late. Whoa! My eyes have been opened!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:11:01	@Xanthe_Cat And you are too kind btw. I use the word "closeted" because it is a shorthand. What you in the LGBT (esp T) community deal with
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:08:37	@Xanthe_Cat But I am closted because at this time I feel it is the lesser of two evils. I might be wrong, but eurgh...I don't like it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:08:01	@Xanthe_Cat Bravely? I'm an utter hypocritical coward! I KNOW being fully out is the way to go, living inauthentically hurts me, I hate it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:07:17	@CCriadoPerez Oh! Phew! I was organising a whip round! £90 is TINY!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:06:34	11) Oh and incidentally, I was diagnosed with BP2 in my mid 30s. That's a late time to discover the reasons behind lifelong "fun". ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:05:28	@CCriadoPerez In all seriousness I am surprised it's that little. I thought you writerly folk were paid oodles to live in Notting Hill etc.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 22:04:49	@CCriadoPerez £90? For the opnions of a WOMAN? What is the world coming to? Next you'll be voting. Won't someone think of the children? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:59:25	10)...rigidly self disciplined in self care/management. I cannot afford to slip. Let's hope it works! (It has so far)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:58:51	9) ...much more dangerous in a volatile job market. Better to knuckle down (if possible) and try to fly under the radar. This is why I am...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:58:03	8) Although I AM out to close friends and colleagues and I feel no shame. Generally reactions have been good. Being "officially" out is...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:57:17	7) They gaslight enough people already, spew enough MH stigma, that I think I would struggle with it. Also, in my career, being out is hard
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:56:25	6) I have to do it because, whilst I have lovely parents/in laws, sublte interrogation over the years has demonstrated this is beyond them
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:55:41	5) But that is a very small price to pay and I am DAMNED lucky compared to some of my fellow sufferers. Being closeted is a safety thing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:55:03	4)...nothing about my suicidality in the past etc. My career has not gone where I want it entirely, in part because of my bipolar.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:54:13	3) very lucky to have a career I love and be blessed with a son I adore. I have gotten away lightly. No police trouble. Most people know...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:53:31	2) If I am honest, there was a period not too long ago where it ruined my life almost totally. I am lucky to still be married...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:52:55	1) I've made a comment about having bipolar disorder to @EverydayAbleism . I have bipolar 2 (most probably that's the diagnosis, but complex)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:44:13	@CCriadoPerez @EverydaySexism Yeah, THAT was astonishing. Possibly accidental, but the title Porn User is...erm...well really? REALLY?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:36:25	@there_runsMary @CrippledFox Mind you, this is Twitter, so 140 chars is tough to express complex ideas in. #benefitofthedoubt
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:35:53	@there_runsMary @CrippledFox Indeed. It's more complicated, and rife with systemic obstacles, than Crippled Fox seems to realise.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:32:56	@RugbyBenCohen Mate if you're out of shape, then I am an amorphous blob. Wait...I AM an amporphouse blob! {Puts down pie}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:32:10	@CrippledFox @there_runsMary That's an issue. Individuals need to aspire and work, undeniably but salaries need to track living costs better
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:31:22	@CrippledFox @there_runsMary It could easily be true but you've missed the point. A senior teacher cannot afford cheap living in school area
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:24:33	@EverydayAbleism BTW that's not paranoia, I've sussed them out and they do it to other members of my family with much less severe MH issues
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:21:57	@EverydayAbleism Remaining closeted to my (bigoted) close family about my bipolar disorder because they would gaslight me at every chance.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:09:35	@Sectioned_ This is a "favourite" coupled to the "everybody gets that" which inevitably ends in the "snap out of it" It's MH stigma trifecta
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 21:04:26	@ladylaxton @CCriadoPerez A CUP!?!?!!? What stridency! Couldn't they find a much quieter way to ask to be allowed to be people? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:39:16	@there_runsMary I forgot about them. I feel I should pay teachers personally for having to deal with my son! He's a bit too like me, tricky
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:36:41	@there_runsMary I think you lot deserve danger money, just for starters!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:36:27	@there_runsMary Utterly bananas, on two major fronts: first, you should be paid sufficient to live, second, teachers should be paid LOTS
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:35:20	@ool0n @Xanthe_Cat OPPONENT'S satisfaction, not your own. Shit. Cambridge Union experience showing! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:34:49	@ool0n @Xanthe_Cat It is. And btw that is the FIRST thing anyone in serious debate should be able to do. Describe opponent's view to 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:33:57	@bengoldacre @faisalislam 3) I.e. mine and wife's would take 12 years. Disparity between salaries and house prices huge and rising
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:33:20	@bengoldacre @faisalislam 2) off their east London 3 bed terrace in 5 years (using all salary). Equivalent house with professional salary

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:25:03	@Xanthe_Cat @ool0n Ganymede. Minimum
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:23:04	@mePadraigReidy @SimoneBeauvoirs Perhaps not, but it's not a terrible idea. What are we all doing this afternoon?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:10:03	@Emmabarnett @lbc973 Easy! Sexist? Yes. Take 'em seriously? No. They should be ridiculed back to the Dark Ages where they belong.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:05:34	@NickCohen4 @mjrobbins @bengoldacre and I confess, I share @NickCohen4 's agenda, but we probably disagree on order of priority.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 19:04:34	@NickCohen4 @mjrobbins @bengoldacre I'm a repub in brain, but a royalist in comedy. If Prince Phillip did not exist we'd have to invent him
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 18:51:09	@bats87 @Sectioned_ Wow! Such insight. Please demonstrate, with facts and evidence, that the moon is made of green cheese. Thanks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 07:59:02	@bats87 @Sectioned_ Erm, no, sorry, that is, to put it delicately and with the greatest of respect, complete and total bullshit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 07:00:41	@Sectioned_ @bats87 But then I'm terribly pedantic and like facts and stuff ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 07:00:12	@Sectioned_ @bats87 it could be, but only if the balance is misrepresentative. I.e it unfairly promotes one side when evidence favours other
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 06:48:17	@Sectioned_ I'm sure you didn't mention it before and that no one was inappropriately defensive and missed the point. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 06:46:19	@SpokesGay @MrDeity Also sadly, I prefer my media figures without rape apologetics, so that's one sub less. And the shows are so damn funny.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 06:45:18	@SpokesGay @MrDeity Sadly Mr Deity has managed to perform a perfect double down douche. Flawless execution, impressive point missing. 1/2

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 04:36:39	@harpistkat the sequel is almost in the bag AFAIK. And there are people starving... Worrying priorities, humanity!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 04:35:29	@SpokesGay Hategate? {ducks}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 04:34:43	@RespectSexWork Sadly not. But rich supermodels who want to take on scrounger who could give them 15 secs of flatulent sex can apply. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 04:31:02	@wmarybeard if not, and I suspect not, they would have got an abrupt, Wodehousian nolle prosequi from me I fear. Glad you gave 'em what for
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 04:29:33	@wmarybeard You are kidding me! A couple told you to keep your legs together? We're you so spread akimbo that you took up extra sets? 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 01:46:15	@SpokesGay @Research2BeDone THAT is fucking brilliant
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-18 01:34:59	@whorephobia There are better things to do? Okay, yes there are better things to do, but stats are fun!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 21:19:33	@tkingdoll I thought that in particular was an excellent Daily Failism. WI ARE MONSTERS......Wasn't WI. WTF?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 21:12:01	@whorephobia @JackAndAHat We need to get a new category of "insult" for variety. I propose "bent copper" to add to whore, pimp and John. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:51:20	@scotthamilton14 I confess you got me though. Nice one! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:51:07	@scotthamilton14 OI! I just googled him. Salvi was born in Canberra and played for the Brumbies. He couldn't be more Aussie with a cork hat

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:43:53	@scotthamilton14 Cruel. But oh so true. Are you using bragging rights on Salvi right now?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:40:53	@Sectioned_ ..pushback you are getting is ridiculous. Of course not all MH professionals are bad. So? Some are, and it's them we need to fix
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:40:19	@Sectioned_ ...and not be an MH clinician/practitioner. Self critique in the MH profession/associated professions is vital. I think this...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:39:06	@Sectioned_ Yikes! That's fucking terrible. I work on MH drugs, I design and make them. I'm about as familiar with MH lit as possible...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:35:33	@ool0n @The_Block_Bot @_NewseXtra They can use computers? The far right have never struck me as that imaginative or intelligent. I'm amazed!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:31:59	@zeno001 @rhysmorgan @noodlemaz Truth. I love London because you can get/do basically anything. The drawback is this requires lots of people
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:25:49	@michaellegge I thought you were that Shappi Khorsandi. I've always rather fancied you. Does that make me a bad person?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:23:24	@michaellegge Ah okay. No worries. Aside, I thought you were a famous comedian. Dammit don't let me down now!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:19:56	@michaellegge Have you got any info, or suggestions for things I could look at. Seriously. This is news to me, I'm not in the media/ent game
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 19:18:54	@whorephobia we'd have a genuine horde of girls being SWs at 13 if this were the case. Given the size of the SW cohort.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:50:02	@OwenJones84 @EverydaySexism @lbc973 I listened, it was astonishingly poo from Farage. Is he unaware these debates were had at the time?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:49:12	@JordanCrane86 @scotthamilton14 Are they using the new rules down there?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:47:35	@whorephobia My fave though is the myth that all SWs MUST be damaged and victims. That doesn't even stand a first pass analysis.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:46:57	@whorephobia How about the myth that a man must support rights/well being of SWs because he is a John. Male centric I know, sorry, but real
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:45:47	@Jess_chemgeek That is exceptionally cool.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:44:53	@danaequality But that's a polysyllable! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THOUGHT THAT TAKES? THIS.IS.TWITTER!!! You're asking for introspection!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:42:52	@call_me_cockers He was practically levitating.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:42:31	@T0m0akl3y actually, it's because I want to hit my mates and there are too few Beetles abut.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:42:07	@T0m0akl3y completely understandable. I am going to use this updated version because I need to, erm, follow youth trends? Or something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:35:36	@bobbyllew Aren't there some charming folks about? Why is what consenting adult people do with their genitals so upsetting to fools?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:34:03	@mjrobbins No worries, could you briefly follow me for a DM, please?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:32:14	@danaequality Oh crap! The RESPONSIBILITY!!! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:29:49	@danaequality We both know you mean me. It's okay, modesty is a vice like any other. ;-) Okay so not serious. Thank YOU for the education.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:27:48	@mjrobbins Sid and Tessa can vouch for me not being a total loon. Possibly!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:27:11	@mjrobbins Very true, I wonder.... ....okay you've got me thinking now. Fancy a pint and a chat sometime?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:25:26	@WelfordTheTiger But they seem like such even handed and NICE chaps.... ....wait. It's the other thing isn't it? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:24:48	@mjrobbins be = one, I have offended TYPO again.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:24:07	@mjrobbins about one here. But unsure about "density" etc as there is be in Reading
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:23:35	@mjrobbins Well, I have been THINKING about it for a while, doing....not so much! I used to go to London SitP a lot, and have wondered 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:22:23	@WelfordTheTiger OH OH Sue Cockers!! Or at least get the RFU to give him a right good telling off. That should improve his mood. {ducks}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:21:04	@willcarling I know! And going in with them when younger is just as fraught. Especially having to do explanations publicly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:19:40	@RespectSexWork Have a great and prosperous day, thanks for the fun chat!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:19:09	@mjrobbins Do you ever go for beer in Maidenhead and would you like to start/meet fellow sceptics etc here, in a kind of SitP fashion?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:17:50	@WelfordTheTiger I thin it's speciesist discrimination. They only left you out because you're a tiger.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:16:59	@RevRichardColes What did you do? Are you part of the militant wing of the CofE? You've done an opportunistic Harvest Festival haven't you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:14:24	@RespectSexWork I've only known 2 trans* people, both women, off the net. A few more on here. And tbh it is easier to ask questions here
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:12:54	@stuxnetsource I think this is one of the most important ones, because it is so easy to get defensive and claim intent is magic
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:12:09	@stuxnetsource I def do that, and the self examination thing. This has all come to me through feminism. So my eyes have been yanked open!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 18:09:30	@boobygraffoe But cocaine IN alcohol, that's fine....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:59:28	@stuxnetsource I'll take me personally for $1000 please, Alex ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:58:04	@RespectSexWork I can imagine. It really should not be your burden, unfortunately society lays it on you. Which is blisteringly wrong
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:56:58	@stuxnetsource @RespectSexWork I know it's a bit 101, and I have no right to ask for hand holding/ed, I can only ask people their prefs
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:55:40	@stuxnetsource @RespectSexWork With that tag I did a lot of shutting up and reading. My questions boil down to how can cis people help?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:52:59	@RespectSexWork I respect anyone's right to be as involved as much as they want. I can imagine that was a rough tag to follow
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:51:36	@RespectSexWork I have that effect on people! If you want me to shhhh please feel free to say so!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:50:44	@ool0n @SpokesGay @VitaBrevi Doesn't matter if I agree with him. Minimising harm is a good thing
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:50:16	@ool0n @SpokesGay @VitaBrevi That's a decent thing to do as you've done it openly and let others make their choice. Kudos.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:48:50	@RespectSexWork Just found it, #fuckcispeople . Some great stuff there, I learned a lot. I confess I know v little about trans* experience
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:45:51	@tessakendall It's not obvious from your writing?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:45:17	@RespectSexWork Have you been following...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:44:45	@RespectSexWork Have been following the recent hash tag can't remember name) about trans* anger and activism?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:43:17	@tessakendall Because you're really tall like them Swedish ladies? I should stress this is A Good Thing. Some facts may have been invented
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:41:33	@RespectSexWork Oops sorry. I'll either talk sense or shut up. Topic suggestion?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:40:43	@there_runsMary Oh indeed!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:40:17	@RespectSexWork See, I can turn any subject to chemistry and being serious. Honest. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:39:48	@RespectSexWork Well it is a mineral oil, thus indigestible, so it travels straight through. Like Olestra and similar fiascos. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:36:07	@RespectSexWork Oh yeah, I went there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:36:00	@RespectSexWork This is important stuff. It impinges on economics. Excess consumption of baby oil costs money and can cause anal seepage.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:34:46	@there_runsMary The previous tweet has much humour and winking smilies attached.. I just ran out of space.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:34:10	@there_runsMary Have you been reading that Daily Mail again? I've not noticed gangsters to be open handed, they usually take "cheap" options
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:32:31	@RespectSexWork {Does innocent look}.......{Fails}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:30:45	@RespectSexWork I was not going to make any comment about how much baby oil might get consumed! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:22:52	@Sectioned_ But...but...but...We're not all like that!!! I'm special, and it is SO all about me. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:20:50	@lbc973 @OwenJones84 Ah! That makes sense.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:20:28	@RichardDawkins Cruelty is usually proportional to insecurity. Kids often have less developed identities. Easily translates to adulthood.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:17:13	@RespectSexWork Ewwww! Wine ruins the taste of baby oil! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:16:06	@OwenJones84 Have you got a regular LBC spot now? If so, I've missed a trick!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:15:06	@RichardDawkins Saying that, I'm sure someone of your proclivities is already strongly anti cube harassment. Please use your voice loudly
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:14:00	@RichardDawkins It already has illegal elements, given your position in atheist community it would be great if you could speak out more. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:11:34	@RichardDawkins It's horrendous stuff that is also targeted at women, homosexual people, trans* people, people with disabilities. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:05:52	@T0m0akl3y @JamesHHolley @jthinks Is this an update to the ancient game of punchbuggy? I.e. you hit your mate every time you see a VW Beetle
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 17:04:30	@DeborahJaneOrr I really wanted him to be Labour leader as he seemed to come from the genuine Left. He's been a bit of a disappointment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 16:32:24	@RichardWiseman Wow! That is high praise indeed. All the cool kids know ducks are rad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 16:30:02	@Sectioned_ Wait. The world doesn't revolve around me? Are you calling my mother a liar? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 09:06:42	@SpokesGay Mind you, you are probably right about recalibration. It's 2am and all my subtlety is gone. I DID TOO HAVE SOME!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 09:05:33	@SpokesGay No more of a stretch than those nice people who have been having fun with us about feminism of late. I was parodying them. Honest
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 09:04:17	@SallyStrange Moi aussi. Mais je doit dormir beaucoup.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 09:02:20	@SpokesGay Racist. White beans are equally good. And don't get me started on kidney beans....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 09:01:26	@SallyStrange I do. You are Rebecca Watson. Or is it PZ Myers?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:53:45	@SallyStrange 2) The upside being that if you need a few moody two by fours you can usually find them easily. Bless our boys in hard hats!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:53:02	@SallyStrange 1) I don't know if it's the same in the US but here in the UK you can rely on builders to nick anything. They love a good nick
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:49:21	@SallyStrange 1 out of 2 ain't bad. Beer's good!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:47:44	@notahappyhooker Don't let it end shittily. I know some truly awful jokes! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:46:31	@RespectSexWork 3) So what can the average person do to help?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:45:44	@RespectSexWork 2) I think SW and PS need support because the law forces you into a vulnerable position potentially. Obviously not always.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:43:52	@RespectSexWork 1) Apropos of very little, I think PS and SW do a tough job. Not just because of nature of job but because of stigma and law
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:23:53	@stephenfry Also your daring friend...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:23:00	@notahappyhooker Am now thinking! Thanks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:20:00	@RespectSexWork 3) there must be some separation of self to maintain sanity. Over identifying could be dangerous. However, job could be fun
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:19:11	@RespectSexWork 2) part of me thinks it must be like any job to some extent, I also think like any service/caring/entertainment job...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:17:50	@RespectSexWork 1) I thought it might be the case I'm not a fan of the simplistic ideas of "Hurr hurr shagging" and "oh poor tortured thing"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:15:33	@notahappyhooker For those of us (blissfully?) ignorant of this person, who is she?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:13:07	@Puffles2010 I appreciate that, but I try to emulate the standards people set for themselves in discourse. Makes life more pleasant!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 08:10:17	@Puffles2010 I have just read Puffles' rules. My apologies for swearing in Puffles' presence, I played vastly too much rugby as a youth!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 07:56:37	@RespectSexWork Was the work psychologically easy? Did you have to detach yourself or did you enjoy it?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 07:01:27	@BoyGeorge Tragically true
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 06:44:21	@DeborahJaneOrr @thestephmerritt Oh definitely. Demanding little swine. Grow up already.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 06:43:52	@thestephmerritt @DeborahJaneOrr I would like to advance Alternate Misogyny: men are better than women so should do childcare. Hurrah! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 06:38:02	@DeborahJaneOrr @thestephmerritt It's obvious misogyny. Childcare=bad bcoz women do childcare. So any woman or man who does childcare=lesser
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 06:36:31	@DeborahJaneOrr @thestephmerritt Oh definitely. It's a universal shitfest. 140 chars not doing me justice tonight! 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 06:33:07	@DeborahJaneOrr @thestephmerritt This bit of sexism is common. Being a dad who took a career break to raise his kid gets you funny comments
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 06:23:56	@RevRichardColes Crikey! {blushes} Thanks very much.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 06:21:12	@debmarianne @RevRichardColes Oh don't worry! Apologies if my tweet seemed terse, I was confused, not tetchy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 06:15:47	@CCriadoPerez @stuxnetsource Because they are mindless, bigoted scum who need to face the consequences of their actions.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 06:10:52	@debmarianne @RevRichardColes My question was which one of the Rohan jackets is the dear Rev's. "No" is not even an answer to that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 05:57:56	@tkingdoll I love horror films, but the genre is rife with dodos. Any faves?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 05:53:31	@RevRichardColes out of curiosity which model of jacket is it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 01:50:54	@CCriadoPerez @FranS199 Context: it's a really really tough concept.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-17 00:03:29	@CCriadoPerez @boodleoops I enjoy conversing with people. But if they don't reply it's no big deal. Of course I cry myself to sleep... ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 23:46:03	@rebeccawatson Well colour me amazed. Some guy with a potential agenda that benefits from silencing women wants to silence a woman!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 22:51:18	@bmagnanti That's very kind, I will, thanks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 22:49:43	@bmagnanti {Embarassed} Yes I have and I'd forgotten. Goddamnit! Senility at 38. Thanks and forgive me bothering you!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 21:22:55	@tkingdoll Me neither, sadly. I do need to revisit though, it was fun for a while.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 21:21:51	@tkingdoll Deal. Do you still go to London SitP?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 21:03:11	@RevRichardColes I've had worse jobs in a restaurant. My parents own a restaurant. Indentured serviture in my teens would've been a step up
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 21:01:47	@Cliterati1 Does it show I've been dealing with misogynists a little too much of late?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 21:01:27	@Cliterati1 Just between us, what's the betting that criticism of these young women focusses on their looks as well as their odious bile?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 21:00:09	@Cliterati1 @MetroUK I'm off to read the article. That sounds very nasty.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 20:57:38	@Cliterati1 @MetroUK Targetting the abused is not an uncommon proselytising technique, sadly.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 17:53:45	@tkingdoll Is it a Poe?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 17:53:03	@danaequality Add me to the list of cis people NOT crying about this and using it as an opportunity to learn. Thanks for speaking out.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 17:52:21	@tkingdoll @garwboy Oh I don't know about that. Given the equipment a lady has, she can have as many penises as she likes. Good thing!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 07:27:03	@SpokesGay Take the matter in hand, dear boy. Or get someone to do it for you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 07:26:12	@bmagnanti So no 2am troll mock fest tonight? Probably for the best!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 07:20:32	@boobygraffoe That was brilliant, you may take the rest of the day off with an achievement like that. Bravo!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 06:41:34	@IamAustinHealey One of the horrors of depression is that improvement cannot be seen. It's a terrible state I wouldn't wish on anyone
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 06:39:30	@IamAustinHealey Nasty. I'm sorry, Austin, that must be horrible for all you passengers. My thoughts are with the poor person who did this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 05:26:11	@Puffles2010 @bmagnanti Puffles is god damn right! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 05:24:49	@bmagnanti @T0m0akl3y Not only that, the poor refuse to abase themselves on the street as I walk past. Don't they know I am paying for them?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 03:57:47	@docfreeride @drugmonkeyblog A fact for which I remain grateful. If anything could make me religious, thanking a just god for this fact...

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 01:21:06	@helenbiscuits @RevRichardColes Do you mean that Rev Coles is hated because he can afford things many cannot?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-16 01:14:28	@caitlinmoran @indiaknight @NivenJ1 okay dopey question from non media type: how does someone get membership at a place like this?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 23:05:39	@RevRichardColes @Welshracer I bemoan the lack of green ink since the internet. There should be an app that converts bilious text to green
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 23:04:04	@RevRichardColes @thehistoryb0y Ah yes, the classic theodicy. The Problem of Sniffles.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 22:58:35	@RevRichardColes It's not describing yourself as an "elite" in the sense of "better than", but in the sense of "inordinately privileged" 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 22:57:34	@RevRichardColes Crikey! You're getting a bit of pushback for what I confess I thought was an inoffensive, well understood term. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 22:30:52	@annaarrowsmith @bmagnanti @markawilliams As a sex toy I imagine it is used when the request "stick the shag bullet up my nose!" is shouted
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 21:53:21	@NickDoody Oh hell yes. Imagine the taxonomical wranglings in those meetings. "But is this TRULY anal mastery?" etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:32:53	@Sectioned_ And I am a frightful New Boy here!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:32:06	@NickDoody apart from academic study, I guess so. After all, money shots with one's supper are hardly conducive to digestion
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:31:11	@Sectioned_ Crikey! You are trying to kill me! ;-) There must be software for this! Give me a moment, I'll see what I can do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:30:01	@RevRichardColes I completely understand, and have done similar myself in the past (and no doubt will in future). Hope the cold vanishes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:28:02	@RevRichardColes Haha. I have Greek Cypriot relatives in the Orthodox Church who still trade on similar privilege.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:24:50	@RevRichardColes Also, you paid? Congratulations! You have just paid the national debt of Liberia if my experience of train prices is real

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:19:50	@tkingdoll I am hoping the gaming industry will be regulated against freemium business model. It's inherently exploitative IMO. (1/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:18:36	@RevRichardColes Ahhhh liberal guilt. An emotion I know well. How did you get the upgrade? Accidental Father Tedian use of dog collar?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:16:42	@Sectioned_ Better?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:15:20	@Sectioned_ 3)...controversial because it is contradicted by the evidence, not supported by "different" evidence, creates a false impression
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:14:42	@Sectioned_ 2)...suffers from the fallacy of the undistributed middle. In a very complex and nuanced subject, presenting material that is...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:13:20	@Sectioned_ 1) Uncritically republishing an article as contradicted by evidence as Will Self's recent piece on mental health and drugs is...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:11:22	@Sectioned_ I'll try! Twitter brevity is not (yet?) my strong suit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:05:43	@Sectioned_ Urgh typos. The Self piece is COUNTERED by the available evidence. Not counted.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:04:30	@Sectioned_ @FollowBDT Is that a little clearer?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:04:10	@Sectioned_ as equal, or giving equal weight, is actually an act of casting false equality, it is by nature partisan without intending to be
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:03:35	@Sectioned_ It is controversial because it is counted by the available evidence to an extraordinary degree. Hence presenting "both sides"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:03:03	@Sectioned_ of two equal it mutually opposed evidence based camps. The Self piece is not controversial because it is evidence supported
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:02:34	@Sectioned_ More than that, when drivel, which the Self piece is, is reported without factual contradiction, it creates the false impression
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 20:01:53	@Sectioned_ It was in support of what you said to BDT about the Self article. I.e uncritical "publishing" can be seen as endorsement
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 19:53:33	@Sectioned_ @FollowBDT which concept? The fallacy of the undistributed middle as it pertains to "neutrality" regarding Will Self's piece?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 19:51:18	@alandavies1 I shall not properly diet this week out of solidarity with you. No no. No need for thanks. Fight on, brother.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 19:49:15	@CCriadoPerez @RuthSeneviratne Now THAT is a nice piece of work. Well done!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 19:46:41	@FollowBDT @Sectioned_ It's called the fallacy of the false middle for a reason (or undistributed middle, etc)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 19:45:19	@FollowBDT @Sectioned_ I understand BDT's position, the problem, BDT, is that with some things apparent neutrality is far from neutral
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 19:02:44	@noodlemaz @VagendaMagazine @rhodri I'd assume it was a woman. Dating for men is bad, but hetero women... The shit you have to put up with
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:55:15	@gimpyblog If you find THAT let me know. A pro science party would be lovely. Not just lip service and budget cuts.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:49:01	@TSFullContact @premrugby The Leicester Tigers wingers, any of them. Because I am deeply biased, one eyed, and a Tigers fan. Did that show?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:43:53	Is it bad that this http:// pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.102 1/ol4015706 … is something that causes me to be profoundly excited?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:40:44	I will also claim to have noticed the onomatopoeic nature of trottelschande beforehand (LIES). It sounds like troll hooves on a bridge
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:38:47	@jailawrites I confess, I saw the word trottel in the dictionary and had to use it. This whole thing is a set up for that really!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:37:57	@bmagnanti True, true. But my followers, all three of them, who will protect them from my urges to mock the living bejeesus out of muppets?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:36:28	@noodlemaz @tessakendall The "Hurr Hurr believers are stoopid" misuse of the previous work are just that. GIGO
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:35:18	@noodlemaz @tessakendall well THAT article wasn't a bitter load of old shit because someone got their knickers in a knot was it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:34:06	@bmagnanti oh and the pomposity and faux erudition here is for laughs btw, dammit THAT has to be clear. I don't take myself that seriously
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:33:28	@bmagnanti although I am happy to cast off this Puritan indulgence ethic and modify the word based on more erudite input
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:32:57	@bmagnanti the shame comes from overindulgence. Its the slight guilt felt after drinking just that bit too much or having two slices of cake
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:28:52	5) I shall now await the international acclaim, book deals and sexual favours that are clearly my right. Or not.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 18:25:11	Okay, incoming twitterings. 1) Last night I indulged myself in mocking a troll on @bmagnanti 's stream. This morning I find myself...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 17:00:40	@noodlemaz Veni, legi, risi. Nice work, Centurion!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 16:54:48	@noodlemaz I NEED TO SEE THE SMACKDOWN! Sorry, Latinfests cause undue excitement in me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 10:07:12	@MelodyHensley @oakst3rdam Ditto. I'm not good with TV etc, I land on things accidentally. The Wire was an experimental choice that worked
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 09:58:54	@lousycanuck As an addendum to this, any individual that wants out of scepticism/atheism as a movement is okay by me. Not my place to decide
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 09:57:30	@MelodyHensley HERESY BURN THE UNBELIEVER! Actually given the death threats on Twitter scratch that LOOK AT THE UNBELIEVER IN A FUNNY WAY!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 09:54:50	@Protoplasmoid @lousycanuck I'll mock them back to the Dark Ages! When I can be bothered of course. It does get boring occasionally.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 09:53:40	@MelodyHensley Nearly as good, IMO, as The Wire. Which I think is the best TV ever.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 09:53:10	@MelodyHensley I've never seen the non-Danish version, didn't know there was one! You're in for a treat, the Danish Killing is brilliant.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 09:44:43	@stuxnetsource @vandeand @FeministRoar Since when did treating others like human beings become a zero sum game? Oh right. Never. That's when
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 09:42:21	@lousycanuck More than that, we have the facts, we have the logic. Fuck them, they'll blink first and go into history as the bigots they are
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 09:41:11	@lousycanuck The movement is not dying, nor should it. I am not ceding it to misogynist scum. I know a lot of people here who feel likewise
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 09:39:24	@lousycanuck "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win" Gandhi So no. But we are cutting dead wood
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 09:37:41	@ingdamnit Me too at the moment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 09:34:01	@ingdamnit You got the blockbot? I haven't yet, but with occasional slyme infections I have considered it.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:48:38	@jdav101 @bmagnanti Anyway, as fun as time spent mocking the witless is, I'm off for much needed beauty sleep. Have wonderful nights all.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:47:40	@jdav101 @bmagnanti You think? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I'm not sure you'd pass the Turing test.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:44:25	@bmagnanti @jdav101 Although, if he referred to you as dollface or sweetheart, we'd have a better idea. I'm easy with either interpretation
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:43:37	@bmagnanti @jdav101 maybe my limited experience, but when douchenozzles break out "pal" and "mate" for no reason, they have overheated.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:41:37	@jdav101 @bmagnanti I certainly won't, have no fear. For example, I can distinguish between your and you're. Even an iPhone can do that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:38:14	@jdav101 @bmagnanti I ask because this is clearly a masturbation aid for you. Also, protip: calling people pal does not make you sound hard
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:36:46	@jdav101 @bmagnanti What? I have to watch Newsnight if it's on iPlayer. Can we hurry this up? Have you reached the vinegar strokes yet?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:33:49	@vandeand @jdav101 @bmagnanti Your Ferrari doesn't tweet for you? What are you? Poor? My Bugatti tweets and updates my Facebook page.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:32:21	@jdav101 @bmagnanti Referring to easily understood cultural coinage is weakness? Awww but we were getting along so well!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:31:12	@jdav101 @bmagnanti How do you know your friend has an iPhone? HE FUCKING TELLS YOU.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:30:25	@bmagnanti @jdav101 They're coming. He was just lent the iPhone by his karate student who mentioned the size of his package. Trufax
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:28:05	@jdav101 @bmagnanti We're mates now? Can we braid each others' hair and giggle about ponies? FABulous!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:25:31	@jdav101 @bmagnanti @fornicatrix What amazes me, is with all this Internet to play in, some losers think harassing people is all it's for.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:23:55	@jdav101 @bmagnanti is taking the piss something to be scared of? Crikey. I never knew that. You must be projecting something awful.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:16:33	@bmagnanti @jdav101 Is "blozza" tough? I thought it just meant he couldn't spell blow job.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:15:47	@bmagnanti I see you have your own egg this evening. How sweet. He's got all cuddly too. Are you toying with him before the block?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:13:23	@onesarahjones @SpokesGay @MelodyHensley My fave: I KILL YOU = joke. Guys don't do that = FEMINAZI OPPRESSION "Reason". Yeah... /sarcasm
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:09:51	@CarriePoppyYES @ool0n {wipes sweat from brow} phew! In the current climate I do not want to add to any cool person's burden. :-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:08:50	@SpokesGay @onesarahjones I am HAPPY to be cleaning house. If my house contains misogynists etc, then I want it clean. Give me those rifts!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:08:07	@SpokesGay @onesarahjones That is a stunningly great piece. Thanks for writing it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:02:02	@uberfeminist Hi, could you untag me from this, I blocked bête. I have enough stupid in my life to be going on with. Ta! Good luck!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 08:00:52	@heatherlabonte Oh yes! Where does he get those wonderful toys? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:59:52	@heatherlabonte @CarriePoppyYES I'd agree. P.S. could you untag me in this please? I blocked bête, I have enough stupid to cope with! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:57:12	@heatherlabonte Oops my mistake! You were replying to the bête fellow right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:56:34	@heatherlabonte Batman? If only I had his money.....{sigh} Anyway, you people really are determined to make me use this blockbot, eh?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:55:01	@jdav101 @bmagnanti Oh did the point go above your head? Because I got it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:43:05	@bmagnanti @ffffelix Oh but THAT is just BBC "balance". Like when they get the homeopaths on.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:42:11	@amandapalmer And the Daily Mail shits itself to death upon seeing this. Good!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:36:15	@Chemjobber A-fucking-MEN!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:32:24	@CarlieP Some of the previous tweet may not be true. Non-zero success rate! Pah!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:31:40	@CarlieP This is not true sadly. I have tested it in Many bars. I can claim only a 1% success rate before my Mrs catches me and kicks my ass
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:28:07	@iandstone I get those enlarge your penis ones. It's bad enough getting them from my wife, but my mother too, that's just cruel.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:24:41	@ool0n @CarriePoppyYES I ignored bête. I have no need for more stupid in my life. I was trying to be supportive, Carrie. Hope I didn't fail.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:22:50	@CarlieP Luckily I love everyone. Well, except people I don't love. Natch.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:19:31	@CarriePoppyYES Me?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:19:10	@CarriePoppyYES I wish you didn't have to worry about all this. These guys are just desperate to deny the reality of cultural misogyny.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:18:07	@CarriePoppyYES Isn't it weird that the null hypothesis for misogynists is some conspiracy? Rape is sadly common, false accs very rare. DUH
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:16:54	@CarlieP All my time exploiting the free booze fill ups at ladies nights when I was in the states taste different to me now...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:15:41	@betepolitique @CarriePoppyYES And with that, adieu, Bete. You're just too damn stupid to tolerate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:14:52	@betepolitique @CarriePoppyYES Oh FFS that is stupid. Rapists do things to drunk (or sober) people. Drink driving is the drunk person acting
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:12:26	@betepolitique @CarriePoppyYES PZ has little to do with A+, and conspiracy theories aren't exactly parsimonious. Anything else? Or trolling?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:11:07	@CarlieP Are you telling me booze doesn't contain penis? I am shocked...shocked I tell you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:10:08	@lousycanuck But he would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for those meddling victims with their tempting drinking habits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:08:36	@betepolitique @CarriePoppyYES So what? All that means is Jane Doe didn't google effectively. It's not the pointer to a conspiracy or fraud.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:04:37	@szvan I'm not sure they'll believe it until it happens on their heads. Even then they'd blame the victim for sitting on a misogynist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 07:01:21	@CarriePoppyYES I know he works with Shermer, so would stick up for friend, but this ain't the way to do it. You must be Very disappointed.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 06:37:29	@bmagnanti @jdav101 [Attenborough] And. Here. In the Twitter. We have a misogynist troll. Look at it play with its own faeces and act daft
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 05:24:51	@CarlieP @UnknownEric @Doubting_Tom True. But the fact we agree on this is fucking tragic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 05:01:08	@CarlieP @UnknownEric @Doubting_Tom Guess what! It's good news! If by good news you mean being a rape apologist.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 04:44:55	@UnknownEric @Doubting_Tom Oh I have taken my ball and gone home for the day.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 03:47:56	@UnknownEric @Doubting_Tom Oh definitely. I am livid about it, especially as I'm a bit diverse! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 03:47:05	@LauraLevites Okay, the last part isn't true. I'm bloody gorgeous.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 03:46:34	@LauraLevites I'd do my best to help out but I cannot play the bagpipes, the food would be cold after the 6 hour drive, and am deeply ugly!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 03:43:00	@UnknownEric @Doubting_Tom 4/2...going for most inaccurate tweet prediction! I am unwilling to cede sceptic/atheist moniker to sexists
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 03:42:16	@UnknownEric @Doubting_Tom 3/2...fuck! ;-) But yes, there are too many loud, misogynist fuckwits in the sceptic/atheist movement.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 03:41:41	@UnknownEric @Doubting_Tom Because some sceptics are misogynists, like many in wider society, chucking baby out with bathwater = bad. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 03:40:26	@UnknownEric @Doubting_Tom To be briefly serious, whilst I KNOW what you are saying, I am not a fan of shitting on a diverse community 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 03:29:45	@Doubting_Tom I'm pissed off about Shermer and Mr Deity. Heroes with feet of clay, sure. But (likely) rapist and rape apologist? Ewww.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 03:14:32	@dELYSEious Oh fuck now I'm going to have to omit Mr Deity from my to watch/read list. Fuck. I liked him.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 03:11:11	@SpokesGay You have my sympathy, Josh. Get well soon.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 03:10:10	@JohnCleese Sorry for your loss, Mr Cleese. I hope you are as well as possible.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 02:50:02	@guardianscience Basically, I think you're right. Literally.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 02:48:02	@bmagnanti @ntolman Or perhaps "Libellous Fuckwittery in One Easy Step".
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 02:47:05	@bmagnanti YOU WORE JUMPERS AS A STUDENT!!!!?!?! IS THERE NO END TO YOUR VILE CALUMNY!?! Next we'll discover you drink a pint in the union.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 02:43:29	@bmagnanti @howardhardiman Knitting and weightlifting? The mental images...they are hurting me!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 01:58:29	@whorephobia @Beau_Tox @danaequality Agreed. It is possible to have an intellectual position on an issue and not have a nefarious agenda.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 01:52:40	@SpokesGay @UnknownEric @ool0n Balance is important. For every doctor who treats a patient we must get a homoeopath consult, right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 00:38:18	@ool0n @SpokesGay Must be space lizards then. Global conspiracy of feminazi space lizards. It's the most parsimonious sceptical position.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 00:35:55	@ool0n @SpokesGay You sir are a gent. I should check that thread about a London meet up. I stuck a post on it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 00:35:12	@ool0n @SpokesGay If that's what happened. After all it could be a conspiracy involving PZ and space lizards and RW etc blah drone waffle.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 00:34:26	@ool0n @SpokesGay I haven't installed this block bot thing yet, I guess I just haven't pissed off enough muppets. How do I see who's in it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 00:20:01	@noodlemaz @TerriChu @EverydaySexism It needed to be done quickly. Someone was going to get there.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 00:16:26	@noodlemaz @TerriChu @EverydaySexism FUCK ME! I must be a GENIUS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 00:13:43	@clarkecarlisle5 Thank you for the work you're doing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-15 00:04:43	@bmagnanti Another thought. People are quite happy to shout abuse at women in the street too. Being male it took me a while to remember that
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 23:59:04	@bmagnanti @tessakendall @vaughanbell I rewired my brain one balmy summer's eve. And indeed, again later the same day. WITHOUT A COMPUTER!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 23:57:41	@tessakendall @RevRichardColes Hey! You charge me to get in! I think, maybe, I'm not sure. Okay, you get free lemon curd, but keep it quiet
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 23:56:39	@bmagnanti Given that Prof Greenfield's claims also apply to pogosticks and bananas: neuroluddism? Webquackery? Diadictuophobia?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 23:45:21	@bmagnanti Prof Greenfield is winning. Hasn't she been banging on about this for over a decade? Kookier than a creationist. Well done! 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 23:44:16	@bmagnanti Creationist Paul Nelson has this thing called "Ontogenetic Depth" we're still waiting for. 10 years now. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 23:41:33	@bmagnanti Prof Greenfield clearly hasn't included e.g. Facebook in her studies. People are perfectly odious under their own names. 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 23:40:11	@bmagnanti Wait...anonymity on the internet is to blame for the RISE of anonymous trolling on the internet? Profound. 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 23:35:19	I need a visit to the Natural History Museum. And a behind the scenes tour. Deeply exciting stuff. I saw Darwin's stuffed pet tortoise once
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 23:16:51	@tessakendall @RevRichardColes Locations are tedious details. And I can do lemon curd...for a price.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:35:22	@indiaknight I've just thought about the state of the pigeons. This might clean them up! #EnvironmentallyHelpfulPranksPerhaps
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:33:40	@indiaknight For BBC style balance, they should sell red dye too. Fastest fan set to make a flag from existing white foam wins. No violence.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:32:22	@indiaknight May I point out that none of my suggestions are based on my student pranks? That is right out, Your Honour. (No dye, amateurs)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:29:48	@lbc973 @indiaknight I cannot help but approve. Not out of nationalism or anything like it. I just love a prank. Now add the food dye.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:27:43	@noodlemaz Damn! An otherwise foolproof idea foiled. How about a kiss (on the cheek) from each of the bar staff at each venue?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:25:28	@noodlemaz Is pub toilet seat over the disgusting line...and I guess the illegal line too?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:15:17	@Beau_Tox @whorephobia @danaequality Ah. I tend to disagree (understatement) with TERFs et al. I hope it can be kept reasonable though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:13:34	@davidpkeeling @caitlinmoran That too. And since it was in France, surely a "Barmy Brussels Bureaucrats" angle to be worked in.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:12:39	@RevRichardColes @tessakendall Not a problem, your Reverence. I'll put you down for the usual rate. A nod's as good as a wink to a blind bat
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:11:24	@RespectSexWork One of the most important things about scholarship is the ability to communicate findings to others.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:09:45	@caitlinmoran "Only uglies boot pigeons" says controversial feminist icon Moran. Daily Mail furore ensues! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:08:35	@Beau_Tox @whorephobia @danaequality Certainly not fan of anything or anyone who favours "shut up you stupid bitch" as part of any discourse
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:07:35	@Beau_Tox @whorephobia @danaequality Not a fan of some/many elements of radfem. Prefer to engage arguments rather than labels. Your point?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 22:02:58	@caitlinmoran Beauty can be cruel.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 21:56:06	@RevRichardColes @tessakendall Vicar Added Tax, surely?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 21:55:46	@RevRichardColes @tessakendall Your cake tithing does your ancestor proud. (I am impressed by the tithe book. Nice connection to history)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 21:50:08	@RevRichardColes @tessakendall I thought you chaps were mostly done with tithing and what not. I am disappointed. I am prepared to go to 10%
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 21:48:44	@Beau_Tox @whorephobia @danaequality Nah. MRAs exist + even occasionally poison actual discussion. Unlike most accusations of pimphood
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 21:32:47	@bmagnanti Not only am I curious but by a strange coincidence I have an iconic bridge for sale!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 21:19:07	@ajhmurray Surely he should have upped the anti on previous Labour political fracas and nutted him. Minimum. I'd favour putting the boot in.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 21:15:29	@LauraLevites DId you get your food delivery yesterday? More to the point, did you get a nice chap in a kilt to deliver it and so much more?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 21:11:38	@RevRichardColes @tessakendall Excellent. Let the civilised revolution commence! Scone?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 21:10:31	@Beau_Tox @whorephobia @danaequality Not just that, even if middle class and educated, must be in agreement, otherwise pimp. (or John or...)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 21:09:58	@danaequality @whorephobia Aren't TERFs generally notorious for ascribing pimphood to anyone who disagrees, no matter how principled?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 21:07:09	@RevRichardColes @tessakendall You're welcome. But of course, you do know that when the revolution comes... ...you'll be invited for tea.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 19:45:10	@RevRichardColes @tessakendall 4) In media noise, signal about cautious use of meta-analyses is lost. Biases + conflict model reinforced
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 19:43:37	@RevRichardColes @tessakendall 3) More than that, even an evangelical atheist like me knows religious people are not stupid/more stupid.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 19:42:30	@RevRichardColes @tessakendall 2) Whole nations with IQs averaging around 50-70 etc. Really obvious howlers made to support agendas.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 19:41:23	@RevRichardColes @tessakendall 1) If you look at the stats behind it, it's derived partly from highly flawed research behind The Bell Curve
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 19:35:23	@FollowBDT Very similar to my "story". I was 34 before diagnosis. I thought extremes of mood were normal and other people too slow!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 19:11:19	@tkingdoll I have not been emailing my mother about my penis size. Not that I have any adverts for that, obviously. Erm, look over there!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 17:25:20	@CCriadoPerez Just heard you on @BBCWomansHour . You sounded eminently reasonable. For a two headed man hating feminazi...obviously. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 17:22:16	@4amcab It's also more expensive than the cake, which is a terrible filter.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 16:28:23	@ColinJE23 @CCriadoPerez Tory govt that's run the racist van campaign. They're a bit brown. It's not hard to figure out the "problem".

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 03:44:58	@tkingdoll You had to do it. Okay....pass the hat. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 03:43:03	@tkingdoll 10:1 they ran it because of the picture. When the Mail becomes a bastion of women's rights and anti rape culture, I'll eat my hat

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 03:14:50	@LauraLevites I've lived in NYC, I sympathise. I can do anger, but itching myself over my shoulder with my teeth eludes me! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 03:05:15	@LauraLevites Sounds good! I've tried one, the itch behind the shoulder a bit unless they've been tailored. And it is SO hard to get that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 03:02:50	@LauraLevites This just means I HAVE to see your show even more. Are you touring outside of the fringe?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 02:57:07	@Crommunist Vastly. Their presence detracts from the overall sum of human endeavour.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 02:56:38	@LauraLevites Cool. And who doesn't? Our paths are strewn with fuckwits. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 02:50:25	@LauraLevites You okay?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 02:49:51	@Crommunist Never overestimate the wit of the Pit.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-14 02:49:29	@Crommunist It's easy. You like Myers. You also now like Ken. Ken did not like Myers. Something to do with toys and prams. Ergo you're bad.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-13 22:05:35	@CCriadoPerez @spikedonline Indeed. It takes a lot of effort though. I can't imagine spending effort to be that ignorant. Such a waste.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-13 21:53:02	@CCriadoPerez @spikedonline I'm not sure why simple patterns of behaviour, of which twitter abuse is but one example, are hard to see.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-13 19:53:36	@IamJadehawk yeah, if you can do it, go with what works.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-13 19:53:22	@IamJadehawk There are "mild" meds. When I'm having a few days of insomnia, I use them to reset my pattern. Usually works.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-13 19:51:23	@IamJadehawk Clearly you live in an area of alcohol bigotry. The State needs to free the people's booze. And also convenient snacks.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-13 19:47:19	@IamJadehawk Also, insomnia OUCH. You're still suffering badly eh? Any medical help available to you?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-13 19:46:32	@IamJadehawk My motto is: it's always evening somewhere. Just get yourself in an Indian frame of mind. It's about 17:15 there now.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-13 06:09:25	@Doubting_Tom It's like the bit by Lewis Black where he mocks Clinton for taking his state from 50th to 49th in education. It's not GOOD!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-13 05:54:53	@Herring1967 Got to be closely chased by The Wire, if not beaten.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-13 05:43:38	@docfreeride No, no,no. FAR too complicated. All women have to do is keep quiet. Just silence ~51% of the world's population. Simple.... Oh

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-10 21:07:23	I see rape apologetics and missing the point are very fashionable today. Excuse me whilst I toddle off and get very drunk.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-10 07:41:35	@stephenfry Mr Fry, your Daily Mail/Dacre piece was sublime. Superlative. In fact, there aren't enough superlatives. I think I agree!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-09 19:53:38	@caitlinmoran @suzanne_moore Oh for fuck's sake. A distance of a few millimetres maybe, and you know what, don't get that close on the road

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-09 19:08:16	@DeborahJaneOrr @AllyFogg The war of men against women? Oh fuck, we men are on the losing team. This means fighting my mum. Not a hope.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-09 17:38:44	@bmagnanti @brokenbottleboy Oh if only that were true. I do a bloody good impression of wholesome. Okay, it's merely mediocre.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-09 16:39:50	@caitlinmoran Already a fan, but have recently bought your books. I have basically weed myself laughing every chapter. Thanks for that! :-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-09 15:37:57	@RevRichardColes Despite the sarcasm, you are one of those lovely vicars. Because that parent should have had the vuvuzela inserted by now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-09 15:36:03	@mjrobbins My fave is complaints about swearing when something much more serious is going on. Been shot inna face? Sure but don't say fuck.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-09 15:34:51	@RichardWiseman @tessakendall Now THAT is a mental image. Don't get me wrong, Richard, you're stunning. But post coital panda? Deary me no.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-09 01:16:50	@littleatoms Don't be silly. Bongobongoland isn't real so tweets about it can't be racist unlike Muslims.. ..wait, I've fucked up haven't I?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-09 00:58:42	@jimalkhalili You should be burned at the steak.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 22:13:51	@wordgeeksarah @__ezzy__ @CCriadoPerez WHAT!? When did this happen? Next you'll be telling me women aren't here to serve men! [/sarcasm]

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 21:45:09	@WelfordTheTiger No. Very, very no. I wonder how the old bugger is doing? He's always been a hero of mine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 21:41:26	@CCriadoPerez we'd be a lot better off. Violation of consent is never the victim's fault, and it's about time people knew that 3/3
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 21:40:52	@CCriadoPerez teach him this. If we focused on teaching our sons respect for women, and less on teaching daughters to wear longer skirts 2/3
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 21:39:41	@CCriadoPerez Nice one. I have a son. In my mind the burden is on him to obtain real, enthusiastic consent. The burden is also on me to 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 21:35:07	@DeborahJaneOrr Personally speaking, they don't go far enough. Anyone for racial repatriation should be sent back to the hydrothermal vents
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 21:31:35	@stephenfry @nickgriffinmep Hard for him to grasp? No. Hard for him to allow himself to admit through a veil of bitter hatred? Yes.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 21:30:19	@nickgriffinmep @stephenfry Hating gay people is traditional? What rights are being infringed? Persecuting gay people isn't a right.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 07:00:07	@rebeccawatson I was wondering when someone would put those two things together. Well, I say wondering...it was kind of inevitable.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 06:29:11	@blakestacey @szvan @pzmyers Now THAT was some framing

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 04:13:48	@CCriadoPerez Neo-nazi racist? I confess I haven't noticed that, and I'm usually pretty spot on with that old shit. ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 04:06:56	@CarlieP Okay, I am SO guilty of that.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 03:14:18	@CarlieP Yeah, you're right. I'm getting paranoid! No, not about being bloody named! LOL I just don't trust the fuckers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 03:09:37	@CarlieP After all, what's to stop some wag claiming RW harassed him at a con? Nothing. And we all know these folk love their tu quoques.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 03:08:41	@CarlieP Yeah, I have zero sympathy for harassers, but worried that claim/counterclaim can be used as a tool of harassment.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 03:06:57	@CCriadoPerez Do what previous generations have done, inflict massive psychological trauma on them to keep shrinks in business.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 03:04:15	@CCriadoPerez Actually, have you considered the "I know your dad" gambit? It worked when I were a lad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 02:59:46	@CCriadoPerez I see. The kids are on your lawn, with their music. And hair. And their whole lives before them. Bastards. I'm not bitter!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 02:58:43	@CCriadoPerez I am torn between "I hope not!" and the notion that if ignorance is bliss, she's ecstatic. All the way to the bank.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 02:57:14	@CCriadoPerez I see the consensus is that sharing is caring. A friend with weed is a friend indeed....erm apparently. Oh look over there....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 02:55:39	@CarlieP I confess I worry how unsupported name and shame could be misused. I do love how it gives demonstrated cockroaches nowhere to hide.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 02:54:00	@CCriadoPerez You do have to admit that Ms Hopkins is a stomach churningly unpleasant human being. Nasty and contrarian for no good reason.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 01:31:49	@guardian Colour me very sceptical. He doesn't understand why it's racist, he excused his bigotry with age, and was unrepentant on TV.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 01:16:58	@JessTheChemist The answer to that questions is always "yes". Always.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-08 00:50:50	@bmagnanti But think of the views. I am talking about highland views, living as I believe you do in a nice bit of Scotland. Compensation?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 22:40:06	@SpokesGay I am VERY sceptical. For example, when that nice chap told me the Brave Hero into was ironic, I didn't believe him. No footprints
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 22:39:14	@JackofKent Doesn't that at least indicate that this "complex issue" contains some simple malfeasance?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 22:37:41	@DeborahJaneOrr Ah but have you seen the people complaining it's all too complicated and subtle and the MEDIA have been naughty...yeah. No.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 22:36:40	@SpokesGay Well I am mad at the sceptics who call out the sceptics who call out harassers. I AM EVEN MORE SCEPTICEST THAN EVERYONE!

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 22:12:57	@amandapalmer @DMReporter I'm astounded at the level of wrong the DM can be on almost any issue. Even Pauli's "not even wrong" is not enough

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 21:28:41	@MitchBenn Ridiculous! The very idea! Lady persons doing SciFi type things in books instead of wholesome ironing? Why it's madness. MADNESS!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 21:23:25	@robinince You know what will happen, you'll wait ages for one person, then three will turn up at once.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 21:20:41	@SidRodrigues Ah, in that case I retract any objections to the sado part. In fact I would like it on record that I support it utterly! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 20:53:01	@SidRodrigues But obviously I'll....{ahem}....read the article linked in your previous tweet now and, you know, form a proper opinion. SHAME
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 20:52:00	@SidRodrigues I question only the sado part.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 20:51:19	@DeborahJaneOrr Is it basically okay to issue bomb threats for this sort of behaviour I wonder? They've been issued for less.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 20:36:47	@DeborahJaneOrr My personal fave is "Basically". It's meaningless, superfluous, and almost always contradictory. I hate it when I use it.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 17:00:33	@ElsieAssap @CCriadoPerez Nah, planking required minor bravery and strong abs. Abusing women requires cowardice and entitlement. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:59:22	@CCriadoPerez 2)... a moral panic, then I am a banana dare I say it. Very real, very misogynistic silencing is an observable fact.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:58:35	@CCriadoPerez 1) I don't like moral panics, and yes, media pogroms can be destructive. But if any attempt to improve the lot of women is...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:55:15	@CCriadoPerez Does it show I'm a fan?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:54:37	@CCriadoPerez 3) not because Spiked/Brendan are controversial. They're mostly wrong, effortlessly contrarian and overly sensitive.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:53:27	@CCriadoPerez 2) It/he falls into the category of entities I would not trust with the intellectual equivalent of a cup of lukewarm piss.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:51:54	@CCriadoPerez 1) Spiked, and Brendan, have almost universally been a watchword for crappy thinking wrapped in pompous pseudo erudition.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:49:43	@garwboy @rpg7twit @JennyRohn Congrats to the both of you.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:45:03	@gilescoren @EverydaySexism Not very scary if one is not a sexist. I think they do some pretty damned good work. But I know what you mean
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:42:09	@EdzardErnst Can I be the first to make a joke about a happy ending? Or is that an innuendo too far?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:39:14	@sousan50 Now that is. Wonderful sentiment I can get behind. You have a great day too! (And now I want ice cream)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:38:28	@sousan50 2) I think that's what we are seeing here in the UK (and elsewhere) a general trend towards silly right wing loons because of fear
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:37:23	@sousan50 1) I am no historian but I have heard it said with some reliability that in times of strife politics errs rightwards.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:31:42	@sousan50 ZOUNDS! What a total charmer.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:27:04	@Aiannucci For me? I'm blown away, that's very generous. I'll have to go and see it now.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:25:46	@sousan50 oooh a fan of the death penalty! He's bound to continue his trajectory towards my "Most Enlightened Person of the Year". ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:24:15	@garwboy This UKIP excrescence is a hair's breadth away from describing people as "fuzzy wuzzies". Isn't there a knackers yard for him?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:21:33	@mrjamesob I'm wondering why we have to pretend UKIP isn't just the BNP on tweed and with posher accents and better table manners.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 16:14:48	Bongo Bongo land? Fuck me deftly! Do we still have to pretend that UKIP isn't the BNP on tweed with slightly better accents and manners?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 09:24:04	@WowbaggerOM That was silliness btw. I am English. I have to know about cricket, it's the law. I was being silly because 2 am and insomnia
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 09:21:36	@WowbaggerOM Don't oppress me with facts. I am choosing to be mathematically hypersceptical.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 09:16:34	@mistressmatisse Pervert! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 09:16:10	I have decided this for Reasons. Important Reasons.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 09:15:34	I have decided not to understand how England have retained the Ashes. If the Aussies win the next 2 both teams have 2 wins and 1 draw.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 09:03:44	7) who won't resort to using a legal cudgel to seek redress when wounded.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 09:02:52	6) It is rare, in my admittedly limited experience, to find someone who defends a very libertarian interpretation of "free speech" and...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 09:01:30	5) Even though, to the libertarian mindset, such impositions seem tyrannous, they're much less tyrannous when they benefit said libertarians
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 08:57:10	@SallyStrange @center4inquiry Oh so very thoroughly agreed with, Sally. My money has already gone elsewhere.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 08:50:46	4) these are actions that can, and frequently do, cause harm. Hence they are illegal/punishable by wider society as inimical to society
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 08:49:41	3) some types of behaviour cross the blurry line from responsible to irresponsible. Drink driving, being a sexist knobhead on the web, etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 08:48:40	2) to harm anyone with their threats, although I think that is very debatable. The threats are not mere trolling after all. But they can do.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 08:47:50	1) Think of it like this: a drunk driver likely does not intend to kill someone when driving. A "humorous" Internet troll might not intend
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 08:46:41	Haters gonna hate. But people who send death and rape threats are not mere haters and need to go to prison. It really is that simple.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 08:42:17	@OpheliaBenson @kausikdatta22 @DaylightAtheism Ahhhh the Have I Got News For You/Private Eye method. Allegedly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 08:26:12	@kausikdatta22 @OpheliaBenson @DaylightAtheism we're in the libel Dark Ages here.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 08:25:27	@kausikdatta22 @OpheliaBenson @DaylightAtheism In the UK, the truth is no defence against a charge of libel. Yes, we are trying to change it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 08:07:42	@OpheliaBenson @kausikdatta22 @DaylightAtheism are we skirting close to libel by naming him? Crappy UK libel laws being what they are
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 07:35:57	@kausikdatta22 @OpheliaBenson @DaylightAtheism That's the one PZ linked, so, yeah, read it. Depressing. Especially the bit about the lawyer
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 07:31:08	@DerrenBrown But glad a) audience was good, and b) time travel is possible (although it's Wednesday now)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 07:30:14	@DerrenBrown ZOMG!! You had enough characters left to spell "especially" properly and you didn't. Please wait while twitter melts down.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 07:22:19	@Nigelrefowens It might eliminate the hit a bit, but that's a lot of strain on the props. Good to see hooking will presumably feature again
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 07:19:19	@lecanardnoir This presumes the capacity for effectiveness and following through a rational thought on the part if Hunt.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 07:16:24	@OpheliaBenson @DaylightAtheism Neither does religion and no one objected to scrutin.... ...oh....wait. Forget I said anything
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 06:41:59	@DaylightAtheism @OpheliaBenson I've never got those sceptics who think cultural norms and social phenomena are not open to scepticism
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 05:37:10	@clownshoe @apmcnally @SpokesGay @dELYSEious HOW DARE YOU!!!!!! Oh...erm...right.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 04:57:45	@clownshoe @apmcnally @SpokesGay @dELYSEious I say this because there's a lot of unironic self appointed "defenders of free speech" etc
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 04:55:04	@clownshoe @apmcnally @SpokesGay @dELYSEious Really? I sincerely hope so! But given the self applied Brave Hero title, forgive my scepticism
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 03:25:32	@SaraLinWilde @OpheliaBenson It is their Purpose.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 03:07:20	@SaraLinWilde @OpheliaBenson 2) At social functions. Mainly to scare off religious conservatives.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 03:06:50	@SaraLinWilde @OpheliaBenson 1) As a man, I normally don't have a womb, but since I was called a feminist by someone I have been wearing one
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 03:05:58	@SaraLinWilde @OpheliaBenson That was very nice of them. For given values of the word "nice". I favour the value "patronisingly stupid"
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 02:38:17	@apmcnally @SpokesGay @dELYSEious Now you've reminded me of the time I listened to THAT podcast. The one that quotes Churchill with no irony
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 02:35:42	@OpheliaBenson Apparently sexism and misogyny are over. I saw it on Pharyngula. I may have misunderstood that post.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 01:06:50	5) Surely it depends on context and on the message being sent. How hard is this to grasp?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 01:06:32	4) No one was forced to be silent, no one was forced to tweet, no need for vileness. Silence, or not, can be one tactic among many.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 01:05:46	3) What's so bad about a pluralistic approach where different styles send different messages and cater to different demographics?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 01:05:17	2) Take the farrago over the recent Twitter silence. Some people have been actually hateful about a differing style of activism.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 01:04:37	1) Maybe this will sound daft, but I don't get hate. There's people I don't like, and I am sufficiently privileged not to get justified hate
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 01:01:52	@empathywarrior @Crommunist Seconded. And may I add that the negative "press" the friendzone gets is daft. More friends are a GOOD thing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-07 00:09:56	@Chemjobber Clearly you are an enemy of the small businessman! Joking apart, I was actually accused of exactly that when refusing to bribe
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 22:47:30	@bobbyllew Pigeons?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 22:46:04	@bmagnanti Physical impossibilities aside, I am amused by the idea of very middle class tramps drinking Pimms outside M&S.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 22:41:09	@Chemjobber Curses! Foiled at the entrepreneurial stage! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 22:12:55	@hugepinkbrains @CCriadoPerez @dawncharles @rickygervais @caitlinmoran I'm being sarcastic and mean about misogynists.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 22:08:52	@Chemjobber If you, errr, make a contribution to my campaign fund, I can arrange an opportunity for you to bribe many people!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 22:07:05	@jailawrites Gets you both ways doesn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 22:01:25	@hugepinkbrains @CCriadoPerez @dawncharles @rickygervais @caitlinmoran men to harass them in the first place. Women's anger time travels 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 22:00:57	@hugepinkbrains @CCriadoPerez @dawncharles @rickygervais @caitlinmoran Of course not! It's women being angry after the fact that causes 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 21:58:14	4) someone with 1 million followers gets 10% result at 50p a go, that's 50k to a good cause.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 21:54:46	3) But not mention this beforehand. I suppose I view this as a psych expt.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 21:51:12	2) not money for a prespecified purpose. Just money. I wonder if trust would extend that far. The big fish would obviously donate to charity
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 21:49:48	1) I have often wondered if the hugely popular high profile twitterati could ask for, say, 50p from each follower and get a significant sum
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 21:39:46	@jailawrites I am in desperate need of it today too! I forget it a lot.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 21:32:46	@neilhimself @scalzi Have you attached a webcam to yourself to live stream your run? It's the only way to fly!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 21:27:08	@caitlinmoran @laurenlaverne The important thing is I'm not bitter.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 21:26:52	@caitlinmoran @laurenlaverne True. And their youth. And the things they'll see long after you're dead. And their lives before them. BASTARDS

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 20:56:52	@tkingdoll How on earth are your twitter devotees to respond to that? I've heard of sympathy for the devil, but sympathy for the betitted?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 20:53:18	Mental health reminder of the day: Be kind to yourself if at all possible.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 20:48:11	@RichardWiseman I knew you were going to do that, and yet I still clicked out of curiosity in the hope that there were more questions!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 20:25:11	@bmagnanti I had a homosexual machine once. It performed a series of innaccurately stereotypical acts in an unrepresentatively camp manner.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 20:06:11	@SidRodrigues Your shudders are offensive. I look magnificent in a bikini. The furry man boobs are particularly spectacular today. Honest.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 19:13:25	@BuffySquirrell @CCriadoPerez absolutely. When acting down a power gradient that steep, the powerful person is responsible in the extreme
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 19:11:54	@CCriadoPerez No one would sympathise if I told people they had punchable faces and acted on it (rightly so). I don't get victim blaming.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 19:07:58	@tkingdoll @daraobriain @stephencgrant I called someone a bit silly once. They compared it to the Holocaust and forced me to commit seppuku

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 07:53:02	@daraobriain May I ask which specific clatter you encountered?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 04:30:22	@DeborahJaneOrr I am not getting this hate Caitlin stuff at all. It makes no damned sense.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 03:33:25	@tkingdoll That too, obviously. Although naturally you are slightly less of a genius and gorgeous than I am. According to my mummy.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-06 03:31:12	@tkingdoll Especially since I am a genius and just fucking gorgeous. Modest too. Although my saving virtue is I never make obvious jokes.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 05:12:28	@tkingdoll AI: Artificial Intelligence. Hours of arse and brain numbing tedious pabulum and horror. Terrible testament to a great filmaker
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 05:11:02	@CarlieP MOCK HIM! MOCK HIM WITH GREAT IMPUNITY!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 05:09:08	@NotACruelSummer @CCriadoPerez Deary me, even I hadn't gone there. My powers of filthy jokery must be weakening. DAMN YOU FEMINISM!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:48:00	@rmiriam @MitchBenn Unpossible. Only one idea can be had at once, and that's dubious. Why anything else would be socialism. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:42:54	@trinawill88 @NewStatesman @CCriadoPerez Me? Neither trolling nor serious. I am in despair at Moffat's comment, whether serious or not.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:41:43	@garwboy You forgot that it would lower house prices and that he is clearly a homosexulaist because he's arty. And thus a danger to shipping
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:37:13	@hoperiffic OOOOH OGLAF!!!! {Sound of frantic internetting}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:35:20	@NewStatesman @CCriadoPerez It was a madly sexist statement from Moffat. Intentional or not. But hey, since when has sexism caused harm?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:34:25	@NewStatesman @CCriadoPerez We heard it from the man himself. When the Queen can be played by a man, then the Doctor can be played by a lady
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:33:09	@CCriadoPerez @BCollier2012 @higgleDpee I think Ms C-P should stop feeding trolls the second victim blamers stop being mockably daft
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:28:59	@docfreeride @zunguzungu Very worth it. An "I fucked up" is worth a lot when you have a public profile. It shows others it's possible.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:26:02	@docfreeride @zunguzungu Speaking as an ex-thoughtlessly sexist young man it is possible to come around. You just have to be open to error
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:22:42	@zunguzungu @docfreeride Massive disappointment. Billy has always been someone I thought "got it". Apparently I was wrong. Sad.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:19:59	@RespectSexWork TELL me about it! Happily I'm better than that... ....oh fuck! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:19:10	@Jess_chemgeek If feminism were true, women would be people. [Sound of beating with the cluestick] YOU WHAT? What will they think of next?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:17:21	@RespectSexWork I've yet to meet the perfect human being. I've met a lot of people who think they're candidates though. Unfortunately.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:16:08	@CCriadoPerez He spelled "irreparably" correctly, proving ability to use spell check and/or some basic knowledge. That's got to be a step up
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:09:01	@garwboy Wait...By Personal List of Gentlemen I mean...oh bugger. No, erm, I mean shit. Damn.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:08:04	@garwboy I am shocked, sir, shocked. Consider yourself remove from my Personal List of Gentlemen for so rudely disabusing me of this fantasy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 03:01:13	@tkingdoll I'm only excited because I'm new to all this. Don't ruin it for the noobs. Won't someone please think of the noobs?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:56:25	@shadesong @docfreeride Amazingly enough that was my reaction too. An astonishingly sexist statement from out of the blue.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:39:27	@tkingdoll First decent non sweary Who joke I've seen. Kudos
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:33:24	A properly sweary Doctor might amuse the hell out of me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:30:05	@noodlemaz Next you'll be telling us that the Royal Baby Saga of weeks past was also of no interest. Oh wait.... It wasn't! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:27:44	Superb actor, he'll do an amazing job. Tragically not a woman though, opportunity missed IMO.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:26:33	@billybragg I'm also pretty sure I meant Internet. #typos
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:26:03	@billybragg Back in the old days I saw a troll kill a person on the Nernst with a sustained campaign of LOLcats.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:23:07	@RufusHound You, sir, are an unabashed fucking genius. What a time to make mistakes. Get in, lad. Well recovered too. Good work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:21:23	HOLY FUCK!! Rufus Hound without a beard!!!! The Apocalpse is surely nigh @RufusHound
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:17:19	@elizabethdanger @jailawrites If women remain silent and obedient none of this fuss would happen. That's, like, super effective! [VOMIT]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:13:55	@mjrobbins Saucer of milk for Dr Robbins, please! (Not that I disagree, mind you)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:11:02	@lousycanuck @thinkprogress before they actually happened. It's like the consequences of these shoddy laws were obvious, weird! 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:10:15	@lousycanuck @thinkprogress Amazing isn't it? It's like people looked at a policy and saw that bigots would use it to excuse atrocities 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 02:09:15	@stephenfry Ahhhh clever, clever. Trying to put people of the scent, eh number 12? ;-) You wily devil. Or in other words, you're right
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:58:28	@garwboy and not only that, I know who the new Doctor is. The wrong one. Am I right? Huh huh. You bet I am.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:57:35	@garwboy In my day we had to talk about the new Doctor using only the vocal and processing equipment derived from aeons of evolution #luxury
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:47:31	@thinkprogress @lousycanuck Excuse me but: too fucking little, too fucking late. More than "reconsidering" should have happened long ago
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:41:18	@littleatoms @carolynporco Very much seconded. I'm loving this hash tag and your efforts in it, Neil. Keep it up!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:38:36	@IceflowStudios @feliciaday Tish, pshaw, stuff and nonsense! I shall have you know, good sir, that some of us are young. #misunderstanding
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:36:11	@feliciaday Way overdue. I am happy to put your name up. BBC might not listen. But I promise not to write the letter in crayon this time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:31:42	@Markgatiss Please place bets on the first case of fatwa envy. Some loon is sure to cry about the call to prayer not being mentioned
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:28:38	@Markgatiss But but how will you know how godly they are unless they show it off? (I seem to remember biblical disapproval of this)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:20:28	@JohnFinnemore I've noticed "Nick Clegg" is a punch line to almost any joke at the moment. I'm not sure if that helps though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:06:16	#Inspiringwomen I remember seeing Prof Blackmond's work for the first time at a symposium and being blown away. Seriously good science
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:05:29	#Inspiringwomen I've also had an intellectual crush on Rosalind Franklin and Donna Blackmond for the longest time. (1/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-05 01:02:25	#Inspiringwomen The two smartest and most dedicated people I knew at school are women. Same went for uni. I wish I could be their equal
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 23:13:42	@SidRodrigues A holiday? What are you? Some sort of deviant? Why when I were a lad... {insert fictional Yorkshireman based drivel and lies}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 17:11:33	@bmagnanti Oh now that's a bridge too far. I knew you were sexually adventurous but chainsaws? I've misunderstood haven't I? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 09:34:45	Frankie Boyle for Doctor Who.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 09:09:30	@ThornburyRocks @MizzReeLoves @amandapalmer Ah yes, the Weiner Method. How did it work for you? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 07:44:01	@ThornburyRocks @DieterTheuns @amandapalmer I blame, feminism, disrespectful youth and immigration. There, can I have my Mail sub now? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 07:39:13	@MizzReeLoves @amandapalmer @ThornburyRocks Memories? Sadly not. Video? Happily yes. Although my political career was dead before it started
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 07:34:33	@DieterTheuns @amandapalmer @ThornburyRocks Ah the Mail. A truly odious organ. Did you know some woman's thighs were fat? It's proper news
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 07:32:38	@MizzReeLoves @amandapalmer @ThornburyRocks sorry I just got excited. Drugs and ice cream reminded me if this one weekend when I were a lad
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 07:31:21	@JackofKent You are prolifically compensating for the silence! I favour pluralism when it comes to activism. And I can't do silence at all!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 07:27:42	@ThornburyRocks @amandapalmer Mmmmm drugs and ice cream.....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 07:26:49	@jennifurret Wow! Lovely! I hope all is going well for you, I for one miss your more frequent contributions at FTB, but I hope all is better
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 07:18:23	@tessakendall Did I offend? You have unfollowed me it seems. I am new to the etiquette of this thing and would hate to have made a faux pas
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 07:15:41	@jonronson I think it's one of those things that you can do or not, there are plenty of ways to show support, #Twittersilence is just one
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 01:43:18	@tkingdoll Wait. Are you saying the world does not revolve around me? Are you calling my mother a liar? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 01:42:15	@caitlinmoran @Baddiel Gosh! Me too. Oh we're all SO alike!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 01:41:57	@daraobriain I should point out I think the dishonest bandwagoners are a tragedy IMO, and not a reason to stop campaigning against abuse.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 01:40:22	@daraobriain After all, the censorious and prudish (NOT the campaigners against abuse) are lapping this up. A convenient bandwagon. (2/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 01:38:38	@daraobriain These folk are in favour of a "free" internet. (For given definitions of "free" I'd say), this abuse is an own goal. (1/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 01:24:35	@gimpyblog @bengoldacre Surely if he does that he'll go blind? #ComputerIlliteracyFTW
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 01:23:34	@jailawrites I have some dehydrated internet hugs on offer if you want them. Just add lovely lovely booze. Hey! That is responsible advice!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-04 01:19:38	@SidRodrigues Good to be vaguely alive again! I vanished (mostly up my own bumhole, never nice) for a while there! How's tricks?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 20:50:04	@SidRodrigues The Mail violates any known standard of intellectual rigour or decency. Btw Sid, look at my name and think back to sitp 2006
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 16:45:46	@tkingdoll insults banned? Deary me no. How else will people know they are fuckwits if I don't tell them? It's a public service!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 16:44:00	@bmagnanti Its even funnier when, due to cut glass accent and decent education, bigots expect me to agree with them. (2/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 16:42:59	@bmagnanti I'm another third gen, Brit born + bred. Decent tan, funny surname, you would not believe the comedy racism I get. (1/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 16:40:31	@bmagnanti @mechanima Impressive work taking the high road with "navel". That's a test I'd have failed badly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 16:37:15	@SarahMillican75 It's the only way to go. I personally favour the pint followed with the pint chaser. A tad early perhaps, but when in Rome
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 16:34:24	@jailawrites so it's generosity? A redeeming feature. I hope so.....I suspect not! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 16:33:16	Played with some slyme for a day or two. So over it now. What a conglomeration of cretinous time wasters. Apologies for indulging myself.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 16:30:58	@Mykeru @RichSandersen What dissent? I've yet to see anything from your ilk that isn't whining about your entitlements. Begone, slyme!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:32:15	@TylerHallKuch @RichSandersen Close but no banana. Nighty night!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:31:39	@TylerHallKuch @RichSandersen Anyway chaps, nice playing with you, time for sleep. I might give this block bot a go, you've made it tempting
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:29:28	@TylerHallKuch @RichSandersen hmmmm nice try, I'll give a C. And my cool's not yet ruffled. Sorry. Wasn't it you who mentioned projection...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:26:14	@TylerHallKuch Really? Not under it yet. 'S cat with mouse old bean. When I tire, away you go.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:25:24	@TylerHallKuch @RichSandersen Tsk, too much hostility. Try more lightness of touch. Pity, D-, must try harder
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:24:31	@TylerHallKuch and as such worth less than the slime on the end of my dobber
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:24:03	@TylerHallKuch @RichSandersen I ask because you're not doing a very good job. You're just some git on the web, a click away from gone.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:23:21	@TylerHallKuch @RichSandersen oh and out of curiosity, did Ricky recruit you or are you attempting to creep up to him of your own accord?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:21:21	@TylerHallKuch @RichSandersen Wouldn't want to be. Nice enough chap, but one of him is sufficient. Are we friends now then?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:18:56	@RichSandersen And remind me of this hyperscepticism I must have missed it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:17:33	@RichSandersen so the stuff about me sending threatening emails you claimed earlier is true and non libellous is it? You are funny!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:16:09	@RichSandersen wonderful, am I blocked yet?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:11:20	@TylerHallKuch @RichSandersen Haha no, I just like mocking ludicrously self important bigots and driveller a. It's a great British pastime
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:10:03	@SpokesGay wharble garble farble FREEZE PEACH rhubarb waffle drone blah.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:08:12	@TylerHallKuch @RichSandersen Wait...I know you are but what am I? Hahahahahahaha oh you guys are the gift of dumb that keeps on giving.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:07:00	@SpokesGay But but being blocked on the Internet is like a double holocaust or something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:03:53	@RichSandersen So you're a fact free, libellous, semi-literate driveller who cannot parse even a simple syllogism. Well done. New heights!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 08:02:47	@RichSandersen I see facts aren't your strong point. This twitter fn started when you impinged on my conversation. Not the other way around
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 07:57:45	@RichSandersen not really. I'm just laughing at you. You are a bit of a pathetic joke after all. Not to be taken seriously.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 07:56:10	@jailawrites why is it that the misogynist muppets are so blisteringly incompetent?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 07:55:35	@jailawrites I have to say it is very entertaining that these bozos cannot parse a simple syllogism. And watching them prance about is funny
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 07:51:50	@jailawrites steal away, it's tragically not mine. I believe the entire Scottish nation get the credit!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 07:50:57	@RichSandersen awwww you don't read for even basic comprehension do you, sweetums? Dance a little more please, your capering is hilarious.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 07:49:29	@jailawrites some wittering numpty of a non entity that think the block bot is fascism or something. I haven't paid too much attention
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 06:14:10	You have to see this Sandersen driveller flailing about. What a forlornly hilarious nonsense of a man.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 06:12:15	@RichSandersen I'm not trying to harm or scratch you. I'm pointing and laughing as you caper about. You are supremely irrelevant
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 06:11:43	@RichSandersen I have to say well done. That is spectacularly moronic of you. Do keep it up
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 06:10:31	@RichSandersen incidentally what's funniest here is you are complaining about possible libel by inaccurate bbc reporting by libelling me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 05:13:22	@RichSandersen I hope you have evidence. That will be fun to see
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 05:11:59	@RichSandersen try what? Mocking you? Okay! I question your personal habits. Have at you!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 02:21:56	@lousycanuck @borngeek @pzmyers I've always loved "X is misogyny" followed by answer "BUT PZ MADE A SEXY JOKE WITH A WOMAN" as if related
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 02:11:10	@lousycanuck @borngeek there is no way I can in good conscience tolerate PZ's beard. I mean, come on. There are limits.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 02:01:06	@borngeek @lousycanuck RW or whoever as if this was some team sport and I represent them. I can still criticise misogyny and disagree freely
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:59:47	@borngeek @lousycanuck One of my favourite tropes is when I disagree with some driveller, I am then expected to support PZ or Laden or 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:55:23	@tessakendall you need to follow me for me to reply apparently. I'm a bit new to all this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:51:24	@tessakendall ah good. I surprised David the other day. I feel Sid needs a shock too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:50:52	@borngeek @lousycanuck much worse than mere bullying, it's oppression. Especially if PZ can loosely be mentioned somehow. That's vital!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:49:35	@RevRichardColes They also do a remarkably secure line in car parks, I am lead to believe
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:47:55	@sueperkins @marcusbrig @SusanCalman I feel radio four would snap this up as a panel show in a second.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:46:05	@tessakendall ...I shall advise others against it
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:45:54	@tessakendall btw you do know which Louis I am, right? Think back into the dim and distant past at sitp. Oh and being punched by you = bad..
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:43:39	@kettlekat @lousycanuck Crikey! That's even worse! I saw a feminist once, she blocked me on twitter and I died. True story.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:26:06	@amandapalmer @stoya Perhaps misogyny comes from knowledge that cocks are generally not newsworthy? Laughable, yes, I should know, I own one
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:20:41	@lousycanuck It's even worse when two or more people agree on what they don't like. Why that's communism. Or nazism or something. I forget
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:02:57	@marcusbrig @SusanCalman @sueperkins Granted that's a bit pervy because it contains few puns and no sight gags, but 21st century and all...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 01:01:25	@marcusbrig @SusanCalman @sueperkins Marcus with some observational material, ending with Susan espousing the virtues of cat costumery 2/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-03 00:58:48	@marcusbrig @SusanCalman @sueperkins Is it wrong to view you three as my ideal intellectual comedy threesome? Sue with some acerbic wit, 1/2
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 21:50:06	@RichSandersen hence I don't. Ergo I shall mock you for the ridiculous mammerer that you so clearly are.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 21:49:28	@RichSandersen the fact that 90% of your whines are tu quoque, and the other 10% are irrelevant do not dispose me to take you seriously
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 21:48:29	@RichSandersen nope I wasn't. I was remarking on your curious lack of concern on serious problems. Your whines about bots don't count
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 21:41:43	@RichSandersen Did I say it was? No. Excellent. Then your straw man can be ignored.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 08:48:51	@IamJadehawk @SpokesGay morons know no limits. Blocked for dull apparently = blocked for evil when using same software
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 08:46:01	@RespectSexWork consent, for me, must be enthusiastic and unambiguous. It's just better that way ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 08:39:56	@whorephobia Very true. Why has my mind lingered on the term "double entry"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 08:08:41	@RichSandersen you're focussing on the wrong problem. I wonder why
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 08:08:31	@RichSandersen what I find endlessly entertaining about this is the interminable complaints about petty insult when women get rape threats
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 08:06:31	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel so what? Someone thinks a owing person on twitter is part of a meanie list? Big whoop, where's their thick skin?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 08:05:45	@RichSandersen so this is team sport, tit for tat foolishness. Is it not enough for ALL this crap to be wrong?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 08:04:39	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel condemn foolishness all you like, but at least be accurate about source
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 08:04:17	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel horde=\=PZ. Where has PZ used those terms? Again, one claim means one thing, the other, another.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 08:02:23	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n do they? Or are they placed in a different box
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:59:49	@davidgaliel thanks for those, read and watched.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:53:10	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen if you can be put in there for any reason, then obviously not automatically an abuser.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:52:31	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen you're telling me morons exist. This I know. Cope. Grow a thick skin....(irony)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:51:16	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n seen no links, sorry, new to this, retweet please

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:49:55	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel how hard is it to comprehend this: I don't use the bot. If people in bot are there for rape threats, good, (1/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:48:28	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n I am a sceptic. You have made a claim in absence of evidence. Evidence please.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:47:28	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel not to defend PZ,but never seen him use those terms.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:45:38	@davidgaliel personal insults? Describing hand waving and hysterics in absence of evidence as such is not an insult
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:44:43	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel no. Easy!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:44:13	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel sweetie, did I say you did? #readingforcomprehension
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:43:20	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n being blocked on twitter is not one of them. If name and shame exists, please link it. Should be easy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:42:40	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n it's just knee jerk hate or whining. The real substantive objections are few an far between.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:42:11	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n let me guess the parallels escape you. 99% of the anti PZ/RW drivel i have read is not principled dissent
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:41:11	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n she would however combat their drivel. The deniers have a right to speech, but not to a platform. (2/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:40:36	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n do you chaps know who Deborah Lipstadt is? She would never debate with holocaust deniers...(1/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:38:55	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel I'd expect to be blocked. Mind you since I'd never do that....(2/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:38:25	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel Count me as an ftbully if the "opposition" is as coherent as this! Honestly! If I made rape threat I'd (1/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:36:17	@davidgaliel obviously not, yet to see evidence this is the case other than your hysterics
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:31:20	@davidgaliel harsh perhaps, but sometimes fair. If the blocked folks are the rape threat tweeters et al, block em, mock em, rile em, i say
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:29:07	@RichSandersen @ool0n @davidgaliel what for?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:28:44	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n my name's on the list, I reply. Ae you having a tantrum about that now too?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:27:30	@davidgaliel so? If people want to block, let them. That is their issue. Not mine.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:26:45	@RichSandersen @ool0n @davidgaliel you're talking about some game I have no team in, who is EbW?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:25:34	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n how am I responsible for the acts of unrelated people?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:25:10	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n you don't read we'll. I don't use any bots, block or otherwise, I block misogynists manually. Simple.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:23:53	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel @ool0n why am I responsible for someone I neither read nor support?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:23:30	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel @ool0n why am I responsible for someone I don't read or support?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:22:40	@davidgaliel what differing opinions? That people you don't like should be raped? That's who I block
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:21:09	@RichSandersen diddums. Will the nasty people not listen to your misogyny?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:20:24	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n I can also cope with being blocked on twitter. Is it a big deal? After all the majority are harassers.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:19:15	@davidgaliel @RichSandersen @ool0n Ohhhhh! I see! You're whining about the block bot that oolon uses/created. I don't use it. (1/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:09:20	@RichSandersen @davidgaliel @ool0n @mollydot explain please. Who do I hate?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:08:25	@davidgaliel different
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:08:20	@davidgaliel illiberal lists of dissenters are a problem, yes. Lists of people who have earned criticism due to their illiberal bigotry...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:06:44	@bengoldacre was it the back of a racist van? I want them to save money after all......
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:05:51	@davidgaliel are they? You're not listening to the same voices I am.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:05:13	I went to Peppa Pig World yesterday. It was like a re-education camp from a totalitarian regime. Unpleasant does not cover it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:03:02	@davidgaliel lucky I'm not a leftist American then I guess
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:02:24	@davidgaliel criticism =\= intolerance. I also only answer for me, not others. I criticise that which I oppose, not silence it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 07:00:20	@davidgaliel I defend speech I oppose. I also criticise it. Can you tell the difference?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:59:34	@davidgaliel more bullshit. I for one read around. I'm not interested in having my ideas reinforced. Only the intellectually lazy are.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:58:30	@whorephobia mmmmm filthy accountants. Sorry I came over all,excited! (You are right though)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:56:57	@davidgaliel you, or I, do not have a right to a platform. V different from free speech.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:56:34	@davidgaliel people also have the right to determine what they are willing to put up with. Period. Their right to ignore your is not bad
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:55:36	@davidgaliel well your first claim is obvious bullshit. The whole Internet exists. Fora can be as free or not as they wish.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:53:43	@davidgaliel well speaking as someone who works with mental health charities etc, that's an abomination. If that's the result....bad
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:49:34	@davidgaliel so all people on block bot have been published on the beeb?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:48:57	@JackofKent I need to come back, but have been....well...useless! Excuses of busy and parent etc are frankly pathetic. I have missed you too
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:47:08	@JackofKent I couldn't possibly comment. M'lord.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:46:35	@HutchinsonDave @indiaknight I used pornography once. To make some marvellously multicoloured paper mâché to seal a window. Wrong?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:44:16	@JackofKent apropos of nothing do you remember, perhaps with a tiny bit of fondness, a chap from sitp London called Louis?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:42:24	@davidgaliel and how have these people made this "list"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:41:24	@davidgaliel I am a Brit, BBC is familiar to me! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:40:34	@davidgaliel who are we talking about? People blocked on twitter (not serious) or people RL named on bbc tv (serious)?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:38:29	@mollydot shhhhhh I know that ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:37:29	@davidgaliel if so that's terrible, have you got evidence?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:36:22	@davidgaliel so you claim that people exist who do not abuse but who are being hammered by name for not being A+?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:34:49	@ool0n my handle, at gmail, we'll do it, okay?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:33:57	@davidgaliel if anyone is on an "abusers" list wrongfully, then that is obviously wrong, end of story. What evidence is used to add to list?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:32:29	@davidgaliel have asked, please elaborate
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:32:03	@davidgaliel @ool0n @mollydot what actions? Sorry, just what am I being accused of?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:30:55	@davidgaliel @ool0n @mollydot well that's bollocks for starters. Snark is appropriate for morons. That said what are we talking about here?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:29:43	@ool0n @davidgaliel I have missed the bbc thing, I need to watch, although I am on holiday. Btw oolon, as a fellow Londoner, we need beer.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:26:42	@mollydot @ool0n @davidgaliel think yourself lucky, I am on everyone's black list. I still like Iron Maiden unironicallly! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:24:10	@neilhimself isn't it enough that, despite never meeting you and only being a fan of your work, I love you both? Or is that just creepy? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:22:55	@JackofKent @ukhomeoffice we need finer grades of report buttons. I need a " report destructively asinine fuckwittery button" for starters
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:20:10	@davidgaliel @ool0n being blocked for asinine bigotry and such ,I've is not oppression nor harmful. Cope with this. (2/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:19:24	@davidgaliel wait, help me out. I am mocking the tediously asinine, have I missed something in this conversation? (1/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:14:59	@davidgaliel @ool0n wait. Is that a fedora?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:14:16	@davidgaliel definitely the first one, although shhhhhhhh don't tell everyone, they'll all want some sarcasm.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:04:06	@charltonbrooker @ukhomeoffice after all how far behind are the trains and internment camps?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:03:20	@charltonbrooker @ukhomeoffice I do feel that that the racist vans are part of a last resort problem solving attempt. Or "final solution"...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-02 06:01:47	@ool0n @davidgaliel I was blocked on Twitter once. I got better.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-08-01 00:28:50	@PME2013 @OwenJones84 same here. Good public schoolboy, raised so Tory it could be child abuse, as I've grown up and read, I shifted left

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-31 06:01:44	@JackofKent @benwheway I used the Internet once and now I don't like women anymore. I blame, erm, men? Okay that didn't work!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-31 05:59:19	@CCriadoPerez what about ignoring the people who tell you to ignore trolls? ;-) In all seriousness: go you!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-30 22:45:24	@SpokesGay or humble brag....I blame spell check
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-30 22:44:54	@SpokesGay have we spotted an example of the wild humble rag? They are quite rare, of course I saw two on this little safari I went on....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-30 06:10:29	@ZoraSuleman Well that's all the best music gone then.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-30 05:51:21	@WelfordTheTiger @vinnymac31 Definitely not THAT guy. I have some standards! Low ones, but they exist!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-30 05:48:06	@vinnymac31 @WelfordTheTiger Can I be the helpful guy shouting "play it wide" from the sidelines as if it will be useful?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-30 02:56:14	@bengoldacre @gimpyblog According to my irony meter, irony has been dead for ages. Mind you, I did use it when speaking to homoeopaths

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-30 02:49:51	@bmagnanti Is it wrong of me to say you made me laugh? Your reply to the boastful military chap whilst you were on hols was sublime! (2/2)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-30 02:41:36	@bmagnanti IIRC you mentioned it might be read today. I am no lawyer. Nor do I play one on TV! ;-)

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-24 03:30:45	@mrsnickyclark @OpheliaBenson I was wondering when the body fascism would start. Your tweet refers to the first example. Er, congratulations

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-19 23:36:25	@bmagnanti Very true. I don't see the conflict between helping the disadvantaged and people exercising free choice I guess.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-19 23:34:51	@bmagnanti Phew! ;-) It's an area I find myself messing up! It's tricky to support things when that support can be part of the problem
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-19 23:31:14	@bmagnanti I ask as a male, non-john, pro-feminist hopeful ally. Although I hesitate to apply the terms "ally" and "feminist" to myself.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-19 23:30:10	@bmagnanti Where do you stand on the issue of "male allies"? Is it possible to be a good male ally for a cause that primarily affects women?

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-19 21:44:53	@caitlinmoran If they truly understand my needs they know I need to become slightly moist. That's going to be tough. I wish them good luck.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-19 19:39:41	@tessakendall Are we allowed to be (literally) puerile and laugh at that comment?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-19 19:35:38	@MegMcCutch @RichardDawkins But but but magic beardy man in the sky made serious face words on parchment long ago. Must be true.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-19 18:27:15	@caitlinmoran Is it okay to be mildly infatuated with you because of repeated incidents like this, or is that just creepy?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-19 06:03:15	@SciencePorn I will suggest this to my wife right now... [SLAP] Ouch! Yeah, that didn't work, she seems really annoyed. Should have asked

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-17 23:15:43	@SpokesGay Damn straight. Nerd culture is about passion and interest. Passion is universal, it can be shared with any interested person.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-07-17 22:59:40	@caitlinmoran Or combine with your earlier fap enthusiasm for a truly spectacular show of rather animated indifference.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-27 22:00:12	@brianmoore666 You say "coward". I would use a less parliamentary word. I will, of course, defer to your legal experience on the matter.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-27 16:12:17	@jailawrites @SpokesGay of course! We did mention it's a nude skydive wedding right?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-27 09:50:53	@SpokesGay Either way, I'm easy. (This we knew) #dingdongthebellsaregonnachime
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-27 09:48:45	@SpokesGay you and me = we, or USA = we? Because the religious right done lost their shit I see
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-27 09:47:04	@CarlieP @SpokesGay more bleach than car!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-27 09:45:49	@SpokesGay by the way, did you hear something about DOMA? I'm flying over to make good on that deal. Now, you know, het marriage is illegal
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-27 09:43:34	@SpokesGay Word
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-27 09:42:24	#SoDeepInTheFriendZone that I am sufficiently stoopid to fail to realise that more friends are a good thing and that women are not objects
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-27 09:40:06	@SpokesGay here is some sympathy: awwwwwww!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 08:15:34	@ajhmurray Glove puppet? Just what version of Jurassic Park are you watching young man?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 08:14:25	@SpokesGay Why so negative? It could be everyday trans awareness! You and I know it isn't, but I'm trying to look n the bright side okay!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 08:12:36	@campbellclaret Whilst I'm very pleased, any chance of getting him to scupper the defence budget in favour of more science and fewer drones?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 08:01:08	@lecanardnoir there's the rub. Who are the rubes, who are the true believers? Is there a financial threshold beyond which it doesn't matter
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 07:57:43	@SpokesGay Indeed. I have certificates to prove it too.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 07:55:58	@SpokesGay Very vexatious. Verily, vital vittles vanquish vices.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 07:53:05	@SpokesGay Are they getting between you and vital vittles?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 07:50:18	@lecanardnoir I understand, trying to fend off the Brummie Twitter Horde. Clever. Clever. (FYI I am a fan too. But keep that quiet)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 07:49:22	@SpokesGay Yes but none of them are as important as me. #DontYouKnowWhoIAm
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 07:47:29	@lecanardnoir Oh I see! You're bragging about being in Walsall after being in all those horrible other places.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 07:45:46	@WendyDavisTexas Best of luck to you, Senator. Women need strong champions like you in the Senate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 07:43:12	@lecanardnoir What did you do to deserve that kind if treatment? Must have been bad....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 07:41:53	@OpheliaBenson @chriscmooney Shhhh don't tell anyone or everyone will want some. I've spoken to PZ, he assures me it's not real.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 07:36:51	@chriscmooney @OpheliaBenson @MotherJones why it's almost like people are not monolithic and nuance exists! ;-) Well done Chris et al.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 07:35:49	@chriscmooney @OpheliaBenson @MotherJones So I disagree with Chris' "accomodationism", love his stances on antiscience and feminism (1/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 03:41:07	@OpheliaBenson Ophelia, no one can "ask Allah", because Allah is a fictional entity. Like all deities. Ooops did I let the secret out? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 03:32:12	@Mark_Cueto Well I'll be sad to see you go. You've been an amazing servant to the game and you are a great player. You deserve more caps
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 03:30:22	Home made sriracha and cheddar swirl bread is amazing. I feel the world needs to know this.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 01:21:10	@DavidFutrelle Ahhh John the Other. The misogynist gift that keeps on giving. For truly one has to search to find more profound fuckwittery!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 01:19:01	@lecanardnoir Hurrah! They are the best kind of feefees to hurt. Go on my son!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 01:17:23	@lecanardnoir Have you hurt wooist feefees?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 01:16:53	@GregProops And my short term memory was affected.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 01:16:35	@GregProops Has your short term memory been affected? Because last time I was in Amsterdam my short term memory was affected.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-26 00:09:52	@marcusbrig Ah but women aren't real people, they're tools for faux outrage from paps at best. Actual women's rights? Too much hard work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-25 05:04:02	@JackofKent I am both loftily disdainful and gawping like a surprised yokel. Why pick one reaction? Hobgoblin of small mins and all that!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-25 04:59:39	@SallyStrange so fucking seconded. Why is wanting to be wanted such a hard concept for some?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-25 02:33:51	@rebeccawatson I see the video as conclusive proof that mushroom season has come early to Oxford.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 22:04:47	@caitlinmoran Although I will confess I suspect the experience will be improved by being {ahem} pharmaceutically enhanced.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 22:04:10	@caitlinmoran I'm not famous like what you lot are, but I didn't hate it. Does that count? A bit of self indulgent psychedelia? So what?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 22:01:33	@mePadraigReidy The whacky video thing? Meh. I've taken sufficient recreational pharmaceuticals in my life that this is weak sauce.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 21:56:44	@mePadraigReidy what's he done this time?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 20:18:15	@clinteas I can only offer my humblest of apologies.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 20:17:15	@caitlinmoran is that where a secret spy network gets their top agents to go to work on one's bum? Sounds like every Thursday night to me!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 20:12:27	@clinteas I'll make it one year. And there will be much drinking and general mocking of sundry MRA's
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 20:11:33	@clinteas annoyingly work must be done. I was not in tip top health last week, and project goals being what they are dictate many hours!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 20:09:27	@Jamiehuwroberts If Manu's anything to go by, have a bit of a lie down.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 20:07:08	@JoyceCarolOates @szvan Impressive seeing as I have neither pool nor robot. I'll keep my eyes peeled though.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 19:24:51	@clinteas Tragically I can't go. Which is a bit annoying because I really wanted to. Just for the elevator part if nothing else
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 05:46:58	@BDStanley @mjrobbins I get the impression he is a deeply lovely person.... ....wait! It's the other thing isn't it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-24 05:44:18	@jennifurret I have advice that can help achieve all three... ...is that actually a good thing I wonder? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-23 06:10:42	@pzmyers WANT BEER!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-23 06:06:20	@claudiaforqueen @RevRichardColes Of course not. Doubtlessly the good Reverend has taste and is a Tigers supporter, #catamongstthepigeons
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-23 06:03:02	@RevRichardColes Read your Debrett's, baptising a rugby baby is a spin pass to the second row of pews. Minimum. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 22:33:39	@AlexCorbs congrats. I saw you put in some stellar scrummaging. Great work.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 22:32:48	@Mark_Cueto we can but hope. I seem to remember hurt Aussies = Dangerous Aussies. I'll relax after a Lions win. ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 22:30:23	@RevRichardColes They might be "happy", but the consequences of living in a system where girls have to play dumb for boys are not harmless.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 22:25:21	@MitchBenn Welcome to my life
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 20:35:36	@jameshaskell week can't go fast enough for me, big psychological advantage.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 20:27:14	@jameshaskell Tuilagi or Roberts? I'd go for Tuilagi
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 20:26:09	@WelfordTheTiger tigers beat South Africa, Lions didn't, as far as I'm concerned we should all be down there. #oneeyedtigersbias ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 20:22:06	@WelfordTheTiger not sure. Was there a match on?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 20:17:05	@rebeccawatson But my beer gut looks great in a bikini. For given values of "great". Oh wait....not the point.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 20:06:23	@stephenfry Agreed. It's pleasing to find you are a rugby fan by the way.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 20:05:13	....no easy meat. Poor Beale must feel rotten.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 20:04:46	Not happy about the 2nd half scrum. We should have had the better of their mid line too. The problem is the field is full of legends....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 20:00:06	@RhapsodiaTales @wmarybeard I would not trust A A Gill with so difficult a job.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:58:38	Okay we won, the Aussies were great, and a lot of help from Lady Luck gave us the game #Lions
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:56:33	Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:55:00	Stuart Barnes is being a tit. If Halfpenny was an Aussie? Not even a question. If my Nanna had bollocks would she be my Grandad? Moron.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:50:26	Phew. Beale misses
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:46:01	Okay that did not go to plan. I blame.....someone
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:44:09	Yes! Lions scrum
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:40:36	What a run from Beale!! Scary bastard!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:38:39	@willcarling the Aussies do not lose easily......wait who am I telling?!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:36:17	B Youngs on!!! Time to mess up some Aussie patterns
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:21:09	I think I meant Cuthbert but autocorrect got me
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:20:28	Cutch beret scores!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:19:55	@TigersUnoffy sad to see further Aussie injury. Got to be the Lions day now. GOT TO BE!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:13:18	@TigersUnoffy ......and also my Tigers bias ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:12:44	@TigersUnoffy I 100% agree. Youngs has the rugby X factor, Phillips is great but not as surprising.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:08:55	As an ex prop, can't wait to see Vunipola as a forward impact sub. Him and Tom Youngs to score......no bias or rose specs there :-) #lions
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:07:08	Lions to do it, one half won, win or draw this half and the right result happens #Lions
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 19:06:27	I had four heart attacks in the first half. Falau is a massive danger for our boys. Falau, Beale, Genia should make an interesting 2nd half
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 18:06:53	Lions kick off! I'm a little overexcited. Come on Lions!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 08:37:56	@Crommunist well I'm not black or white but I speak for everybody. There was a vote apparently. I'm not happy about this, seems like work
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 08:24:36	@SpokesGay @IamJadehawk I have performed a number of important studies. I was wearing a lab coat at the time.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 08:00:47	@CarlieP any good? Always on the lookout for new toys
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-22 08:00:03	@davidbazan @rebeccawatson I read of a 80 year old woman who got raped. She was wearing a thick nightgown in her own house, sober. The slut.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-21 06:41:42	@ajhmurray yeah but then he reinvents himself as some moody git who shouts at lighting engineers. Or something.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-21 05:00:32	@dELYSEious @SurlyAmy @DanCardamon I consider Dan Cardamon's message to be so brave it is on a par with anyone who won a Victoria Cross

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 21:39:01	@SusanCalman I've gone for the Borat style man thong. Which is a level of brain damaging wrongness even the most deviant cannot survive
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 06:46:04	@WowbaggerOM I made a mistake once. Shhhhhh don't tell anyone. I blamed Rebecca Watson and got away with it.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 06:40:11	@JordanCrane86 how did it feel when you kicked THAT goal?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 04:07:04	@bmagnanti Ah but that would require watching it. I play by getting sufficiently drunk beforehand that actual viewing of it is impossible!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 04:02:40	@JackofKent ...and praising anecdote above all things. It was a joy to behold people in the grip of a state of moral panic. (2/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 04:01:48	@JackofKent I have to confess I did like the way they kept dismissing evidence, ironically then trying to refer to evidence...(1/2)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 03:54:41	@rebeccawatson I think you could always have said that. Even we here in the UK know this is a fact.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 03:43:17	@JackofKent The cluelessness, it is strong with these people.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 03:38:44	@MsClara @MitchBenn Ouch! Get well soon Mitch.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 03:37:29	@ObscenityLawyer Very impressive. Evidence/reason based. The hilarious fervour of your opponents made things amusing.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 03:35:49	@MitchBenn Crikey, what happened?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 03:35:03	@SidRodrigues @JackofKent Could you gents follow me for a brief second, please.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 03:33:50	@ObscenityLawyer Just listened to you on the MM. Well done! You actually dealt with the howlers with charm and reason.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 03:25:26	@JackofKent The lawyer is doing a good job so far!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 03:13:11	@JackofKent She is an astoundingly shallow thinker. It's also joyous to have one participant dismiss evidence!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 03:04:33	@ool0n @CarlieP @aratina Oooooh fun!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 01:01:49	@SpokesGay Ah well that makes sense. Mind you, I'm feeling forgiving today, mostly due to my own hideous error rate.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 00:54:45	@SpokesGay What is inspiring today's grammar pedantry, Josh? (Not that I am complaining)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-20 00:26:24	@DrNerdLove @Crommunist But the forced hand dick grab was my best move. I'm going to have to go back to treating women like people. [/snark]

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-19 21:45:09	@CarlieP @ool0n I got some ftbullies person retweet something I said. I blocked them on principle. Seemed like a good idea.

1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-19 17:30:41	@rhysmorgan It's somewhere between "good" and "best"?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-19 17:04:52	@Jessie_XL @rebeccawatson Sounds good to me. I'm a fan of voting with one's feet on this issue.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-19 16:39:59	@SarahMillican75 I'd get that looked at.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-19 06:00:24	@TheSimonEvans You're irritated? I've been here three days and Stephen Fry hasn't even said hello to me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-18 23:30:47	@rebeccawatson Oh, I've been doing it wrong. I have been going 5k-to-couch. Still, if apathetic bears try to get into my house...
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-18 23:18:51	@Herring1967 I was once amused by a clown at an early age. Is that a bad thing?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-18 21:29:39	@garwboy It's the shape changing reptiloids that worry me. They come down here, with their ability to seamlessly blend in....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-18 21:24:42	@garwboy Ah the joyous union of two crank beliefs: evidence free claims of persecution of the majority by minorities and little green men.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-18 00:17:03	@rebeccawatson ZOMG BOYCOTT! Complaints about you trying to destroy CFI incoming in 3...2...1 {Sigh}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-18 00:11:23	@AdamSerwer @Crommunist Hell! Don't upset Cheney. He shoots his friends in the face, imagine what he'd do to you! #2006jokesthatarenotold
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-18 00:04:50	@SpokesGay @center4inquiry Were mistakes made?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-18 00:04:21	@nickgriffinmep Awww aren't you a laughably pathetic little bigot. Go on, dance for me.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 22:33:18	@ool0n @SpokesGay @PaulFidalgo @center4inquiry Yup. Content free. Because "neutrality" is not actually support for the status quo now is it?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 22:32:13	@ajhmurray Brave and the land of the free? [Not serious attempt, can't get to Lowestoft in time!]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 22:31:19	@SpokesGay @PaulFidalgo @center4inquiry I beg to differ. The feeble fence-sitting faeces just got palpably pathetic.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 22:17:11	@SusanCalman @MikeHolden42 Next you'll be telling me the chimps in the 70s tea adverts couldn't talk. The very idea.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 21:07:53	@OwenJones84 I am shocked, shocked I tell you. He's always seemed liked such a nice, enlightened chap. Whither our modern heroes? [/sarcasm]
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 20:46:26	@rebeccawatson How does it feel for "everything to be your fault"? #Pharyngulamemes
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 20:33:46	@AdamRutherford @rebeccawatson Ordovician, every time. It just sounds nicer than other periods.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 20:13:56	@EmmaK67 I never tire (read: always tire) of misogynists pooh-poohing violence against women as something trivial. {sigh}
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 09:24:20	@CarlieP BTW Carlie I love, Love, LOVE, your Twitter profile motto. May I steal it mercilessly for real life? Whatever that is.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 09:19:59	@CarlieP @hoperiffic Feminist super powers. It's how you're simultaneously oppressed, not oppressed, oppressing and in charge of everything.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 09:16:14	@hoperiffic {Makes noise} Is it feminist cookie tea? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 09:10:35	@hoperiffic Shhhh I'm not here.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 09:08:37	@WowbaggerOM The brave hero stuff and misuse of Churchill is eminently mockable though. That's a bit pompous and silly.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 09:07:49	@WowbaggerOM Oh I don't know about that. I'm not sure about hypocrisy and dishonesty. Inanity on the other hand....
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 08:15:17	@mistressmatisse Addition: It also rings my "Hey, I'm likely to be an abuser" bell. Not my most favourite of bells.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 08:13:25	@hijinksensue Where you went wrong: complimenting women. Don't you know by now that women aren't REAL people? [/sarcasm] #misogynyeverywhere
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 08:11:39	@mistressmatisse Compassion = Good. (Faux?) Compassion coupled to needy requests for good boy cookies? That =/= good.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 07:29:58	@SpokesGay It's like the words "Tu Quoque" have been omitted from all philosophical works since the dawn of time.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 07:22:28	@feministtswift @TristanTaormino Oh no! Are you crazy women being crazy by trying to be people again? Naughty naughty women. I hate misogyny
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 07:22:00	@SpokesGay @OpheliaBenson I was...enthusiastic...with my followings. I'm new to this, didn't know that was naughty!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 07:01:54	@OpheliaBenson Bloody feminists, with their standards and logic! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 06:57:33	@OpheliaBenson I cannot imagine why! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 06:51:26	@ashleeydg I don't need to know you to know you are too wonderful to cut yourself. Pull my name out as many times as possible!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 06:48:49	@OpheliaBenson And if THAT thought doesn't keep you awake tonight I don't know what will! ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 06:48:14	@OpheliaBenson When in primary school it is a Well Known Fact (TM) that boys pull the pigtails of girls they like and tell them they smell.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 06:10:27	@LastTangoInHull @OpheliaBenson This is "charming". If I hated Ophelia et al, and I don't, I wouldn't spend my time proving them right.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 04:07:23	@RealBobMortimer We've got piles of it round the back.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 03:36:43	@dannycare They don't show enough rugby yet! (Admittedly I'm lukewarm on the golf)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 01:18:09	@marcusbrig I am sensing that you were very mildly whelmed at best.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-17 00:58:53	@Herring1967 forgive me this bit of odious toadying, but thanks so much for all your free work. Thanks to the extent I've started paying!
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-16 21:53:32	Annoyingly I still love him. #Oxytocinisaconspiracy
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-16 21:52:55	Father's Day present: My young son woke me by scratching his dirty backside and putting his finger in my mouth. #Ihadkidswhy ?
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-15 08:03:54	@wmarybeard I feel I now need to point out I didn't speculate *quietly* about the state of your genitals either. Oh dear, twitter is hard.
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-15 08:00:49	@wmarybeard Is it okay to have enjoyed it and not speculated out loud about the state of your genitals regardless of level of agreement? ;-)
1517018450	LouisRedux	2013-06-15 07:35:00	@drarcox @RichardDawkins If this is true it seems Gove can get one thing right. Well I've just lost a rather painful bet.
