97096775	CimmerianInk	2015-06-06 06:04:55	@recovery_pati No matter how "curious" he was, it shouldn't have led him to molest his sisters. Brothers should protect their sisters.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2015-06-06 05:33:32	If what #JoshDuggar did was so *mild* would they care if he did it to their own daughters!!?? He also did it to a younger sister. #pedophile
97096775	CimmerianInk	2015-06-06 05:31:43	#DuggarInterview Sisters say it was just MILD inappropriate touching on fully-clothed girls while they slept, like it's a freakin' excuse!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2015-06-06 04:48:37	The fact that the #DuggarSisters defend Josh means nothing. They were witnesses to their parents dismissiveness, why wouldn't they dismiss?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2015-06-04 21:53:40	So the reason he committed incest is because he's an incestuous pedophile, not because he was a teenage boy curious about girls. #JoshDuggar
97096775	CimmerianInk	2015-06-04 21:52:24	#JoshDuggar says he touched his sisters because he was curious about girls. Most teen boys get a girlfriend they don't touch their sisters.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:25:20	@ReleasingLunacy I thought I saw millions of dollars but I wouldn't swear to it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:24:42	@ReleasingLunacy Ah I see. Isn't it weird how this has taken off apart from ALS? People love a trend.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:17:41	@ReleasingLunacy Yeah & the point was that the bucket was supposed to be if you didn't donate but that kind of got lost too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:14:38	@ReleasingLunacy I have no idea but it has raised money for the cause which is great. I think there's enough ice to go around. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:12:46	@ReleasingLunacy LOL! Heck just today? Try everyday! ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:12:00	@ReleasingLunacy Of course if someone uses the ALS hash tag they should talk about it otherwise what's the point besides being on YouTube?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:10:53	@ReleasingLunacy I wonder if that's true?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:10:38	@ReleasingLunacy Exactly! I'm curious, did you see the story saying the challenge was originally something else then became about ALS? ....
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:09:25	@ReleasingLunacy Yep lol, I thought you tweeted it to me and I was like 'huh?' :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:08:42	@ReleasingLunacy Oh! I think it just showed me your statement, I thought it was a tweet lol! And yes you're right about the media.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:06:03	@ReleasingLunacy Don't know if you saw my tweet but David's post was perfect and moving.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 07:04:56	@ReleasingLunacy :) The one about not using tweets in other places? I just wondered what happened to make you say it?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 06:51:32	Not sure what your last tweet meant but David's post on FB was perfect and eloquent.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 06:44:34	@ReleasingLunacy Doing it right now....
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 06:43:56	@ReleasingLunacy And as a patient she said she has up & down days & needs therapy. But she judges him? I was shocked at her ignorance.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 06:38:52	@TheMarySue Really Stallone? Is it a problem to put all male actors together? Unless they all have Low-T together of course.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 06:35:57	At my therapist a woman waiting said she's not crazy like R. Williams, so sad that those with mental issues don't understand suicide either.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-08-21 06:34:13	I think the #ALSIceBucketChallenge is great but the celebrities doing it aren't saying anything about ALS. At least talk about the purpose.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-07-05 21:06:52	@XboxSupport3 I haven't but I can do that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-07-05 12:44:38	@XboxSupport3 I think so...?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-07-05 12:31:19	@XboxSupport3 I went My List and played an episode from there instead and it started over again.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-07-05 12:11:48	@XboxSupport3 From the recently played list.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-07-05 12:01:50	@XboxSupport3 Every show, on mine & my husband's profiles, on separate Xbox One consoles.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-07-05 12:00:22	@XboxSupport3 Yes.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-07-05 11:57:39	@XboxSupport No, that did not help. Checked 2 different shows, both started over, also happens on both profiles & both One consoles.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-07-05 11:50:08	@XboxSupport I tried your suggestion but it is still happening.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-07-05 11:18:32	@XboxSupport We're having Netflix issues on the One. Every time we start an episode it starts over instead of picking up where we stopped.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-11 04:21:29	@SamsungSupport Thank you, I will need to take some pictures to test it. You've been very helpful.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 23:38:28	@SamsungSupport And what happens to the apps stored on the card? Will I need to reinstall them?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 23:20:34	@SamsungSupport I have information on the card, how do I save it before it's deleted?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 23:12:36	@SamsungSupport No, it's the card that was in my previous phone.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 22:51:47	@SamsungSupport And it loads to Instagram
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 22:50:48	@SamsungSupport I took a picture with the SD card out, it shows up in the galley.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 22:30:33	@SamsungSupport After restart it is worse but it seems pictures are on the SD card can I move them to phone?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 22:27:56	@SamsungSupport Sorry please wait I forgot to restart
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 22:25:51	@SamsungSupport Now it's worse the icon is on more pictures and I can load even less pictures than before.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 21:25:29	@SamsungSupport Yes taken using the Camera app, not sure if saved on sd card, how do I check?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 09:56:29	@SamsungSupport I just tweeted it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 09:55:56	@SamsungSupport In reply to rep named Sky here's a screen shot of what I'm seeing when I try to use Gallery app. pic.twitter.com/ui4ZjyZpDV
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 09:49:37	@SamsungSupport Yes should I use your name too?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 09:40:30	@SamsungSupport For some reason I can't tweet a picture as a reply.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 09:29:04	@SamsungSupport How do I take a screen shot?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 09:20:55	@SamsungSupport Also can't use Studio app that came with phone, says not supported, can't edit photos I took with this phone
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 09:16:16	@SamsungSupport Still not working. Gallery shows some pics but also just icons, no Instagram.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 09:10:32	@SamsungSupport I went in and hit reset, will that fix it?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 09:00:07	@SamsungSupport Also I can't get the pictures to load into Instagram or other picture apps.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-05-10 08:59:12	@SamsungSupport I'm using the Gallery app that came with the phone. But it won't show all my photos just an icon with a person and lightning

97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-04-22 21:36:27	@TESOnline I think a valid suggestion would be to schedule maintenance when the fewest people would be online, as a courtesy.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-04-22 11:50:06	@ReleasingLunacy Not much to say on my side but I wanted to let you know you're in my thoughts.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-04-22 08:51:17	It is disturbing that a director would choose to change a scene to rape so it's memorable. No one thinks about victims. #GameOfThrones

97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-14 04:27:36	If a show like @DowntonAbbey is going to show someone being raped, even in part, more than a 'not suitable for all' warning is needed.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-14 04:24:03	Just watched 2nd episode of @DowntonAbbey Season 4...wasn't expecting a rape..I wish there had been a better warning, badly triggered now.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-12 01:36:04	@TESOnline Where are the beta forums? I'm in the beta and have no idea how to get help.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-11 12:46:33	@ReleasingLunacy When you're in a deep depression you're trying to fight chemistry. Maybe acknowledging that it's depression could help???
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-11 11:57:44	@ReleasingLunacy I'm so sorry the depression is so heavy for you. I really hope it eases soon. ((Hug))

97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-09 23:41:57	@ReleasingLunacy That is very true. It can be hard to balance letting parts express themselves and not letting it to too far & become unsafe
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-09 23:39:17	@ReleasingLunacy Of course you're not a bad person! You're a really great person RL.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-09 23:38:19	@ReleasingLunacy if you mean letting her express herself then I think it's good that you respect that parts feelings.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-09 23:36:02	@ReleasingLunacy Oh! Jeez I'm really behind on knowing your story because I didn't know you have DID too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-09 14:09:12	Wow I just now figured out how to get notified when my friends tweet. How sad is that?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-09 14:07:48	@ReleasingLunacy Ummm...I feel like I'm missing an important fact so I'm going to ask, who's Sierra?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-09 13:55:24	I'm lying here and it's unbearable. I can only exist with fantasies and imaginary people but it's harder to do at night for hours.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2014-01-09 13:53:09	I hate going to bed. I absolutely hate it! I hate this time of night. I hate laying here. It's too quiet. Every night the same thing.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-19 08:29:29	Jean-Ralphio @rejectedjokes is "literally" my favorite guest on Parks and Rec! I laugh the whole time he's on. So glad I found this show!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-19 08:19:53	I officially love Ben Schwartz (the actor)! The man is hilarious on Parks & Recreation and really cute. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-18 05:47:04	@ReleasingLunacy Hang in there, the holidays are almost over. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-17 11:29:02	@ANoName11 Haha, I hear you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-17 11:19:22	@ANoName11 Yea, that's what I've read. There's no guide on how long it takes, but thank you. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-17 09:31:31	@ANoName11 You're very kind. I just can't figure out why no matter what I do I gain or how long it takes the body to recover from anorexia.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-17 07:55:43	@ReleasingLunacy How are you though?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-17 07:55:18	@ReleasingLunacy Hi RL, I know but I really feel like I'm living in the wrong body. I lost 2 or 3lbs felt good then gained it back.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-17 07:53:45	@ANoName11 I was anorexic a year ago and after recovery gained over 30lbs. Been exercising regularly over 2 wks, diet is lower calorie.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-17 01:30:01	I am hating life today. Been exercising to get healthy, still fat no change no matter what I do. Nothing I do matters. I feel awful.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-15 10:04:35	I also could have used more Martin Freeman because he rocks.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-15 10:03:49	Actually I should add that I really loved Smaug himself. The design and rendering was amazing and Benedict's voice acting was awesome!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-15 09:56:53	I can't get past Peter Jackson using a character he created to cause a major and stupid change that didn't happen in the book. Rant over. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-15 09:51:45	con't It's like Peter Jackson read a list of what makes a Hollywood blockbuster and decided to follow a formula: hot chick,hot guy,stab...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-15 09:50:29	con't WHY is Legolas so grumpy and mean the entire movie!? He's a different person than the one we know in LOTR and not in a good way.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-15 09:49:41	con't WHY did PJ use Tauriel to literally break the dwarven party up!? WHY is there a Twilightesque love triangle for no reason!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-15 09:48:30	*Spoilers Desolation of Smaug* I don't mind changing a story in adaptation but you used Tauriel to change the entire course of what happened
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-15 09:42:48	I got ONE thing out of the travesty that was The Desolation of Smaug: I heard #EdSheeran for the 1st time. #ISeeFire was BEAUTIFUL! New fan.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-15 09:39:37	Even if a movie sucks, if it introduces me to a new artist I appreciate it. Twilight=Florence and the Machine, Hobbit sequel=Ed Sheeran
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-12-14 13:47:53	SO utterly disappointed by Desolation of Smaug. Too many severe deviations from the story that wasted my time and insulted my intelligence.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-06-16 05:11:24	@SarahJLA May I ask how violent the game is? Like is it *really * bad? Any game you could compare it to?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-04-21 10:42:04	@SarahJLA Maybe Redbox will get it and let me try it out first. I did that with BioShock Infinite before buying it.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-04-01 01:51:59	@Stevevalentine You were awesome on Psych! The pork belly bites "divine nuggets of God's heroin meat"! You had the best lines! :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-28 04:28:04	Excited to see @Stevevalentine on Psych's 100th episode tonight!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 01:09:42	@XboxSupport1 Ok just to make sure I understand by "original" console do you mean the older one with the issues or the main one (newer)?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 01:06:24	@XboxSupport1 Do you want me to start a new game on the older console or the newer one?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 01:03:42	@XboxSupport1 ...the latest one. This happened once before & I couldn't load any of my ME3 characters.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 01:02:46	@XboxSupport1 Then the saves just stay pending so my newer console can't find any. Strangely the ME3 save issue affects all saves not just
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 01:01:15	@XboxSupport1 I'm only able to access saved games on the older console if I played the game there last.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 01:00:10	@XboxSupport1 Yes,when I play on my older console the saves for both games just stay pending for days.If I do it on my new console no proble
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 00:43:08	@XboxSupport1 But I was told I can't move it until it's done syncing. First Tomb Raider, now Mass Effect 3 and I can't play on main console
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 00:41:52	@XboxSupport1 No, my newer Halo 4 console shows only New Game as my option, no saves. Older console says cannot be copied may be moved.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 00:34:48	@XboxSupport1 This is getting beyond frustrating.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 00:32:52	@XboxSupport1 ...the game for a minute to force the sync but it didn't work. And I can't play this on my main console because it won't sync
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 00:31:41	@XboxSupport1 Right now on the older console where it was last played it still says Pending Upload like it did yesterday. I tried playing...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-27 00:07:18	@XboxSupport1 Xbox Support tweeted me yesterday that I needed to wait until the status wasn't Pending to move it to a usb stick. True?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 23:49:42	@XboxSupport1 I replied to your question but never heard back. This is day two and it still has not synced it's still pending
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 23:48:32	@XboxSupport1 No that wouldn't be possible and this is day two and it's still pending.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 01:36:19	@XboxSupport1 No, my whole house is run on a wireless network.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 01:21:41	@XboxSupport1 So I'm stuck with no access because the save won't complete.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 01:19:29	@XboxSupport1 Yes I'm looking at my router setup page and it is enabled.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 01:04:34	@XboxSupport1 Is it safe to move a pending Cloud save to a USB stick or will it be corrupted or lost? This has taken all morning.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 01:03:15	@XboxSupport1 ...and the older console still keeps moving the sync bar & starting over. I can't access any of my ME3 saves on the Halo Xbox
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 01:01:53	@XboxSupport1 Okay. I will add that I tested the connection again and everything is connected. It still won't sync...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:50:08	@XboxSupport1 I don't know if we do. How would I check that?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:38:43	@XboxSupport1 I just tested my connection and it connected but gave me a suggestion to unplug my router so I will do that first.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:36:48	@XboxSupport1 There was a message that it would use the info from my other console but there's nothing to load.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:35:56	@XboxSupport1 Yes. And I went to my Halo 4 console and there are no games to load now. It did this before. No Cloud saves are showing.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:28:18	@XboxSupport1 I heard my console go quiet and the light stopped flashing so I'm going to check it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:27:33	@XboxSupport1 Wireless. Like I said it's only my older console that does this. My Halo 4 console seems to sync without issue.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:21:23	@XboxSupport1 I just turned it off and the green light is flashing so I know there are downloads. Do I wait for the light to stop flashing?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:17:56	@XboxSupport1 Well I played yesterday late afternoon into evening so it's been off while I slept.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:08:54	@XboxSupport1 ...eventually the Active Downloads screen acts like the download is finished but Cloud Storage remains Pending Upload
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:07:34	@XboxSupport1 I've wasted hours trying to get this to work.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:06:58	@XboxSupport1 I'm worried about trying to move the save to my Xbox USB stick because the status is pending.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:05:54	@XboxSupport1 ....the sync bar gets about 1/3 then starts over repeats. This is only happening on my older console not my new Halo 4 console
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-26 00:04:42	@XboxSupport1 Now the problem has spread to Mass Effect 3, I'm extremely frustrated! ME3 Cloud Save same as Tomb Raider won't sync...

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-11 03:54:58	@XboxSupport1 Yes I can try that and let you know.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-11 03:43:53	@XboxSupport1 None because I've put quite a bit of time into the game. It's my 1st playthrough.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-11 03:34:55	@XboxSupport1 Also the date stamp on the Cloud save is not the same as what shows on the Tomb Raider load screen.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-11 03:32:45	@XboxSupport1 The Tomb Raider Cloud save stays in a Pending status so I'm not sure what I would copying if it's never complete?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-11 03:19:23	@XboxSupport1 ...and since I've been saving on the Cloud there is no save for it to find so it would say I have to start a new game.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-11 03:18:30	@XboxSupport1 Ok, the problem with that is you choose your save device at the start, if you choose HD won't it look for a save there...

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-09 07:43:57	@XboxSupport1 Yes other saves work and yes I can try that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-09 07:41:30	@XboxSupport1 Yes, it took more than a day to sync.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-09 05:31:29	@XboxSupport1 Is it a Tomb Raider issue? Didn't seem to happen with my Mass Effect 3 save.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-09 05:30:32	@XboxSupport1 I don't think so, my whole house is wireless. Eventually the sync finally finished so I could play on my main console.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-09 04:27:22	@XboxSupport1 ...after a long time the bar finishes but then the save isn't available on other console starts syncing again. Frustrating.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-09 04:11:12	@XboxSupport1 It's not working, thought sync was done tried to play on other console it's still syncing and never competing it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-08 22:44:45	@XboxSupport1 I haven't tried playing the save yet, but I will today to make sure.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-08 22:36:08	@XboxSupport1 ....and it was only one save game. I had trouble with the same save the other day.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-03-08 22:35:18	@XboxSupport1 No errors, the sync bar moves then either backs up or stops then tries again etc. Save finally synced after a long time...

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-29 04:29:03	There is a ridiculous amount of double standards in sexual abuse cases involving female perps and male victims. What's the difference!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-29 04:27:21	con't...if a male had done that to a female student he'd be in prison. This female librarian won't even have to register as a sex offender!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-29 04:25:53	WTF!? A school librarian makes sexual advances towards a male student, goes to his house, pushes him onto the bed, and she'll get probation?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-29 00:26:42	Watching this week's Dowtown Abbey on my dvr....oh my goodness. Unbelievable.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-29 00:08:03	@PainIntoPeace Sounds like a plan! :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-29 00:01:46	@PainIntoPeace Ohhh I see. Yes feelings are scary. I understand. Can you do something nice for yourself?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-28 23:51:48	@PainIntoPeace I'm sorry. :( Sounds like your mother's is triggering to you. If you know any calming techniques you might try them.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-24 12:19:01	@PainIntoPeace lol! Yea but so cuuute! And that little puppy? Awww! :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-24 12:12:05	@K_is4Kellies You know what? Having the trauma and life experiences we do? Using humor can be helpful sometimes.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-24 12:03:30	@PainIntoPeace Oh! SO pretty!!!!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-24 12:01:57	@K_is4Kellies I so hear that! I make jokes in therapy at weird unfunny moments.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-24 11:44:32	@K_is4Kellies Ha! Oh my goodness K, you're too funny. ((hugs))
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-24 11:13:44	@K_is4Kellies I shouldn't laugh at that but I did. ;)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-23 03:42:21	@Kazcita Keep trying! :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-23 03:42:02	@Kazcita Strangely my internet outage opened up for a few precious moments just now so I could sign up. Then internet went down again. :\
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-23 03:15:18	@Kazcita Hey! Did you sign up for the Elder Scrolls Online Beta test!???
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-23 02:53:13	@PainIntoPeace Happy to provide them then. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-23 02:51:54	@jhaletweets On the off chance that you read this :) Is there a way to buy autographed photos from you? I love your voice work!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-23 02:48:10	@PainIntoPeace I'm sorry. :( My bathroom is a safe place so if I cry it's often there or in my closet. Safe hugs if that's ok.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-23 02:41:01	@TESOnline Will the Beta be assigned to the first people who signed up or are there other deciding factors?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-22 08:25:11	@sarahlou003611 When I was in the hospital they had some kind of waterless body wash thing but you had to ask for it. Do they have that?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-22 06:28:49	@ReleasingLunacy Hi, yes I got it thanks! I think Twitter is freaking out because of the inauguration.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-22 06:28:02	@castorgirls Very wrong and obviously a person who has no experience of why it's wrong. Apparently they don't teach that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-22 06:10:56	Quote: "I loved my mother Lemon, obviously because of Stockholm Syndrome." May have been a joke but I think it's more like truth for some.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-22 06:06:28	@castorgirls Wow, really?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-22 01:50:11	@CaseyDHudson I'm late on answering this but a sequel is better because if it takes place before we already know what's coming.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-21 07:30:56	@gideonemery Don't you know you only need flannel in Portland? ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 22:17:12	@castorgirls @Kazcita Indeed. :) Though it was always amusing how people's lives paused until their soap operas were over.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 12:05:01	@Kazcita @castorgirls It's a perfect storm lol.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 12:01:44	@castorgirls @Kazcita Nice! Then we all got a laugh. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 11:58:49	@castorgirls @Kazcita You liked it too lol!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 11:53:57	@Kazcita Thanks for the safe hugs. The same to you as well. ((hugs))
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 11:52:59	@Kazcita Haha! People can be so creative! That was great. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 11:38:21	@Kazcita btw your avi pic is lovely. You look beautiful! And ummm Data and Spot in the background? Nice!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 06:46:08	@weightluss ...severely restricting, over exercising etc. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 06:45:29	@weightluss ...behaviors and has a death rate of it's own. EDNOS people don't meet weight requirement for anorexia though they may be...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 06:44:27	@weightluss ...I think people start off at a "normal" weight before getting so low. EDNOS is commonly a combination of anorexic or bulimic..
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 06:43:01	@weightluss I know that according to the DSM you have to be under a certain bmi to meet the criteria but people wouldn't start off that way
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 06:41:11	@PainIntoPeace Have you seen Dowtown Abbey? That's the BBC I think.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 06:40:16	@PainIntoPeace I noticed that with someone I know in Canada. She had shows I don't have.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:21:33	@PainIntoPeace I just started watching Portlandia and laughed my ass off.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:16:21	@twcrew @K_is4Kellies @AsSamsara Ha! Yes it does. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:14:17	@twcrew I absolutely agree that it's not about the food at all. It's definitely about something else.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:13:32	@K_is4Kellies @twcrew @AsSamsara Oh K! I'm sorry! That's a long time to struggle. And #EDNOS doesn't get talked about very much.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:10:07	@noelove I actually teared up during this episode.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:09:24	@twcrew Oh no! You're not overwhelming me at all lol. I just mean that the inner fighting is tiring. You've been so great!!!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:08:06	@twcrew I agree with you. It's very exhausting. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:07:23	@K_is4Kellies @twcrew @AsSamsara Hi K! Thanks. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:06:56	@twcrew That is true. There is definitely opposing thinking going on.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:05:26	@twcrew ...like feelings can kill you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:05:12	@twcrew I can see why that would be. My therapist says you have to see that feelings etc. don't kill you to believe it. But it feels...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:03:57	@twcrew That would mean talking to them which right now is like talking to something I don't believe in. But understanding the why is needed
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:02:40	@twcrew Very true.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:01:30	@twcrew I agree with that because I've cut before too and this is WAY harder.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 05:00:26	@twcrew @AsSamsara I'm serious though the kindness is really appreciated. You guys are amazing. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 04:58:42	@AsSamsara @twcrew Not an intrusion. :) I appreciate both of you trying to talk to me. I swear Twitter is a great support system.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 04:57:25	@twcrew My therapist says that I won't know anymore about what happened or anything else as long as I keep doing this.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 04:55:55	@twcrew It did actually occur to me when I posted that last blog entry that the eating could be used as an excuse to quite therapy.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 04:52:56	@twcrew Alive or dead? That could take a lot time to decide. :) I lean towards alive but it's real iffy.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 04:49:22	@twcrew It feels like people are asking for perfection. Maybe they aren't and it just feels that way.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 04:47:52	@twcrew ...all of that's gotten buried with images of my uncle. So I question everything and therefore can't acknowledge any alter issues.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 04:46:55	@twcrew Part of the issue is that part of my doubts and questionings about what abuse happened also questions that I really have parts...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 04:44:59	@twcrew Good question. And choosing "alive" isn't really happening right now. It's a suicidal ideation thing not outright suicidal.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 04:36:35	@twcrew The eating disorder my T says I have. Her orders were to eat every two hours and I can't do that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-20 04:34:36	Just posted my 600th blog entry and it's so pathetic how much I suck and that after all this time and 600 blog entries I still suck.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-19 04:53:18	@FemalePTSD At least insomnia will be good for something eh? Wonder how it will end.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-18 13:44:12	Just watched the first few episodes of Portlandia. Hilarious! I'm so late to the party.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-18 11:55:55	@K_is4Kellies @Sheffele I know from experience how confusing systems can be. :) Can't imagine how outsiders see it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-18 11:54:11	@TrendySocialite @huetiful Good to know! I've been trying to justify the cost, wondering if it's worth it. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-18 11:44:14	@TrendySocialite @KoilsByNature @AsIAmNaturally @CurlKit I love As I Am products! What hair steamer do you use?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-18 11:41:47	@Sheffele @K_is4Kellies Understandable. Be gentle with yourself. I'm sure he's there for a good reason that will make sense someday.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-18 11:10:41	@Sheffele @K_is4Kellies ...like being a different gender would have protected a girl from abuse. Just something I read.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-18 11:09:27	@Sheffele @K_is4Kellies Would understanding why he exists make it easier to accept? Many times male parts are about boys not being abused
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-18 10:00:11	@ReleasingLunacy It's always hurtful when douchebags speak out of ignorance. None of them have ever experienced what we do. Idiots!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-18 09:46:18	@ReleasingLunacy Ann Coulter is a certified moron.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-15 23:44:23	@MyBipolarBrain Does your therapist let you stay longer if they're late?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-15 23:43:13	@MyBipolarBrain It's ok, it threw me but she's kind of a scatterbrain and she did actually know who I was lol.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-15 23:40:50	@MyBipolarBrain If it makes you feel better my therapist called me by the wrong name.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-15 06:00:14	Ok, wait a second! this website says that *this* is a picture of Ryan Seacrest in school!? No way! http://www. chacha.com/gallery/1793/w hat-do-celebrities-look-like-in-their-yearbook-photos/12938 …
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-15 05:53:26	...Then I capped off my singing extravaganza by singing "Hakuna Matata" in my car. Wow.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-13 04:30:59	So We’re Not Getting A Death Star But We Can Confirm We Have The Geekiest Administration In History http:// pulse.me/s/hbHPW
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-13 01:50:04	@Kazcita No I haven't. I'll have to look it up. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 23:30:23	@Kazcita I had to laugh at myself drooling over a hobbit and 2 strangely hot dwarves. But Martin is fantastic as Watson.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 23:29:17	@Kazcita I know, like we needed that! I also find Martin Freeman attractive though just because his acting is amazing.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 23:27:24	@Kazcita Haha! I like that one even better! It's a trap lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 23:23:18	@Kazcita That's amazing and unique on so many levels. What has Cumberbatch done to all of us lol?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 23:19:14	@multiplemee Wow, it's good they have one.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 23:18:29	@Kazcita Oh!!! You got a T-shirt with the saying on it! Cool! How did you do that?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 09:10:27	@Kazcita Woops I'm confused...what are we talking about? The Facebook page and...?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 08:42:42	@sarahlou003611 Seriously!? Try to stay calm in the face of stupidity and tell them why. So sorry this has been so rough on you. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 07:24:20	@AndiJolie I'm glad to. Anytime :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 07:07:12	Maybe the rest of the episode will be better but I'm already irritated so I won't watch.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 07:06:08	Oi! Dr. Phil has an episode about bipolar disorder and they make her look friggin' crazy and violent. Like we need this... *eye roll*
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 07:04:38	@AndiJolie Then it was worth the tweet. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 06:56:22	@ReleasingLunacy You saw it too!? Good and I'm glad it's not just me. I heard that "alternate personality" part and was like What!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 06:55:19	@AndiJolie ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 06:40:01	And now there's a new show called Do No Harm about a doctor with an alternate personality? Of course he's "good" then "bad". #DIDisNotFun
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 06:38:20	I don't think I can watch Elementary anymore.Sherlock with emotions? In love with Irene Adler? He has sex with women? Revenge? Uh uh...nope.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 06:34:49	@sarahlou003611 Yes, the hospital is never pleasant. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 06:23:17	Commercial just reminded me that ED doesn't always mean Eating Disorder Might need to make sure no one confuses it with Erectile Dysfunction
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 06:21:53	@sarahlou003611 Well then that IS good news! :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 05:53:00	@sarahlou003611 Really? What were you expecting lol?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 05:51:56	@sarahlou003611 @multiplemee Is that what happened to you!? Ruptured ulcer???
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 05:49:10	@XboxLIVErewards For Dec. there was 200 pts for spending 2000 points? I bought the Halo 4 map pack but didn't get the points. N/A?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 04:22:58	@Kazcita Yea I definitely think so. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 02:24:28	@Kazcita I actually don't like most of the show anymore because it became about sex, less nerdy. But some episodes are very geeky & good.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 02:19:41	@Kazcita Exactly lol! When I watched ST:TNG as a young person Wesley was cool to me because he was young and smart and on the Enterprise.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 02:18:00	@Kazcita And Wil Wheaton's appearance on the Big Bang Theory has been quite funny as Sheldon's arch-nemesis.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 02:16:52	@Kazcita Cool about the wedding and agreed, agreed, agreed on the others. Though Wesley has a good episode "First Duty"? I think...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 02:10:39	@Kazcita Me too. :) I've been re-watching Warehouse 13 and Brent Spiner guest stars and the guy who kidnapped Data in "The Most Toys" stars.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 02:08:10	OMG Freakin' media: Stop putting the Aurora shooter's face all over the news! He murdered innocent people, he doesn't deserve the attention!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 02:06:36	@Kazcita I loved that! It was a cool moment for Data and Q's all "I would never curse you by making you human." lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 02:03:34	@DanSlott I know you like uber-negative comments about Superior Spider-Man but I just read SS #1 and loved it. Final page? Twist! So there!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 01:53:17	@weightluss You're not alone in those feelings.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 01:08:35	@SarahJLA That's when you say "Heyyyy You!"
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 01:05:11	Read story of NH mother convicted of exploiting her own daughter and sexually abusing her. Yes women sexually abuse too. Yes mothers do too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 00:34:36	I like my therapist but I don't like when she ignores that I have bipolar disorder because everything is about trauma for her.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-12 00:29:25	It is so cool watching Saul Rubinek and Brent Spiner together in Warehouse 13. #themosttoysreunion
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 23:59:27	I hate waiting for repairmen. The whole "We'll be there between 8-noon". Ugh. And no promise of a phone call before he shows up.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 07:59:42	Am I the only person who doesn't get Beyonce's appeal? She's mostly naked on a magazine...so what?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:35:10	@sarahlou003611 I'll hope too. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:32:29	@sarahlou003611 Good. Now focus on getting better ok? :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:30:33	@sarahlou003611 It's a reasonable question as long as they don't get hung up on it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:28:59	@sarahlou003611 Goodness *shakes head*
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:28:19	@sarahlou003611 Very true.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:27:40	@sarahlou003611 As in done to yourself?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:27:19	@sarahlou003611 Yea, that's a very normal doctor thing to do. They have a very different idea of time lol.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:26:13	@sarahlou003611 That's a good thing! I've had people disbelieve me because of the mental. It's not fair.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:24:32	@sarahlou003611 I understand. I think if they can understand it will lessen the stress on you at least a little.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:19:19	@TribeCalledCurl Ooh how do we win!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:15:32	@sarahlou003611 Keeping it "scientific" might be good. I don't know. They just need to know you can make decisions for yourself.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:14:46	@sarahlou003611 I hear you. Breathe deeply and ground yourself. Speak calmly because dumb people like to mistake standing up for crazy.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:12:16	@sarahlou003611 That's good too. Maybe she can help with communication with the staff. Stay strong. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:11:29	@sarahlou003611 I'm glad they're listening, keep making them, stay calm and give them your reasons. They can't put you in psych for that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 06:10:24	@sarahlou003611 They absolutely CANNOT force a blood transfusion on you! I know that for a fact!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 04:30:45	@sarahlou003611 What do they want do? And second, do you have a friend or relative who can come and be an advocate, back you up?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 04:23:21	@sarahlou003611 You have rights as a patient, yes.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-11 03:06:31	@sarahlou003611 Hang in there and keep updating us ok?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-10 23:20:55	Doctors: Junior Seau's brain had CTE http:// pulse.me/s/h7Dmc
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-10 12:47:15	@castorgirls ...they can be affected by starvation haha.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-10 12:46:49	@castorgirls On mine they mark what's not within normal and show the values. My bad numbers were platelets and thyroid. Strangely...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-10 12:44:34	@castorgirls ...I drop off the results at my primary doctor's office. I did today, they said they'd call me about it. We'll see.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-10 12:43:12	@castorgirls I'm not sure yet. My therapist ordered the test but couldn't interpret the results. She's not a doctor. She suggested...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-10 12:34:40	Got wonky blood test results today. I need a translation ugh!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-09 02:48:12	@weightluss No it's not. Most people "envy" skinny people but don't realize that some are skinny due to ED's. They feel free to tease.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-09 02:26:55	More respect for Miley Cyrus after she speaks about cut4beiber campaign and seriousness of self-harm.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-08 08:33:43	@DepressionSlave And there was a very, very graphic photo of someone who had cut. They have absolutely no thought for anyone else.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-08 07:33:13	@missinginsight @AsSamsara @sarahlou003611 I got one too earlier and figured you were hacked. It happened to me before too. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-08 03:56:12	@weightluss This Bieber thing might be the dumbest, most ignorant thing I've seen on Twitter! And over what!? Pot?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-08 03:52:19	@weightluss @dutchminati Are you f#%*#kidding me!? Self-injury is not a joke or a way to manipulate people! Seriously!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-08 00:48:08	@Kazcita I'm dealing. As for Q, he is one of my all-time favorite characters! Him with the band on the bridge at the end? lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-07 10:29:51	Migraines every single day. Annoying.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-06 13:03:25	@castorgirls I missed the last season so I have to catch up somehow before the next one starts.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-06 13:02:34	@castorgirls It's amazing isn't it!? Come to the dark side CG ;)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-05 12:48:15	@K_is4Kellies @MyBipolarBrain Do you actually have to or can you put your foot down?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-05 12:45:33	@K_is4Kellies @MyBipolarBrain I bet you do! That is NOT ok to do to someone with mh issues! Maybe they just want to charge insurance?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-05 12:41:24	@K_is4Kellies @MyBipolarBrain Seriously!? What the...?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-05 12:40:03	@thinfulthinking That's the million dollar question and a good one too.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-05 09:38:08	@noelove Hey Noel! Can I bother you for that pork mole recipe of awesomeness? I want to buy the ingredients this weekend. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-05 09:31:38	Yesterday was hideous...deep depression, near crying. I noticed I hate going to sleep more now...that waiting for oblivion. Bad dreams too.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-03 03:11:56	Maybe sprinkling salt directly on my tongue would make it stop?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-03 03:11:12	Ugh, craving salt again. I hate that! And it gets so strong too.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:49:23	@ReleasingLunacy @castorgirls Was that sarcasm!? :p
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:48:18	@ReleasingLunacy @castorgirls or is that considered a Smiley? Need help with internet jargon.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:32:42	@castorgirls @ReleasingLunacy You guys are so funny and extremely awesome. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:26:57	@castorgirls @ReleasingLunacy @CimmerianInk Maybe it will be in the DSM revision *crosses fingers*
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:26:07	@ReleasingLunacy @castorgirls HA! Oh my gosh hilarious! Of course CG gets to have all the Tolkien stuff filmed in her country so she wins.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:20:56	@castorgirls @ReleasingLunacy I'm cracking up right now!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:17:12	@ReleasingLunacy @castorgirls lol!!! I wasn't going to say it... :P
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:11:34	@ReleasingLunacy @castorgirls LOL! Oh no, can't be doin' that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:10:33	@castorgirls @ReleasingLunacy Oh yea, that's true! Lame! But you never know.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:08:48	@ReleasingLunacy @castorgirls Is there new interest in the Smurfs? I missed that. So out of the loop!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:07:12	@ReleasingLunacy @castorgirls I'll see if my "deep" thoughts warrant a post. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:05:56	@ReleasingLunacy @castorgirls :) You guys support the strangest things, just like my therapist lol! ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:04:59	@ReleasingLunacy The story was too funny because Facebook took her picture down thinking it was nudity then they realized it was her elbows.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 09:02:57	@castorgirls @ReleasingLunacy Hehe, well I see some new ones for under 10 bucks...just saying. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 08:59:53	@ReleasingLunacy I'm glad you got out for a bit. :) And I'm with you on this day being over.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 08:57:53	@castorgirls @ReleasingLunacy :) lol, I want to blog about it but it feels repetitive and whiny.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 08:55:56	@ReleasingLunacy @castorgirls You gotta get on Ebay CG! :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 08:54:55	@castorgirls @ReleasingLunacy I had an intense workout session today but I actually made a slight emotional connection I need to explore.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 08:53:45	@ReleasingLunacy How are you doing today RL?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 08:53:20	@ReleasingLunacy ...which was hilarious but made me take my time picking pictures lol.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 08:52:44	@ReleasingLunacy I will.I was doing a "deep" "artistic" ;) series of body parts then I remembered the lady whose elbow pic looked like boobs
97096775	CimmerianInk	2013-01-01 08:29:01	Lame, Twitter took out my awesome frame on the last pic. You can only see it if you click the link. :p

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-31 06:30:00	Wow, my blog had 25,000 views this year. Thanks so much guys for hanging in there with all the backwards and forwards I do all year long. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-31 06:27:56	2012 in review: Thank You To Everyone For Staying With Me http:// wp.me/pWw9h-v1
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-31 03:14:12	@castorgirls Well sure, be all reasonable. ;) I'll dm you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-31 02:50:57	@Progressive Hi Progressive, a question: we paid off a car, do we need to call to update the lien information or will the bank tell you? Thx
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-31 02:14:15	So...is the Fiscal Cliff the same as that little yodeling dude on The Price Is Right who falls off if you don't guess right?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-31 02:11:36	@AsSamsara Hey! :) Well the sad thing is that I don't do holidays so no excuse there lol. ;) But thanks.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-31 02:10:30	@castorgirls Actually I do have a question I wanted to ask you but I'm not sure you'll be comfortable answering it. :\
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-31 02:08:48	@castorgirls Not really because I've hit the goal already with a decimal point after it so I know I can do it but I keep backsliding.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-31 02:07:38	@castorgirls But at times I just need to express my anxiety. On the other hand I don't post my daily diet or exercise etc.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-31 02:06:33	@castorgirls Don't worry about it. I think it's good sometimes to be aware of effects on Twitter. Like when people post pics of self-harm.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 23:36:24	@castorgirls Thanks CG. I set myself up for this by setting a goal for Dec 31st. The more I fail...well you get it. I value you too. A lot.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 23:34:54	@castorgirls I know but I struggle with the need to just say something to get it out or to be quiet for the sake of others.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 12:03:13	@ReleasingLunacy Can you take something?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 12:02:49	@ReleasingLunacy Don't you love it when your body switches from one pain to another? Sorry about your ankle hun. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 12:01:40	@twcrew The lame thing is I ate around 900 calories and it just feels awful.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 12:00:47	@twcrew I know it's bad. I weigh myself sometimes up to 5 or 6 times obsessively. It's anxiety either way.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 11:59:24	@ReleasingLunacy Thanks RL :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 11:49:37	@ReleasingLunacy Mmmm...drugs. lol ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 11:46:03	@ReleasingLunacy Or maybe I'll just take extra Xanax so I can breathe lol. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 11:44:43	@ReleasingLunacy I hope so. But I also know that weighing in tomorrow morning is going devastate me. Thanks RL. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 11:30:46	And now I feel bad for posting that stuff because I have friends struggling with ED's and I don't want to trigger them.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 11:29:45	And I feel like I can't leave the house tomorrow because eveyone will see how fat I've gotten.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 11:28:48	Having morbid thoughts because of the intense stress because I overate today. I'm 5lbs heavier than I was this morning. Why am I so evil!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 11:05:45	Had to take a Xanax. Overwhelmed by anxiety about how much I ate today. I'm crushed and the scale has gone up more than I can handle today.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 06:29:42	@castorgirls I'd be distracted lol. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 05:44:32	@castorgirls I know wow!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 05:43:46	@kc8rzk :) Thanks
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 03:58:29	Just baked this pecan pie. pic.twitter.com/5aLLNHPk
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 03:49:41	@castorgirls Whoa! That is AWESOME!!! With the bubbles and everything!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 03:18:22	@havetostarve_ Exactly, but we keep moving the number we want down... :\
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 02:29:12	@havetostarve_ I know how it feels to think I need to lose just a bit more. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 02:26:01	@USPS Wow post office...in line going out the door and you have ONE person working. Really?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-30 00:39:40	@Bethblog @BGS_Devs Just got 100% achievements 1550 gamer points on Skyrim for Xbox, you guys did amazing DLC!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 23:17:17	@XboxSupport Hi Xbox, with the Cloud outage should we not even attempt to access our Cloud data? Is there a danger of losing the saves?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 22:13:45	@havetostarve_ According to a chart I saw, even if you have a small frame, you are already way underweight. Please take care. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 13:10:33	@castorgirls And let's not forget how incredibly long you have been trying for her during this holiday.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 13:09:45	@castorgirls Blending in is boring and overrated. And any failure lies in other's expectations of you, *not* you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 13:07:29	@castorgirls How are you? Though I'm asking as my medication begins to kick in so I won't be of much use. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 13:05:52	@castorgirls Yea, I agree. It's just hard to know sometimes if you didn't have a "normal" to compare.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 12:44:56	And since I'm black I'm allowed to say that lol. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 12:44:16	Really Discover Card!? Commercial with 2 heavy black women going "Mmhmm", neck twisting, loud laughing customer service? Really? #stereotype
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 12:12:29	@ReleasingLunacy No worries. I just get puzzled by the pretty pictures commercials paint sometimes.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 12:11:35	@ReleasingLunacy Neither was I and even more so now as an adult.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 12:10:41	@ReleasingLunacy Mmmm....virtual soup lol. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 11:57:20	My mother slapped me when I was little and feeling nauseous and told me to shut up.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 11:55:43	Tylenol commercial where a mother comforts her little girl on her lap, humming "You are my sunshine" because she's ill. Do moms do that?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 11:43:04	@ReleasingLunacy Hey RL, you're not alone. :) ((hugs and soup))
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 11:36:55	@SarahJLA Is it the one where George does the opposite and yells at the guys in the movie theater?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 09:13:47	Just saw what the @wegohealth award nomination said for the 1st time and it was very kind. I'm very grateful that people even read my blog.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 09:01:29	Numbness and anger hit at the same time because a problem with Xbox is stopping me from working out. I'm anxious and sullen.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 08:31:14	@XboxLIVErewards Hi! Was buying the Halo 4 Map Pass for 2,000 points eligible for the promotion this month in conjunction w/staying Gold?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 08:28:29	Just saw the Catholics Come Home commercial. They mention all they've done...except for the #clergyabuse .
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 08:15:54	@K_is4Kellies Well I'm glad you're okay. :) Or at least mostly okay ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 08:13:22	@K_is4Kellies :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 08:13:04	@K_is4Kellies Are you safe though?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 08:05:02	@K_is4Kellies When you say you find yourself, do you mean you dissociated and went somewhere?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 06:26:18	There was nothing peaceful about the way she died because she was raped and murdered.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 06:25:10	The Indian woman who was #gang -raped has passed away. The article said it was "peaceful".Really? You think she died peacefully? Think again.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 01:16:21	@dylansmoosie Exactly!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 00:45:12	@LaurenRainbows :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-29 00:44:42	@dylansmoosie That's my feeling. In this case the images were on his laptop so that's enough evidence to bar him from kids until a trial.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 22:33:09	@dylansmoosie Yes it does. He should be kept away from all children, I don't care if he hasn't had a trial yet. Safety of kids first!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 13:36:28	@dylansmoosie And the judge is letting him continue to treat children!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 12:52:16	@ShopEBV @Etsy WOW! Spectacular!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 12:00:41	@LaurenRainbows Absolutely! Have a good night. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 11:46:23	@ChimeEdwards You wrote that review very thoughtfully & made excellent points Chime. Trust the feeling in your heart. Slavery is not a joke.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 11:37:35	@LaurenRainbows I've noticed that sometimes Angry parts can be protectors and that's a good thing. We all do the best we can. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 11:30:34	@LaurenRainbows Sounds very caring. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 11:25:00	@LaurenRainbows I hear you. I came to really appreciate my Angry part. She's also strong and I bet you are too. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 11:23:37	@K_is4Kellies One thing to remember is that you've said you aren't a danger and they *cannot* make you go to the hospital. And breathe. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 11:18:50	@LaurenRainbows You know what? I've learned that Anger has a place too. Angry parts have really good reasons to be angry. So I welcome you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 05:10:37	Just started watching Castle and freaked when @NathanFillion came out in a "Mal" costume! That was awseome! #browncoats
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-28 04:38:30	@K_is4Kellies lol K!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 23:05:08	@PainIntoPeace I definitely understand that. Hopefully she won't stay long. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 23:03:08	@PainIntoPeace Hmmm well if the nurse sees you will that satisfy them enough to give you your lithium? And you wanted to check the levels?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 22:59:47	@PainIntoPeace Can you get the dr to at least give you another week? That's not too much and maybe you can leave the house later.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 12:33:16	@LaurenRainbows Yes it is. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 09:22:07	@thatgamecompany Do you know how hard it was to wait a whole week to play Journey again so I could get the "Return" trophy? :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 09:20:56	@LaurenRainbows @K_is4Kellies I bet a lot people agree. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 09:20:27	@K_is4Kellies I'm with you!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 08:53:23	@K_is4Kellies So glad holidays are over for everyone.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 08:51:38	@twcrew Sorry to hear that. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 08:48:58	@NerdAppropriate Strangely I just bought this game earlier this year but never put it in. I will now. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 01:10:51	@PainIntoPeace lol! You found a hoodie?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-27 01:06:33	@thinfulthinking Tell me about it. Weighing in today was devastating. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-26 23:20:05	Will be at my local comic book store when the doors open to get @DanSlott last Amazing Spiderman. Can't wait.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-26 23:17:56	@PainIntoPeace As a hint I searched for "hoodie lots" and found tons of cheaper hoodies in groups of 2-4 or more for great prices. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-26 23:15:11	@ohgodscrewthis @RiffTrax I can see that in my head. Rob says "Line?"
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-26 23:12:49	@lizerman lol, I always love the dark side.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-26 23:07:26	@PainIntoPeace I bought a whole bunch of Aeropostle hoodies on Ebay. All in excellent condition and for a 1/4 of the price.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-26 23:01:32	#JJAbrams turned down directing the new #StarWars movie? It's as if a million nerds cried out at once and were suddenly silenced.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-26 07:59:49	How is it I JUST discovered Rifftrax!? I just watched Twilight and New Moon with their voice-overs, laughed so hard I actually cried.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-26 07:58:14	@HuffingtonPost "Line?"
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-26 04:14:23	Just watched the 10th Anniversary Firefly special and saw myself in the audience at Comic-Con lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-25 22:37:11	@noelove Yay, thanks I will!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-25 11:54:44	@noelove OMG! Do you know how much I would LOVE the recipe for pork mole? One of my absolute favorites!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-25 09:16:08	@kc8rzk Thank you. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-25 08:47:44	In cases of tragedy committing by someone I don't believe it's always "mental illness", I believe in evil. Some people are just evil,not ill

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-24 07:45:12	Cool moment reading Indestructible Hulk #2 Bruce Banner uses Gamma fracking which is green & eco-safe. Thinking @Mruff221 might approve?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-24 06:40:24	@PainIntoPeace Good :) Oh and have you Googled anything about Lithium levels to get some idea if there's a problem?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-24 06:36:25	@PainIntoPeace Absolutely! Before they close for the holiday. Let us know what they say okay?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-24 06:30:31	@PainIntoPeace Were you able to talk to your prescribing doctor about the symptoms? You don't want to let it go too long.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-24 03:09:27	@PainIntoPeace Are they too high? Have you had your thyroid tested too? Lithium can affect it so it's good to keep an eye on it.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-21 12:52:56	@castorgirls Thank you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-21 12:51:15	@castorgirls Yikes! Let's hope things go better from here. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-21 12:18:18	@castorgirls Did your plane make it in?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-21 12:17:41	@castorgirls if it's based on a lie for attention? ...it's fine. This is the same circular argument I have with my therapist. :) ....
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-21 12:16:09	@castorgirls If a person believes they are attention-seeking then nothing is valid.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-21 11:34:33	@Kerroonthecouch That's kind Kerro, thank you. I think you're pretty awesome too. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-21 10:01:40	@castorgirls Oh no, I hope by the time I respond to this you're on your way or already there?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-21 10:01:08	@castorgirls The current pain doesn't feel justified unless I can prove something more happened. Therefore it can't be dealt with.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-21 06:58:48	@castorgirls Yes but you know why I'm asking. Maybe not 100% but do people remember more than me? Are you off the plane already?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-21 06:57:53	@Kerroonthecouch See, you're not though because I'd rather not be a liar or attention-seeking.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 22:40:03	@Kerroonthecouch Hey Kerro :) I guess I'm wishing I remembered more concrete things to prove I'm not lying to myself. It's causing distress.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 13:08:07	I wonder how many victims of #sexualabuse as children have 100% recall of what happened? Or do many struggle with memory?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 12:36:18	@ReleasingLunacy Thanks and she's got the sweetest heart. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 11:26:38	@castorgirls Great idea! I look forward to seeing them. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 11:20:31	@castorgirls lol that's a more likely explanation. I know we have a time difference but if you need me I'll be here.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 11:10:22	@castorgirls Oi sometimes it's like the universe conspiring though I don't put stock in the Mayan thing. :) I'll try to be available for you

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 03:49:13	Apologizing for people's reaction to something you did isn't the same as apologizing for what you did. #kristenstewartcheating
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 02:57:26	@SarahJLA @thatgamecompany OMG just finished Journey...wow! That was beautiful! I can't believe how engaging that was.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 00:27:25	@K_is4Kellies Ugh! I hate that side effect!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 00:10:00	@K_is4Kellies Doh Of course it's antipsychotic! And I hear you on the hospital. I will say that Invega helped at the time. I do seroquel now
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 00:02:15	@K_is4Kellies Dumb question: what is AP? :) And you're comorbid like us so yes meds help.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-20 00:00:33	@K_is4Kellies I take an antipsychotic now but it's for bipolar disorder not DID.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 23:58:46	@K_is4Kellies But that was different than DID switching.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 23:58:20	@K_is4Kellies There was a point when I was having trouble with fantasy intruding w/out my control and my doc put me on Invega which helped.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 23:57:16	@K_is4Kellies ...not because it may get there someday. I guess try to stay calm and try the meds though I thought meds don't help DID?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 23:56:05	@K_is4Kellies Jesus K! I think that's an overreaction on her part! In my area psych hospitals take you because of danger of death or harm...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 23:46:20	@K_is4Kellies ....are you unsafe? Wouldn't more therapy be suggested instead?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 23:45:30	@K_is4Kellies Ummm...and why is that reason for hospitalization? Hospitalization is for when you're not safe or a danger to yourself...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 23:38:50	@K_is4Kellies Hey just read about your therapist talking about hospitalization. Why did they suggest that!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 14:12:48	@castorgirls I'll check on you later, won't get rid of me that easy. :) *warm mushies* my friend.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 14:10:06	@castorgirls I apologize my seroquel is knocking me out
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 14:09:35	@castorgirls I understand that very much. I think maybe try to supplement what you can for your health in the meantime though.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 14:03:41	@castorgirls ...point is. My therapist says the turning point is different for different people. Will the test results be yours?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 14:02:33	@castorgirls Yes but you have to be ready to accept help. I don't admit that anything's wrong with me so...I don't know what the turning...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:59:13	@castorgirls I rationalize that I have time.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:57:49	@castorgirls I agree with you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:55:17	@castorgirls I'm sure you're right about the psychological. I just think the physical isn't there yet.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:45:24	@castorgirls No news there, same as usual. I don't think I do any damage yet.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:34:52	@castorgirls I guess meant that maybe the pressure would be less after the anxiety of xmas is over?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:28:46	@castorgirls Will you be taking on the ED issue after the holidays are over?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:27:10	@castorgirls Excellent! I'm so proud of you!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:26:18	@castorgirls Thanks. Right back at ya. I hope you reach out if you need to while you're gone. Twitter, blog or something.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:23:02	@castorgirls Agreements within or agreements with Allison? Just curious. I'm really glad you've taken steps to be safe.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:20:39	@castorgirls Ugh, that's gotta be rough. I'm sorry CG. Can you find it within yourself to care about the damage?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:17:03	@castorgirls and yes I bet going back home is full of anxiety. :( Do you have to go?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 13:16:06	@castorgirls Uh oh, were the tests because of the ED? Can you say what the results were or no?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 12:56:09	@castorgirls Very good! It was great. :) What's going on? Have you been triggered? Is the holidays?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 08:40:15	@castorgirls So I've seen Hobbit twice, 2nd time w/out HFR and w/out was way better for me experience-wise. I LOVED Hobbit!! How are you CG?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-19 00:10:20	@K_is4Kellies I'm so sorry that happened to you K. But I'm glad you got information to help towards healing.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-18 23:51:06	@K_is4Kellies Were you able to leave a message?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-18 23:50:27	@K_is4Kellies Having the note is good then for those who don't speak. That may help you talk about it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-18 23:49:18	@K_is4Kellies Just read it, and yes that is very important information you just got! You handled it beautifully too. How old were you?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-18 23:27:19	@K_is4Kellies ...your therapist ahead of time that you need the full time available?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-18 23:26:37	@K_is4Kellies You did!? Did you write about it because I'm WAY behind on reading blogs. I understand the lack of RL friends. Can you tell...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-18 23:17:23	@K_is4Kellies 10!? Oh jeez that's not good. :( I would need more stability. I hope you get 90 since you have so much to talk about.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-18 23:11:37	Saw the Hobbit again but w/out high frame rate, much better visually as HFR made people walk really fast unless our theater set it up wrong.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-18 23:08:53	@K_is4Kellies Do you get a full hour at your therapist? Mine is only 45 minutes, not always enough time. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-14 13:55:54	@castorgirls Hmmm...makes me even more curious now.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-14 13:52:02	@castorgirls Was it a good difference or a bad difference?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-14 13:39:27	@castorgirls Yes to both. And there's a guy in the building with the BEST Legolas costume I've ever seen! He even runs like him!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-12 09:21:43	@bipolarvoice Very twisted and mean too. I'm so sorry that happened to you. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-12-12 09:03:33	@bipolarvoice Boo! That's awful! Your words were powerful even when stolen.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-11-21 12:09:16	@borealischaos I also think they should add some other categories and symptoms to anorexia and bulimia to cover different types of people.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-11-21 12:07:29	@SarahJLA Time for delivery?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-11-21 12:06:13	@borealischaos Exactly! It almost needs another name to be taken more seriously.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-11-21 11:59:36	@borealischaos They need to make people aware of how serious it is, and know it's a real disorder.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-11-21 11:48:53	@borealischaos Absolutely.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-11-21 11:47:32	@borealischaos Yes. The subject needs attention.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-14 11:30:43	@castorgirls As your friend it would hurt more not to be there for you than any possible triggers. I'm a grown-up, it's okay. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-14 11:29:16	@castorgirls As you tell me: we're responsible in managing triggers. You tell what needs to be told and let me & others decide what to read.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-14 11:21:30	@castorgirls Please do! Or email me or something! I want to be there for you. You don't have to do this alone. Blogging, others can help too
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-14 11:18:01	@castorgirls I don't want to push if Twitter isn't the right place to talk about it but I want to know what's going on. ?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-14 11:03:22	@castorgirls I understand and I'm sorry you're having such a rough time. I thought your blog post showed lots of insight but I was sad....
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-14 10:54:20	@ReleasingLunacy It was. I felt very unworthy, if that makes any sense.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-03 00:44:42	@mymorevividlife ...I have it recorded to watch asap though so no spoilers as River Song would say. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-03 00:43:53	@mymorevividlife I haven't watched the Who mid finale yet because my husband and I always watch it together and he's been so busy working.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-03 00:31:13	@mymorevividlife I have never seen Babylon 5 can you believe it!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-03 00:30:14	@mymorevividlife Yea, DS9 was different, darker, but TNG goes many different places and they have some really good plots.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-03 00:23:33	@mymorevividlife TOS definitely had something despite the camp. :-) TNG gets more serious, more interesting and the acting gets better.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-03 00:17:08	@mymorevividlife Oh! It gets so much better in later seasons! Deana is still useless but better stories come and more character development.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-03 00:05:21	@mymorevividlife You like my favorites lol! What season are you on so I can see where you are in development?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-02 23:52:47	@mymorevividlife Who don't you like? :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-02 23:52:29	@mymorevividlife I'm out of sorts but oh well. If you just started Star Trek TNG then you have to get through the 1st season. It gets better
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-02 23:03:04	@MyBipolarBrain Yea, that makes sense to me then.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-02 22:56:41	@MyBipolarBrain I bet your body is so used to napping that it's on a schedule.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-02 22:54:11	@MyBipolarBrain Ugh, that sucks! Are you going to try not napping and see if it works?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-02 22:51:56	@MyBipolarBrain Do you take sleep meds at night?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-02 22:50:19	@MyBipolarBrain Hmmm, I understand. Are you napping out of habit or because you're depressed?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-02 22:46:03	@MyBipolarBrain Why can't you nap?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-10-02 08:50:06	@SarahJLA We didn't have Smallville so what could we do?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-29 11:10:17	Most people with #bipolar disorder would rather hurt themselves than anyone else. The media is NOT helping the stigma.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-29 11:09:14	Once again bipolar disorder is being listed as something that can make you murder an innocent person.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-29 07:22:09	@SarahJLA Yea, I liked the first one okay, but this is just pure fun! I think Gearbox calls it joy-puking your face off or something lol. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-29 03:16:04	@twcrew Yea it pretty much sucks. Many times Eve seeks him out for sex after flashbacks which is not normal unless one is re-enacting abuse.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-24 09:39:09	@podcastitute Gotcha. When I saw the site I freaked. Borderlands makes me all stressed and hyper...in a good way. :-)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-16 03:12:38	@SarahJLA It's worth playing ME2 again just to have Garrus romance Shep's pants off lol. Love his scars. ;)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-14 08:31:50	@SarahJLA What's funny is when the talking in the scenes triggers a Kinect command and you're like "Huh? Why did I just reave the wall?"

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-05 07:43:32	@Gam3Newz Where is Vasquez for goodness sake!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-05 05:44:30	@ReleasingLunacy Get some rest! ((hugs))
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-05 05:44:05	@bipolarlainey Hopefully that's all it is. My doctor is the one who brought it to my attention as a heads up.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-05 04:25:44	Nervous. Doctor put me on Singulair for my asthma but it can cause mood swings and suicidal thoughts. :\
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-04 21:58:01	@ReleasingLunacy I wanted to send ((safe hugs)) because I read your post about hate and it broke my heart. Please be good to you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-04 09:30:13	@XboxSupport I <3 @XboxSupport because they respond super fast and they're nice too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-04 09:26:59	@SarahJLA Maybe because he has to fully give himself over to that identity in order to do what needs to be done?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-04 07:00:39	@ReleasingLunacy Good news! :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-04 03:02:41	Anger http:// wp.me/pWw9h-tO
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-02 09:20:26	@castorgirls Seems pretty but also meaningful?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-02 05:59:09	@castorgirls Thanks. If the song comforts you then that's good. Take care of you. ((hug))
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-02 05:37:09	@SarahJLA I believe in you. ;) I find it easier than the PS3.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-02 05:36:14	@SarahJLA Actually I'll throw in that you may want to check out Black Friday sales in November. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-02 05:35:25	@SarahJLA Welcome to the club lol! I'll dm you my gamertag if you get one. Think of it: Borderlands 2 girl co-op. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-02 05:08:21	@castorgirls I'm glad this evil holiday is one day. Ugh! Can you listen to another song to kick the other one out your head?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-02 02:43:24	Has this all been a distraction? http:// wp.me/pWw9h-tL
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 11:58:38	@castorgirls Oh! I see! Then it's really good you were able to get home and take some time off to recuperate.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 11:57:33	@castorgirls I hope I can write tomorrow because otherwise I won't get any grasp on this. I'm just vaguely aware now.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 11:56:18	@castorgirls Thank you. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 11:43:36	@castorgirls Did you take flu meds that made you zonk out?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 11:42:39	@castorgirls I appreciate the worry though I hate causing it. It's weird to just be realizing something might be off.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 10:48:24	@MyBipolarBrain I should add that I asked because there's a free app that has lots of sounds for sleep.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 10:44:57	@MyBipolarBrain Do sounds help you go to sleep?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 10:43:13	@MyBipolarBrain I'm sorry you had such a rough time. I hope you can get some sleep.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 10:24:15	@MyBipolarBrain How are you?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 10:22:38	@SarahJLA Thanks to you!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 10:18:10	Got my new superhero socks! pic.twitter.com/pymGatAc
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 09:37:09	@castorgirls I do want know what Allison says IF it's not imposing or none of my business. :) You getting lost and making it home scared me.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 09:35:23	@castorgirls I must be really slow because I didn't catch on. :) I need to write a blog post...maybe tomorrow. I think I'm disconnected.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 08:43:30	@castorgirls ...for the first 6 months which is now over.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 08:43:01	@castorgirls ...issue is because my T isn't in their network (they're terrible) so it would cost more to see her weekly. I had a reprieve...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 08:41:32	@castorgirls Agh! I just saw this response! I thought you didn't reply...sorry. Ummm, anyway, glad you have an appt and the insurance...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 08:37:56	@MyBipolarBrain I'm so sorry. :( Do you know grounding techniques?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-09-01 02:19:23	Just got my Black Label Katniss Everdeen Barbie! Not for the Barbie part but for Katniss. :) pic.twitter.com/QM7lcbIS
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-31 08:02:42	@MyBipolarBrain So good! :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-31 08:00:09	@castorgirls Not sure how I am but I'm glad to see you. I've been super worried about you. Did Allison tell you how your session was?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-31 07:57:35	@MyBipolarBrain I know it isn't. You're doing the best you can and you keep trying. That's awesome.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-31 07:56:17	@castorgirls This is beautiful CG...and it's sad. I understand it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-31 07:51:39	@MyBipolarBrain So proud of you. ((hug))
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-31 06:47:31	WTF!? "A prominent New York-based friar has sympathy for some pedophiles saying they are sometimes "seduced" by their underage victims."
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-30 22:42:31	How about no name calling on either side.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-30 22:41:43	Is it really necessary for evolutionists to call people who believe in God ignorant? How is that better than fanatics who do it to them?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-30 21:56:30	@MyNocturnalSoul Sometimes we can see the truth but we can't apply it to ourselves yet. Doesn't mean the advice is wrong, :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-30 21:25:26	: Posted from ABC News http:// abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/d efendant-texas-rape-case-vanishes-trial-17112599 … via @addthis
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-30 11:14:58	@SarahJLA Ooh black hoodie, that's really nice. If you're going to wear a hoodie it should be Shepard's favorite hoodie on the Citadel. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-30 11:00:42	@SarahJLA Also I decided to order the Garrus from Play Arts Kai because he's better than the toy version.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-30 10:58:17	@SarahJLA I like the hoodie, though I like the utility (?) jacket even more. I love your Garrus shirt and the Alistair one. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-30 10:54:49	@SarahJLA WOW! I love it! I only have the N7 shirt.I've been slacking. Though I have preordered both Garrus & Femshep figures. Need shirts!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-30 02:39:30	@castorgirls I meant when you said that you were going to email her to make sure you didn't do anything "awful" during the session. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-30 00:45:12	@MyBipolarBrain Congrats! :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-30 00:44:50	@Xbox The grenade launcher. Grenades are awesome! #Swagfest #halo4
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 23:00:46	Bic Pens ‘For Her’ Draw Amazon Flames http:// abcn.ws/OqP0VX (via @ABC ) You guys HAVE to read this article!!! Hilarious!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 22:23:12	@gideonemery Yes, I love that tweeting pictures of herself in bikinis or underwear is news. Her being naked is what started this madness.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 21:52:54	@castorgirls Is it ok if I ask how things went after you talk to her? You don't have to share...I'm just really worried about you. ((hugs))
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 11:20:25	@castorgirls I'm sure you didn't. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 11:09:15	@castorgirls Do you think you'll ask her to tell you about the session?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 11:08:23	@castorgirls Oh hun! I'm so sorry! These stupid greeting card pushing holidays are awful. It's ok to protect yourself & part of you did that
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 11:02:12	@castorgirls Ok. I'll be thinking about you. Have you spoken to Allison about what happened?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 11:00:21	@castorgirls I'm fine. Are you up to going back?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 05:15:14	For the love of God, media PLEASE stop publishing whatever half-naked pics Kim Kardashian sends you! You only encourage her! #15minutes
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 04:48:24	@castorgirls Hi. I wanted to check and see how you're feeling...mentally and physically?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 02:37:10	@cherapple Sure! I hope the doctor can help her. Good luck! :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 01:52:03	@cherapple I've never heard of that before, how awful! If she's not too young birth control can help with periods...just periods :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-29 01:49:58	Just saw an article highlighting Kristen Stewart's Grumpiest Faces and I laughed and laughed. Her face is pretty much always grumpy.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-28 22:19:22	@SarahJLA I have one too. I hooked it up maybe a year or two ago and played Star Wars.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-28 22:18:23	@SarahJLA LOL! Reminds me of how I play Sims. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-28 22:17:42	@SarahJLA Yes that is very cool! Gotta love NES games!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-28 22:16:02	@SarahJLA Gotcha. I still remember Oregon Trail lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-28 21:26:19	@SarahJLA I want to play a Commodore 64 game I downloaded but I have no idea how to use a DOS emulator.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-28 21:25:01	@SarahJLA I don't know that one. What platform is it on?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-28 08:26:05	@SarahJLA Oldies can be goodies. I'm going to go back and play The Dig ala LucasArts. Played that in either the late 90's or very early 00's
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-28 07:04:45	@castorgirls Again, I'm so sorry I didn't see this! I'm so glad you made it home!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-28 05:32:32	@castorgirls Oh my God! How did I miss this tweet!!?? I'm so sorry I didn't see it! Are you ok now...besides being sick I mean?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-27 11:43:16	@SarahJLA I just bought the Robin socks and the Superman socks from a seller on ebay. Great price and combined shipping! :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-27 11:30:31	@SarahJLA LOL! I just found those and I'm lovin' the Robin ones because bright colors entertain me.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-27 11:28:11	@SarahJLA Woot! Found them on Ebay for $8.99 and free shipping. Now I must investigate other super hero socks lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-27 11:24:54	@SarahJLA I love that site! Did I miss the capes on yours?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-27 11:20:20	@SarahJLA Thanks, I'll check. Great pic!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-27 11:18:52	@SarahJLA Oh boo! *pouting* I may have to search the interweb lol. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-27 11:12:36	@SarahJLA Where did you get those!? I must know!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-27 11:09:44	I entered the Rock Band Blitz Giveaway for Xbox 360 for a chance to win 1 code to download Rock Band Blitz: http:// wfi.re/mpytg
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 10:14:57	@MyBipolarBrain Doh! See even more logic.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 10:14:27	@MyBipolarBrain You might try, like flushing your system.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 10:13:57	@MyBipolarBrain Exactly!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 10:00:31	@MyBipolarBrain Question: will drinking lots of water help the process along?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 10:00:02	@MyBipolarBrain Ok, so getting some rest will help and sometimes just having *some* relief is enough to kind of get through the rest.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 09:53:46	@MyBipolarBrain I have to think that the alcohol effect will get lesser over time right?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 09:53:07	@MyBipolarBrain I try to go to bed and hope that whatever made things dark will have eased in the morning. Not gone...but eased.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 09:52:12	@MyBipolarBrain Have you ever had that feeling that if you could get some sleep things will be better tomorrow? Sometimes when I'm real low
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 09:27:56	@MyBipolarBrain I understand. Anxiety can be part of the down especially anxiety about how people feel about you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 09:22:50	@MyBipolarBrain I've worried about that before but they're trained to understand when we struggle and we're always harder on ourselves.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 09:19:53	@MyBipolarBrain ...about you will NEVER give up on you. People who *really* understand will NEVER give up on you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 09:18:42	@MyBipolarBrain At times like this my therapist says that we're still going uphill, we're just taking a side route. And people who care...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 09:10:03	@MyBipolarBrain ...you're a good person who struggles with pain but keeps trying to help herself. That's awesome and stumbling is okay.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 09:08:55	@MyBipolarBrain Yea, that's why I'm thinking movie because it would last longer. Also, you need to try and let go of the guilt.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 09:04:45	@MyBipolarBrain Do you have something that makes you laugh out loud every time, like a movie you just love?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 08:57:13	@MyBipolarBrain I understand. So is there a way for you to really feel inside that this is where the feelings are coming from, to get calm?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 08:50:36	@MyBipolarBrain Alcohol can be a depressant right? It makes sense that you would be down afterwards. Was there some guilt about it too?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 08:37:09	@MyBipolarBrain But did something set off the feeling or is it general weariness with life?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-26 08:11:10	@MyBipolarBrain I'm sorry hun. What's going on?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-25 10:26:01	@SarahJLA White wine? No way! Maybe the Thalmor drink that but Nords? No way! My Redguard drinks a nice red. ;)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-24 08:12:36	Why do news reports call sexual abuse "sex scandals"? It's abuse!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 23:51:31	@SarahJLA lol! Yea, I'm sure fan feelings really bother him when he sleeps on his piles of money.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 23:49:07	@SarahJLA Take that George Lucas! ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 23:47:54	Listened to my god damn therapist and ate more "normally" yesterday, woke up today and gained .6 lbs. Even that's too much. Bitch!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 23:45:26	@SarahJLA I have a stormtrooper mug I haven't broken out in a while. But I reject that midi-chlorians are behind the force lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 12:00:26	@cullenbunn Deadpool is one of my favorite Marvel heroes/antiheroes!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 11:17:01	@ReleasingLunacy Thank you RL. You too! :) ((safe hugs))
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 11:09:53	@ReleasingLunacy Hehe, I wish I could enjoy food like I used to. Wishes, wishes huh?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 11:08:03	@ReleasingLunacy Woops I meant all three not both.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 11:07:26	@ReleasingLunacy Those are all good ideas. Maybe I'll do both. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 11:06:26	@ReleasingLunacy It's not wrong. :) I understand why you say it...eating should be good. Maybe one day I will be normal.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 11:04:42	@ReleasingLunacy It does. I want to hit something!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 10:59:11	@ReleasingLunacy It does. The phrase needs to be erased not used more! Grrr!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 10:58:22	I realized I am absolutely LIVID! Angry at my therapist for our talk about my eating. Angry because I tried to eat and now I hate myself!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 10:55:02	OMFG! Now other politicians are using the term forcible rape! They differentiate it from violent rape? Really!? #rapeisrape
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 10:49:26	@SarahJLA LOL!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 09:17:52	What a joke! http:// wp.me/pWw9h-tF
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 08:02:10	@MyBipolarBrain Good. I hope you get out of the hospital soon.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 08:01:28	@ReleasingLunacy I grew veggies in pots which was much easier.:-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 07:52:37	@MyBipolarBrain How are you?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 06:27:09	@SarahJLA It was cool to grow tomatoes and use them. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 06:26:36	@ReleasingLunacy :) I used tomatoes from my garden which was neat.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 06:25:52	@ReleasingLunacy *Hugs right back at ya*! It's rough both ways isn't it?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 06:17:00	Made homemade tomato sauce. pic.twitter.com/kcDVoHBY
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 06:15:31	@ReleasingLunacy I honestly don't care about my organs right now. I can't handle gaining weight. Maybe I should care, but can't.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-23 02:50:00	@slowlywechange They actually said that!? Or was it implied? Good for you for trying to take care of yourself. Screw them.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-22 01:12:30	@MyBipolarBrain I believe in you. ((hugs))
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-22 01:07:00	@MyBipolarBrain Yay! You can do this! :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-22 00:24:45	@borealischaos Thanks, likewise. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-22 00:19:32	@borealischaos I hope your metabolism levels out. It would be hard to struggle with weight after suffering with food issues. ((hug))
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-22 00:13:40	@borealischaos I'm sorry. :( Usually it's about more than losing weight.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-22 00:09:27	@borealischaos You did that weekly? Did it affect you?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-21 09:48:15	@XboxSupport Ok will do! I thought it was up to Xbox to support the game but if it's them I'll tweet it. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-21 09:34:33	@XboxSupport @zumba Is this about trying to get Zumba Fitness Rush as a supported game on the Xbox PlayFit App? I'd love to see it on there

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-18 23:03:40	@castorgirls Ummm...being hideously fat and disgusting? Again, no sarcasm just truth.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-18 20:51:17	@castorgirls I don't know what you mean. When I say that, I'm being serious not obtuse. I don't understand the question.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-08 10:20:28	@ReleasingLunacy @JazzyJ1112 lol! I love what the media considers "news".
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-08 10:19:37	@ReleasingLunacy True. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-08 10:03:13	@ReleasingLunacy (((big hugs back to you))) I'm sorry you relate, that sucks. I'd rather be alone in my problems than have others suffering.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-08 09:59:25	@ReleasingLunacy @JazzyJ1112 I hope the distraction works. Sorry you're sad and afraid. :(

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 10:39:42	@castorgirls I don't know. It was like I was angry and in his face at first and then a change came over me and I got scared of him.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 10:37:59	@castorgirls Freud can have fun with that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 10:37:21	@castorgirls ...and then I backed off. In the dream I asked him to tell me what he did to me, then I think I got scared and backed away.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 10:36:15	@castorgirls It's weird because he didn't really look like himself, kind of an approximation but I was really aggressive in the dream...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 10:31:34	@castorgirls Thanks. :) I had a dream about confronting him and his wife last night and all day I've seen him and a house or a room.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 10:30:25	@castorgirls Ugh! I can imagine this process is going to suck so just know that I will be here for you whenever you want to talk or vent.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 10:26:33	@castorgirls Not a good day...intrusive thoughts. One last question and I won't bug you about this anymore. :) When's your appointment?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 10:07:54	@castorgirls ...harsher than the way I'm thinking it and I can't convey the tone I mean so I hope you know how I mean this to sound.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 10:06:48	@castorgirls ...take you because of BMI or whatever, let it be because of them, not because you minimized what's happening. That reads...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 10:05:19	@castorgirls May I make a request? When you see them, please don't downplay what's happening with you. If their "rules" won't let them...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 10:02:19	@castorgirls *hug* Is this appointment to see if they'll help you or have they already accepted you?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 09:59:41	@castorgirls I wanted to see how you were feeling now after it's been a bit since the dentist?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 09:57:48	@castorgirls *snort* yea, it's so rough lol!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 05:17:12	@castorgirls I'm sorry. I was wondering if you had been given something to relax and that was why you didn't remember.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-08-03 05:16:03	@SarahJLA Well I saw that the weapon pack is out on the 7th but wondered if it's seperate from the main dlc.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-31 03:25:55	@castorgirls It's fear. She was looking for a way to contact me and considered contacting some cousins but...

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-29 22:37:48	@MyBipolarBrain It's a way for her to abuse you as an adult.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-29 22:01:15	@bipolarvoice Agreed. They would be offended if another country did that with a 9/11 tribute.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-29 22:00:22	@MyBipolarBrain If she's like my mother she gets a kick from exercising control over you & knowing you're dependant on her. Prove her wrong.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-29 21:43:39	@MyBipolarBrain You know what I've said before...take whatever steps are needed over time to move out. She adds to what you deal with.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-29 21:37:32	@MyBipolarBrain She's playing the victim again. So selfish! You deserve better.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-28 20:53:57	@MyBipolarBrain I understand. They're all addictions and when we try to conquer one, the others get difficult. Hang in there.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-28 20:50:02	@MyBipolarBrain Congratulations on the 16 days! That's wonderful! :) The other things take time. Don't be too hard on yourself.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-28 09:24:52	@castorgirls I specifically try to be healthier than my family. My grandmother was good and died. My mother is not and should.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-28 08:52:16	@castorgirls No. I'm just disappointed. My grandmother died young, I hope she follows pattern.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-28 08:32:01	Since one of my uncle's died (not the abuser), all I can think of is how much I want my mother to die too.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-26 01:36:12	@bipolarlainey That's a long episode. The crash sucks I'm so sorry. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-25 22:57:07	Kristen Stewart does realize her fame is based on Twilight right? If she cheated on "Edward" her fan base will hate her =no money.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-24 23:05:30	@primagames Can you help me resolve the issue with my e-guide that I asked about yesterday??? I keep trying to get help and nothing happens.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-24 21:33:54	@mymorevividlife Thanks. :) Though I still support traveling back in time to kill Freud.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-24 21:22:57	@mymorevividlife ...about heavy things? I bet it would take a bit to get back to a comfortable place. Me? I'm still sick, stupid cold.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-24 21:21:32	@mymorevividlife I imagine that things might be weird after a break. How do you not see someone for 3 weeks and then go back to talking...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-24 21:15:17	@mymorevividlife Did you have a bad session?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-24 10:17:28	@SarahJLA Don't you want Anders in your bubble? Wait that sounds wrong...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-24 09:16:14	On my own again tonight.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-24 08:52:42	@primagames It's been days and I haven't heard back.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-24 07:48:38	@primagames Yes I did.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-24 06:54:51	@A_HOWDZ And were you? ;)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 11:12:04	@Sheffele @castorgirls Definitely.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 11:06:58	@castorgirls @Sheffele I understand the need when services are limited but what about prevention before things get bad?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 11:05:34	@Sheffele @castorgirls I always thought only thin people did until this last year. I learned otherwise.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 11:03:01	@castorgirls I sincerely hope it's better too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 11:00:29	@castorgirls That is superiorly lame of them. ED's happen at lots of weights and relying on bmi only is not good enough.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 10:57:33	@castorgirls ...and it's about what's really going on...the motivation and pain behind the eating issues. That deserves help.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 10:56:18	@castorgirls Like you told me, it's better to get help before things are far gone. It's not all about the numbers right? It's your health...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 10:50:35	@castorgirls I will. How are you today?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 10:33:05	@castorgirls It's scary. And being sick just sucks. Wish it was fun.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 09:31:55	I don't think I've been alone like this since my grandmother died.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 04:57:56	@PainIntoPeace Doing it was the hardest part. But it was necessary and especially with my mother, it was the best decision I ever made.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 04:42:59	@PainIntoPeace Don't get me wrong, it still hurts but I had to take some kind of control. I've cut off both parents for separate reasons.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 04:36:23	@PainIntoPeace ...worth it anymore. I tried to get him to have a relationship with me but he wouldn't make the effort.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 04:35:07	@PainIntoPeace So to answer your question, yes it did help to cut him off. I would cry for hours after talking to him and the pain wasn't...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 04:34:01	@PainIntoPeace I just wanted to check before I answered. My dad didn't abuse me either, just wasn't there except calling every 6 or 7 years.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 04:19:58	@PainIntoPeace Before I answer may I ask if your father was the one who abused you?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 04:13:24	@PainIntoPeace I had to stop talking to mine. I'm sorry you were hurt. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 04:06:53	@PainIntoPeace I don't know the particulars of your personal story but for me my dad has the power to disappoint and hurt even today.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 03:23:12	Oh my God news media; the theater shooter was going to kill people no matter what, "Batman" did not cause it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 02:57:19	Ugh, I am SO sick. Hubby went camping without me. Now I can cough and groan by myself.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 02:42:35	@PainIntoPeace It's not silly and it's not your fault.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-23 02:40:13	@NerdAppropriate To add to my previous answer, I slept outside to see the Hobbit panel at Comic-Con this year and I'd do it for this one too

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 23:15:07	WHY are media outlets showing past videos of the theater shooter!? It just gives him attention and encourages other murderers to follow him!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 06:53:44	@JazzyJ1112 Agreed.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 06:49:49	@JazzyJ1112 It absolutely sucks. What happened to music?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 06:47:16	@JazzyJ1112 lol, I just watched it for the first time on YouTube and couldn't get through the whole thing.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 06:23:08	Ok...so exactly why do people like that song "Call Me Maybe"??? I don't get it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 06:16:46	@castorgirls LOL! Damn! You're right. My bad. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 06:16:04	@castorgirls Believe me, I understand. It's very painful. You want to say something but sometimes it wouldn't help, just make things worse.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 06:05:10	@castorgirls whoa I missed a word in my first sentence and had to read it 3 times to see it. That should have been: They might have been etc

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 06:02:25	@castorgirls ...is that I don't look it. Ignorance at it finest.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 06:01:53	@castorgirls They might of been shamed. I always love it when people find out I'm bipolar and the first thing they say...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 05:59:41	@castorgirls Not the dishes! Don't do it lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 05:56:04	@castorgirls ...so they'd rethink saying that crap out loud.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-22 05:55:19	@castorgirls One of them actually said that people who cut are stupid then his friends laughed and agreed. I turned to look at them...

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-21 20:53:32	@SarahJLA That is very cool! I really love ME3MP. I was surprised how much I love it. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-21 13:00:25	It was disturbing for me to watch The Dark Knight rises tonight...I was anxious expecting a copycat, could feel tension in the theater. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-21 04:08:27	@K_is4Kellies It really is...I'm still laughing. Hopefully that will give you a smile during the day. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-20 04:37:11	@castorgirls Very true. It's why they have that news program over here "What would you do?".

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-20 04:31:43	@castorgirls Neither do I but I think at the least I would call the police on my cell.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 23:41:38	@castorgirls I know! That was ridiculous. Speaking up afterward is too late.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 09:51:58	@castorgirls Exactly.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 09:48:25	@castorgirls Anonymous commenting allows people to show hatred they would be too scared to show in real life. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 09:46:58	@MyBipolarBrain It will, I absolutely believe it will happen for you. :) That kind of hope is good to have. Hold onto it!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 09:45:49	@MyBipolarBrain I understand...you were trying to be a good child right? I had to re-evaluate "Honor thy parents" and adjust it for me.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 09:43:55	@MyBipolarBrain ...Keep your eyes open for opportunities to loosen her hold and I bet over time it can happen.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 09:42:20	@MyBipolarBrain I understand, I really do. I had to plan how to get away and I got out the second it was possible. I was poor but safe...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 09:39:33	@MyBipolarBrain This is just me but I had to actually sever ties with my mother for my mental health's sake. Best decision I ever made.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 09:37:03	@MyBipolarBrain I apologize if my mother issues surface but abusive parents always act like victims. Makes me blind with rage.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 07:29:47	@Kazcita And your Twitter profile pic is awesome. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 07:29:12	@Kazcita Schrodinger, woo!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 07:26:26	@SarahJLA I love the scene with he and Lizzy talking awkwardly after his impromptu swim. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 05:47:48	@collectsideshow 3 day passes for the Comic-Con 2013 prize, no Preview night or Thursday? Was that a mis-type?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 03:50:28	Trying out Eucalyptus and Spearmint lotion from Bath and Body Works to calm me. Maybe if I believe it works then it will.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-19 03:49:11	Ugh, I cannot be sick! Tell me this is allergies. I have to watch Dark Knight Rises this weekend and I'm already mental.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 05:20:24	@mymorevividlife Really!? Oooh I see a Doctor debate in our future. ;) One day we can chat about what makes them each great.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 05:17:23	@mymorevividlife Doh! I said 10th Doctor (I wish!). It was 11 Matt Smith. Woops.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 05:03:20	@mymorevividlife ...and Karen Gillan/ Amy Pond. I had other issues which I will blog about unhappily. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 05:02:40	@mymorevividlife ...but Ian McKellen came out that night to say hi so I met him and got an autograph,. Ending up meeting the 10th Doctor...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 05:00:36	@mymorevividlife It was amazing and exhausting. I had to sleep outside one night to be guaranteed getting into the Hobbit panel...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 04:33:45	@mymorevividlife I just talked about this at Comic-Con, the right to dress up as whoever you want no matter race the character is.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 04:32:16	@mymorevividlife Let me clarify that I laughed because her comment was ridiculous.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 04:18:45	@mymorevividlife As a black person I laughed at this heartily. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 04:10:53	@slowlywechange Who says you can't? You guys could watch a movie or whatever you like. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 01:38:20	@mymorevividlife Yea, that statement is not enough. If it were me I would actually write an article talking about consent for my readers.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 00:28:58	@mymorevividlife I didn't see it. I'm sure it would piss me off.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 00:18:49	@mymorevividlife Ummm, that @lovehoney person favorited my tweet when I said "boo" so I had to tell her I was booing her. So sad.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-18 00:16:18	@Lovehoney I see you favorited my tweet, you missed that I was saying shame on you for minimizing a wife not wanting to perform oral sex.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-17 12:16:45	@SarahJLA Exactly! So satisfying. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-17 12:14:18	@SarahJLA Mail Slot was one of my favorite achievements. I felt so badass lol.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-17 07:30:21	@mymorevividlife @Lovehoney Well then boo and shame on her!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-17 07:20:47	@mymorevividlife Is the writer for sure a woman? Is it possible it's a man writing as a woman? I'd rather believe that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-17 07:05:20	@mymorevividlife @ghostlove @Lovehoney That was an excellent post and the article referred to is highly irresponsible and frankly dangerous.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-17 05:14:23	I am in a foul ass mood and getting worse by the moment. You can actually see little storm clouds over my head.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-17 00:14:29	Comic-Con is over. Glad to be home.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:39:23	@podcastitute I'll dm you because I'm anonymous here due to the nature of my writing. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:37:23	@podcastitute I was born there lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:35:19	@podcastitute And what's cool about Comic-Con is that gaming is present too. Seeing the Mass Effect 3 dlc early was cool.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:33:45	@podcastitute Good idea! I lived in Louisiana so I understand the long drive.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:32:20	@podcastitute @s7evendaysageek lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:31:37	@podcastitute I hear you. Do I see a road trip in your future? :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:28:33	Last day of Comic-Con. So far I've met: Claudio Sanchez, Stan Lee, Sir Ian McKellen, Matt Smith and Karen Gillan. 4/5 were random.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:25:03	@podcastitute Yea, the tickets are reasonable, it's the hotel that kills ya.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:22:26	@HHCast Watch their site and pounce on the tickets lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:20:25	@HHCast Exactly! :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:19:27	@HHCast Of course Adam is awesome too! :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:18:49	@HHCast I don't know, he was so gracious he might do it. He actually stood there and talked to me. He's very cool. You could ask? :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:16:50	@HHCast Hey Mal! It was so random Karen got on my elevator & signed my badge. Matt was downstairs w/ Moffat and he signed it too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:13:25	@HHCast Also met the wonderful @Stevevalentine at the Bioware base on Thursday. He was so nice and approachable.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 03:11:26	@HHCast People I met at Comic-Con randomly: Ian McKellen, Matt Smith and Karen Gillian. #worthit
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 02:58:01	@SarahJLA Love the Black Widow rifle!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-16 01:13:04	@bioware Hey is there any Mass Effect multiplayer swag happening today at Comic-Con?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-15 08:49:04	@theoneringnet Hey guys, I'm at comic con, waited overnight to see Hobbit but wondered where the poster was? Have you guys seen it?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-15 08:17:35	@castorgirls Thanks my friend. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-15 08:13:20	@castorgirls The story with Ian was I slept outside and he came out at 11pm to say hi to us. I asked him to sign something and he did.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-15 08:09:08	@castorgirls I'm ok kind of...I'm not sure what's going on, just unexpected problems.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-15 08:07:26	@castorgirls just a note that the Hobbit panel just ended seconds ago so took a while for me to reply. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-15 08:06:28	@castorgirls I met Ian McKellen and got his autograph. I'll have a lot to blog about because of unexpected mental/emotionally issues.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-15 08:04:10	Just saw 12 minutes of both Hobbit movies!!!!! #sdcc #comic -con HOLY CRAP!!!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-15 02:40:21	@mymorevividlife I am! I've posted some pics on twitter and I'll do some more later. I met Ian McKellan!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-15 01:56:13	Slept outside overnight to get into room to see Hobbit panel. #norest Comic-Con
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 12:58:05	@ReleasingLunacy @castorgirls Hope so. Thanks. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 11:32:18	@castorgirls I did. Someone had me following unknown people. I'm more worried about my blog. Trying not to cry.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 11:28:23	@castorgirls can you please let me know if you see any weird stuff from me either here or my blog. I got hacked and I'm so freaked.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 10:51:47	Yea I was definitely twitter hacked! Was suddenly following people I never heard of. I am freaked out godamn it!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 10:43:47	I think my twitter account got hacked! #yahoosucks
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 09:07:28	@castorgirls You're my hero! :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 09:06:32	@castorgirls lol! Suurre there's not. *plays gullible to humor you*
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 09:05:02	@castorgirls Ummm...wait, you jumped off the bridge!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 09:02:33	@castorgirls Whaaat! Oooh, see I knew you had the Kiwi advantage! :p ;) Where are those pictures may I ask? *taps foot impatiently*
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 08:51:27	@castorgirls No rest. You won't believe what I'm going to do to see hobbit: I think I'll have to sleep outside.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 08:49:52	@castorgirls I wondered if the level of noise can do that???
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 08:43:39	@castorgirls ...then kind of blacked out for a second. Freaked me out.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 08:42:45	@castorgirls It was very nice. I almost passed out though. At one point the screams vibrated in my ears and head and I felt lightheaded...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 07:37:27	@wbpictures Are those going to be available as merchandise at some point? They're beautiful!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 07:32:08	@castorgirls ...because the fan reaction moved him.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 07:31:41	@castorgirls Sorry took a while for me to reply. It was great, Joss and Nathan both got choked up. Joss couldn't even talk at one point...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-14 07:30:12	@ReleasingLunacy Thanks, it was fun. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 23:25:36	@gideonemery I met David Gaider at the Bioware base at Comic-Con and we discussed how much we love your voice work.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 23:16:53	@castorgirls We'll see if I can balance it. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 23:05:12	@castorgirls If I get in I'll try to switch out taking pictures with my real camera and my phone so I can upload them for viewing.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 23:01:42	@castorgirls I think I'm getting in. Still in line but will know in about an hour or so.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 22:55:29	@Stevevalentine I just wanted to thank you for being so gracious and nice at the Bioware booth yesterday. Thanks for the autograph & pics!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 19:46:08	@castorgirls Unfortunately we won't know for at least another 5 hours. He wasn't optimistic because people literally camped out overnight.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 19:44:21	@castorgirls I know! I was ticked which made me feel bad since he got up to get in line and I stayed in bed. I'm so mean lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 19:06:13	@castorgirls it's 4a.m. hubby got in line for Firefly panel and Joss Whedon came out to greet people in line. Hubby forgot autograph book!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 08:33:54	@K_is4Kellies He's a trooper to sit for pictures with fans like that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 08:22:45	@castorgirls Um...yea, you would. :p I specifically opened the subject because I'm in my room. I don't want to push you though.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 08:15:58	@castorgirls Was that a joke!? ;) Seriously, is it work? The project?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 08:14:40	@castorgirls What's the weird place?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 08:14:16	@castorgirls That's commitment right!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 07:53:41	@castorgirls ...asking how you are though.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 07:53:26	@castorgirls Not shaking but my mood is up and down. Just saw my ex-best friend only a few feet away but didn't speak to her. I was really..
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 07:50:25	My pedometer app says I walked over 4.5 miles today at Comic-Con, over 10,000 steps. #boyaremyfeettired

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 07:43:27	@castorgirls He's so nice. I just said hi and stood there but I have a picture as proof. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 07:42:17	@ReleasingLunacy Thanks, that's nice of you! :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 07:33:24	Had my picture taken with @TheRealStanLee ! EPIC! Bucket list is down an item!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 07:31:42	@bioware @dragonage Just met the incredible Steve Valentine at the Bioware base at Comic-Con! Thank you!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 05:01:05	@K_is4Kellies Thanks K! You guys should try for tickets for 2013. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-13 04:57:33	So far at Comic-Con we've met the singer from 1 of our fave bands, got an autograph from a jedi and in an hour I will meet Stan Lee. #crazy

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 22:01:50	@HHCast @noelove I'll tweet pictures for sure lol! We'll see if they do anything awesome.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 21:21:44	@HHCast If I spy him signing things while I'm out and try and grab it. He's around on Friday which means I may be at Firefly 10 yr reunion.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 21:16:41	@HHCast Famous and sexy would definitely stand out. I'll keep my eyes peeled. My goal is Firefly panel tomorrow & Hobbit on Saturday.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 12:28:49	@Sheffele Thanks. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 12:05:26	@castorgirls Oops I caught the end if that tweet before this part. Uh you had good reason to "complain" missy.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 12:04:09	@castorgirls I'll do my best. Thank you CG. Mushies back at ya!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 11:58:03	@castorgirls lol! I know, how silly of me! ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 11:57:32	@castorgirls I'll try. It's lame to complain about a trip others would like to take. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 11:52:42	@castorgirls :p Sure point out the obvious. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 11:50:21	@castorgirls I need the mushies, thank you. :) It's a combination of traveling all day, mentalness, fibromyalgia pain and migraines.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 11:48:45	@castorgirls I will. If the opportunity is there to share I will, if it's too hectic then I'll wait until later like I did tonight.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 11:31:03	@castorgirls I have to tell you that I'm in my room right now shaking. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 11:30:20	@castorgirls Because I know my friends might dig it, I'll try to upload what pictures I can.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-12 06:49:02	@HHCast Just got to Comic-Con 2012! pic.twitter.com/SqT9ipne
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 10:35:54	Omg! I just realized I won't have a scale the whole time I'm away! Noooo!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 09:30:17	@MyBipolarBrain Me too. You'll be in my thoughts.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 09:23:20	@MyBipolarBrain Well you and I know fixing doesn't happen per se but maybe they can do something to help.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 09:22:01	@MyBipolarBrain I know. It's complicated.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 09:18:57	@MyBipolarBrain Knowing the history, this makes me ill for you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 08:17:39	@MyBipolarBrain btw I saw your conversation w/ kellie about your mother & that changes everything! Your mother abused you! Doesn't deserve u
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 08:13:25	@MyBipolarBrain I understand. People worrying means we care about you. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 07:26:23	@MyBipolarBrain I know that makes it difficult but I understand why she'd be worried. I'm worried too. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 07:19:01	@MyBipolarBrain Oi! Is it more stressful to have your mother involved now?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:51:07	@MyBipolarBrain I hear ya. Is there any stuff you can do that usually ups your mood safely? Music? Movies?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:48:34	@MyBipolarBrain I know. But I'm going to send positive vibes your way and hope for a short turnaround. Bipolar's a bitch ain't it?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:47:01	@mymorevividlife You're welcome. It was 100% sincere.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:46:17	@mymorevividlife Thanks. Flying out ought to fix it for a while.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:43:23	@MyBipolarBrain Ah yes...I totally get that. I hate the drop. Hopefully the low is as brief as the high. I'm sorry. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:41:11	@MyBipolarBrain Absolutely.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:40:39	@MyBipolarBrain Any med changes to explain it? Triggers?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:39:47	@MyBipolarBrain ...that in a nice way not judging because I self-harm too. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:39:03	@MyBipolarBrain friends just need to be there for us and support us. Kicking self-harm is more complicated than making a promise & I mean...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:37:23	@MyBipolarBrain Is this because you feel bad about the promise? It's ok. You wanted to stop but we can't kick habits for someone else.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:30:08	@K_is4Kellies Thanks K, you're in my thoughts too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 06:25:18	@AsSamsara Awww, thanks hun. I appreciate it, really. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 05:54:27	@mymorevividlife Thanks. Stress about the trip is probably helping to scramble my brain. Too many possibilities of things going wrong.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-11 05:33:29	I'm a bit crazy today and I can't blame it all on the caffeine. I keep seeing images of me banging my head against the wall.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-10 23:49:11	@podcastitute @killerreviews I think I just scared my neighbors I laughed so loud. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-10 23:41:35	@podcastitute @killerreviews @HHCast lol! Maybe for the sequel we'll get to see "food poisoning" face instead of constipated face?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-10 23:29:59	@podcastitute @killerreviews I thought KStew looked constipated during the entire movie.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-10 23:11:46	@MyBipolarBrain That's great! Makes it easier to have open communication.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-10 23:02:59	@MyBipolarBrain Glad you opened up. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-10 10:07:48	I seriously think that seeing all these celeb new mothers w/flat abs after giving birth is unhealthy for regular women w/out trainers.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-10 02:25:24	@mymorevividlife Oh I see! Boy I really misunderstood that lol!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-10 02:09:57	@MyBipolarBrain Yay, great news!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-10 02:06:33	@FemalePTSD So proud of you for taking steps to stay safe!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-10 02:02:05	@mymorevividlife You're writing about the hangover effects? Are you using personal experience?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-10 02:00:48	@MovieElijahWood @Comic_Con Thankfully this is the last year for Twilight. All the Twi-hards will leave after the panel leaving it open.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 22:28:25	@FemalePTSD I don't know about you but at bad times talking to my therapist more often could help me to hang on, to calm anxiety etc.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 22:25:46	@FemalePTSD and I wouldn't be talking about taking something forever, just temporary until things calm down.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 22:23:57	@FemalePTSD Do you take an antidepressant as well?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 22:20:23	@FemalePTSD it's just a thought though. You could also increase talk therapy like having it several times a week as an anchor.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 22:18:28	@FemalePTSD The point with the meds is to dampen down the overwhelming part of the emotions to give a person time to gain some control....
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 22:10:43	@FemalePTSD If you can't go somewhere then I wonder if medication may take the edge off? Not ideal but my doc tried it in the past.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 21:51:41	@FemalePTSD I understand. I guess I'm thinking of more private places kind of like rehab but for mental health?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 21:49:39	@mymorevividlife Good! I hope that works out. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 21:45:18	@FemalePTSD Do you have inpatient care there to go to for safety until you feel better? I don't remember what you call it in the U.K.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 21:43:25	@mymorevividlife I hope so too. How's the change in Seroquel working for you so far?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 21:40:37	@mymorevividlife Glad your mood is ok though I hate having no motivation so boo on that. :( I'm getting ready for my trip.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 21:39:13	@mymorevividlife lol! Yea the eldest daughter had a sex tape "leak" and now here we are.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 21:37:26	@mymorevividlife How goes it my friend?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 21:36:54	@mymorevividlife Yes, having a sex tape make you and your family famous is nauseating. Definitely better things to be aware of out there. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-09 21:30:19	I don't give a crap about the Kardashians.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-08 08:03:44	@castorgirls I'm better. Upcoming trip is very distracting.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-08 08:03:01	@castorgirls Yes but I've seen pictures of NZ and I'd trade any day!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-01 05:13:37	@castorgirls lol! If that makes you feel better, I'll humor you. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-01 05:08:16	@castorgirls :) I'll take that! You have to admit it's funny that our days are so wonky. It's like you're from the future. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-07-01 04:59:46	@castorgirls If it makes you feel better, it's still June here. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-30 20:43:37	@mymorevividlife lol, that was funny, thanks!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-30 08:54:51	@castorgirls Okay now I'm poking you to see how you are since it's been 2 hours since I last poked you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-30 06:14:34	@mdart0042 I'll try. The temptation to just not eat comes up now but I know the weight loss wouldn't be real. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-30 06:13:28	@twcrew I really hope it's something as nice as fluids. I've been working on losing this psych med weight for years.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-30 06:12:18	@castorgirls Hey, how are you feeling?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 23:53:55	@castorgirls Ok but I'll still check on you later so brace yourself. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 23:33:44	@castorgirls I'm sorry. :( I have to go out but if you want to talk about it later we can dm or anything you like. No pressure.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 23:28:28	@castorgirls then it just reversed out of nowhere. Wait a sec! Why are you up?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 23:27:42	@castorgirls It just seems like my body isn't doing what it should be. I was so happy when my eating better finally worked...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 23:24:00	@castorgirls :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 23:23:17	@castorgirls Can I gain muscle in 3 days lol? Since this is about health not punishment the weight gain is extremely depressing.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 23:17:21	@castorgirls Do you know that's one of my favorite quotes of all time!? #chills
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 23:16:37	I'm so upset: I was losing weight by eating well etc, lost 5lbs and then gained it all back but my diet was the same & added exercise!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 12:43:09	@patriciasinglet You are incredibly brave and it's amazing and kickass that you did that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 08:38:36	@JazzyJ1112 So funny. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 08:38:12	@JazzyJ1112 woops that declaration may have been tweeted twice lol
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 08:35:53	@JazzyJ1112 I think color is very important for mental health. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 08:32:50	@JazzyJ1112 I LOVE IT!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 07:57:21	@JazzyJ1112 I'm not sure. Mood swings and such. How about you?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 07:00:12	@JazzyJ1112 I know, it's just that they were doing so well and then dropped the ball. Everyone believes Vulcans. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 06:58:35	@JazzyJ1112 He says it like it's a fact in most cases. And the episode is about Seven having a false memory after the Dr. hypnotizes her.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 06:57:01	@JazzyJ1112 Specifically Tuvok says that "historically" recovered memories aren't trustworthy.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 06:32:03	Boo for Star Trek Voyager episode about false memory and hypnosis. Blanket statements made about validity of recovered memories. Boo!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-29 06:25:41	@TribeCalledCurl The most beautiful thing about #naturalhair is that when you truly accept & love it, you accept & love yourself more.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-28 10:30:50	...what happened to her? Are they implying rape? No? Is this how they dealt with it back then? Why is she catatonic then?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-28 10:29:23	Watching Alfred Hitchcock presents, can't understand plot: woman wears bikini, is "attacked", is catatonic, dr. says she'll be fine...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-28 00:27:08	@Kazcita I hope so too. Let me know the outcome.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 23:28:52	@Kazcita I know what you mean. I always feel like I have to explain what I say to avoid offence. PC police are everywhere.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 23:18:55	@Kazcita You have got to be kidding me!? It was a joke, obviously! We can't use exaggeration for humor anymore?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 23:15:46	@Kazcita LOL, thanks for the history lesson! ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 23:06:21	@bipolarvoice I hear you. I bet back then people thought they had to push through and just get things done no matter what.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 23:00:00	@bipolarvoice Well there's always the old story of relatives kept in the attic? I think people either ignored or persecuted them in the past
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 22:55:54	@bipolarvoice I know exactly what you mean. We can now look back and see disorders cropping up in family tree.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 22:54:22	@Kazcita lol! As an american I have no idea what some of that meant but it's still funny. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 22:52:34	@bipolarvoice It was definitely unpleasant. No one in my family knew about bipolar disorder when I was younger. 1 uncle has it too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 22:44:23	@bipolarvoice I was...sort of. I had a breakdown when I was 24 and was put in a psych ward where the diagnosis was made. Had symptoms b4 dx.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 11:56:32	@castorgirls I think that the fact you even mentioned a support group is positive. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 11:52:34	@castorgirls strong tactics. I figure maybe if I listen to you that would be helpful. I hope.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 11:51:35	@castorgirls but I worry about you feeling pressure. I try to remember how I feel when I have food "issues" & that I don't respond to
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 11:50:13	@castorgirls Ah, well that's what I want to say but I don't think it would go over well. :) I could tell you how important you are to me...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 11:46:18	@castorgirls I understand, so maybe you could come and go as you're able? Then maybe it would get easier over time.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 11:39:35	@castorgirls Is there a healthy, legitimate support group on the internet?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 09:08:37	@bipolarvoice Wtf!? Seriously? That's awful.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 07:35:58	And the stupid news crews are trying to scare people more than they already are just to get ratings!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 07:25:17	There's actually ash falling from the sky!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 07:23:41	A little shift in the wind and the fire is threatening more homes. This is awful...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 04:09:55	@mymorevividlife Very true. Because it's an animal, like that makes a difference. Where are those animal cops they showed on Animal Planet?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 03:19:21	@mymorevividlife Oh my God! First, so, so happy you found him! Second human beings are bastards, who picks on a helpless animal!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 02:10:12	@mymorevividlife I remember that your cat had gone off a while ago, is he still gone!? :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 02:09:17	@mymorevividlife Ha! It is so satisfying to mock them when they suck at games that we rock on. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 01:59:17	@mymorevividlife lol! I love it!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 01:34:28	My cat is nice and warm, by my side while I play #Dawnguard . #bliss

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 01:30:10	@mymorevividlife Lol! The everlasting debate of PC vs. console! I play some games on the PC but I prefer the console.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-27 00:56:39	@mymorevividlife Do you play on PC or Xbox? Just curious since they have different release dates.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-26 22:15:49	@mymorevividlife It's so good that you've got a healthy, more balanced therapeutic relationship. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-26 22:15:12	@mymorevividlife Thanks Hun. :) It was my bad for thinking that male victim details wouldn't trigger me.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-26 21:46:18	@mymorevividlife A therapist's absence can be scary, I'm glad you're ok with it. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-26 21:44:32	Holy crap: Skyrim's #Dawnguard , #MassEffect3 Extended Cut DLC & #SWTOR 1.3 update all out on the same day. Woot!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 21:44:44	@Sheffele I understand. We'll probably hear about him at least until sentencing is over. I think it's gotten to everyone. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 11:28:02	@Sheffele Hey. Just had company leave. Too much stuff in 24 hours: Sandusky & entertaining guests. How are you?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 05:09:14	@castorgirls Thanks. :) You're in my thoughts too. Sending lots of mushies and positive vibes.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 04:59:12	@castorgirls They should start arriving in an hour....woohoo.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 04:58:33	@castorgirls Awwww, yay!!! That's great and you got to see some new ink. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 04:53:50	@castorgirls Oh! How did the haircut go?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 04:23:31	@castorgirls I will. It makes me feel less alone too. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 04:14:39	@castorgirls Is there anything I can do to help you?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 04:13:55	@castorgirls I won't write about the case but my reaction to the verdict.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 04:13:12	@castorgirls And yea, it was very real. I thought of my uncle the whole time. I'm going to write a blog post about it when I can.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 04:11:44	@castorgirls Those fears all make sense but I like to think that abusers will see this and shrink back out of fear.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 03:58:13	@castorgirls Why do you think it scared you?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 03:57:51	@castorgirls I thought I was being weird! It was so painful to watch but you'd think we'd be cheering and happy....
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 03:40:26	@castorgirls Are you alright? I have to admit that I was shaken. I actually cried and not in happiness for justice.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-24 03:28:06	I wonder if other people had emotionally raw reactions to the #Sandusky verdict and press coverage?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 07:19:58	@castorgirls I don't know what to do if it keeps up.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 07:19:33	@castorgirls if it will stay that way. It was like the restless crazy needed an outlet.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 07:18:49	@castorgirls Awwww don't be mad. :) I grabbed a razor at which point I decided to try vigorous exercise. That helped but I don't know
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 07:15:39	@castorgirls Suuuure you don't. Oooh that was sarcasm too. ;)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 06:17:27	@Sheffele Hey. :) I don't know what the deal is. I'm not on new meds, I've been restless and feel like screaming. Feeling crazy.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 06:15:44	@castorgirls Was that sarcasm? :P
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:51:38	@castorgirls Bills, boo! :) Thanks for the chat, take care of you too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:48:02	@castorgirls And I'm having people over tomorrow for a bbq. Such good timing!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:46:39	@castorgirls I'll try to think of something. I wish someone would write a manual on self- care to just tell me what to do.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:40:09	@castorgirls lol! You are so silly, thanks for the laugh. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:39:09	@castorgirls I'll do my best. I'm useless at self- care.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:36:19	@castorgirls I also can't tweet correct spelling either. Jeez.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:35:23	@castorgirls I guess I feel like that should all be past already.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:34:39	@castorgirls If I can sit still long enough I could try that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:34:01	@castorgirls They both off today.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:32:05	@castorgirls I don't know why I'd be stressed or overwhelmed, nothing's going on, I wanted to go to the movies but was too agitated to leave
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:20:42	@castorgirls ...it makes no sense.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 03:20:12	@castorgirls I'm not sure honestly. I'm really confused because my feelings don't make: wanting to scream & hit my head? I'm all fidgety...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-23 02:51:42	I keep imagining banging my head into the wall over and over. I don't know what's wrong with me.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 09:48:03	Why do I feel like screaming? I've been feeling like this for hours.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 09:46:26	@JazzyJ1112 Woot! That IS good news! :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 09:34:52	@JazzyJ1112 Can you say what it is?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 07:43:42	@mymorevividlife True but maybe people will be grossed out by my ultra honesty.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 07:12:16	@mymorevividlife lol, I love Indian food but no one I know does. :p As for the other, I just posted a highly embarrassing blog entry. #dumb
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 07:09:09	@mymorevividlife Look at you taking care of yourself! :-)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 03:04:19	@JazzyJ1112 Did you tell her it wasn't ok?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 02:35:48	@JazzyJ1112 So you were being nice and that happened? Uncool.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 02:32:16	@JazzyJ1112 Who the hell is this person taking liberties with your personal space!?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 02:30:25	@JazzyJ1112 That SO crosses boundaries! Not ok to grab people, ewwww!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 02:29:22	@JazzyJ1112 Awww, I'm sorry. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 02:28:10	@JazzyJ1112 No one should grab you though!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 02:27:35	@JazzyJ1112 Because of SI? My husband just busted me the other day when he spotted scars from a couple of months ago.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-22 02:25:07	@TTGames Hey guys, loving Lego Batman 2 on the Xbox! One request: can you patch the game to allow the camera to be inverted?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-21 22:27:20	So sad they had to drop some charges against #Sandusky , 1 because it wasn't a crime when he committed it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-21 22:25:31	My therapist said that #histrionic personality disorder would NOT explain #Sandusky behavior.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-21 22:23:00	@mymorevividlife Stay strong, your lungs will thank you. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-21 03:24:40	#Sandusky defense rests WITHOUT putting him on the stand. #guilty
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-21 01:24:14	@castorgirls Yep, you too. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-21 01:23:53	@castorgirls I hope you're able to get some rest. It's hard to function with a lack of sleep adding to everything else. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-21 01:17:42	@castorgirls Still having effects from your trip? Or is it work? Both? Or evil holidays?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-21 01:08:12	@castorgirls That's no fun. :( Does drinking tea ever help? Decaf of course. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-21 01:03:34	@castorgirls Any particular reason you're not sleeping?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-21 00:26:43	@castorgirls It was! My throat kept closing and I thought I was going to cry, and you know how I feel about crying. ;) How are you doing?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-21 00:25:35	@AsSamsara Thanks, he's a good guy so it helps that we both want things to work out.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 22:55:24	@ELIZABETHSPRAT1 Thanks. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 22:44:21	Had a long talk with my husband last night, told him how his words made me feel. I think we worked it out but yesterday was hellish.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 07:22:07	@mymorevividlife . .. like it's a danger to become selfish? My sister in law is bipolar but a complete bitch.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 07:20:01	@mymorevividlife It is. I have this resistence to "whining"about it because I don't want to be "that" person, you know? Do you ever feel....
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 07:01:21	@JazzyJ1112 I'll try. Thanks. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 06:58:49	@mymorevividlife Hey Viv, thanks for the comment on my blog, I just haven't replied yet. He always calls on his way home, I can't answer him
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 06:42:50	@JazzyJ1112 I know. Thankfully tomorrow is a therapy day. Thanks for checking on me.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 06:41:02	@JazzyJ1112 I actually doubt he has any idea how it made me feel.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 06:40:29	@JazzyJ1112 and he's right. I just don't know how to help myself.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 06:39:38	@JazzyJ1112 He didn't blame me or accuse. He said what he needed because he works full-time& has to do all the cooking and cleaning too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 06:31:47	@JazzyJ1112 It's not just sex, it's that he's unhappy with all the things I'm not doing and he's right to be.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 06:10:34	@JazzyJ1112 I'm just feeling pressured and stressed and I want to be alone.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 06:10:03	@JazzyJ1112 My husband's not bad, we just had a discussion yesterday about his need for more sex &talking& for me to do more housework.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 06:01:13	I am starting to feel very upset, very emotional. I wonder if it's because my husband will be off work soon & I don't want to deal with him.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 05:27:17	@mdart0042 I want a speedy guilty verdict for the sake of the victims.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 05:26:06	@mdart0042 Oh don't think I'm not with you. I only meant as far as what they can do in the courtroom. I have thoughts of his fate in prison.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 04:44:02	@mdart0042 Yep. They say this trial may be over by Thursday. I hope for a speedy guilty verdict.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 04:37:33	@mdart0042 They shouldn't use mental illnesses to defend him. That's not why he did it and it gives the mental health community a bad name.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 04:30:20	@mdart0042 And to top it off they're trying to say he has some histronic personality disorder that makes him act seductive. Please!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 04:17:47	@mdart0042 Exactly. The defense is trying to say that #Sandusky didn't abuse ALL the kids at the charity, so he must be innocent. Bull!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-20 02:13:28	People really need to remember that #Sandusky didn't have to molest every single child he met to be guilty. Isn't one enough?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:57:22	@castorgirls I'm sorry if our conversation caused problems for you. Are you ok?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:52:14	@thevoiceofgid @HuffingtonPost lol! I second that motion.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:49:43	@castorgirls That sounds frustrating. The pull to know more...but it's dangerous too. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:42:44	@castorgirls ...purposely tried to trigger memories?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:42:13	@castorgirls Hmmm, interesting phrase. I have like 2 memories sort of. I have no way of knowing what else to do I guess. Have you ever
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:35:31	@castorgirls I have no idea, again :) I want to explore the reactions and see if more come but there is also an aspect of SI to it too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:29:25	@castorgirls Exactly! At first it was almost a relief because I felt that the gut reaction was more proof that I'm right, now there's more
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:25:50	@castorgirls You were?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:23:42	@castorgirls testing it, waiting to see if I get triggered again. Sorry for the long answer.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:23:03	@castorgirls the 1st trigger was because of a very specific detail I thought was weird but was similar to a memory for me now it's like I'm
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:21:47	@castorgirls ...too scared to testify. Then it was just kind of checking in to make sure they were ok and not being harassed by the defense
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 07:20:36	@castorgirls I don't know. At first it was stress/worry for the victims stress/worry that they wouldn't be able to testify that they'd be
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 06:06:16	Bad cycle: I follow the #Sandusky trial for the victims& in part because I'm compelled to, now I've been triggered twice but keep returning.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 04:24:44	@castorgirls lol! You're so funny, I don't actually have style, I just like certain things and sometimes it works. :) other times....hmmm.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 04:20:50	@castorgirls :) my 1st pair are really cool darkish greenish corduroy which are so neat. If I get a red pair I think I'll be happy lol.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 04:16:37	@castorgirls :) It was a big deal for me when I got my 1st pair a couple of years ago, now I love them and have 2 pairs. Sounds weird I know
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-19 03:10:17	@mdart0042 I thought of you specifically. :D

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 08:51:58	@JazzyJ1112 Tell me about it! They're great like Frosted Flakes. Wow that sounded less silly in my head lol!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 08:48:01	@JazzyJ1112 I have to get up early so it's just a matter of waiting for my sleep meds to kick in. Maybe that will help.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 08:45:39	@JazzyJ1112 I have a stressful weekend ahead so that should do it lol. Thanks for checking on me. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 08:44:00	@K_is4Kellies No but hopefully it will go away.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 08:43:09	@JazzyJ1112 I know. I think because it was such a strange thing to do and I had never heard of anyone else doing it, it struck me harder.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 08:38:33	@JazzyJ1112 Yes. A detail in the Sandusky case. Read a weird thing he did that happened to me too. Thought male details wouldn't be the same
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 08:32:45	@JazzyJ1112 Not really. Not sure what's wrong with me my eyes are watering but I don't cry.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 08:05:06	Trying to breath deeply. Triggers suck.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 08:02:47	@mymorevividlife Thanks. :) It'll pass. Love ya!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 07:51:23	@mymorevividlife A bit triggered but proud of you for your general awesomeness. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 07:28:10	Thought as a female victim the details wouldn't resonate as strongly . This one did. #Sandusky
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-15 07:26:07	Just read an article with some testimony from the #Sandusky trial. A singular detail made me start hyperventilating. Similar weird actions.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-14 06:06:51	@castorgirls @JazzyJ1112 Huh, I don't know, I never thought of that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-14 06:02:32	@castorgirls @JazzyJ1112 And there's no one to watch them and hold them responsible for the way they report.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-14 05:58:21	@castorgirls @JazzyJ1112 Very true and sad.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-14 05:55:35	@JazzyJ1112 @castorgirls Yea, abuse is not fodder for entertainment, profits and ratings.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-14 05:49:16	@JazzyJ1112 @castorgirls Absolutely, I agree completely.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-14 05:46:29	@castorgirls @cimmerianink I saw that msnbc amongst others will not reveal the names of the victims at least. That'something.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 23:56:05	@JazzyJ1112 You'd think common decency would prevail.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 23:19:37	I worry that details being reported from the #Sandusky trial aren't for the benefit of victims but for salacious content to up readership.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 07:22:53	@castorgirls @JazzyJ1112 Thanks. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 06:37:27	@JazzyJ1112 There's nothing wrong with that. T.V. is mostly crap anyway. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 06:09:59	Does the company that makes condoms also make #magnum ice cream? The truck says "For pleasure seekers". Weird.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 06:05:39	@JazzyJ1112 Oh, I see. T.V. shows are easier maybe?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 06:01:41	@JazzyJ1112 It's definitely different.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:54:40	@JazzyJ1112 Plus Fight Club is all about mpd isn't it?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:54:02	@JazzyJ1112 Ha! Nice movie tie-in!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:53:09	@JazzyJ1112 @castorgirls My pdoc just called to say I can stop the wellbutrin.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:52:24	@JazzyJ1112 @castorgirls Yea I've seen her since 2001 to deal with the bipolar dx, it worked out that she has experience with abuse and #did
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:51:22	@JazzyJ1112 LOL! #didmpd danger huh? :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:48:34	@JazzyJ1112 @castorgirls Bipolar since 2001, didmpd for at least 2 years I think.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:47:41	@JazzyJ1112 See we should form a club.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:39:47	@JazzyJ1112 @castorgirls I have no idea. I don't really understand #didmpd very well at all. I have no idea if they criss cross.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:37:58	@JazzyJ1112 lol, yep. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:37:27	@dylansmoosie @BraveKidsVoices Not me. Bravo.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:36:28	@JazzyJ1112 Yes both bipolar and didmpd. Woot!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:35:15	@JazzyJ1112 @castorgirls I can take Wellbutrin for about 2 or 3 weeks and then I go too high. My mania is an anger, aggression etc.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:32:58	@JazzyJ1112 Still off. Would like to fight or speed or something.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:28:42	@castorgirls I'm wondering if I'm finally hitting the ceiling on the Wellbutrin I take, can make me manic after a while. Feeling aggressive.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:26:45	@AsSamsara @JazzyJ1112 Thanks. I don't know why I want to do that to myself.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 05:12:50	Feeling very aggressive. On the drive home my speed passed 90 miles an hour several times. I wanted to go much, much faster.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 04:16:58	@mdart0042 Thanks meredith. :-) my therapist says words can't hurt but she's wrong.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 04:16:10	@AsSamsara @JazzyJ1112 Strangely I had a perverse desire to torment myself by keeping it, though I didn't.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 04:15:12	@JazzyJ1112 I saw Avengers for the 5th time lol.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 01:39:40	@JazzyJ1112 I know. I held it sideways to block the logo on both sides but was very, very aware of it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-13 01:36:57	Bought a snack at theater and it came in a cup marked with the nickname my abuser called me. Yea. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-12 13:05:36	@JazzyJ1112 night!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-12 12:59:22	@JazzyJ1112 :) absolutely.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-12 12:57:22	@JazzyJ1112 At least in this group we understand. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-12 12:55:57	@JazzyJ1112 Did you come back after saying you were triggered or was that someone else?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-12 12:55:07	@JazzyJ1112 I see. Sorry about that, I had no idea you weren't present.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-12 12:51:37	@JazzyJ1112 @K_is4Kellies was an alter out?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-12 12:27:49	@K_is4Kellies @JazzyJ1112 @Sheffele Would you like to talk about it?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-12 12:24:51	@K_is4Kellies @JazzyJ1112 @Sheffele Can you discuss what the problem is?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-12 08:31:06	@JazzyJ1112 Are you okay? Are you safe?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-12 07:35:03	@JazzyJ1112 Hey what happened!? Are you ok?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-11 22:47:43	@poisonand lol! Starting early on learning road rage I guess.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-11 05:59:44	@bipolarvoice Absolutely! We bipolar people have to stick together. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-11 05:58:19	I just saw three Twitter accounts of women who have some form of the word bitch in it. Does it make me an anti-feminist if I laughed? ;)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 21:59:08	@JulieBipolar I definitely would not sleep. I have to take Seroquel or I'd be up for days. True fact as I've done it before.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 10:43:32	@K_is4Kellies @Sheffele I know how stressful it is to try new meds. I hope they work for you. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 07:15:59	@K_is4Kellies I know that @mymorevividlife and I find Seroquel helpful but you may have to see if you like it and see if you have trouble.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 07:12:15	Snow White& the Huntsman was decent. K. Stewart looked mildly constipated the whole time and that had to be the most awkward looking ending.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 05:41:33	@castorgirls It's ok. The twitching just adds to my daily excitement, esp at night which is already so lovely.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 05:38:28	@bipolarlainey Watched "Extreme Risks". It was quite good. Thanks Lainey. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 05:36:15	@castorgirls Did you get any rest?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 05:35:56	@castorgirls He said there was medication but that it had its own side effects and wouldn't be worth it if the jerking wasn't bad.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 05:13:40	@mymorevividlife I hope that helps all around. I know your dosage is pretty high. He didn't tell me what meds are used to treat it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 04:33:19	@twcrew In my case my psychiatrist recommended one based on my needs.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 04:32:13	@bipolarlainey Agreed! Watching Star Trek TNG actually calms me when I feel like crap. Trek crosses international boundaries.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 04:24:13	@bipolarlainey Star Trek has strangely hit on multiple mental health issues: Dax, B'elanna, Data, Riker, Picard. Can you tell I'm a geek lol
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 04:18:05	@bipolarlainey Same boat here. *sympathy hug*
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 04:13:45	@bipolarlainey Found it! "Extreme Risks" thanks, I'll be watching it. Curious how they tackle depression etc.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 04:06:45	@mymorevividlife ...really bothersome.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 04:06:28	@mymorevividlife He said there was medication to treat but that it had its own side effects. Didn't recommend using unless the jerks were...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-08 04:04:22	@bipolarlainey No way! Really? I'll check it on Netflix. DS9 had 1 w/Dax having an unknown personality being suppressed. Very deep. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-07 09:53:13	Here we go with another "holiday" meant to send people with abusive histories into a tailspin. Screw Father's Day.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-07 09:51:40	@castorgirls It does, doesn't it? It's one of those, So-and So is rolling in their graves moments. It's just so stupid!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-07 09:42:38	@castorgirls That's what I said!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-07 09:41:37	@castorgirls I'll admit the scene of her jumping to catch the paw of a bear was silly but I love gingers. :)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 23:23:37	Wow, Ray Bradbury is dead.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 23:23:12	@mymorevividlife @cimmerianink lol! Yes, Hallmark over here. It's ok, thank goodness for Wikipedia. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 22:54:05	@mymorevividlife I had to look up what Clinton Cards are lol.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 22:27:31	I love my Keurig. Don't know if it's the instant gratification or because the k-cups on the carousel are like toys.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 22:21:42	Ok, I never cry but I cried a bit watching #AndrewDeLeon on a clip from #AmericasGotTalent . He felt rejected in life and hid his talent. Wow
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 22:16:51	Andrew De Leon: http:// bit.ly/MgyALS via @nbc Never judge people by how they look. Amazing! America's Got Talent
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 21:56:26	@mymorevividlife Father's Day is another "holiday" the world could do without.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 10:50:46	What is with the outbreak of people eating other people!!?? #reallifezombies
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 10:46:53	@castorgirls Oh goodness. I just love how America spreads all that stuff around. Even though, once in blue moon I like cinnamon pop tarts.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 10:45:03	Prosecutors have 'bizarre' letters Sandusky wrote to victim, source tells NBC http:// on.msnbc.com/MfRx1m via http:// msnbc.com app
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 10:39:50	@K_is4Kellies I'm really sorry to hear that. It totally makes sense that you would go away for a while.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 10:39:02	@castorgirls Being in America that is so funny to see, but also sad because we're chunky over here due to all that "candy".
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 10:36:57	@thevoiceofgid If that doesn't sum up society, I don't know what does.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 08:06:58	@K_is4Kellies Sorry you've had such a rough time. :( Any ideas on what triggered so much lost time?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 07:57:21	@castorgirls Sounds fun. I may have to look into trying this out. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 07:45:27	@thevoiceofgid Ummm, you could take out Jeremy Renner? The Army of Gid would totally have your back. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 07:40:46	@castorgirls Another trend I've seen but know nothing about. It's like Instagram all over again. I'm so slow to catch on!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 07:39:25	@castorgirls lol, way beneath huh? *digs around* Oh! There it is! Thank goodness for having friends who can dish out & receive sarcasm. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 07:35:20	@mymorevividlife Oh my goodness! How dumb are they?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 07:29:53	@castorgirls I stick my tongue out at you. :P
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 07:28:57	@castorgirls Wow, I looked at it. I have no idea what castor sugar is! But what a challenge...hmmm, I wonder about the altitude here?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 05:26:13	@castorgirls Yes, I try to be as...refreshing as possible. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 05:25:20	@castorgirls Deal! I wonder if one can get the ingredients to make it here?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 05:14:56	@castorgirls lol, I wasn't going to say. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 05:14:33	@castorgirls Nope. We only have German bakeries/delis here. Comes from living in a non-metro area.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 05:12:43	@castorgirls Doh! How could I forget I was talking to a librarian? Or are you just a jam/jelly/preserve expert?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 05:09:08	@castorgirls It's ok, I don't get it either.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 05:08:46	@castorgirls *raises eyebrows* Where in the world or U.S. would I get pavlova???
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 05:07:27	My goal is to be able to do Zumba Fitness Rush on the Xbox without dying. #outofshape #zumba
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 05:05:43	@castorgirls My question is,what's the difference between jam and preserves?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 05:05:04	@castorgirls Are you kidding? I totally agree with you! Jam has...stuff in it and jelly has...not as much stuff. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 05:03:22	@castorgirls No argument: NZ all the way. :) Your accents are way better though I've never tasted pavlova.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 04:57:55	@castorgirls *hangs in shame over cultural divide* I'm really trying to imagine a yeast spread....I may have to see if world market has it.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 04:55:42	@castorgirls . ...curious. I hate running out of space on tweets!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 04:54:42	@castorgirls lol! I wasn't aware. :D I saw a tweet about chocolate with marmite and looked ut up. Wiki said NZ has there own kind & I was...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 04:12:56	@castorgirls May I ask what the heck marmite is? I read you have it in New Zealand.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 04:09:04	@dragonahcas @DalishCassassin @thevoiceofgid I think he'd be a great spy, like James Bond or Bourne.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 04:00:20	@dragonahcas @thevoiceofgid I'm with you!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 03:59:39	...that she wouldn't do it. I laughed.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 03:59:12	...saying "Play with my foot!" The lady in line of course wouldn't, and eventually he kind of kicked out and waved his fists like he was mad
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 03:57:29	On a funny note, different store, saw a baby in his carrier. He stuck his foot out towards the woman in line behind his mom, like he was...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 03:54:35	I had to go around him and I've been freaked ever since.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 03:54:09	I said excuse me and he turned around close enough that we brushed. Normal person moves back, he just stayed there really close to me.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 03:53:14	Was at the store, saw a guy watching me though he was with a lady. Ignored him. Went to checkout and had to pass him, his back was turned...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 03:43:31	@castorgirls Thanks. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 03:43:14	@castorgirls How do you always know the right thing to say? *hug*
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 03:38:46	@castorgirls I'm not an advocate or an activist or anything.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 03:37:37	@castorgirls I'm not an activist of anything so this is weird. I was thinking that maybe my posts should be more helpful from time to time.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 03:12:17	@apdolan @wegohealth :) Kind of makes me want to up my content for the month.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-06 02:58:54	Whoa, I'm a featured health activist on the @wegohealth June newsletter! No pressure or anything huh lol?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-05 22:27:12	@castorgirls That's an interesting article. I don't think ED's are about models. I think they're about pain. Models just provide visuals.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-05 09:52:17	@castorgirls @emerfly CG I'm so glad to hear about that book because I've been looking for some new books to read. Thanks!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-05 09:05:16	@emerfly I agree with the Dissociative Identity Sourcebook.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-04 05:51:42	@castorgirls That is sad.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-04 02:26:09	@mdart0042 Yea me too now that I've read people's stories. In the old days I didn't realize that happened. Evil doesn't stick to one gender.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-03 23:08:26	But there are plenty of female sex offenders.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-03 23:07:59	Re: story I just shared. I think there are more female offenders than authorities realize. People don't think of women as being pedophiles.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-03 04:11:42	@castorgirls Hey, did you get any real sleep?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-03 03:19:34	@K_is4Kellies Sorry I was gone, I was going to ask if you have any anti-anxiety meds?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-03 00:11:30	@castorgirls I'm ok. Are you pretending to sleep to avoid talking to your family?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-03 00:07:56	@castorgirls Wouldn't we all? :) How are you?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-06-03 00:03:56	@castorgirls That was amazing, the balance and strength? Wow! I can't even do two pushups lol!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-28 07:57:41	@K_is4Kellies @JazzyJ1112 I think that's the norm for most if not all of us. I told a "friend" that I was abused, she said to get over it.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-28 06:48:24	@K_is4Kellies I agree, don't be embarrassed. But I haven't told people about the DID so I'd be a bit freaked too.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-28 06:36:05	@K_is4Kellies You know there seems to be a tendency at times like that, that people can't really tell. Can you call and ask what you said?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-28 06:19:46	@K_is4Kellies I'm sorry. That is SO disconcerting! Do any parts have journals they write in when out?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-27 23:48:17	I like rabbits except when they eat my strawberry plants!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-27 22:44:04	@castorgirls That was funny and cute. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-27 07:38:50	Just joined http:// community.wegohealth.com
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-26 23:13:15	@mymorevividlife I agree. That happens way too often. I often wonder what will happen if I actually sit down and write my book.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-26 23:11:34	@mymorevividlife I'm looking forward to reading everything but I'll make sure to read those first. Your post was helpful while reading.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-26 23:09:31	@mymorevividlife Yes I was joking to myself that I'm wrong to like him since I'm black lol. But it doesn't change the talent.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-26 23:01:34	@mymorevividlife Yea, I saw that! I bought his complete works on Kindle but I think I still want a real book too.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-26 22:59:58	@mymorevividlife I liked the way he didn't always tell you what was so horrible. You had to imagine it. I had to ignore the racism.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-26 22:35:42	@mdart0042 Uh oh it's Meredith vs. Lovecraft! ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-26 10:43:12	@mymorevividlife Just finished reading Call of Cthulhu and some other stories. W-o-w. Now I want to find a cool looking collection to own.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-26 00:04:32	@K_is4Kellies I totally understand. Just remember that the blog is for you first. Do whatever you need to for balance. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-25 22:57:30	@K_is4Kellies I'm bipolar w/ DID and my blog readers remind me that I have to take care of myself first and then I can blog. Don't feel bad.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-25 11:01:58	@K_is4Kellies Hey there! Just wanted to say, don't stress about getting back to people on your blog. Everyone understands. Just take care :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-25 00:05:54	@Kazcita LOL! That's fantastic!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-24 22:00:07	@Kazcita For some reason the pics won't load. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-24 06:58:01	@castorgirls I'm so happy for you! That makes my day. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-24 06:48:40	@castorgirls Hey, I wanted to see how things went? Did your mood ever get better?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-24 06:45:07	@Kazcita lol! Fantastic!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-23 07:09:18	@castorgirls I'm fine. I'll be thinking of you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-23 07:04:56	@castorgirls Do you have any music around that usually makes you smile?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-23 06:15:01	@BGS_Devs Beautiful, wish I had one for my house. Wonderful for remembering Adam.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-23 06:13:07	@castorgirls I'm sorry hun. I hate that feeling.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-23 04:12:54	@fogartyelaine It's my area of expertise lol.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-23 03:39:51	@fogartyelaine Blu ray is great if you have a high def tv. It also upconverts all your regular dvds to higher res. Discs have come down...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-23 03:37:35	@mymorevividlife That was it lol.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-23 03:28:14	@mymorevividlife I'm ok thanks. Did you tweet something else and then delete it? Thought I saw something.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-22 22:13:16	@mymorevividlife Are you alright?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-22 22:08:57	@patriciasinglet Congratulations that's amazing!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-22 04:59:13	Thanks to Susan @wegohealth for the bipolar roundtable discussion. It was very nice to discuss the issues around being bipolar.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-21 10:46:32	@castorgirls Was it ages ago? Jeez :) Glad you're fine, if fine is really fine and not "Ahhhh!"
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-21 10:31:57	@castorgirls I've taken it before and I have to stop before it makes me manic. How are you?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-21 10:31:04	@castorgirls Honestly don't know yet. He put me on Wellbutrin to help the increased depression so we're waiting to see...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-21 10:25:46	@castorgirls Feeling better on the side effects side which I'll take as a good thing. You?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-21 10:19:30	@castorgirls Which techniques will you try?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-21 10:19:18	@castorgirls That makes sense. I think we've stayed hypervigilent as adults and I know I worry over many things obsessively...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-21 09:49:06	@castorgirls Yea, it would. I was just wondering if the approach would have to be adapted. I know I was very used to worrying as a kid.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-21 09:33:31	@castorgirls Yes definitely complicated.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-21 09:33:02	@castorgirls Part of the technique seemed to be to show that things weren't as bad as the child thought but in abuse they are so...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-21 09:28:15	@castorgirls That was interesting CG. I wonder how that would work with kids who have had real experience with danger like abuse?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-21 08:39:04	@castorgirls You want to try it out on me? ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-20 23:04:21	I think it's my blog's 2 year anniversary this month!!?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-14 21:24:24	@hellojusteliza Agreed.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-14 21:00:35	@hellojusteliza Yes, I love that question because of course emotional pain and anguish is quantifiable by a scale of numbers.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-14 11:50:35	@castorgirls Don't know if it's side effect of new meds (ironic) or if I'm sinking. Calling my pdoc tomorrow to ask about side effects.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-14 11:24:51	Why are thoughts of dying swirling around my head and sounding not so bad?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-14 10:30:00	@JazzyJ1112 Did it feel good to write that post? I hope so because you rocked it!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-12 12:22:36	@twcrew @JazzyJ1112 @polyvore I agree. They have no idea what it's like for people with abusive pasts.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-12 07:39:45	@JazzyJ1112 @tygergirl27 I decided to go ahead over to Polyvore and write a "card" for my mother. I put the link up a few minutes ago.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-11 23:55:50	@mymorevividlife I wish they were but thanks for asking. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-11 23:42:03	@mymorevividlife I'm proud of you Viv! Your body starts to heal after a person stops smoking. This is great!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-11 23:41:10	@dylansmoosie I read that too and I could NOT believe that judgment! It's sick and opens the door for pedophiles to find loopholes.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-11 05:58:40	@JazzyJ1112 @tygergirl27 It would probably be cleansing. Or at least good to get some of it out.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-11 05:53:07	@JazzyJ1112 @tygergirl27 I hear you. I wrote two blog posts today already. Too much thinking.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-11 05:47:05	@tygergirl27 @JazzyJ1112 Hallmark doesn't make cards for abusive mothers. That seems unfair.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-11 05:46:03	@JazzyJ1112 Then definitely use the day to make yourself feel good and cared for.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:28:00	@castorgirls lol that was supposed to be: take care of you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:26:24	@castorgirls That anytime goes for you too. I'm going to try to sleep and hope tomorrow is better. Take of you. *safe hugs and mushies*
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:22:39	@castorgirls No, thank you. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:21:30	@castorgirls I guess I can do that. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:19:36	@castorgirls LOL! Yea you can't just spring that stuff on me. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:17:43	@castorgirls You mean I'm not an Avenger!!?? *gasp* ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:15:25	@castorgirls Eventually, I hope anyway. I had to take Xanax last night to help with anxiety. Don't want it to be a habit though.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:12:37	@castorgirls You're too kind. :) I really appreciate you reaching out when I said something.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:11:23	@castorgirls I'm glad. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:10:18	@castorgirls I don't deserve you guys.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:09:05	@castorgirls :) You did make me smile. Thank you for that. Are you doing alright yourself? Be honest.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:03:45	@castorgirls I honestly don't know. I need to blog but I'm too tired tonight. Maybe tomorrow I can write.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 12:02:27	@castorgirls I'm not sure if I should laugh or say that I'm grateful it's helped you. The way you said it was just funny not the situation.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 11:56:54	@castorgirls The idea of two weeks of this is disheartening.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 11:56:18	@castorgirls Who knew social media would come in handy at times like this?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 11:53:06	@castorgirls I'm on new meds but it will take a couple of weeks to see what happens.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 11:52:17	@castorgirls Thanks. Twitter can be kind of helpful in times like this. Being able to say something just to get it out.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 11:45:55	@castorgirls Thanks CG. Really. I'm ridiculously sad which is not helping but complaining won't help.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-10 11:34:43	Things are heavy right now. I have some things I need to sit with but it's scary.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-09 09:35:19	@NAMIMass So in the case of a child who develops DID, would that be a bad reaction to trauma? #mhsm
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-09 09:25:28	Who decides what resilience is in a child who experiences trauma? Is that even a fair statement
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-09 09:23:31	" @NAMIMass : A1: Some are more or less resilient to #traumatic #stress #mhsm " Not sure how I feel about this statement re:children...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-08 01:53:34	This is just wrong. pic.twitter.com/xZnVBgWO
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-07 22:37:39	Why do t.v. shows and movies ignore the fact of morning breath when it comes to romance?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-07 22:35:36	@tygergirl27 That's great! I'm so glad. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-06 06:26:36	@tygergirl27 :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-06 06:18:57	@tygergirl27 Now there's a goal! :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-06 06:17:16	@tygergirl27 Whew, I'm glad. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-06 06:07:34	@tygergirl27 I hope that tweet didn't come off bossy. In my head it sounded much nicer. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-06 06:04:39	@tygergirl27 Staying positive is good but it's also ok to acknowledge when you're in pain. I'm sorry you don't feel well.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-06 05:58:56	@tygergirl27 No you don't. Pain whether physical or emotional is a valid reason to complain.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-06 05:38:30	@tygergirl27 I'm sorry you're in pain. :( That makes things really hard.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-05 23:32:35	@tygergirl27 Hey, I just wanted to say that I understand how night time can be a disturbing time of day. I hope you are able to rest today.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-05 23:22:22	@JazzyJ1112 @tygergirl27 That's awesome! Enjoy yourselves!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-05 23:16:56	@JazzyJ1112 @tygergirl27 I just got up so my brain hasn't quite kicked in yet which means no emotions yet either. How are you?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-05 22:58:54	@JazzyJ1112 @tygergirl27 Good morning. I just wanted to thank you both again for checking up on me last night. You guys are great. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-05 10:39:41	@tygergirl27 Thank you. Here's to Seroquel. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-05 10:36:25	@JazzyJ1112 Thank you and take care. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-05 10:34:09	@tygergirl27 Awww thanks for that. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-05 10:33:34	@JazzyJ1112 I appreciate it. My meds are kicking in so I'll sleep and probably blog about it tomorrow. Seriously thank you.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-05 10:25:57	@JazzyJ1112 You're very kind. I'm just feeling the weight of life at the moment. Thank you though, really. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-05 10:20:03	Just spent at least half an hour in the closet crying. Exhausting and I don't feel better.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:41:55	@castorgirls You do the same. *safe hugs if I may*
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:39:51	@castorgirls I agree. And thanks, I will try to sleep now. Thanks for the Nerd talk. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:37:25	@castorgirls Amazing skill to manage that large of a cast and story.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:35:42	@castorgirls :) Unfortunately I had to hurry there from another place and change clothes so t-shirt was easier.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:34:18	@castorgirls Oh absolutely, his reaction made sense. I think her sitting shaking afterwards was kind of emotional. Joss did a great job.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:32:24	@castorgirls I ended up just wearing a 60's type vintage looking Avengers shirt. :(
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:31:11	@castorgirls I loved that about him and the protective thing gets me as well. Found myself scared when he went after Black Widow.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:28:08	@castorgirls It's almost 3:30 a.m. I took a Seroquel because otherwise I wouldn't sleep at all. It's just starting to kick in.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:24:18	@castorgirls Hehe, yes it could have been. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:21:51	@castorgirls That is a wonderful point! :-) I love that you saw that and felt that way. Of course when punched Thor I lol'd so hard. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:19:02	@castorgirls Oh my gosh CG. Cue weird music because I SO understand what you mean, his expression etc...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:17:14	@castorgirls lol! Exactly. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:16:44	@castorgirls You know what? It hit me the same way too. So glad you said that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:15:39	@castorgirls True and true. I still don't like her but I gotta give her credit.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:14:33	@castorgirls When he said he's always angry?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:13:24	@castorgirls Me too! And no one was more surprised than me since I don't like her.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:11:57	@castorgirls Absolutely! He's very gifted.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:10:59	@castorgirls Joss Whedon rocked it. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:08:33	@castorgirls I agree. :-) I thought it was intelligent AND entertaining which is an accomplishment.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:06:07	@castorgirls I cheered and woohoo'd it was AWESOME!!!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-05-04 17:04:20	Avengers officially my favorite movie. Maybe it's the delirium from the midnight show. :-)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-30 22:05:51	@Kazcita Oh btw love your Twitter pic lol. KIRK!!!!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-30 22:05:02	@Kazcita Very good point. And the media is contributing to the problem and being irresponsible.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-30 22:03:10	@mymorevividlife Yes it is. It reminds me of the fact that missing black children don't get the attn white children do. We're all the same.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-30 21:38:49	@mymorevividlife Cracked me up! I see myself there as well.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-30 21:36:08	@castorgirls Ah! Scared! Hehe not really of course. I should probably read about the app to know what I'm doing.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-30 11:05:55	@castorgirls I signed up as CimmerianInk.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-30 06:18:24	@castorgirls I got it. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-29 21:57:31	@castorgirls I'll be sure to get it, now go to bed! :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-29 21:54:16	@castorgirls Get some rest. :-)

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-29 21:53:49	@castorgirls No, I don't even know what it does. Pictures?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-29 21:16:26	@castorgirls I read an article about the guy who created Klouchebag because of Klout messing up his job prospects.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-29 21:11:46	@castorgirls Of course I will probably kill said garden...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-29 21:11:12	@castorgirls So glad you got out to take pictures! :D Not sure how I am, still a bit off after last therapy session, but started a garden :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-29 21:09:45	@castorgirls I've never done Klout before. I was barely using Twitter before and my FB page is just for news and coupons lol.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-29 21:02:25	@castorgirls How are you today?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-29 21:02:02	@castorgirls *sticks nose up in the air* Well then the score means nothing. I laughed because apparently I'm a bit angry in my tweets.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-29 20:53:08	@castorgirls Mostly alright??? Does it know you're a librarian!? That in of itself should get you a "holy crap she's amazing," score. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-29 20:45:31	@castorgirls :D I've been seeing that name everywhere, thought it would say I was a jerk. Did you do it? Did it say you Rock big time!?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-25 20:38:40	@castorgirls Ha! So weird. I just checked E! Online and the 1st article is about Aussies and others getting the movie first.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-25 20:34:40	@castorgirls Thanks. :-) I'm going to geek out pretty hard: Marvel t- shirt, midnight show, nerd talk, cheering. It's gonna be ugly. ;)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-25 20:27:04	@castorgirls My expectations are high after all the movies leading up to this.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-25 20:26:16	@castorgirls Even though I have to wait I'm all for escapism. :-) I'm glad it's good since I've been waiting for it since Iron Man. *whew*
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-25 20:18:52	@castorgirls to make it up to you. :-)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-25 20:18:33	@castorgirls Huh. So because of the special day someone (?) brought the movie in early? If you're behind then Avengers was a great choice...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-25 20:09:48	@castorgirls First what's ANZAC Day? And why is NZ once again so cool? You already got hobbits and elves. Now this? *turns green with envy*
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-25 20:00:22	@castorgirls We're talking about the Avengers right???? Because it's out May 4th.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-25 19:55:51	@castorgirls How are you seeing it so early???
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-25 08:27:01	@castorgirls I'm with you on that! I love both of them and Robert Downey Jr.made Iron Man awesome!

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-22 04:05:21	@Kazcita I bought Morrowind on Steam for the PC and am wondering if it's work playing.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-22 04:04:36	@Kazcita I've only played Skyrim all the way through though I attempted Oblivion before bioware's excellent graphics distracted me...
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-22 01:44:10	For the record @bioware I loved the ending to ME3. I've been a die hard fan since ME1 for me it was about the journey. Engaging. Emotional.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-22 01:40:21	@Kazcita Skyrim is already awesome so this just adds to it. :)
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-22 00:46:15	@Kazcita There are easter eggs in Skyrim!? Oh yes, do tell!
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-21 20:49:21	@Kazcita Very cool. :-) Dishonored isn't out yet but there's a trailer for it and other info on Bethesda's site.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-21 07:26:50	@castorgirls I understand that completely.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-21 07:23:56	@castorgirls Not that I'd wish that on someone.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-21 07:23:29	@castorgirls Maybe incarceration sticks in his head. It's also possible that he's with someone else and not interested in your life.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-21 06:41:31	@Kazcita Considering your love for Lovecraft and Bethesda games, have you looked Dishonered?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-21 06:09:17	@castorgirls He may actually be afraid of you. You took the step to bring the authorities in which showed strength. He won't risk jail.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-21 05:38:23	@castorgirls How are you handling that he's in town and when is he leaving? I'm assuming the event is about cars?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-21 05:34:05	@castorgirls Thanks. One less thing to worry about. How are you doing?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-17 07:10:34	@Kazcita So are you watching Pike or Kirk? And yes it's hard not to laugh. Reminds me of Adam West's Batman.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-15 13:30:38	@castorgirls True. I have to remember that I hate labels and not fall into doing it to myself.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-15 13:27:33	@castorgirls Especially considering that my husband backed out right before filming and left me on my own. See? Am I an introvert or not?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-15 13:25:47	@castorgirls :D You're so nice. Actually I had my hair in lots of braids down past my shoulders.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-15 13:23:39	@castorgirls I should add that this was not mental health related so not really brave on my part.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-15 13:22:46	@castorgirls Research people, research.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-15 13:22:24	@castorgirls I absolutely agree with you. A person can sincerely connect with another culture and want to express that.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-15 13:20:59	@castorgirls A total shock because there were way more interesting people than me. And my hair was totally different. 3 seconds of fame lol.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-14 12:13:38	@castorgirls My husband says the best part is from when they hit the iceberg and leave the rest. He hates the romance too. Joe?
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-14 12:08:01	@castorgirls The costumes are gorgeous! Like Downton Abbey. The history that gets me is the class issue and the way people ignored danger.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-04-14 12:00:25	@castorgirls I just wanted to check out the 3D. To be honest I hate the love story but I love history and that's what gets me.

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-03-25 08:05:05	@castorgirls Exactly what I thought! This trend of joking about rape is disturbing and happening more and more.
97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-03-25 08:01:46	@castorgirls Yes and how many people are wondering why we're making a "big deal" about it?

97096775	CimmerianInk	2012-03-24 07:33:46	@castorgirls I bet. The book/movie isn't for everyone and they definitely can't show everything in the book and keep a PG-13 rating.
