186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2012-07-24 07:00:42	@brain_opera @teaandtalking .. But it's worth it. Try convincing a Board that you won't go mad as an authorised signatory when you're manic!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2012-07-24 06:59:02	@brain_opera @teaandtalking No one knows this subject better than we do. It's hard standing by your own convictions when being shouted down

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2012-07-24 06:50:33	@brain_opera @teaandtalking Scary response but unsurprising
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2012-07-24 06:49:40	@brain_opera @teaandtalking I'm a senior NHS Manager and have worked in both acute & mental health hospitals. Neither were overly supportive

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2012-07-24 06:08:15	@brain_opera Me too. It's only through setting up a local bipolar group I found I wasn't alone in struggling with personal hygiene #4GoesMad
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2012-07-24 06:05:31	@julia99 Thought it was Stephen Fry. No, maybe Catherine Zeta Jones. Poor loves. They've all suffered so much
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2012-07-24 06:00:12	@MindCharity Disagree. Depression (or manic depression in my case) has nothing to do with my ability to cope or think logically #4GoesMad
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2012-07-24 05:57:59	@brokenmind_ Absolutely. Being famous and mad just creates a different #stigma for us (CZJ, Fry, Wax etc) #4GoesMad
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2012-07-24 05:54:49	@teaandtalking Agreed. I struggle to disclose my times of #psychosis because of the #stigma attached #4GoesMad #madconfessions

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-13 06:07:43	@Zoe_Smith @Butterflywgs Binning didn't work for me either. Not therapeutic. Better off with a good CPN if you can bear sticking around.
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-13 06:05:27	@Butterflywgs @meerkatarmy Nooooo!! Hubby has made chocolate chip cookies .......
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-13 06:03:36	@Butterflywgs @Zoe_Smith @Aliquant Binnability tends to depend on capacity of bin than nature of need at the time. Most of us are binnable x

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-13 01:59:46	@kmachin I'll see what I can do
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-13 01:49:22	@kmachin Will ask when I go back as there is now 2 groups of staff who knew me; patient, staff, patient and staff, patient
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-13 01:09:36	@BeatriceJBray @kmachin @shirleyayres @monstertalk It's amusing to see them on the hospital corridor as Head of Strategy, not a patient
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-13 01:04:15	@iamminihorse @latentexistence @julianyon @d_incurable Didn't work for me either.
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-13 00:54:57	@BeatriceJBray @kmachin @shirleyayres @monstertalk Strange. I was 'non compliant, failed to engage but would benefit from a hostel setting'.

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 18:04:07	@itvthismorning Kelvin McKenzie's use of the word 'nutter' was inappropriate during this morning's news section
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 18:02:14	@purplepersonage I'm a control freak at work. Hubby has mild OCD so cooking and cleaning is his outlet
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 17:59:58	@itvthismorning Offended by the use of the word 'nutter' in the news section!!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 17:53:24	@purplepersonage Which is why hubby does the cooking and shopping!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 17:52:36	@purplepersonage I don't do exercise but don't rest and run permanently on adrenalin. I have a challenging relationship with food too
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 17:50:40	@purplepersonage I eat & eat when I'm depressed but then, as I get worse, I self neglect including food. When I'm (hypo)manic ....
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 17:47:11	@purplepersonage It's really tough when, although it can be hard, normality can be achieved with effort.
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 17:45:45	@purplepersonage He's with you on Button Moon!!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 17:44:38	@purplepersonage I met hubby and was a size 8. Got married as a 14 after going up to a 16 and am now a 12-14. Self loathing sucks *hugs*
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 17:40:53	@purplepersonage Are you following Mr Spoon?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 17:40:06	@purplepersonage Same as me. Started to struggle with normality last October. Work crumbled in June

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 16:20:09	@recoveryandback I know it's stress but it's supportive stress
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 16:19:31	@purplepersonage OH won't take me back until psych gives the green light but only just started to tweak meds
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-09-12 16:18:19	@purplepersonage I'm quite similar. Been pretty stable since last major episode in 1999 and have been off since the end of June

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-29 06:52:59	@musebootlegs cos they never play feeling good, didn't do citizen erased last tour .... Not buying it. Tour with it? Broadcast it!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-29 06:27:31	Had a ticket for Leeds. Am unwell but consoled myself with (usually excellent) @bbc3tv coverage. Why have you butchered the muse set?

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-28 03:15:17	@Puffles2010 Good docu-drama on last week about him. One of the first to go into Dachau as a political prisoner

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-27 04:52:58	@Zoe_Smith Last time I checked symptoms of bipolar = ability to be unpredictable and a bit stupid. Give yourself a break. It's a long race

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 21:01:58	@BeatriceJBray There are some really good online resources that would help that
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 20:59:41	@my13thsadday @jermec @helenvking Chocolate fixes most things x x I would miss your tweets x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 20:57:54	@BeatriceJBray Shadow your specialist roles. Reduces vulnerability and builds in succession planning
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 20:51:43	@Butterflywgs @meerkatarmy Have you not tried Wineclone? Authorised by my CMHT (not)
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 20:46:18	@Butterflywgs @meerkatarmy Sour cherry? ;o)
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 20:45:52	@Butterflywgs @meerkatarmy *gets really excited* Meh >:o(
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 20:42:28	@BeatriceJBray Deputies/Assistants for those roles that would make the group quorate/constituted. Apols if I am wide of the mark
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 20:33:12	@BeatriceJBray Contingency?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 20:20:24	@jermec Not sure I know the difference but it has no specific trigger. CPN is good but sees me as a short term (as do I but less short)
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 20:14:16	@jermec Anxiety really p***ing me off. CPN due at 2.30pm. Any news on Z? How are you?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 19:45:24	@my13thsadday You're not alone. Some people are great at communicating in 140 characters. I'm not one of them! You however are very capable
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 18:54:07	@my13thsadday You seem pretty capable of dealing with online people x x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 18:15:19	@Aliquant You mean you're not building bunk beds for her?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 17:40:10	@Aliquant Go girl!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 17:34:38	What the f*** has Barbra Streisand done to her face?!?!?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 17:33:24	@Zoe_Smith Thinking of you. Missing having you around for tea and general mentalist chatter. *sends hugs*
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 15:32:59	@BipolarBlogger Yay!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 13:47:27	@jermec Haven't quantified who wants what yet. What do you want on your bagel?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 13:40:45	@jermec @Helenvking Sounds like a good message (sorry for the interjection)
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 13:39:33	@my13thsadday Morning!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 13:37:58	@Aliquant Didn't manage the furniture last night?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 13:37:13	@jermec Morning! Did Z see someone sensible last night?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 08:06:57	@latentexistence I wouldn't dare! Just thinking of having some smoked mackerel pate which is ...
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 08:05:29	@PrimlyStable @latentexistence How ignorant. Before you know it, the government will have a lead for disability who isn't disabled!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 08:00:28	@latentexistence Yay!!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 08:00:08	@latentexistence Salty, greasy fish paste it is then. Nope, Marketing don't like it. It's not porn enough
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 07:37:37	@latentexistence Fish paste?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 07:32:35	@iamminihorse No, I'M the new CEO of Apple *stands up*

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 07:25:47	@Aliquant Not feeling particularly awesome (but accepts your recognition graciously) & recognise that we don't recognise awesomeness enough.
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 06:56:12	@jermec Hubby supports Stockport County. He knows real pain!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 06:38:58	@jermec As a distraction from other pain (and the pain of recent results!)
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 06:31:58	@Aliquant Awwwwwww! It great when awesomeness is recognised ....
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 06:30:51	@jermec Evil witch @0iD
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 06:29:41	<= Tea and sympathy over here too please!! ;o) Feel like gnawing my leg off would be good pain distraction @jermec . Hi @bigdawny1
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 06:25:41	@Aliquant Real friend would be grateful for new cat bed. Happy hammering x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 06:16:40	@Aliquant Are you mental or something, building furniture close to midnight? ;o) #mentalist
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 06:14:35	@jermec *gets out small violin*. Bugger off. You know we love you. Now, shut up and throw another *insert appropriate group* on the fire

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 05:20:21	In pain. In bed. Drugs taken. Hopefully won't speak until the morning when I'll be there to make tea for the breakfast crew. Baked goods?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 05:17:09	@purplepersonage Hope you have a nausea free night x x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 05:15:11	@Aliquant Furniture shopping a success then?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 00:51:05	@BipolarBlogger I get Stemetil (prochlorperazine) which also helps with anxiety.
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 00:38:23	@my13thsadday @Zoe_Smith A mushroom risotto intervention?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-25 00:23:28	@jermec @Zoe_Smith Me too!!

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 20:47:38	@my13thsadday @Zoe_Smith @jermec Ditto x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 20:45:59	@Zoe_Smith @my13thsadday I don't think so Z. Where are 6 and 14 yo?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 20:30:45	@my13thsadday And the fact that it's from the 90's is good how?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 18:14:51	@my13thsadday Double yay!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 18:10:53	@jermec @zoe_smith Awwwwwww!!!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 17:14:02	@meerkatarmy If you want them too but more likely to send curry farts in Jiffy bags *stealth tactic*. Mentalist not aggressor
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 17:11:38	@0iD She's gorgeous!!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 17:05:33	@0iD All sighthounds rock! I don't know ... Ipswich Town; sighthounds; mentalists; Flogging Molly ... we could have been made for each other
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 17:02:36	@meerkatarmy Love York. Hope you can enjoy your trip out. Remember my dog and your credit card limit ;o) x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:58:42	@0iD I have two handsome doggies and a handsome cat! http://img.ly/7EqQ http:// bit.ly/nY90Sk
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:56:28	@meerkatarmy Avoid Manchester. They've got billboards up looking for looters that fit that description x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:55:01	@recoveryandback You're both in my thoughts. I'm off at the mo and don't know how long my recovery will take. Worried and scared.
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:53:39	@recoveryandback I have a 5 month old puppy pinning me to the bed! http:// yfrog.com/kjauaihdj
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:39:22	@Zoe_Smith So like that red checkered one?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:38:21	@0iD Not quite rancid. 'Oniony' is how I'd categorise them on the parp scale.
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:36:31	@Zoe_Smith Nooooo! I must know. I am on a quest for replacement mugs. Otherwise I WILL spend. What is the secret?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:34:41	@recoveryandback Joined you in tea, paracetamol and codeine. Hope things are easier with EE x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:33:37	@0iD Homemade. Was already 'yesterday's' curry and I didn't fancy it. Charlie clearly did!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:29:28	@Zoe_Smith So right shape, wrong ...?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:28:37	@my13thsadday According to a new study, women's MH is hit harder than men's by the daily commute: http:// bit.ly/odvlxt
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:25:38	@Zoe_Smith @jermec @0iD @my13thsadday My other dog is making me cry as hubby fed him the leftovers of last night's curry. Not. Good.
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:23:17	@Zoe_Smith Is this better http://img.ly/7EoP
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:12:10	@Zoe_Smith @jermec @my13thsadday @0iD Feels like I'm now in one of those seats at the theatre marked 'restricted view' http:// yfrog.com/kjauaihdj
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:06:05	@my13thsadday @Zoe_Smith @therealewing But isn't that life anyway?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:04:57	@jermec @my13thsadday @Zoe_Smith I'm a little scared of you!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 16:04:21	@Zoe_Smith @jermec would it make you smile an ickle bit it I sent you a set of these? http://img.ly/7EnN
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:59:04	@my13thsadday @Zoe_Smith Me too
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:58:00	@campbellclaret I'm picking up a theme here .....
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:56:02	@violet_towers At least both times were 'am' ;o)
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:54:35	@jermec @Zoe_Smith @my13thsadday @0iD They won't go away but my mug is half full today and I have to believe that this will get easier
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:51:41	@Zoe_Smith Well they shouldn't fuck up this time. I had a year of revolving door admissions last time I was unwell. Take it at your pace
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:48:47	@Ruthie_Knighton A bit up and down. Getting loads of great support from CMHT, GP & psychotherapist. Richard from OH was great last week too
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:45:34	@Zoe_Smith @my13thsadday @jermec @0iD Understandable but this illness is a marathon not a sprint and meds take fine tuning and tweaking
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:44:25	@jermec @Zoe_Smith @0iD @my13thsadday it's my maid *checks for delusions*
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:43:48	@my13thsadday @jermec @Zoe_Smith Of Chablis? That would be lovely
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:42:53	@Zoe_Smith Hurrumph!! Yes, I think we can safely assume that @jermec is happy in that bad cop role @my13thsadday
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:37:03	@0iD @jermec @Zoe_Smith @my13thsadday http://img.ly/7Eme
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:35:29	@jermec @Zoe_Smith Ditto. Anyway, I'll need you my next change which is looking imminent #Thursday #CPN
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:32:41	@disableddaddy @julianyon Or arrogant. Recent encountered some shiny turds who just know the Market gaps and going rate.
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:30:34	@Zoe_Smith Not at all. It is a really shitty diagnosis and nothing like the Kerry Katona, CZJ, 5 days in rehab/Thailand image portrayed.
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:28:01	@jermec @Zoe_Smith @0iD @my13thsadday Of?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:27:39	@Ruthie_Knighton Morning!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:27:00	@my13thsadday Will get hubby to dig out recipe x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:26:25	@Zoe_Smith @my13thsadday Action required then
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:25:34	@Zoe_Smith @jermec Agree change may be as good as a trip to Paris ;o)
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:25:00	@my13thsadday @Zoe_Smith What about someone like a specialist nurse or nurse consultant who might have a more holistic view to meds?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:23:50	@Zoe_Smith http://img.ly/7Els Yep!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:17:08	@my13thsadday There's still a portion of g/f cheesecake in the fridge .......
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:16:10	@jermec @Zoe_Smith @0iD @my13thsadday Secret low fat ingredient? Sweet potato (with lots of Green and Blacks 70% chocolate)

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:08:35	@my13thsadday The 0505 from Manchester is the Special Brew Choo Choo
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 15:07:04	@jermec @Zoe_Smith @0iD @my13thsadday Brownie a la hubby. Tea brewing http:// yfrog.com/h83kqckj
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 14:54:47	Tea anyone? Homemade gluten free chocolate brownie?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 14:47:56	@jermec @my13thsadday Why is Mark named after a shower?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 14:47:11	@jermec Last night it was fife #zoezoezoe but it could be you anytime (leicester's not far away). You asked if anyone could get to her
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 14:25:14	@Zoe_Smith Not a problem. Didn't realise how valuable my @friends were until this recent and ongoing crisis x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 14:20:29	@Zoe_Smith http://img.ly/7Eht

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:51:42	@itsmotherswork Especially with all those kids he's got!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:50:44	@Aliquant Just exercising my Mentalist's right to check ...
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:30:54	@Aliquant I'm with you babe. Not sure all our caring professionals (or bank managers) would agree! Already sizing up today's purchases
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:28:52	@jermec You sleeping I hope?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:27:28	@my13thsadday How's you?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:27:02	@my13thsadday About 3 hours *Woohoo!*
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:25:25	@Zoe_Smith *big hugs* this morning. Hope we hear from you soon x x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:22:51	@Aliquant Woah! Too enthusiastic for this time in the morning (especially when I'm going to be resisting all day from visiting mr x stitch)!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:20:42	@my13thsadday Morning chicken!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:17:57	@tristanx @Aliquant No and yes!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:17:09	@Aliquant Not mixed I hope?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:16:44	@jermec Yeah, it's up north. I could go up to Zoe and catch Leeds on the way down again
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 13:15:49	@Aliquant need to devise some sort of multi accessible gadget so you can access wine/camera etc and not disturb Tom ....
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 07:33:15	Sleep calls (or insomnia just to piss me off and mess with my head). Night y'all. I may return x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 07:31:41	@Butterflywgs Amen to that one x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 07:31:04	@julianyon An array of snails?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-08-24 07:30:22	@muse So want that glass!

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-19 08:27:28	@thegrumpymanc No need to be sorry (I did ask). It's ok not to want to feel the way you do. Would time out from work help?

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-19 04:45:38	@Butterflywgs @mindcharity I'm sorry you feel it's a cliche. I believe in spectrums, in both illness and personality. I'm also not creative
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-19 04:40:51	@itsmotherswork It's not something you can ever put a financial value against ..... No crime is
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-19 04:39:12	@Zoe_Smith Step back, deep breath. Any thoughts on why you've got so many projects in the go babe?
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-19 04:37:08	@Butterflywgs @mindcharity I don't get huge highs, mainly lows. I don't know who I'd be without it & I find I like myself more than loathe

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-16 21:10:56	@my13thsadday @zoe_smith @jermec On my way back from a week in Somerset with no signal but plenty of cheese and cider. Now look like a house

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-13 01:08:54	@thegrumpymanc Yep >:o( Should have it finished today though x
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-12 17:21:12	Managed to drag myself on hollies despite meltdown about work. Sleeping well through winiclone. Back over to cafe to finish work b4 chilling
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-12 16:50:46	@my13thsadday Convinced to come down on that basis, found a Christian Cafe with free Internet who let me connect to their network directly
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-12 16:48:57	@my13thsadday Hubby was a star and convinced me that if we couldn't find somewhere in Somerset where I could do the work, we would come back
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-11 16:38:39	@my13thsadday *hugs* I went into complete meltdown yesterday when I realised I had a piece of work to finish and couldn't connect to work
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-11 16:06:00	@Zoe_Smith It's helping me forget work while I'm in Somerset. It's keeping me away from the cider!
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-10 03:20:27	@jermec @myuntidymind @zoe_smith Sorry! Missed the postcard >:o( In sunny Somerset :o)

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-07 07:01:44	@NormanTonner Call me, rather than an ambulance when you need a lift ......
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-07 07:00:13	@jermec Silly little uni girls wanting why no drs were available with 5 in resus cos they'd fallen while dancing on a table
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-07 06:18:01	@NormanTonner Hard to know; it's a reflection of society in general. Drunks use ambulances as taxis. The elderly are reluctant to call 999
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-07 05:58:44	Fuck wits! Watching #24hoursinA &E and want to kill people. On call tomorrow and hate how the public abuse the FREE service #SaveOurNHS

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-06 05:02:51	@jermec Bit of both. Need to work to help keep me sane and get me out of bed but it saps all my energy and makes me constantly doubt myself
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-07-06 03:28:04	@jermec No. Not bad enough apparently to warrant secondary care input as we're 'coping'

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-04-09 07:45:54	@BrokenOfBritain @jermec It's amazing how much your twitter friends support you. Being 'normal' @work means that colleagues rarely know you

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-04-09 07:39:16	@BrokenOfBritain Perhaps a shared blog so that it's less obvious? I'm a bit like @Dalekette , very out & so quite well known region/national

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-04-09 07:28:20	@Baskers You paint such a delightful yet vivid picture ;o)
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-04-09 07:26:57	@julianyon Yes. I did a lot of #mentalhealth awareness training for faith leaders a while ago. Big knowledge gap. Felt completely let down
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-04-09 07:25:14	@BrokenOfBritain @jermec Makes me think of a Stranglers song! I'm way too acquainted with my bowels to find it that interesting. & I'm mad?

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-04-09 07:17:10	@BrokenOfBritain Thank you! You've done fantastically well despite the fever, nausea etc .... Keep well ((hugs))

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-04-06 09:20:25	@latentexistence I prefer my frozen grapes pressed and made into eiswein ;o)

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-04-06 09:10:02	@RichardWickison It has it's downsides. You can only cope with so much crap in your head for so long. No sleep, racing thoughts then despair
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-04-06 09:05:57	@latentexistence Just been downstairs and hubby had made a gluten free/low sugar almond cake. Yum *puts slice in envelope*

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-04-06 08:01:21	@MarkOneinFour It is but there is the issue of pathologising everyday life as I fear is happening with antidepressants
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-04-06 07:50:41	@MarkOneinFour @kp_ld They get bonuses from the PCTs to use generic drugs (just like for flu jabs, diabetes screening, doing their job ....)

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-03-08 08:02:10	@jermec Always!! Listening to Michael J Fox's second book at the mo. Irritatingly inspiring
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-03-08 08:00:14	@Zoe_Smith You could end up tweeting with a couple of bipolared insomniacs!! There's worse ways to spend a night!

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-03-08 07:34:17	@BeatriceJBray Would love mentally challenging and stimulating episodic work. Likely? I think not. Becoming too tired for full-time work

186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-03-06 04:27:12	@andesha Stick with it babe. It will pass eventually x x 
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-03-06 04:07:17	@andesha It's the self neglect that I get most ashamed of. Not washing, cleaning my teeth etc. Then you have to put a face on to the world
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-03-06 03:55:00	@andesha that's because they have no clue that having those makes you feel worse, more of a burden and less able to give in to depression
186563681	mnicsleepteachr	2011-03-06 03:52:40	@andesha I know babe. Just maintaining a 'normal' life at work means I'm useless at home. I'm harder on myself than my hubby is ((Hugs))
