2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-20 13:03:21	@glen_malley I just thought it fits the way I feel. Just sort of general "can't believe it".

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-20 10:46:23	I wrote a letter to the kids as a reply from Santa, there is no doubt in my mind that the Google translated Norwegian is utter gibberish. pic.twitter.com/hi6RrSbx7F
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-20 10:11:01	@lefteyedgirl @roquesullivan Happy Holidays to come. I apologise for my foolishness during Autumn. It was I that fell .

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-20 07:54:22	@nina_in_japan it's going to be a drag. Still yes, soon it will be and we'll all be funfilled. Yup.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-20 07:42:48	Right, another day ahead. Let's that through this.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-20 07:15:43	@WeinsteinShmuel oh I know what's there, that's a very odd thing for you to assume. Anyway, thanks. Merry Christmas
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-20 07:09:00	@WeinsteinShmuel you're laughable. Anyway my life is obviously more fulfilling than yours.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-20 00:42:19	@sfpodge that's fast football
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-20 00:40:34	@YabaiKankei oh haha. I tried to look coquettish in some. But I looked silly. I see what you mean :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-20 00:31:45	@YabaiKankei it wasn't pleasant in colour either !
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-20 00:00:45	@beckimeetsworld do it. Start being free.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:54:47	@beckimeetsworld good plan. Better than nowt :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:52:21	@hull_libraries @AboutHistoryMag I'm starting to wonder about those chipolatas
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:50:47	@kinjapan86 whoop
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:49:59	@beckimeetsworld if you still feel naff, there's plenty of pills here !
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:49:17	@beckimeetsworld out of the frying pan and into the noodle bowl :) you could try a low dose. But it's maybe better to look forward to
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:46:43	That poison apple looks tempting. I could do with a long sleep. Different play, by the way. The musicians of Bremen are safe. pic.twitter.com/jEy8mLaMt4
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:44:40	@beckimeetsworld you'll probably settle down when you get here. Now you've got way too much happening. Christmas Family Japan.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:42:33	@beckimeetsworld well hormones can get mucked up.Depression sex drive hormones all can be affected by stress.being depressed is stressful
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:39:35	@beckimeetsworld the mind is something often unfixable. It's hard to treat. My mother was the same. But she never believed us.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:37:33	@beckimeetsworld lol. Yes, I was diagnosed with that and asd. I still have days like it, but nothing like the brain fogs and obsessions.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:36:11	@beckimeetsworld watch some YouTube videos about your condition. Often more comforting things come from them than GPs
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:35:20	@beckimeetsworld often there's a suitable med after a few tries of various types. But it's always best to get away from the upsetting thing
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:33:40	@beckimeetsworld depends on what it is. Some of them make you woozy or forgetful. Turns out I had celiac disease, and that made me ADHD!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:31:50	@hull_libraries oh it did. But I still sat on the kerb and finished the chapter :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:29:36	@beckimeetsworld I spent yrs at therapy and stuff. Turns out it was all a waste of time and effort. Talking about it gets you more upset
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:26:03	@hull_libraries yes. Fell off the curb while walking with Lord of the rings
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 23:23:59	@MSalt69 Japanese MIL bought us ice cream today

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 18:12:10	@AdsilaMika brought it home for them normies.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 18:09:30	So I had to arrange a bag of stollen slices from the baker for the teachers. First year I had to not have it :( then cakes they gave me. pic.twitter.com/EhO7eZcty8

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 07:26:50	@clairetanaka ah yeah, the old point and er..... might be funny :/
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 07:25:23	@clairetanaka the whispers of "Nomura Sensei?" From the older kids is a bit sad !!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 07:24:40	@clairetanaka oh I look at them and point to a couple and say hello yusuke, you've been a good boy this year haven't you. Shocker!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 07:20:22	@clairetanaka it's nice in that way, at least:)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 07:20:02	@clairetanaka i have to speak slower. And calmer. Usually I'm all hyper. Otherwise they'll know it's me. Still I can give the kids something
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 07:11:11	@clairetanaka oh that's a relief mrs Christmas lol
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 07:09:44	@cinnamaldehyde like when face masks say they 99.9% of stuff. Just in case
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 07:06:32	@cinnamaldehyde they are not properly edumicated !
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:55:07	@bartontiger I do it as a reverse drag. With panache and a fancy scarf!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:54:15	@AdsilaMika this I shall do 6 times. "Because U are English, and is from in Europe, and is similar". This is why makes me
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:50:37	Today is slightly loathsome. I have to be the Santa at the クリスマス会 then have Christmas cake (take ) and gakudo 'do'. While grinning
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:46:15	@beckimeetsworld dotour coffee shop only saw me once. Coughee shop more like.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:45:03	@beckimeetsworld true
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:43:03	@beckimeetsworld little idea that smoking in coffee shops is bad. Smoking sections in restaurants have no door. So the smoke drifts !
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:41:05	@beckimeetsworld it's like telling not to eat chips! In there's very little social stigma attached. And even less cross culture input
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:38:12	@cinnamaldehyde I had some Worcester sauce unknowing it contained malt vinegar. Most loathsome aches. So 'malt' is just a big fat no, now !
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:35:51	@cinnamaldehyde I've never had or seen it. It's probably some private special little gluten free factories. Not mass produced
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:30:46	@cinnamaldehyde @US_FDA dear FDA pic.twitter.com/MgKd8K9QO2
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:28:50	@cinnamaldehyde @US_FDA these ppl think like "malt isn't wheat", and that's their complete level of understanding where gluten is from :(
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-19 06:21:30	So that's 3 Christmas parties, a New Years party, and 2 "let's meet for drinks" that I have to worry about. I'm really not good at them
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 21:24:40	@ProgressxBlack your hair is strong in the force

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 21:18:54	@nina_in_japan recipes and I need gluten free flour. I miss too :/
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 21:18:13	@nina_in_japan yes. I thought of you I keep doing Amazon and rakuten. Then I get a Twitter-Poke about iherb. I was looking at stollen
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 21:16:24	@nina_in_japan that and a big pair of emoji!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 20:35:48	@sheepchase @KitchenAdam what big baubles you have :) Pretty neat tree!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 20:34:07	@NomuraKate our 2 got them 2yrs ago. They have a lot of fun with friends too. Mario and some quiz game are a group favourite.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 20:32:02	@DayniKo that's a shame at Christmas. Especially as you're delicate anyway. Hopefully things will smooth out :/
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 20:26:57	@zoestagg thanks yes it is. I keep forgetting iherb
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 20:25:10	@redhero I've tried them a bit faster. Especially if it's news :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 20:24:12	@OlDirtyGaijin oh that does lol good. A lot like Christmas might be picturesque!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 19:15:43	@OlDirtyGaijin the Bremen play is a youchien favourite! Oddly.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 19:11:12	@beckimeetsworld interface mismatch gets in the way of everything sometimes :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 19:09:53	@OlDirtyGaijin @briandotjp first I knew of the story was when I came to Japan!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 18:40:04	@beckimeetsworld it's why I left home at 19. Or thrown out!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 18:30:11	@briandotjp that's good. We did Bremen for our happyoukai.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-12-18 17:12:15	@hizaga I did go to a church of Christ in Oklahoma, but it was a bit full on. I still listen to the podcasts from there

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-30 11:23:19	@DayniKo does body warmth help? I mean like showers or heat pads?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-30 11:22:13	I do think it is better following the recent changes. It's more manageable in terms of notifications as well. @twitter pic.twitter.com/neaPXzTEwc

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-30 11:09:32	@innocencewalker aye. That's when you start to feel like a sales product:(
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-30 11:08:36	@innocencewalker ah it's a hoikuen so we must be neat but not too made up. Clear nail polish is ok as well:)

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-23 23:24:43	@28Loki clutching at straws or not, it just might work
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-23 23:23:29	@writersinjapan yes, I was surprised. Might even meet up at new year. It's the nicest thing. So that's another thing cheered me up
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-23 23:11:33	Meanwhile on Facebook, my wife and ex wife are friends, both helping and encouraging me along. And at one point, I thought all was lost.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-22 14:24:09	@WeAreXpats rice and a raw egg!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-22 14:09:58	I don't think I've ever held my breath that long before.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-04 21:28:24	And so I face my final curtain. I'm tired now. Tired of being me.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-04 16:00:20	@briandotjp you've stolen the lot !!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-04 14:09:44	@DayniKo I know someone that's feeling downtrodden today. ( 'ｰ')ノ(◉_◉ )

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-03 19:07:45	@sheepchase @MattNavarra looks ace
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-03 12:20:19	@nina_in_japan yeah. I'm learning what to run away from, and if I go down the snack aisle, I feel horrible. But it is better
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-03 08:58:20	@RamandaB my jpnese friend in NY says food is easy. But things like kotatsu, and Asian-hair care products are hard to come by

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-03 08:49:02	@nina_in_japan it's been 6 months since the proper diagnosis. I do feel much better. Casein also a lesser prob. But massive difference.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-03 08:46:36	@nina_in_japan salted chips is the only ok one. And I'm sick of them! I haven't been glutened for a few weeks. It is a game for sure.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-03 08:44:30	@briandotjp thank god for YouTube! When 8pm comes, I saunter off to the the tube. Daughter is the same.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-03 05:34:47	All week I haven't had any potato chips, or other snacks. I have gone right off them. After dinner I just want to go to bed. Can't stand tv

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-02 23:54:35	@troovus it's true. The media have made everywhere I lived sound awful. Meanwhile my corner of Japan is rather quiet but Brit-less
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-11-02 23:46:32	@troovus I may return one day, but for now I would rather keep well clear. Hull will have to remain an un-revisited memory !!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-10-31 05:44:35	Well, phone has been crap a while, and dropping it in the toilet has rendered a waterproof phone useless. iPad 2 to the rescue. Wifi only.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-10-31 05:42:39	@YabaiKankei that's terrible. I drink senna tea from seims if I get glutened. When that ol' constipado has you in its spell.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-21 07:17:21	For some, sexuality is set, For others it is changing, Some want none of it, Some want some of it, While many can't stop banging.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 18:40:23	@SublightMonster if you draw a jack o lantern on the board, the kids in Japan say, "it's a Halloween".
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 18:37:17	@nina_in_japan @JackOnSkates sounds a funny tune to sing

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 18:24:31	@tokyorich @fernandogros oh yes. And watch what they post!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 15:26:21	@timthesocialist Sadly yeah, too many people think like that.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 14:40:18	Great, I fixed. We are now with 4G again. 4 bars not no bars
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 14:17:18	@YabaiKankei oh well.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 14:13:55	@YabaiKankei oh, that's a funny rule

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 11:44:50	@sfpodge he's all wet suited and booted. He'll still get soaked
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 11:39:34	It's fairly rubbish being on a scooter in this weather pic.twitter.com/icJFBzs65v
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 11:36:55	@noriiwa here's the easy way. An online relationship can go wrong if you meet someone for the first time outside of the internet.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 11:31:43	It's probably better to just tweet Saitama pics here and re tweet as beingsaitama!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 11:27:18	@noriiwa @AdsilaMika yes today I'm alone, so the 愛 became extra 雨 I sing that song to myself at work
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 11:22:19	@WeAreXpats walking in the rain, Oran juice Jones
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 11:20:19	@YouTube 愛燦燦 actually, but with extra 雨
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 11:17:59	https:// youtu.be/uMVQ5LpT5Ik 雨燦燦 a famous, slightly sad haunting rainy day song. Chicken Skin shivers.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 10:31:29	@lefteyedgirl they are far nicer than the ones we get.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 10:23:31	@noriiwa @AdsilaMika and then if it was to go wrong it would be a disaster
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 10:20:38	@noriiwa it all means although one might like someone else, and they, you, it might make a pleasant situation online into something else
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 07:46:42	It's a strange thing to like someone a lot. And you both wish to meet, but then you mostly would like them more. And it could get awkward.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 07:12:34	@happy_excited22 yes, it raining heavily here in Saitama. But it's going to pick up a bit more later!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 07:09:42	@timthesocialist @M_Star_Online an interesting debate, indeed
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 05:55:51	@28Loki in the end I slept at 11. I had some sleeping meds.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 05:51:38	@28Loki I wanted to!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 05:51:08	@noriiwa ah yes! Have nice day. But rainy. 雨燦燦 ♡
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-20 05:44:48	@zaichishka animals so sit in the most awkward places at times!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 20:31:50	@spooky_girl I hope get a more comfortable kid soon. I think our school's 3 and 4 are the wildest, crankiest and easier illest!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 20:15:27	@spooky_girl here is humid. They get cranky and restless all the live long day!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 20:14:23	@spooky_girl things are things warming up in the weather now? Upto 5 yrs they always mleurgh at the weather. In japan at least.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 20:11:08	@spooky_girl boobs, poops, pees, hot, cold, lonely, stifled. Whatever is up!?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 20:08:40	@writersinjapan @WeAreXpats @redhero my fax machine is broken. I put the paper in but it won't send it. Keep coming out of the other side
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 20:04:32	@nina_in_japan we are two of a kind.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 20:03:39	@noriiwa is this taito ku

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:36:22	@SparklesWoo apart from the pasta, we are all eating the same. Pasta days, I have the sauce of the day on rice. pic.twitter.com/UqmFX3h9dZ
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:34:21	@WeAreXpats @writersinjapan thank heavens for those days of finding food gold
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:32:35	@SparklesWoo it'll be OK. Bit frustrating but it's doing a special service by having to eat less
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:31:22	@SparklesWoo I make my own miso and ginger beer, too!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:30:35	@writersinjapan @WeAreXpats I wanted to see relatives in Oklahoma, and then Japan. I didn't know there'd me no cheese and onion crisps here!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:28:27	@SparklesWoo thanks, chuck
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:28:12	@nina_in_japan off again tomorrow, and I'm gonna have a hot shower now. See what happens!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:26:36	@SparklesWoo crisps, are salt only, pasta, blah blah. But sort of have it all sorted.!!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:25:33	@SparklesWoo the biggest bind is soy sauce. Or if Worcester sauce it has malt vinegar, or paste is made with fermented Barley
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:24:15	@nina_in_japan yup. pic.twitter.com/ViQeciADLs
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:21:42	@SparklesWoo if it's gluten, it takes a few hrs to hit. But milk, and some fruit / veg is an instantaneous BLAM!!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:19:36	@writersinjapan all the better to rule all the things!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:18:18	Now at the 36 hrs awake mark. Not for any reason
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:16:49	@SparklesWoo stronger now. Just gluten. And fresh milk. Cheese OK, eggs are dependent on how cooked
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:15:21	@SparklesWoo go the park and collect a bucket full of acorns. Acorn flour is good home made. I was a bit iffy with corn and tofu. But strong
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-19 19:04:00	@SparklesWoo so good. I'm in possession of the corn flours. We are inventing gluten free greats pic.twitter.com/QHuvQwV6xb

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 12:12:07	@28Loki only because I've done it all arse about face!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 12:11:19	I am always available for questions, answers, weddings, funerals, and bar mitzvahs.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 12:01:38	@AdsilaMika so I have found myself in the most troublesome predicament. To wit, COMING out means nothing, if you can't then GO out!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:57:43	@lovelovemarines you were right the first time
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:57:03	@lovelovemarines I'm currently tweeting said story

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:47:20	@AdsilaMika becasuse* So you keep growing and it's all screwy. And you go along with it,and you get married and get divorced and get married
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:45:29	@lovelovemarines it's a loooong story
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:44:01	@AdsilaMika so you go along feeling wrong and out of sorts. Because your a girl that is also having hormone trouble beca6thts celiac bonus
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:41:45	@AdsilaMika my hormonal deficiency, and they fix it, then yay, it's visibly fixed. But that's all it is. It's not internally altered at all
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:39:44	@AdsilaMika if born with a birth defect (I've said this before, but at 4am one day), and that defect is hypospadias, and that's caused
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:37:46	@_Miyako_Kyoto_ yes I guess that'd be nice
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:34:02	@DayniKo yes. Same here. I have no IRL friends. Just colleagues and family.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:30:50	@AdsilaMika I'm sure that there's only so much one can say out loud, before you appear to be in the need of a check up from the neck up
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:22:55	@lovelovemarines not in my particular case. Though I know many tweeps meet up
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:16:53	@AdsilaMika which in turn means that there are 50 more ppl in my life that I will never meet.And the more I gone on with it,the harder it is
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 11:15:22	The problem I have have with twitter is that I now have too many (around 50) that I really like. So that's more ppl than in my actual family
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 09:55:16	@DayniKo thanks. I have gone off all of it now
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 08:34:55	@nina_in_japan I will be on Facebook a bit longer

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 04:08:37	@noriiwa sure. Maybe find me on Facebook. There are only a few people with me, and they are my family and friends

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 03:58:23	@noriiwa both Japanese and English. Novels or cookery
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 02:35:03	@AdsilaMika I love my books. My books and I have been together a long time. Long nights together, reading until dawn.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-16 02:33:00	I think, it's just time to sign out of the interwebz. Anyway, phone only works on WiFi, and these days I have no time for my beloved books

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-10 09:00:32	@brianlynn @nina_in_japan @Norsebysw I can't explain that. I have now found my new special interest.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-10 08:59:24	@brianlynn @nina_in_japan @Norsebysw I actually felt a little tearful. Oh my. The rolled R is a bit like ラ in japanese. But longer.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-10 08:55:03	@writersinjapan always the same name, but we have chameleon-like abilities. We show our true colors. One shade at a time.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-10 08:51:46	@writersinjapan a certain someone I'm very close to, that's in my bed
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-10 08:50:33	@brianlynn now it makes sense. I like Japanese, I like English. But old norse, I have to hear more
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-10 08:47:29	@nina_in_japan @sfpodge @clairetanaka you'd go nuts at my 'talking to the encho on the phone voice', then!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-10 08:45:39	@brianlynn it reminds me of Lord of the rings. Hammer is definitely a word!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-10 08:44:20	@noriiwa taking everything out of it. We will give it up (やめる) because it is hard and we have 2 gardens too
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-10 08:42:12	@nina_in_japan @brianlynn @ozAntinnippon @Norsebysw that's beautiful to listen to.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 21:04:52	@writersinjapan I didn't care for cars, but I like that he likes them. It's taken an hour to park them. Maybe it's his 'special interest'!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 12:51:15	@michaelshizuro she's hot. I didn't know he'd been giving her any loving!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 12:49:27	@riinroo I mashed it with butter, mayo and hotdog mustard, salt and pepper. Nothing fancy!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 12:47:43	@michaelshizuro except uhuru, maybe. He didn't log that
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 12:44:47	@michaelshizuro he liked green ladies. And star dating
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 12:43:11	Potato, ham, cucumber, carrot salad. Sorry about the presentation. The popcorn insisted on being in the frame. pic.twitter.com/JCSqyG8fBO
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 12:25:04	@sakurapandatea seems nice. You too. Whichever game you chose
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 12:23:27	@sakurapandatea I dare not go back. Japan is a very nice place to be. I am mostly unquestioned, and left alone
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 12:18:41	@sakurapandatea that's true. My '77 class photo. We were all different back then. UK scares me, nie pic.twitter.com/xzGRVkBOUu
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 12:16:35	@sakurapandatea the one on the right
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 12:13:40	@sakurapandatea I think multicultural state is woeful
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 12:01:43	@sakurapandatea in Japan, I see no cameras. 21 yrs of no problems. I have even had fun with police. Different world
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 11:55:58	@ReddKlaw bonkers barmy, mate. pic.twitter.com/vU06dzFuUu
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 11:54:58	@sakurapandatea England has cameras everywhere. I think the Queen has seen my bum.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 11:53:53	@ReddKlaw like Duran Duran was singing Rio a couple of yrs ago
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 11:52:58	@sakurapandatea but it seems like a few yrs. Like the 80s
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 11:51:51	@28Loki I like all that mix. For all that, I am still in a bunkbed
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 11:50:21	@28Loki there's England, Scotland, French, choctaw, Japanese, Welsh, and secretly Korean, and Ainu. Quite a mix.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 11:47:15	@ReddKlaw yes amazeballs. It was was the first story I saw when I turned on my first pc in Japan.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 11:45:48	@28Loki see, differences. That's funny. My wife is also M and May. Daughter MJan, son swelter mind blower.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 11:38:17	@28Loki Mika is a choctaw name, and so is Adsila. But Mika is also Japanese.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 11:36:55	@28Loki I guess. I was there sooner than aunt expected.! I have a little choctaw blood. Possibly as much as an arm's worth.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 11:30:59	@28Loki I only like sooners because I lived in oklahoma a while. But TBH, I don't fully understand. I saw and and it was fun!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 10:50:35	Had to give up the allotment. But will instead concentrate on the English language room's garden.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 10:15:31	@LKP48 Japan will condemn it, equally pointlessly
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 01:09:33	@28Loki @beingtokyo counting counting the sheeps

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 01:03:26	@beingtokyo lilliput.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:59:25	@bartontiger it was possibly Wesley Lutton's successor. My aunt is there. Possibly the bursar.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:56:33	@bartontiger great gran is near the east hull Chapel. Not far from the red car. Portobello St vicar pic.twitter.com/a6E0rVMe1P
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:45:33	@bartontiger on a tangent dad worked at Hull nick, and grandad is buried in the cemetery next door. I send them books. From Officer Taylor
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:36:39	@Pubgoblin or a shufty if you are low on time.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:35:28	@Pubgoblin have a butcher's up there. There's loads
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:34:36	@thislolak I quite like Catherine Cookson too. And Sidney Sheldon. Just something romantic. Or adventurous!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:29:51	@Pubgoblin levis cup my arse, and shimamura let's my arse fall off
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:28:49	@beingtokyo @Pubgoblin srsly though, ameyoko has giga-bloke sizes. I am 184 and was swamped by a lot of it
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:25:39	@thislolak I used to read my mum's Mills and Boon. I felt like I I was perspiring in an unnecessary fashion
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:23:39	@beingtokyo @Pubgoblin I am tall but a lady L sufficient. You are probably an LL.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:21:01	@Pubgoblin @beingtokyo or amazon or shimamura has 大きいサイズ selection.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:19:53	@Pubgoblin @beingtokyo there's a lot of big stuff in Ueno.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:18:42	@thislolak it even had Herman Munster in it
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:18:01	@thislolak oh the movie was great. Needful things was a great book, bad movie. Pet semetary great
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:16:44	@thislolak my kindle has many unread by others. But for 3 pic.twitter.com/r91eNZzV7j
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:14:03	@shotanueva it's for mental agility, so the encho says. I personally can use it, but 'ok google'generally works OK pic.twitter.com/2d78mjj7Oe
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:11:03	@thislolak I read Stephen King a lot. Green Mile the most. One chapter. `The bad death of eduard delacroix` fascinates me!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:07:54	@shotanueva yeah. I think they talk about how they hate the soroban. Lol
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:06:18	@thislolak like When Marnie was here. I cried reading the book. I loved it a lot. Then I saw the movie and I felt blasé.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:03:03	@thislolak I read the book and loved it a lot. But howl was too young in ghibli. I thought he'd be more gentlemanly sherlock like
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-09 00:00:12	@shotanueva They usually giggle. Then I go back to being matron and stare. It's like being mother superior pic.twitter.com/lIZZiYUr5l
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:49:50	@shotanueva I ask them. They are the 無口チーム
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:48:40	@thislolak
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:47:39	@sfpodge he will be the victor. I'm terrified pic.twitter.com/iDEeuwVXbZ
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:40:59	@ThinkingJaplish in England I really was afraid. Not here, I just eat jelly beans
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:39:48	@ThinkingJaplish it's nice. Actually Actually obon is the same as Halloween, but more orange here. These are for the school to make. NoScare
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:37:25	@sfpodge book makes speak. Or some other thing.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:36:24	@beingtokyo actually I dunno why but I considerably dislike ghibli things. I think it's howl's moving Castle that put me off
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:34:17	@hizaga ermahgerd. I had these in America. I was late for work. I didn't know what day it was. Wednesday is the weekend, right
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:30:41	@sfpodge not always prisons,but somewhere where they can't just go get one.I'm very random.I hide my email address in the book. Replies come
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:27:01	@sfpodge I send them to nz, USA, South Africa or myriad English speaking countries. Or nunneries in some cases. Commonwealth or somewhere
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:18:15	One thing I do, is send my read books to random prisons around the world. Surface mail is fairly cheap. Make someone happy.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:11:50	Funny how a moment of boredom gets all the retweets, likes and follows. That's awesome
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 23:08:43	@derrottenberger @_taring it is pretty cool on all notes. Even the Queen cheers up!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 22:25:07	@28Loki I see Street Cats.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 20:04:55	@hizaga we make them once a week. I can be a bit cack handed with them sometimes!!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 19:32:52	@hizaga maybe. Cubicle conferences are quite possibly a thing
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 19:27:26	Nama harumaki again tonight. I am a quiet eater. They continue to babble. pic.twitter.com/Xx6SQMEPb3

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 19:08:44	@hizaga I think that is the most likely zone, or San Francisco to have such a carry on!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 19:07:25	@jasonrcombs livestrong. Com says sinus headache. I certainly don't think you have cancer. No, siree Bob
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 19:04:08	@WeAreXpats I suppose that yes. When nobody is looking over your shoulder saying "that's not right", it's easier to be freer

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 17:51:49	@thislolak no one bats an eyelid. Toilet behaviour here is a very open affair. ( )
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 17:41:54	@beingtokyo is that roppongi or does everywhere look the same?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 17:40:02	@JapanThis @thislolak my job at the soroban time seems to be rounding up the piddle possy
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 17:38:39	@thislolak and they giggle as they tiddle. It's madness

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 17:29:34	Why do girls go to the toilet together in Japan. One cubicle, 2 or 3 girls.Are they afraid they'll be too lonely to pee? #beforeicametojapan
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 17:26:22	@thislolak whole hearted agreeance
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 17:25:05	@thislolak @seanmaki oh my gosh. And that poor monkey

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 17:21:39	@thislolak I'm going to get some nice bread for them from co-op, I think. Just a small token of my windfall.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 13:41:36	@000gun it's always been a carry on with them. I have these moments when I get frustrated, then like you think, how could they know?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 13:39:29	@lefteyedgirl they are only doing their job. Which being a nosey arse.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 13:36:12	@AdsilaMika ( #hypospadias ) I'm not off my rocker, don't worry
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 13:34:33	@AdsilaMika they were probably in a pickle, I'm sure, but the corrective surgery didn't help ME all that much. Damn and blast it.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 13:33:05	Somebody should really have properly explained to my parents that a boy without a winkle is a girl.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 13:29:38	@bartontiger so was her face. But quite quiet for a change.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 13:24:37	@noriiwa I hope you can have a long life. Take care of your ticker, though
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 13:21:32	@DayniKo you hardly appear to be a Mrs. WobbleBottom as it is. But if you feel better for it, good luck
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 13:18:33	@JapanThis I thought it would have a socket on the charger transformer part. Jony Ive should have asked.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 12:58:27	@lostinseoul very exciting. These typhoons keep tantalising us!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 12:52:57	@lostinseoul it became a tropical storm of minor proportions
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 12:52:20	@glen_malley @JapanThis that's actually what's bothering me too. I generally watch YouTube with the charger and
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 12:20:56	@28Loki you should make 3 pound batch and freeze some!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 12:17:57	@noriiwa you're just enjoying yourself
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:58:44	@noriiwa pleasantly plump is perhaps politer. Or gentleman's waist.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:53:14	@noriiwa absolutely, sir. ラジャ (￣^￣)ゞ
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:52:24	I rather startled the encho with this, today. Haha. pic.twitter.com/wD6Bvf7B5A
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:49:12	@noriiwa ぶよぶよ
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:48:11	@noriiwa the word we use is Foodie. That's a nice word :) pic.twitter.com/UDNDv2RkwC
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:46:30	@28Loki good for you. It doesn't do for a working chap to settle for potato chips and beer.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:43:29	@28Loki whatever is easiest is a glass of milk and slice of bread, consumed very quickly.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:42:37	@noriiwa lol no, not glutton or greed! I just like to cook lots of different things. That's funny! pic.twitter.com/1yBswpMrNE
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:40:40	@28Loki they are. I make them, and the kids love them. Cheese on top. Also good mixed with ketchup. But in buns they are not kid-friendly
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:38:24	http:// allrecipes.com/recipe/24264/s loppy-joes-ii/ … make these, people. Sloppy Joes, the kids will scoff the lot
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:37:11	@28Loki but less messy
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:36:30	@28Loki I think the easiest thing is is fry mince, onion, potato. Then mix in bbq sauce, then plop it on toast. Sloppy Joe style :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:34:37	@noriiwa I'm also fond of shiratama. I eat anything!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:33:19	@28Loki u cook something different every time. Keeps the kids happy. My mom had around 5 things she could make, and frozen dinners to bake
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:30:10	@28Loki I'm a collector of condiments. My calamitous kitchen cookery is covered in ketchup. #word

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:21:15	@ichigoichielove yes. A little bit of violence never hurt anyone. Go kick them in the knackers
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:19:52	@spooky_girl funny. Also featuring rene magritte
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:17:16	@28Loki oh I had some tabasco that was smokey flavour. That was nice

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:12:15	@28Loki dijon is nice. But Japanese normal からし mustard is like wasabi. And that gets right up you nose
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 11:07:06	@28Loki don't you like spicy stuff? I use American hotdog mustard. That's my fave. I don't like jpnse mustard. Unnecessarily tear inducing
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 10:54:48	@hikosaemon @NAR nice but it is going to be expensive, by the look of it
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 10:52:46	@28Loki I used to eat them a lot. Lots of mustard on it.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 10:51:56	I doubt that they are as passionate about it as I am pic.twitter.com/6T8Qlj4j2g

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 10:32:42	@noriiwa outside of Japan, it's still called mochi
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 10:32:08	I ordered a bigger bento from madam over there. Looks the same to me pic.twitter.com/QLLLoK6ffn

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 10:20:13	@lefteyedgirl oh yes. Better black and white than navy!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 10:17:42	@JNegronBK oh that's a bit manky looking.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 10:16:56	@lefteyedgirl a blackened heart!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 09:01:22	@writersinjapan it's even been rainbow, purple, and blue!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-08 09:00:23	@writersinjapan only if I colour it. It's actually a dirty brown, but I mess with it.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 18:09:57	@writersinjapan I was there. The shadow in the background of the morgue.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 17:58:32	@writersinjapan I'd like to wake up with her inside me

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 16:01:10	@DayniKo I've been putting up with it since I was 4. Now I've told everyone, I'm losing patience. I have to straighten my head and be ok
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 15:55:37	@DayniKo and they call me my old name. Even though I have been very patient this far. Also this is Japan. I'm not kaba chan.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 15:53:35	@DayniKo yes. On those days I just look like a regular guy, albeit with smooth arms and face. It's really starting to get to me, now.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 15:44:00	@DayniKo dress down. And it's wrong and I feel so uncomfortable.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 15:43:06	@DayniKo thankyou. I sort of flipped out. I'm tired of having to pretend to be someone I'm not. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, I have to dress
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 15:37:24	@glen_malley @DayniKo I have an account for that

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 14:20:49	@michaelshizuro maybe I'll go cook something
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 14:17:46	@michaelshizuro that is a good idea
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 14:12:09	@michaelshizuro not really. Tired of myself
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-07 14:10:40	I'm just... I don't feel right. Like I've just lost the will. The plot. The point.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-06 06:06:46	@noriiwa Yes. I have worked on both.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-06 00:21:11	@tonykeyesjapan yes. I hope so too. Fortunately word is getting out that the world is super complex, and so are the people in it
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-06 00:16:43	@tonykeyesjapan whoop

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-06 00:06:53	@sanverde it turns one girl in her class is FtM and 4yo.Complains every day that she wants a ちんちん! Suddenly the world around me gets it
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-06 00:01:58	@sanverde thanks. It's a process of getting inside their minds and seeing if they might understand. And she did, very much!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-05 23:59:07	Well, during the week I dress down, and at home I dress up. So I came out to a teacher yesterday and felt so happy
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-05 23:56:02	@noriiwa yes that's true. But still, rice paddies is not what the west call them. Rice fields is the name we use.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-05 10:49:40	@cinnamaldehyde oh gawd. I think there's some of that in it too. It a was a cheap one. And there's no honey in it. Crikey. Whatever next??
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-05 10:45:04	@cinnamaldehyde I'm not at all sure why I didn't think of it. I have since learned that it is actually made from fermented barley. Doh!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-05 09:33:35	@redhero @JNegronBK not strictly, but it seems veeeery likely
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-05 09:32:24	@redhero @JNegronBK it's a pity about the head phone socket.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-02 06:51:42	@ReddKlaw it's a really lovely name. Silly to say it, but I expected like hayley or Claire. Or Megan!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-02 06:24:24	@noriiwa top of the class. Top of the year.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-02 05:17:11	@noriiwa I like how the words can be made. Today 9.2. I will wash shoes and make meat ball stew. くつ and ぐつぐつ

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 18:07:14	Well, I just realised my name Mika Adsila Nomura has the initials M. A. N. *Guffaw.*
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 18:05:53	@noriiwa you got it, bro
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 17:58:54	@noriiwa it's OK now, thanks. Yamanote is also a bit late, I think. 地下鉄 ok
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 17:55:18	@noriiwa because all the lines are interwoven together.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 17:54:23	@JapanThis I especially don't like the smoking areas in restaurants. I can still smell it!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 17:09:49	@noriiwa not yet. But there's a 人身事故 somewhere on the joban line, and the keihin tohoku line is stopped.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 14:20:44	@Otakuhaspie all the extremes
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 14:18:44	@Otakuhaspie it might still change course, if it does what #11 did. Parts of hokkaido are a real mess.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 14:14:47	@Otakuhaspie yup. A few years ago there were more than 20!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 13:49:22	@TasteyFlav I'd say that was spot on
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 13:46:58	@fernandogros the result was, I have to say, very me. I hate conflict. And I do sort out a lot problems. Very clever stuff.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 13:26:38	@DayniKo I'm mostly accepting of anyone. Except when ppl let the door close on me!!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 13:23:43	@writersinjapan oh I was firm about most of them. Bigged myself up a couple of times

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 13:12:43	@noriiwa I do like old UK comedy on YouTube from time to time
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 12:48:13	@sushiewushie makes me happy when I hear it
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 12:34:19	@nina_in_japan I am always breaking up the kerfuffle here at work. I guess I mediate. And ruminate.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 12:30:01	It's too much to explain celiac disease. All they understand here is that I have wheat allergy. Lol. Still, at least they are remembering
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 12:26:22	@radcrochetqueer at least you've mastered the finer points of pleasant conversation
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 12:24:52	@nina_in_japan I think it would have been dweeb if I hadn't bigged myself up a bit.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 12:08:44	@nina_in_japan the leading lady!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 12:08:07	@noriiwa hmm, I like it sometimes. But I don't really watch a lot of TV. I don't really like it much.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 11:59:54	@lefteyedgirl huzzah!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 11:58:16	@noriiwa sometimes エンタの神様 is amusing
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 11:56:41	@ReddKlaw as long as there's no graphic noodles hanging out
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 11:52:46	@roquesullivan thanks ever so
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 11:51:43	@noriiwa I have seen it. I smile politely.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 11:47:42	@fernandogros I just read that, and did the test. Apparently I'm a Mediator. Very interesting read all round.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 11:45:52	@roquesullivan but TBH, I've been having less than prescribed. At night 1 single capsule. But I feel not good. So I think, stuff it.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 11:44:22	@roquesullivan after I stopped eating gluten and the pain went away, I was already on a high dose, so I have been gradually reducing it.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 11:42:58	@roquesullivan it was for pain, and the depression. But it it wasn't really getting better. Until they did tests for celiac and it was that
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 11:41:46	@noriiwa oh yes, it's from a comedy called Father Ted

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-09-01 11:28:30	@roquesullivan I have decided to just stop. I was given it when they thought it was fibromyalgia. But I feel better. Unless I take them

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 16:41:46	I am on my best behaviour. pic.twitter.com/7qLP8VH7lD
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 16:05:00	@hull_libraries yes, I have noticed over the yrs that whichever of you tweets, there is some grammatical trickery involved!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 16:01:25	@ChriChriHime thank you
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 16:00:34	@DayniKo shimamura special. Thanks
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 15:59:52	@hull_libraries I see what what you did there

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 15:57:15	It's a funny thing but, I feel as though I am dressed as a tomboy,but in pink if that makes the slightest ounce of sense. #transgender fun
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 15:36:15	@spooky_girl bit longer. But here's how. https:// support.twitter.com/articles/20172 128 …
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 15:27:35	@spooky_girl 120 seconds
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 15:27:13	@spooky_girl you can just use the twitter app
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 15:09:51	@SetagayaGirl hear hear
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 15:07:51	@SetagayaGirl or rush him. The police have for a reason! Mind you, UK has long stand offs
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 15:06:01	@ichigoichielove hey ya
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 15:05:15	@SetagayaGirl they have patience, for sure.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 14:09:50	@nina_in_japan it's what the Japanese do best. Sugar Rush Parfait
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 14:08:26	@DayniKo and it's a fairly non-humid gustiness
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 14:06:57	@YabaiKankei パワハラ at its worst
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 14:01:54	@cinnamaldehyde ah yes, and my hair and skin is very soft. I'm pretty much pain free. Much marvel.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 13:56:11	@cinnamaldehyde yup, fingers and toes are all fine now. One even split off all the way to the cuticle. Much improved
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 13:53:54	@beingtokyo I generally eat about 7:30pm. I get full up quick, then I won't have any thing else after :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 13:51:40	My nails used to have a lot of ridges. Since stopped gluten, much tidier. pic.twitter.com/JspNNOCGuz
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 13:46:59	@beingtokyo I mostly only have me breakfast and tea. Middle of the day I can't be naffed in this heat.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 12:34:47	@thislolak apart from every egg is a fresh one, I would have to agree. It seems a waste of energy and resources.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 12:30:42	@thislolak I have done both. That's not nice at all.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 12:26:33	@thislolak I'd like to have had the experience but I can see that it's naught but a nuisance
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 12:24:17	@JapanThis @writersinjapan YES! キリスト
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-31 12:22:50	@thislolak I am in a curious position here.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 21:25:31	Have had Cymbalta. If I type nonsense, I don't mean it.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 21:01:05	@fernandogros @JustAGlassChild amazing. I love angelique kidjo https:// youtu.be/nrwRjUue-sY for that reason. And any other 'World' music

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 18:02:40	@AdsilaMika he says. "you are brave". But I was not brave. I was running scared.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 18:01:43	@AdsilaMika it's raining and something is ahead. A home in a gap in the trees. I burst in and and old man glances my way. "you are brave“
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 17:59:58	@AdsilaMika a Hunter shoots at the moose in front of me, another Hunter takes down a duck that shouldn't be there; it's dark, it's cold,
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 17:58:26	A wolf is chasing me through the trees. And darting this way and that. Crows see me near their tree, they caw in a group and swoop down
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 17:51:01	@writersinjapan @LKP48 @mebehindadesk that's not even a pee's worth!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 17:49:42	I would think FtM #transitioning must be harder in some parts. Easier than mtf in others. But I am much happier. So you be you. If you can

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 16:03:39	@hull_libraries if only there were a train
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 16:03:00	@hull_libraries it was my leaving do. So I ate a very lot. pic.twitter.com/pE5OQWeU9U

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 15:58:19	@hull_libraries it's been 21 yrs since we last had a bbq together!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 15:55:39	@hull_libraries are you mostly recovering from the parents or the bbq!?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 15:54:49	@yurikageyama ermahgerd

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 15:10:13	@sheepchase @kinjapan86 oh yes that ghost walk. Iike Whitby a lot too. Especially the pontefract cake shop.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 15:01:20	@Stwutter waiting for the corbyn corbyn jokes. Hot air, private seat, all that.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 14:58:49	@noriiwa it is best to get to the heart of the matter, without dressing it up, in many cases. That's the difference betwixt Facebook/Twitter
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 14:54:10	@jakeadelstein @sfpodge probably why I loathe TV, I guess
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 14:47:33	@sheepchase @kinjapan86 oh it has a posher name than I thought. I think there's a horror house as well. And up the hill there's old stuff
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 14:45:25	@noriiwa concisely

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 12:27:09	@writersinjapan me too! I have odd days. Days of questions.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 11:52:13	@writersinjapan typhoon and mine
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 11:48:27	@Blitzkrieg_exe in theory
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-30 11:44:53	And then the storm was past.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 14:24:54	@sushiewushie 31c and rain now. All the humids.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 13:22:03	@sushiewushie we look forward to it in Japan. It cools right down :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 13:12:30	@GearoidReidy @PatWallace05 @business it's a big one, for sure. Lots of cancellations of things.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 12:47:54	@SublightMonster @roquesullivan nasty sod is here in Japan on holiday.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 12:27:43	@JasonPackman oh him. He's still here :(
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 12:04:14	@writersinjapan very much droll
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 12:03:07	@writersinjapan @MillisBrent gets getting closer to deficate with each change
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 12:01:34	@dbs_78 probably more like he was a knob end
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 11:58:38	@AdsilaMika by which I mean one person. I really find it bizarre.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 11:48:43	@MillisBrent as long as it's not your orifice!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 11:44:31	@lefteyedgirl thank you very much
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 11:40:56	@lefteyedgirl this is a nice tip. Mine is straight and shorter than it was.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 11:34:49	@lefteyedgirl I like the smells, mostly. Maybe Asian hair products are tailored for Asian hair. My mother uses only shower gel!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 11:16:09	@writersinjapan 2 weeks is sufficient, for sure.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 11:15:21	@MillisBrent thus far. When does your day start?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 11:14:26	Soon there'll be less of these. #朝顔 Morning Glory. It's only about 3.5 weeks to autumn. September 22nd. pic.twitter.com/S07aKqVRDi
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 11:06:01	@jamessalvona this is news!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 11:04:00	@lefteyedgirl I use asience. My hair used to be harder work, and honey hair cream treatment. But I do think I prefer home products. USA UK
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:57:50	@jamessalvona oh that's early early. Did they break up early? Here the summer hols are shorter in hokkaido and longer in winter
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:54:02	@sakurapandatea I get bored and have my two kids at home all day!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:50:57	@28Loki all the yays.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:49:22	@kingofbitching especially at the end of the day!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:35:26	@kingofbitching no one ever asked me to be their knicker-sniffer. How awful :(
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:21:40	@writersinjapan yeah, that's tricky. Good luck, like!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:20:53	@writersinjapan when he gets older, you'll be busy barking at him to do his homework
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:18:06	@writersinjapan mine can play outside now. But it used to be very hard finding space in time and place to entertain them
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:16:50	@writersinjapan freedom. I'm happy to work with kids, but having my own at home all the time. Can't get things done.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:14:40	@ReddKlaw mooo
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:14:07	@writersinjapan then they can look forward to going again
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:13:45	@writersinjapan ah yes it happens with us. So the kids get used to it, but know it's not permanent yet, and if they enjoy,
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:12:21	@taemannom okly dokly
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:11:17	@riinroo I expect that you shall be doing the fandango
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:10:26	@taemannom
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:03:32	@writersinjapan yeah, and UK is the first Tuesday of September!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 10:01:23	@riinroo very good. Are you chatting, or singing, or needle work!?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 09:59:12	@taemannom @egg_dog I'd better not
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 09:58:26	@ReddKlaw your new avi is all the admires
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 09:57:22	@sakurapandatea 930 - 7. I also have a gakudo from 4.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 09:53:37	@sakurapandatea I get bored. I'm a youchien teacher, so it's fun and there's always something to make or do.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 09:51:52	@sakurapandatea I am!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 09:48:33	Kids back to school today. This is a good thing. #Japan
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 09:20:37	@kinjapan86 whoop
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 06:26:30	@ldkkei ppl who don't give a damn, and make a point of telling that to others obviously do care enough to feel the need to mention that.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 06:23:29	@ldkkei reading that, it seems very much that the opposite is true.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-29 02:00:12	I don't remember actually cancelling going to sleep. But I am not getting any sleep at all.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-28 23:53:14	K is very amazing. Her powers of tolerance and understanding dazzle me.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-28 21:22:55	@DayniKo hooray. I hope your night is a restful one
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-28 21:21:12	@nina_in_japan she slept till 4 and moved slowly. Seems to have passed!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-28 20:28:02	K ok. So that's OK.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-28 20:26:45	@nattoben it's quite a job as well!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-28 08:04:07	@Hakuzi_Hanzo I am the same! Cheese, parmesan ok, milk and yogurt no. smh!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-28 08:02:16	@zaichishka thanks. Experiment gone wrong. It's gone now, but 'Gordon Bennett'.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-28 07:56:55	@Hakuzi_Hanzo but I guess it will be a while longer!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-28 07:56:30	@Hakuzi_Hanzo celiac made things weak. So even soy and corn are off. But, after a while of no gluten, I might be able to eat them again
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-28 07:55:05	@Hakuzi_Hanzo I am. But I am trying to introduce different things into diet. I made a cappuccino 24hrs ago. No more.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-28 07:47:48	I am never going to drink milk again. What a mistake. Fever, slept forever. Itchy, scratchy, sicky. Still, lesson learned. Thanks.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-08-14 08:51:19	@AdsilaMika but hadn't realised how much it had been wrong. Anyway, Hormones cause that (it's believed), so transgender. celiac messes

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-07-01 07:51:35	@MillisBrent @supergaijin76 but so many are persecuted for the joy I feel with kaori. Strange world, right
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-07-01 07:50:47	@MillisBrent @supergaijin76 because of celiac I've struggled with hormones, and had trans feelings. I feel happy and normal.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-24 16:37:25	@AJJTokyo oh yes. Thankyou. I was just thinking of an island, with a country that's got hostility pointing right at them.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-16 16:21:47	I realise that these days I hardly read the news. If I don't notice it on Twitter, then it can't be worth looking at.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-16 15:01:29	@glen_malley I always have a princess handy to wake me up
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-16 15:00:06	@sfpodge takoyaki only apparently
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-16 14:50:29	A girl just said why is there mayonnaise in the fridge if we don't eat takoyaki. For sandwiches, I say. She's never had any in a sandwich.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-16 13:07:05	@AdsilaMika but now it's arms or a drawing or other representation. That's why I was peeved last week. Fair enough.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-16 13:04:35	Meeting postponed until tooth hurty. So I'll tell you that I got a minor bollocking off K last week. The "previous" photos of her are ok.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-14 23:55:37	@MeowMeSpacie K's legs get edema. But she has a decent day. It's mostly when she lays down, it seems. Awful to see. And she gets very hot

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-14 23:40:16	@MeowMeSpacie K has a pillow that has sand in. And you microwave it. I only had this a couple of times. But she gets this a lot.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-09 13:47:11	@fernandogros @ozAntinnippon and apologise
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-09 13:42:28	@MillisBrent still doesn't look as bad as the strawberry one.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-09 13:33:50	kids thrive on repetition don't they. There's one boy that never stops. My voice tires. pic.twitter.com/UHeCA00yxA
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-09 13:25:52	@000gun saizeria is the worst. All that pizza and spaghetti, and beer floating on the air. Still, it is nice to be different
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-09 13:20:44	@000gun restaurants are bit tricky!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-09 13:14:44	@JNegronBK
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-09 13:14:18	@000gun because of the soy sauce or something in the air. But I wear a face mask and do what I can to hold my breath
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-09 13:13:20	@000gun I used to be having no end of Meds tests, the lot. I still slip up but I can't avoid a lot of it. I feed the kids, and my lips itch
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-09 13:06:09	@000gun my asthma has also cleared up. It's a real pain in the everywheres. But unbelievable.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-09 13:02:07	@JNegronBK I believe that to be the case, squire.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-09 12:47:01	@noriiwa today I had to do paperwork for a meeting tonight. So I ate at my desk :)

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-02 19:37:32	My actual name is Mika Adsila. It occured to me that Adsila Mika is easier to say. When annunciated correctly. For me at least.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-02 19:12:03	@cyber_octopus white noise. The only thing I'm OK with is the sound of someone breathing. That helps, or aircon hiss :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-06-02 19:09:50	The risk of the destruction that #gluten can cause in people with #Hashimoto ’s so far outweighs the benefit that it is really no contest.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 09:58:22	@zaichishka @roquesullivan @SublightMonster that is a fab hobby. I commend you
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 09:38:53	@MillisBrent @jasonrem85 @robotopia I learned Japanese that way
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 09:37:53	@sheepchase @ozAntinnippon sorry, mucky mind. pic.twitter.com/9hYmD6zbtJ
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 09:34:59	@sheepchase @ozAntinnippon so you're the guy that's flapping around the town.!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 09:34:15	@lefteyedgirl oh. Thanks, maybe yeah. I hardly seem to drink enough water. I get a lot of night sweats too. Good point
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 09:27:12	@roquesullivan @zaichishka @SublightMonster cool. They're gobsmacked in Japan too, so you must've really warped them abroad
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 09:23:34	If you use Veet, careful of finger nails melting

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 09:14:24	I think the way #celiac affects hormones is the reason my hands remain smooth at 45. Though perhaps more veiny that nessecary.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 09:07:46	@beingtokyo good luck
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 09:05:52	@ozAntinnippon @sheepchase try opening the zipper. Let a bit of air in. Failing that, you could go Tackle Out for the day.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:58:29	When a little milk comes out, but I have no kids..maybe it's because I spend the day with babies. #Celiac affects hormones, too.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:51:53	@ozAntinnippon @beforethesneeze *sure
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:51:39	@ozAntinnippon @beforethesneeze that's an anthem for suee
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:41:11	@beforethesneeze @ozAntinnippon by jove, what a beautiful day to enter someone's center
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:39:36	@izzitjusmereal yes I did that. After a bunch of test I am better. But perhaps think differently. maybe wanna fight thru. Come on dad,
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:34:38	@ddblue0 ha! My cholesterol is 288, and I'm still OK
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:33:40	@izzitjusmereal Tricky thing. Is it about or is he saying that but actually truth is,scared.Either way I hope you can do what needs doing
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:29:57	@ddblue0 if you translate that to Japanese it's ミスターヲブルボットッム
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:27:26	@izzitjusmereal that's a bit steep.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:14:36	@MillisBrent suck it up, life is for living. Variety is the spice of life, as is chilli powder
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:12:32	Gee my hands feel sore. I shaved the backs and arms ( #Japan ) we had no Veet. Bugger
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:09:09	@ststev a stopped clock is right on time, twice a day.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:01:13	@MeowMeSpacie nice. If anyone gives you roses, dry them. Tea them.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 08:00:13	@GardeningLif @MeowMeSpacie that's great. I must investimagate this here flower. It's like HollyHocks meets hibiscus
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 07:53:42	@Glinner @MadameRamotswe @MikeChaseACLU @washingtonpost @violetblue just Hi everyone
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 07:51:40	@ozAntinnippon you be all A to the Z, Anthony. How's your day so far? Chillin' or Illin'?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 07:46:50	@chestnutvinegar oh now that's a bit rock n roll
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 07:46:13	@gegallas @TheSandiConnect I followed y'all. Now, I expect to be impressed
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 07:45:01	@AdsilaMika and I let them because 1) Japan, 2) I'm cack-handed at plaits.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 07:43:55	Older girls in Japan are far more controlled. It's quite normal to be in a Gakudo and they say, Mika Sensei, can we plait your hair?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 07:37:32	Tuesday is always an odd day for me. I am at home, and do housework. There's no Kids, or K, but cooking and washing and vacuuming aplenty.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 07:30:03	@misssaxbys @AussieinJapan @zaichishka dotour coffee shop is very smokey *cough*
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 00:03:51	If it is not for reproduction, it's about closeness and togetherness and love. Love making is that, nurturing love, and helping it grow.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-31 00:00:32	@Blitzkrieg_exe @cyber_octopus English, is a pot of tea

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:50:26	@tonykeyesjapan better a witty foe, than a cumbersome wit for a friend
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:48:05	@RekishinoTabi have. That's a good one I forgot.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:47:34	@tonykeyesjapan stolen scraps hath fed thy brain well enough. Your chalice teems with words beyond folk of near moribund comprehension
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:41:47	@JapanThis I've been in UK USA Japan. I have only ever felt at ease in japan. USA not so bad, but UK I was very insecure. Yay Japan
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:40:08	Hair is pretty until it's washed. Then I'm bedraggled. Maybe a pixie cut would be nice. But the plaits
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:36:20	@JapanThis dunno mate. Made it up. Dunno how you blokes go about your business
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:35:20	@JapanThis top class bs is still amusing. It's like when I listen to politics. All I see in my minds eye are dancing faeries
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:33:06	@tonykeyesjapan gadzooks, my codpiece is overflowing with the spittle of angerment
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:31:00	@tonykeyesjapan ye gads, man. Your way with words hath outshone the bard of all the things!!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:29:44	My one tattoo is small enough to hide behind a band aid. Coming up to pool time

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:23:24	I like posh words like poppycock. Bullshit is too modern.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:18:41	@JapanThis oh yes mammalian protruberances was too hard to spell, so I mucked up the easy word instead. Derp.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:15:55	@JapanThis yes and there's lactation and ovo-lactarian. I'm just a go along to get along type. I don't want it but if it makes y'all happy
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:13:18	@JapanThis that's funny, K calls me Picky Mickey. It's to do with the 自閉症 but I'm terribly fussy about food. Even the colours
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:11:07	@BrandyBoyK9 'supp
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:10:04	@JapanThis the rijichou says to me he's a vegetarian too. He always has salmon and cabbage. I'm a funny little miss, he thinks
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 23:07:21	@Kuma well fo'sho :) but Tuesdays is my scheduled day orf. So I go set the rice, and write the essays and report cards from now
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 22:59:42	I've used twitter from day one. Did we all grow up together. ?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 22:57:37	@JapanThis when I say I'm a vegetarian they say there lots of veg in chanpon. I say I do t like meat, they say salmon steak is nice.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 22:55:17	@AdsilaMika not sure about other countries but in Japan, nursery teachers do a lot of writing. : )
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 22:54:05	Sleep at last. K says goodnight, see you tomor..... How do people just become . Now I have to go write an essay.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 22:50:59	@cyber_octopus maybe smoking it gives people Lavender Lungs :) thanks for mentioning it. You might be right. I am a lavender lover :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 22:47:53	Anywho, finally all the accumulated brother/sister muck has been trashed and K will be officially at this from June 1st.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 22:44:56	@cyber_octopus maybe if you eat a full field of it. But I got this is Kaldi pic.twitter.com/lmXiCAX4Ur
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 22:42:58	@JapanThis lol. We said to our boss, we live together. She said いいね. Then took us for lunch to a ramen shop. And I'm like, what do I say
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 22:27:23	So we had lavender tea. Fully expected more purpleness. If you chew the flowers it's like Earl Grey. Hippy Happiness pic.twitter.com/6gGapqBFZL
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 22:24:14	@JapanThis @mebehindadesk siri never believed me. OK google just be like, sure, duck, I understand you are punning
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 22:07:42	#beforeicametojapan I was afraid to say I was a lesbian. Now I'm more worried people will find out that I am a vegetarian.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 21:52:34	@supergaijin76 @ClassicStarWars I see the world as a cacophony of very loud memories. Since aged 2. Nothing goes forgotten
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 21:50:45	My friend is my age. She's all wrinkles and grump. This is not my case at all.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 21:48:56	@bartontiger I prefer to say Front Bum but that's only UK. I only use Twitter to share nonsense :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 21:42:20	Although I feel like me, my confidence in fem is a bit warped. As has my 人生 been. Thus I consider myself to be Mikanese. With friends.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 21:39:14	Apparently celiac has messed me up and my hormones over the yrs. That's why, says the doctor, my lady bits aren't quite right.I'm 45 already
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 21:34:34	@noruweijin lol yeah, I think so. She behaves about the same.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 21:28:21	@noruweijin we have dinner with mimi in her cage, then we give her all the bits, and she cleans the floor too
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 21:27:31	@noruweijin we couldn't have no mimi. She chose us. When K and I went to shimachu, all the dogs were asleep. Except Mrs, here.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 20:55:58	My whole life, size and stature has been governed my being a #celiac but not knowing. Short, petite, and a fighter. pic.twitter.com/7uPMlOCQnq

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 20:43:34	@ststev there was one once the size of a dinner plate. Veritable swarm.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 20:42:44	@noruweijin I used to. I had a gray and black one called Pepper in England. Now we have a dawg, but next time we plan on American Shorthair

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 14:59:32	@JapanThis I use mosquito coils, that's about it. And roach traps. I was bitten bit a praying mantis last year. That really hurts.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-30 14:57:36	@glen_malley @mebehindadesk I keep some them in a glass tank. The only thing that actually dies at my hand are roaches. Dirty things.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 22:37:46	@JapanThis yeah. But I did walk back and give her a kiss. Auntie said she said she liked kaori. So that's why she's coming. Ho hum.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 22:35:44	Wtf does my Mrs think she can learn at this time of night... Oh yeah, Japanese people
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 22:32:36	@JapanThis @DaikanyamaGuy first time I walked away from her
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 22:31:54	@JapanThis on Monday the day was supposed to replace the the drip with a food tube. But she looked at me and said もいいんじゃない？, 美香ちゃん
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 22:27:20	@JapanThis @DaikanyamaGuy thanks AKB48 MAN pic.twitter.com/SmzlCrUiN8

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 22:19:52	@JapanThis @DaikanyamaGuy anywho on Saturday we'll go to grandma's funeral and after I wanted to go here in the car pic.twitter.com/mF5GfR772p
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 22:13:47	@JapanThis @AdsilaMika @DaikanyamaGuy I suppose. I want to but...I must I must. I'll probably enjoy it. I'll probably love it.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 22:10:14	Kaori will study a bit more. Tomorrow we are half a day each, but I patrol soroban class too on Thursday. I'll it
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 22:08:10	This is gonna be more complicated than top trumps. pic.twitter.com/AHj34YJ1sW
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 22:06:58	@JapanThis @DaikanyamaGuy I suppose. I dunno I always feel more littler than a hobbit. I'm very body conscious.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 22:01:52	@JapanThis @DaikanyamaGuy I think it's me. She's fairly uninhabited. I'm visibly not but am actually a foreigner. Lol. Anyway she's the boss
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:40:00	@JapanThis yes, K and I are a bit shy at the best of times. Maybe we should have another try.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:38:48	@bartontiger a bit
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:38:17	@bartontiger it's a funny mix. You should see my explanation via link on my bio. It's quite a to do. Oh well, nanight. Must bog off.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:36:39	@bartontiger he was. Crashed his car in army training in Mappleton, invalided out, compo chip shop,
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:35:05	Hooray, 22:30. K finally finished studying. It's been a lovely day, but I think that too many nice things make one a bit restless.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:32:11	@bartontiger nah. However grandad used to run a chippy in spivey Street. You know, in the 50s. 'for it got knocked down.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:28:40	@bartontiger
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:28:02	@bartontiger there are exactly two photos and no name. My village is like Hornsea sized. Without a mere, or a seaside, or Heron
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:24:04	@Durf @DaikanyamaGuy oh I. Oklahoma we always had pringles for breakfast.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:22:10	Thanks @JapanThis the room behind is the baby room we work in. She's just.. Well, you know.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:19:47	@bartontiger lol. Yeah, she's online shy, but I have one family member in Hornsea that I'd the only one that knows everything
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:10:48	@bartontiger it's not difficult I don't think. We've been together a while now though, best friends with extras. Like car-share :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:08:56	@bartontiger it's slowly moving through Japan, but for now, we are coworkers and co-inhabitants but special ones.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:06:58	@bartontiger marriage is a funny thing here. You can just walk to the local council office and registration is like filling out a tax form.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:05:16	@bartontiger by the way, well done on your Estonian pic.twitter.com/B8eCIrcASy
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:03:31	@bartontiger well it's legal in some places. We've chosen common law and exchanged rings and registration of abode. We're a bit unfussy
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 21:01:49	I could've been my proper name, but I didn't like the two aa of mikaadsila and I simply refuse to use an underscore pic.twitter.com/QEJsZRr18W
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 20:57:58	@sheepchase @JasonPackman I always have to turn NHK news up. Where they born in a library?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 20:56:44	"My wife doesn't understand me", is a phrase I can't imagine ever using. She gets me before I do.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 20:53:41	@NomuraKate I have some S n V pringles kept in a special place. Like diabetics and their Mars Bars
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 20:50:48	@NomuraKate funny when I felt rubbish I always went for salt n vinegar crisps. Maybe the sourness helps
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 20:49:37	@beingtokyo When it shines it burns, when it rains: swim
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 20:47:34	@NomuraKate overwork, feel like you're about to expire. Some patients develop めんどくさいたす

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 20:39:32	@AdsilaMika Encho : you two helped start it, so I want you two to keep it going. Rijicho: Mika, is there any coffee.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 20:37:49	Kaori is studying now. She wants to be in the office a bit more, while I'm going to be an instructor, to teach newbies nurse
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 20:34:35	You know, you won't have thought it this, but the onsen feels pretty weird for kaori and I.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 18:58:29	@mebehindadesk that's very sweet of you. I think I've had enough of being miserable now. And I have someone to share life with. And job!!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 18:45:31	K is not the age I was when I met her for the first time 34
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 18:21:41	@writersinjapan @zaichishka yes, us what can't get in in a right kerfuffle with it all
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 18:19:38	@zaichishka @writersinjapan I only came in to do the cleaning :(
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 18:17:56	@zaichishka @writersinjapan actually it says never leave. I wish I'd never entered this room. I want to get out

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 14:27:04	@sheepchase run up the stairs in a panic and pretend your being chased by sheep in a bond movie. Quick rush of adrenalin

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 13:08:57	@zaichishka @JapanThis coffee grounds and they're blue. Saitama is quite acid, lots of blue. But I also have a white one
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 13:08:02	@zaichishka @JapanThis I like the way you can alter the colors. I think alkaline soil (lime powder) makes them go red, and acid soil
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 12:34:27	@StSundae there out in force
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-25 12:33:06	@writersinjapan that's a classic. Next time say it in French. That's like moon-man language to the nutters.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 19:27:27	@YabaiKankei yeah, but I know I don't need it so I thought shit or bust. I've only been on it about 4 months. I think it ll be ok by Weds
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 19:04:08	@YabaiKankei ah, thanks, actually I was pleased to know that I made enough changes, so now the doc knows what's up
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:56:44	Yes it was a trifle warm today, but note that I had my cardigan on. Take care of yourself in the UV
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:29:30	@writersinjapan well hip hooray, you're on you're way
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:28:57	I just had one of those post Cymbalta brain zap things. Damn that really hurts.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:26:27	@tessastuart16 that's the spirit

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:24:55	@tessastuart16 yup, never rains, but it pours. This is all how your body reacts. Sometimes people don't react. St first
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:20:26	@tessastuart16 and whatever you do, Don't let the bastards grind you down.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:19:26	@tessastuart16 don't forget to do that. Look after your self. I've had a rough few times. So have others, but this is about you, not them.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:15:54	@tessastuart16 try protein shakes
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:13:56	@tessastuart16 denying your self food at this time, is a form of self harm. You know you need to eat
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:10:56	@tessastuart16 but don't get stuck in a cycle of self blame or harm
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:10:27	@tessastuart16 you must have been under a lot of pressure. However repulsive it is now, there will be a change. Fault is for the courts.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:06:40	@tessastuart16 are you tall? I'm 150cm 45kg. But if you're tall and that weight I feel a bit worried. Obvs don't go too far
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 18:01:10	@tessastuart16 as long as they're not bruised or broken, you've got enough
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 17:56:47	@TPsinghh @ozhypnotherapy ... Away
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 17:53:47	@Kuma neither do I, but I still get a whiff of it now and again

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 16:18:15	@tokyorich @SetagayaGirl lol. I was in adachi ku one summer and it was 40c. Then like 27c over night. Today is warm enough for me

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 12:56:37	@sfpodge I pay no attention to her. For that is what she craves.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 12:47:54	@sfpodge I am a lot better today. Thanks. I went 2 hell and back on Friday night. Poor Kaori. But better than being drugged up

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 12:14:27	You know, the more down the #celiac discovery road I get, the more I realise what I was unknowingly eating. Typical Japanese hotdog...

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 08:44:06	@cinnamaldehyde hmm. This has been a real eye opener for me. Yes we had to get an extra chopping board!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 08:40:52	@cinnamaldehyde I've lost weight without even trying even been jogging which I've never done
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 08:39:19	@cinnamaldehyde the funny thing is that coming off the meds feels a bit scary and I feel a bit sort of high, I guess
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 08:38:08	@cinnamaldehyde actually it's only been less than a month so I'm still kind of getting used to it all.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 08:36:09	@cinnamaldehyde I'm über lucid. I have a few DLE marks left to clear up but nothing new came

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 08:32:24	@cinnamaldehyde I just got to work. I've been in simply sleeping pills painkillers and anti depressents so long. Now I'm off all of them!!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-23 07:07:23	Have a nice day Japanese people, and everyone else of course

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 22:35:01	@JapanThis oh I know. The years of body language and fluttery eyelashes at K made me realise there's more to life than language :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 22:33:28	Once I have shot down celiac and kicked it's ass, and Im OK, then what.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 22:27:58	@JapanThis kaori is still better than my Japanese. It's why I look after the kids up to 3 yrs old. Then they start talking and I'm leaving
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 22:19:57	@JapanThis you want cup coffee? Yeah kaori does that. Tomorrow is too hot

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 21:58:20	When you wait yrs n yrs to b with some1 and so did they for you, then you live together & u think I could have been with you so much longer
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 21:53:59	@ozAntinnippon I want to be 'KEY GRIP' I bet that has to be more exciting than just keeping tight of meryll streep's keys, right. RIGHT?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 21:50:33	Never cared for half of what that bastard doc said I can't eat. Sure yeah, I'm OK, you damn gluten pinching piggy. Seriously #glutenfree ok
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 21:44:01	@Kuma there's one man in the place. The 理事長. He's always pretty sweet to all the ladies. It's like woman land for him. 40 vs 1

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 21:04:11	If you could just say, "I love you, now we are married" and it happens, that'd be great. But you know, Japan; paper work, waiting.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 15:28:11	@sheepchase just for the record, I had a most splendid vespa in UK. It was a real lovely egg shell blue colour. Oh, those summer nights

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 13:32:23	@gegallas don't get the food mixed up. Those cat biscuits smell like fish food, but they just float on the tank.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 13:29:40	@000gun lucky I live near plenty of cheap veg fruit and rice. Otherwise it really would be an expensive illness

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 13:20:19	A gluten free life hurts much less than the pain it. Anyone with #celiac or #gluten issues, please reach out to me and tell me it's okay

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 10:15:19	事実婚（じじつこん) とは、婚姻事実関係一般を意味する概念「事実婚」の概念は多義的に用いられ婚姻の成立方式としての「事実婚は「無式婚」ともいい要式婚（形式婚）と対置される概念であるが、通常、日本では「事実婚」は法律婚（届出婚）に対する概念として用いられている
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 09:59:04	@AdsilaMika I think it just makes us officially a couple, registered at the same dwelling and don't have to pay for things separately
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 09:57:52	事実婚（じじつこん）or common law married is what K I have started I suppose. But it's far too complicated for me to get my head around.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 09:56:05	@riinroo thanks. I'm glad to see you too. I can't give up everything!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-22 09:33:25	@AdsilaMika but kaori took me shopping and found so many new things I can eat. And I feel better now. Sorry to have been a drama-llama

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-14 20:50:42	I'm quite worried about jimmy. He's 18 months old and looking terribly frail. pic.twitter.com/7IGw8iSh8U

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-14 20:47:51	My actual name is mikaadsila. But perhaps Ocd really didn't like the double 'a' bit in the middle.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-14 20:44:49	@Kuma snogging is fun and we should all make it a part of our daily lives. Go on, grab a granny or appropriate loved one.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-14 20:41:40	@Kuma ah youre that snogger bloke my in law tells me about. She lives in sapporo and she gave us her car. My feisty Tanto

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-14 17:18:23	@RekishinoTabi somethings just need to be scoffed NOW
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-14 17:14:13	@rich_yorks I agree natto is nice with so many things.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-14 17:13:07	@RekishinoTabi funny thing is that after I toasted them to a warm crisp slightly darker brown, we ate them before I got a photo
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-14 17:10:38	@RekishinoTabi these are truly delicious

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-13 23:16:38	And so to sleep. It's not about sex, it's about having a loving hand to hold until morning.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-13 23:13:21	@LKP48 @cowmask I think it's going to grow back ok. Not sure if wobbly or normal yet. I did the same at 4yrs old the nail is OK but thicker

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-05-13 21:26:36	@noriiwa I know, It's very surprising because the population is falling in Japan. This is a new place, I was there from opening day :)

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-27 18:09:17	@writersinjapan thanks. I suddenly want to show the world. That's love, I guess.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-27 18:08:34	@writersinjapan I'm very excited. I mean we've been friends so long. And we know how we feel. But she is more confident. I'm a bit quiet!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-27 18:07:15	@AdsilaMika it raises many questions
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-27 18:05:20	My lady friend, whom I shall call K. from now on said she wants to come and help plant the seeds on Friday in the allotment.I'm all a quiver
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-27 17:37:06	@noriiwa I had one when they first came out. But I got fed up of it after a few weeks
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-27 17:29:42	@Mr_Landshark @StumbleUpon I only knew tine and interrobang
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-27 17:23:43	I like the old fashioned way of things. I don't have a suica card. When I buy my train tickets I always end up behind someone recharging
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-27 17:21:46	@Mr_Landshark oh I'm feeling spritely and stood on the train

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-26 21:34:05	@NomuraKate Ironed a hat yesterday. After wiping the dust off the ironing board
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-26 21:14:18	@NomuraKate the clothes I wear require less ironing. Slips, vests, and sporty teacher clothes, with a teacher apron on top
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-26 21:06:56	@Crowdfire handy app. Keeps my numbers in. Balance.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-26 20:43:14	@NomuraKate I only to ironing for weddings or funerals. My grandmother used to iron socks. She had an ironing fetish
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-26 20:30:59	@FitFudge or my favorite, sesame oil, soy sauce and a bit of sugar. I understand your craving. I love it, too. pic.twitter.com/X2AXcHbdvC
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-26 20:27:48	@FitFudge I grow that. It's good in veg curry, and also blanched, mix with soy sauce, vinegar and boning flakes

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-26 18:12:34	Before when 'we' went home it was a very polite "see you tomorrow" now it's the same line, but with barely uncontainable glee added.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-04-26 18:08:13	Well that was a very smily day for me and my lady friend. Pity it wasn't the same for the person that has stopped the trains running RIP

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-02-20 04:54:29	@noriiwa no sir, you are a silver citizen, using your brain to its fullest capacity! I am in Japan by chance. My grandmother's home.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2016-02-20 04:45:23	@noriiwa hmm. It's like this, I can understand and read Japanese. My お返事 level is low. I am 四分の一日本人. But it's hard work!!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-08-31 23:45:50	@redsnapperuk oh quite so, I found it similar to watered down soap.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-08-31 23:44:45	@redsnapperuk lapsang souchong is like tar infused rope. All the teas of Asia don't compare to tetleys

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-08-31 23:42:06	@redsnapperuk cocos infusion sounds somehow quinntisencially British!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-08-31 23:40:54	@redsnapperuk oh yes I have a lot of grated ginger tea. I recently got persimmon leaf tea as well. Local shops quite exotic!! Next box
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-08-31 23:34:10	@redsnapperuk My current box of tea is Gingko Biloba leaf. Though anything suits, other than fruit teas
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-08-31 23:33:09	@redsnapperuk there's lots of macadamia nut stuff here.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-28 17:42:23	My kidney biopsy results show there's a bit of damage. Not to bad, blood flow a bit weak. Eat very sensible
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-28 17:25:29	@redsnapperuk @SparklesWoo oh you guys. The Dr recommended I try paleo/gluten free to help with the lupus. More research!!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-27 18:37:28	@SparklesWoo it was slightly anti histamine induced but that'll do
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-27 18:36:42	@SparklesWoo it's a steam in the inside train

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-27 17:09:57	@TheHappyG one massive Violet, and a sandpit. You'll get paid a fortune
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-27 17:08:33	@luannesorrell @MyFoxOrlando #depression takes hold. On some the grip is tighter. #BobbiKristina
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-27 17:02:41	@guardian looks terrible
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-27 17:02:01	@au_somemum thank you. I'll just have to keep hoping!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-27 16:59:07	@au_somemum no ma'am. I have people in place. I'd have been alerted, interfrastically.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-27 16:56:28	@au_somemum I know where they'll be. Hull Daily Mail or Holderness Gazette!

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-26 15:29:14	@builtbysabus @FoxNews no news affects us. But to be human is to wish to know.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-26 15:25:55	@HuffingtonPost haha. I have asperger's. I so get those "can't come" days.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 15:34:30	@SparklesWoo it was hot!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 15:34:02	@SparklesWoo not sure what does it. I have one med for stopping the stomach wobbles, and it's likes Coal tar soap. Quite queer.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 15:32:15	@IainPoole that's nice. Reminds me of the back of the mere.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 15:30:31	@SparklesWoo hey, my multi minerals smell icky as well. Like hot rocks with wee on.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 15:28:32	@Daily_Star good luck, well done. All white people with brown hair do not look the same.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 09:49:32	@PeerAbuse @electroboyusa and when the nail bullies are your parents, it's more difficult to get away
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:26:17	@au_somemum she's me with a wig on
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:22:33	@msnbc ban guns. That's part of everything you could do.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:21:41	@PeerAbuse @electroboyusa I was bullied. It felt like a fight to me. I had a fight, be it physical or mental, each day.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:20:11	@PeerAbuse @electroboyusa point is, original tweet is basically nonsensical. Like so many of these motivational tweets.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:16:26	@PeerAbuse @electroboyusa America can't lose. So, they ain't fighting.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:14:41	@BiggieSmalley cats are nice. Until you wanna play ball
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:13:37	@nytimes yay
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:12:55	@au_somemum yes. I always liked to be away too. I used to sleep in a cupboard to be away. It's still early. Sleep eull come
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:09:59	@Brdges2Recovery @electroboyusa we need the MAJORITY to be aware.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:08:33	@au_somemum oh she's the away-one.... Bugger
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:05:58	@au_somemum read them a story. Or make one up. I do :)
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:04:49	@jakeadelstein @ForeignPolicy he still got his paper-point across. However, I hope he's not going to be in power much longer. #dislike
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:02:06	@electroboyusa @PeerAbuse America is bullying in Syria then?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 06:00:46	@ForeignPolicy @jakeadelstein that's just being silly. You all thought he was going to use a real house, light it, and get real firemen!?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 05:55:34	@au_somemum illness inside, and the 3 kids be out :)

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-25 05:46:28	I have to avoid coffee. At the same time, I've kinda got sick of coffee. I've never loved you, coffee. Now, go. pic.twitter.com/gXD543E77B

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 21:58:12	@darkmatterof nothing to do with you.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 19:43:14	@TheSun nice. Well done, chuck

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 18:00:04	@SparklesWoo yup
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 17:56:30	@SparklesWoo I think some of the seniors on it carried away with the excitement of it
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 17:50:08	@SparklesWoo true. There's no need for it or them. Especially them that flirt all the time, and get too familiar with folk. Makes it awkward
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 17:46:52	@SparklesWoo and people fancying their chances with the ladies.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 17:46:08	@SparklesWoo it's the reason g is losing users or not getting new members. Too many know-alls.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 17:41:49	@SparklesWoo it's nobody you know IRL, right. So... Whatever.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 17:38:30	@SparklesWoo I shall make up my own imagined scenario!!
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 17:33:53	@TimeOutTokyo that would be a tax beef- und
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 17:27:44	@SparklesWoo hmm. Intriguifying
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 17:24:50	@Daily_Express what a pathetic story to run.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 16:43:33	@SparklesWoo looks better than a bowl of chicken nuggets and butter. Lol. Looks very tasty, actually
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 16:42:01	@guardian but bob's words are easier to follow. Quality not Quantity
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 16:40:31	@hull_libraries you've actually done what radio humberside won't.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 16:31:17	@ProspectCentre @Poundland you could make it even more fitting if I could get them in a pack that said, "a quarter" on it
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 16:29:48	The words I'm sick of reading online are: 'The moment.'
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-07-23 16:25:17	@five_in_tokyo oh yes. He's all smoke and mirrors and dark side. But he ain't got all the best robots in his monster truck #starwars

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-06-09 13:36:47	@Bob44444Bob true, that sir. It's crazy how the world "knows more" than the officers on duty. This kind of sharing should be illegal
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-06-09 13:34:07	@SkyNews how often did Gazza strip!!?
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-06-09 13:32:20	@Bob44444Bob *In site *= it's also true
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-06-09 13:31:04	@Bob44444Bob In site that social media makes it all much worse. People often share a clip, not the whole thing. Then the world jumps on it.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-06-09 13:10:08	I respect the law but the law seems to have forgotten to respect citizens #PoliceBrutality
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-06-09 12:49:30	@Bob44444Bob are you one of the cops on duty? What I meant was, handcuffs are surely better.Shouting at ppl to sit down makes ppl retaliate
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-06-09 12:44:19	@Bob44444Bob that's not sarcasm.
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-06-09 09:22:37	@Bob44444Bob In the old days, an officer could hand cuff a delinquent. No need for control and restraint at this level.

2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-04-20 19:36:51	@BBCBreaking maybe it's better that staying home. Which adds to the tradgedy
2820004866	AdsilaMika	2015-04-20 19:30:49	@jaketapper so many lives wasted maybe. But that's not the only evidence. Still, utterly abominable, nonetheless.
