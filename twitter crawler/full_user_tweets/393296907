393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-19 13:07:03	@swanners1 yes when I was unemployed back in the 80s I did volunteer wk and short courses. I'm sure it helped me get a job

393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-19 13:02:33	@swanners1 I agree. Ppl shld work where they can even for benefits as long as they r capable
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-19 12:59:40	@MikeGargett I like that
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-19 12:59:03	Good afternoon all any one have any interesting news?
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-19 12:58:05	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr that's called having an enquiring mind. And it's one version of the cockroach ditty.
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-19 12:27:13	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr like the Kalahari Bushmen. But dialects r the beginning of new languages. Like Gidday in Aussie.
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-19 12:26:00	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr most words start as mispronunciations I think. The 1st languages are summonsed to have been clicking languages..
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-19 12:24:14	@bullfrogr @joyce_psycho r u thinking abt the Mexican song La Cucaracha? The cockroach who cldnt walk for lack of Marijauna?
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 13:58:32	@GingerlyRobin @bullfrogr @joyce_psycho @bipolarblogger @owl615 hallelujah
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 13:58:07	@bullfrogr @joyce_psycho the human kind are. Just keep mutating gals
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 13:57:09	@bullfrogr @joyce_psycho really what a coincidence:)
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 13:56:29	@bullfrogr @joyce_psycho true but I still hate then!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 10:22:05	@joyce_psycho @gingerlyrobin @bipolarblogger @bullfrogr @owl615 I kinda like the idea of being a mutant though!!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 06:53:36	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr yes I agree. I hate it when ppl attack them. Ppl are the culprits not snakes
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 06:52:26	@GingerlyRobin @joyce_psycho @bipolarblogger @bullfrogr @owl615 I must b a mutation. I have no innate desire to clean. I do the minimum
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 06:52:04	@Owl615 generally:)
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 06:49:41	@GingerlyRobin @bipolarblogger @bullfrogr @joyce_psycho @owl615 :)
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 06:49:21	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr they eat the bugs that get inside. I had one in my laundry 'Gertrude' . She lived there a long time
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 06:47:38	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr spiders have an undeserved reputation. Even he poisonous will run rather than bite u.
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 06:45:29	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr I hate the little ones hat get in food particularly porridge they r disgusting. I have moth traps but still
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-18 06:44:02	@bullfrogr @joyce_psycho ad long ad u respect snakes u have no need to fear them. It's ppl who disturb them who create problems
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 18:13:41	@Owl615 that is all they do talk! Hahaha
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 18:13:02	@GingerlyRobin @bipolarblogger @bullfrogr @joyce_psycho @owl615 sorry but that must b a man thing:)
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 18:12:34	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr the local indigenous ppl's used to feast on them in big tribal gatherings on the Bogong high plains hence the bane
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 18:11:34	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr they're kind of cute. I think they bring good luck. Here now we have enormous moths call Bogong moths.
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 18:10:20	@bullfrogr @joyce_psycho fortunately they don't do that. I have had a big black spider fall on me in the shower tho...
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 14:04:45	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr I don't like killing spiders they eat the pantry moths which get into the drygoods. My house is a menagerie!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 14:03:34	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr they r a type of black widow very poisonous. Fortunate they don't tend to come indoors. Wear gloves in the garden
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 14:02:34	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr I have cockroaches sometimes they're big black native ones not the yucky brown buggers. We have ted a k spidwrs
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 13:44:54	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr mwa ha ha ha . It was the thought of rubbing dust my little dust devils:)
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 13:43:46	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr yes I had the same experience a few wks ago. I don't know what species though
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 13:25:43	@bullfrogr @joyce_psycho with white gloves or rubber? Fiendish chuckle:)))
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 13:24:31	@joyce_psycho still lots to do. But it doesn't take all of Saturday. I have a very untidy partner and daughter

393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 13:15:57	@joyce_psycho yes I shldnt complain things have been so much worse . Ian a silent diva
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 13:14:03	@joyce_psycho I have this theory that after a time the dust won't get any thicker. But the truth is I have cleaners in every fortnight
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 13:10:58	@Owl615 @joyce_psycho @bullfrogr @bipolarblogger I prefer to work outside in the garden.
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 13:10:06	@Owl615 oh la la
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 13:09:47	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr @bipolarblogger @owl615 yeah it's rather scary isn't it? We must snap out of it!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 13:08:43	@joyce_psycho I do too. Not sure if its the Seroquel or just bored with life

393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 12:55:03	@joyce_psycho @bipolarblogger @bullfrogr @owl615
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 12:54:36	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr @bipolarblogger @owl615 a sure sign of impending sanity:)
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 12:54:10	@joyce_psycho @bipolarblogger @bullfrogr @owl615 brooms r kinda easier in some ways. U don't have the lug he fuckers around!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 12:52:59	@bullfrogr @joyce_psycho @bipolarblogger @owl615 the first thing I did when I bought my house was pull up the carpet. I have rugs now
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 12:51:01	@BipolarBlogger @bullfrogr @joyce_psycho @owl615 vacuuming was invented to demoralise women
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 12:49:52	U know what they say about ppl who talk abt sex:(
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-17 12:49:24	@joyce_psycho @bullfrogr @owl615 @bipolarblogger I wish!

393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-03 20:50:46	@Thewayimfeelin I'm ok thxs lovie:) just starting back to work after 5 wks leave.
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-03 08:26:08	@Thewayimfeelin some of us r listening hun xx
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-03 08:22:45	Sometime in the last week I sent my 10K tweet and I didn't even notice. Should there b fireworks or something?
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-03 08:18:40	@bullfrogr that takes courage and determination. Ultimately we r all responsible for our weaknesses and faults. Only u can make a difference
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-03 08:16:56	@bullfrogr I've been quite successful in resisting the urge to gamble lately which is a huge relief!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-02 13:46:00	Addiction is a complex phenomenon there's no easy solution but self help is a key ingredient
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-02 13:44:48	@bullfrogr I have an awful feeling I am just one doing it legally. And gambling is another weakness I am overcoming .
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-02 13:43:21	@bullfrogr it's try addiction dare our own responsibility to overcome. I take drugs which I am prescribed which I depend on. Am I an addict?
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-02 13:35:31	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns yes u can then imagine anything!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-02 13:34:42	@bullfrogr I only give praise where it's due Hun
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-02 11:35:31	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns omg it might have the most profound tweet of all time! What a waste!!! Hahaha
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-02 11:34:22	@bullfrogr you are! And just downright too talented. Even if you don't realise it , it is obvious to me u will survive. Xx
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-02 11:32:36	@MrsTeepot good luck! Knitting is very soothing I find . Although all I can do is knit knit isn't:) I can't cast on or off. No skill
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-01 17:50:38	@MrsTeepot my mother refused to teache how to knit. She the didn't have enough Valium!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-01 17:43:38	Back to work today hohum
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-01 17:35:15	@bullfrogr @owl615 interesting:)
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-01 17:33:05	@Owl615 @bullfrogr cool that excellent news
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-01 17:32:32	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns dunno
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-01 17:31:59	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns that's good!!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-02-01 17:31:27	@bullfrogr I think u r safe from that fate darling xx
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-31 20:20:17	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-31 20:19:57	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns ur mind plays cruel tricks but knowing that is a start. I am sure that it is the way to recovery. It ain't easy
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-31 20:18:41	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns but if u know its wrong can I keep your conceptions in juxtaposition. How u feel and what uk ow to b true
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-31 20:17:17	@bullfrogr not gone
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-31 20:17:10	@bullfrogr that's where acceptance comes in play. The fear of reality is fear of fear. If u can accept it it looses much power. It is less..
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-30 12:55:15	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns true!:)
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-30 09:38:49	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns lots of ppl r under hat misconception and they r not mentally ill. It's often 50/50 if its true or not.
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-30 09:37:36	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns just try to notice ur perceptions without fighting them. Is that any worse than thinking ppl r bitching abt u?..
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-30 09:35:58	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns therapy and healing is not a one-size fits all program. Take the best of what's available for u xx
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-30 09:34:09	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns our minds can play cruel tricks but we need to remember its out R thoughts and feelings not necessarily reality
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-30 09:32:36	@bullfrogr yes it's about accepting the feelings if possible with a sense of curiosity and letting them ebb and flow w/out fear.
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-30 09:30:48	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns your suggestion to put my head in the fridge that WAS hilarious!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-30 09:30:16	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns u r very wwicked my dear but in a good. U have a starling perspective sometimes: eg if I want a cold Xmas...
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:32:56	@MiggyMoonbeam thxs :))
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:32:02	Oh dear I sound well too philosophical tonight. Settle down girl!!!!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:31:16	I always feel bad abt complaining when I read abt disasters how easy my life is in comparison I feel humbled by ppl's courage
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:29:06	Every day u wake and get on with ur life is defeating pessimism and depression. It's all about self belief. It's not a cure but it helps xx
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:26:34	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns hellooo!! Only the best ppl r on twitter. It our own Mad Hatters party!!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:25:14	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns yes it's hard and frustrating too but if u cld do it once it just can't be beyond our reach xx
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:24:11	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns there is a path that's right for u. Being afraid of bad feelings will destroy u. S/times surrender is victory
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:22:44	@bullfrogr sometimes it takes kind faith to know it can b better or u can cope with distressing feelings. That's hard living they crap but..
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:21:21	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns no u help me u make me laugh with ur wicked humour. I laugh I live !!
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:20:03	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns r traitors
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:19:54	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns yes support is good. It's not always easy to remember there's a life worth striving for.some pols brains ...
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:18:32	@MorrisseyGlennS @bullfrogr sometimes mh is a prison though. It's not always easy to have faith in reality when ur head is screaming
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 21:17:13	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns thinking right takes a shit load of practice. It's finding what works for u that's the key
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-29 08:37:44	@bullfrogr @morrisseyglenns ah but u have ur youth that's counts for a lot. Xx

393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-19 16:35:32	@bullfrogr hmm I loved 'the slave' by Isac Singer. I found it very moving. But that was a long time ago. My favourite poet is Blake

393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-19 16:02:21	@bullfrogr yes I think it was 'cause I recall recommending it. That's a book that's hard to put down.
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-19 16:01:24	@bullfrogr my l parents gave a Kindle for Christmas. I love it and its so easy to get books. Plus I can adjust the font which is a godsend

393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-19 15:31:16	@bullfrogr why b ashamed? See it as some new discovery.
393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-19 15:30:01	@misguidedmuser is t it so annoying and often sleazy too. I block all the time

393296907	garbosmc	2013-01-15 09:38:08	@bullfrogr @owl615 twitter is outside time and space. I'm sure there's something in that.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-29 14:08:23	@bullfrogr @deborahbarnum no I run better now:) I gained a modicum of courage. Maybe familiarity with anxiety has bred contempt:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-29 14:07:03	@DeborahBarnum ambition is a good thing but so is patience. It's often ant learning to tolerate distress . Fear of anxiety makes it worse
393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-29 14:05:42	@Owl615 @bullfrogr @swanners1 and fair enough
393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-29 14:04:19	@Owl615 @bullfrogr @swanners1 it's endemic to the industry. I'm glad my ode is in private practice and my insurance covers some $

393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-23 12:01:23	@pinguinokx @releasinglunacy I have to agree hat it's one more sweet thing my waist line can do without:)

393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-21 19:27:33	@thislyricisit @imtheq I cld go ad nauseum abt the treatment of women but calling every man a misogynist adds no value to a discussion
393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-21 19:26:35	@thislyricisit so did the pope. U just don't get do u? No one shld throw around that sort of accusation to stifle genuine discussion. ...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-21 11:57:14	@ImTheQ @thislyricisit and that doesn't give either party cart Blanche to the moral high ground. War is a dirty busy
393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-21 11:56:16	@ImTheQ @thislyricisit the anti Semite card gets dealt well too easily. It is not anti Semitic to disapprove of violence and oppression...

393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-11 11:22:19	@Owl615 @bullfrogr ur hunk it might do more harm than good. I really don't know how some ppl can live with themselves really. They r evil

393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-11 11:12:52	@bullfrogr I really believe that's how change begins
393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-11 11:12:30	@bullfrogr true! But even a bad experience can kick start internal change. It's. Wry hard to challenge ur world view on ur own. ...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-11 11:10:43	@bullfrogr ha or they're dull and randy eh ha!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-11 11:09:42	@bullfrogr @owl615 no one can possibly calculate the damage done to a bullied chile. I s/ times think of suing my old school but it's futile

393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-10 15:57:33	@BarbieBites I think that's a good idea tbh. I'm old fashioned and value privacy. U can show less on twitter but still enjoy the 'company!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-11-10 15:20:51	@BarbieBites @k_is4kellies Facebook is way too public for me. I can't believe ppl who post pics drunk or out of it. They're up for keeps

393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-04 13:35:29	@GingerlyRobin @bullfrogr so I just cldnt give it up completely.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-04 13:35:09	@GingerlyRobin @bullfrogr the trick for me is not to over indulge and have decent periods where I don't drink alcohol. But I love wine...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-04 09:01:37	@bullfrogr @gingerlyrobin I don't feel the urge to drink as much. Anti- DS used to increase the impulse to drink. Glad to b off them
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-04 09:00:40	@bullfrogr @gingerlyrobin yes I feel great while drinking but pretty ratty down and anxious if I drink too much. On current meds ...

393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 19:55:04	@pinguinokx it is! I can't give up wine but I have cut back now I'm on antipsychotic and off anti DS. They made me drink and manic
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 19:53:15	@davesleney oh yeah I go from totally depressed and anxious in the am and normal bot high in the evenings
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 18:39:27	@misguidedmuser that's frightening. I have only been to private clinics. Iv been told by mh profs that the public system is too dangerous!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 18:23:22	@misguidedmuser I knew it was somewhere up there. Lucky escape!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 18:21:42	@misguidedmuser wasn't Rockhampton where that Indian dr wkd
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 17:50:15	@misguidedmuser now it's evening I'm feeling high again sort of restless and edgy. They don't tell u that anti- DS can 'wear off' but theydo
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 17:48:48	@misguidedmuser well since they have sacked 2500 workers from QLD. Health system that should Come as no surprise xx

393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 13:15:37	@pinguinokx r u drinking a lot. I drank 3 days in a row. Not getting drunk just a few glasses. I love it but I notice it pulls u down after
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 13:14:05	@misguidedmuser r u wkg or does yr son rewire a carer?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 13:13:35	@misguidedmuser my dr wants me on Lithium.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 13:13:19	@misguidedmuser what r y on now? I'm just on Seroquel 550mg. It helps but doesn't eradicate the morning anxiety. Keeps it from being PAs
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 09:49:18	@pinguinokx if I didn't have my family id drink myself to death:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 09:48:21	@misguidedmuser thxs xx I feel such angst over nothing. At the moment I can't see a way forward.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 09:36:25	I feel like I am trapped in a recurring nightmare of up and down that will never stop
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 09:35:41	Beautiful warm sunny day and my daughter and I are going out with friends to cafe and park. Great day ahead so why do I feel so anxious?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 07:26:31	@bullfrogr @swanners1 yes I agree. The ability to express emotion
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-03 07:25:31	@pinguinokx yes I know the mania is tempting. Just I find it doesn't last
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-02 21:42:45	@pinguinokx the horrible restlessness where u can't relax. Maybe a mixed episode
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-02 21:12:37	@swanners1 that's unusual for a boy u e lucky Lisa tot have such a sensitive and loving son xx
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-02 12:27:30	@DanieTreg it's. Ice to know there r others in Melbourne who like minded:)

393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-02 09:29:53	@bullfrogr waking up is a bad dream. I felt so high last night and then wake up in a lather of anxiety is terrible. Really hard
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-02 09:28:12	@FNCrazy77 yep. Feel quite calm now. Neat every morning. Took some Seroquel that helps.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-01 21:49:22	@bullfrogr I went for a job and just missed out:( its frustrating I know xx
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-01 21:47:32	The show I saw struck me as finding 'evidence' bc he wanted to. So it lacked credibility
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-01 21:46:32	@Mich_568 Done. My friends swears his house was haunted due to a botched séance and his story is collaborated by others. Still the guy in
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-01 21:44:31	Don't if the clergyman was Catholic but there are religious person even from mainstream churches who do exorcisms. I have friends who had 1
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-01 19:19:45	It really worries me when cp priests start exorcising demons from ppl. A lot of ppk get hurt or killed during unruly exorcisms
393296907	garbosmc	2012-10-01 19:17:34	There is the most ridiculous show abt ghosts on SBS tonight. Honestly ppl will believe anything!

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-24 14:50:14	@Owl615 the roof almost caved in from the enormous weight of the honey.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-24 14:49:30	@Owl615 yeah I am terrified of stinging insects! Bees, wasps.... Don't think we have hornets here. My nana had bees in her roof...

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-21 21:18:26	@swanners272 Hi Lisa how r u? Ur new Ava looks sad. How is ur new therapy going?

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-21 14:15:25	@BipolarBimbo have u tried looking on their website. Sometimes pharm cos. provide a number on their drug information sheets.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-21 13:56:37	@HealingFromBPD nice sentiment:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-21 13:30:55	@bullfrogr that's a healthy attitude. I guess being in an office accentuates my feelings of inadequacy.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-21 13:29:46	@bullfrogr Wei wld think teaching is very demanding. U have to b alert & interactive the whole time. Fi u find twitter is honing ur English?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-21 07:29:33	Good morning all:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-21 07:28:55	@bullfrogr I feel like everyone can c how useless I am or they just dob't like. The paranoia is uncomforta ly at the moment
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-21 07:27:39	@bullfrogr I had a job interview yesterday I was a hopeless waffler.:( I agree ppk can b exhausting 4 me too. Still have to make an effort

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-20 09:01:11	@bullfrogr yes let's be thankful for small mercies
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-19 18:42:52	@bullfrogr yeAh I live in a city of 4 million even if 0.1 are homicidal maniacs that's still 4,000 ppl!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-19 11:14:24	@bullfrogr they give me waking nightmares. I don't enjoy any sort of adrenalin rush. In constantly alert and alarmed anyway:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-19 11:13:15	@bullfrogr ur children make u bond. S/times I feel strongly that I need to there. Other times it feels too stressful. The effort is good
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-19 10:59:43	Just upgraded my tweet app. I like the new features
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-19 06:10:01	@bullfrogr oh dear! I NEVER watch horror films I'm too easily scared.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-19 06:06:06	@bullfrogr or child either. But I do need my space sometimes - just to b alone.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 21:51:11	@bullfrogr I know hat feeling on the outside looking in. I always feel separate and false in company like a puppet
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 21:13:48	Anybody know some good jokes I need a laugh!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 21:12:44	I think I'm having a weird mixed episode I'm sorta high but anxious an emotional oxymoron.....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 21:11:02	Oh dear and the typos! Pun s is what's I be meaning lol
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 20:38:39	@bullfrogr except the sort communication u want on ur terms?

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 16:11:45	Rain rain rain it's wet and freezing. Thank goodness in getting a lift gone from my partner bless him:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 13:31:40	@bullfrogr it's the structure it provides that helps me.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 13:30:47	@Owl615 so true. Without humor life can very dull
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 09:48:47	@Owl615 hehehe. Good to have laugh hun!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 07:28:02	Good morning all:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 07:27:40	@bullfrogr no and yes many jobs r dull. I'm afraid if j stopped wkg I wld just stay in bed and never get up. Work is discipline 4 me.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 07:25:29	@bullfrogr @youtube haha I wonder what she popped poor soul
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-18 07:21:16	@Owl615 now now I thought of worse - something to do with wind- but I restrained myself. Xx
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-17 22:47:13	@bullfrogr but I'm not challenged by the work I am doing and I find that stressful as too much wk. oh well guess in never satisfied:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-17 22:46:06	@bullfrogr I had no choice I went out on 4 months sick leave. I had a graduated return to work. Work has been pretty good abt it..,

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-17 16:29:49	@Carregonnen now rhat's a worry. Maybe god created evil to gain more attention! After all bad behaviour is always rewarded!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-17 16:24:50	@Owl615 :) does that make it a bad break?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-17 12:19:51	@bullfrogr yes job satisfaction is important.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-17 12:18:52	@bullfrogr every day
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-17 12:18:40	@bullfrogr when I don't have enough to do. My boss knows abt my illness. Not if he is Mollycoddling me or just doesn't me. I wake up anxious
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-17 11:37:51	@bullfrogr meaning I shldnt wish my life away like that. So I'm actively looking for another job.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-17 11:36:36	@bullfrogr me too! I used to like my work but now I yearn for retirement. That is a little under 6 years away. I might as well wish to die
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-17 10:46:43	@oxymoronic82 @cashis4life such modesty only adds to ur charms:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-17 10:46:07	@Carregonnen :( too true

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 14:14:17	@Owl615 @dangerturtle @swanners272 @dhanoka well hello u gorgeous dame!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 14:14:16	@GingerlyRobin @bullfrogr @bipolarvoice psych was a real wacko. What a waste of $.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 14:14:16	@GingerlyRobin @bullfrogr @bipolarvoice yes I agree! And especially when ppl r really vulnerable when the illness is acute. My 1st....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 14:14:16	@sparklepanda r u still living there. It literally sounds like a house of cards! Termites r the Devil's spawn

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 14:05:25	@bipolarvoice yes living with urself is a 24\7 gig. I think that's why so many pol seek to escape thru substance abuse and SH
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 14:04:52	@bullfrogr @bipolarvoice it is easier out here if u have mh issues I think. Many high profile ppl have spoken out abt their mental issues
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 14:04:52	@bullfrogr bipolar I thought u hated ur friends or is that when u r feeling down?

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 13:48:26	@bipolarvoice yes it might help stem the severity of the illness. I know mine has got worse from lack of proper treatment.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 13:47:54	@bullfrogr I like spiders I had one bug fat black one in my laundry I call Gertrude. She ate all the moths that ate my ckothes
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 13:47:54	@bullfrogr I meant like u had a man to fuck u better to put it crudely. Just screwed up thinking by the ' helping profession'
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 09:52:38	@bipolarvoice yes If there was less stigma it wld encourage pol to seek treatment. It wld save a kit of lives.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 09:50:41	@santa2ndfl hi :) is it morning where u r? Unfortunately most ppl r asleep when I wake up!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 08:24:40	@bipolarvoice but earlier it was hushed up. And my mother told me she thought my neice was 'putting it on' to get her mother's attention.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 08:23:06	@bipolarvoice not really everyone is treated as a one-off. I think my neice's illness made some members confront mh....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 08:21:44	@oxymoronic82 did u make it?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 08:21:11	@sparklepanda yes there an infestation 2 doors down from us. They were attracted by my leaky shower. Chomped on half a doorframe. Hate 'rm!

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 08:16:38	@bullfrogr that's ridiculous. What did they think? U weren't gettting enough (nudge nudge)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 08:14:57	@bullfrogr @bipolarvoice of course it wld b hard
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 07:27:32	@polarbirdie @painintopeace In the morni gs I rave sleep but when it's time to sleep I'm full of beans. I find that frustrating.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 00:12:18	@bullfrogr @gingerlyrobin @bipolarvoice I think a lot of mh profs take up the profession to find out what is wrong with themselves
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-07 00:11:18	@bullfrogr @gingerlyrobin @bipolarvoice nicely put!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-06 23:33:03	@GingerlyRobin @bullfrogr @bipolarvoice I think a fair few of them do! They just lack insight:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-06 23:21:13	@bullfrogr @bipolarvoice yes I gather Russia is very unenlightened from what u have told me.. Move over here u cld teach Russian !;) xx

393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-06 22:57:08	@bipolarvoice it was a skeleton(s) in many families. My mother' s family is/ was riddled with m illness. I'm just one in a long line...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-06 22:54:28	@GingerlyRobin I'm good by the way. Apart from a damned Lamictal rash. My GP said if I start getting breathless go straight to HOSP gr8!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-06 22:53:02	@GingerlyRobin @bipolarvoice we're just a pack of hoons not loons ( with shotguns)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-06 22:52:13	@GingerlyRobin too right. My bro in law is American and he used to be VERY paranoid abt ppl when he first came to Oz. now he knows ...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-06 22:29:23	@bipolarvoice that was 'therapy' and it was all hushed up. The silence on MH eventually cost her her life:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-06 22:27:57	@bipolarvoice my g:mother attempted suicide in the early 60s. They put her in an assylums and made her get up at 6 am to scrub floors...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-06 22:26:45	@bipolarvoice clearly the plane hijackings of the 70s, Ira bombings and red brigade in Italy just didn't count
393296907	garbosmc	2012-09-06 22:17:12	@bipolarvoice well it's a bit like the US talking abt the war in terrorism as if it didn't exist b4 9\11.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-28 07:14:09	@bullfrogr absolutely. Being completely blind wld be terrible especially if u had sight before. If u r born that I guess it's not that bad
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-28 07:12:04	@bullfrogr yes that's right u have. Good if u can manage ob mild meds:)

393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-27 22:18:34	@bullfrogr the intervals between episodes became shorter. I am resigned to a lifetime of meds now but NEVER any depressant again!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-27 22:17:18	@bullfrogr in some ways I just get very agitated and paranoid and guilt ridden off meds. I tried so many times to stay off meds but...

393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 23:57:24	@sparklepanda I hope they create an Amazonian jungle scene that would spectacular
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 23:56:46	@sparklepanda yes! But I thought the Rio 'taster' was cleverly done. I feel they gave the flavor but kept their tinder dry...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 23:55:12	@sparklepanda I thought Roger Daltry sang well for his age. And the tribute to Freddy M brought tears to my eyes:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 23:53:27	@sparklepanda yes they were excellent. I'm not upset the Stones weren't there. They're well past their use by date IMO
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 23:43:12	Hey just finished watching the closing ceremony LOVED it! Notable absence the Stones I thought. Unless they appear in the opening?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 23:41:33	@bullfrogr already have 1 OD under my belt. I took a dozen Serapax slept 27 hours. Promised I wldnt do that again:(

393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 14:04:50	@swanners272 @owl615 it amazing how much more music can communicate and evoke an emotional response\ memory.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 14:04:24	@swanners272 too much energy at night. This rapid cycling is my undoing. It's taking an enormous toll.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 14:02:54	@swanners272 I feel sick with anxiety and despair. Then I have to drag myself out of bed. In the evenings I don't want to go to bed ...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 13:57:53	@swanners272 I almost have to crawl out if bed at the mo. It's terrible. Not sure which is worse:(

393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 13:47:39	@Owl615 nah never got his appeal at all. Barry has some other funnier personas such as Les Patterson and Sandy.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 13:45:16	@Owl615 fantastic show compulsive viewing imo
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-13 13:41:02	@Owl615 @swanners272 who else performed. At Sydney they had Dame Edna whom I utterly despise. Just terminally boring high cringe factor

393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-12 11:04:54	@stampman56 it seems surreal. Australia is a very secular society in comparison. We may have less 'tights' but we have more freedom

393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 12:50:23	@K_is4Kellies summertime and the living is easy
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 12:49:18	@BarbieBites my mother can b blunt & tactless but not intentionally cruel. I now know her insecurities lead to defensive behaviour
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 12:44:36	@Owl615 I love that show!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 12:42:22	@BarbieBites oh well I hope she coughed up then! The biggest lesson I learnt abt maturing is realizing my parents are fallible xx
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 12:40:38	@BipolarSmith happy to chat if u need company:) I use twitter to give and receive support. It helps a lot xx
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 11:08:45	@BipolarSmith women will seek help earlier and r more comfortable abt voicing distress. For many men this is viewed as a sign of weakness

393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 11:05:01	@BipolarSmith I think men in general (but not all) r reluctant to talk abt their health. I think a lot of men don't even realize they...

393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 10:14:46	@BipolarSmith I think women tweet more than men.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 10:13:18	@BarbieBites u don't get on? It's partly instinctually we're hard wired to seek out love from our mothers no matter how cruel they may be
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 10:10:22	@ItsJackOk do u have anyone u could ring to give u help. U should not b alone when u r in such a dangerous mood (())
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 07:08:43	@bullfrogr Emotions are the same. I know I can get better when I'm really I'll bc I know it can pass now. That believe helps me thru
393296907	garbosmc	2012-08-06 07:07:12	I don't think so. We can change our thoughts they r not reality. If u don't believe u can't achieve. If u have confidence u can:)

393296907	garbosmc	2012-07-30 23:09:30	@sparklepanda plenty of time to learn from experience. Love is such a fickle emotion with nothing to do with common sense
393296907	garbosmc	2012-07-30 23:05:16	@fgasia Thxs for the RT;)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-07-30 23:04:15	@bullfrogr it was called 'iv heard the mermaids singing' the end just shattered me and I cldnt explain even to myself why.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-07-30 23:03:02	@bullfrogr bless u darling. A sensitive mind is a cruel gift. I hardly cry now too. I once cried for 3 hours after seeing a movie....

393296907	garbosmc	2012-07-30 22:59:26	@sparklepanda r u like that show 'Laid'? Such lethal power!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-07-30 22:58:23	@bullfrogr I think it's a sensory hallucination. I never have it any other time but during an episode

393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-23 23:21:25	@bullfrogr don't worry iv left out plenty! I used to treat every in impudent as as just a one-off. It's only in the last year in joined dots
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-23 23:15:36	@K_is4Kellies hey hun what's wrong love? Mind u bed always feel safe to me too
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-23 23:14:07	@bullfrogr who r these ppl and r they worthy of ur attention anyway?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-23 23:13:04	@ItsJackOk oh well lock ur door and Fi straight ahead :p
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-23 23:11:45	@ItsJackOk I wld v very sad if that meant hurting urself s/heart. Just think of all the wonderful things u cld like playing yr fac music ld

393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-23 23:04:16	@bullfrogr I have done some very bad things Luke gambling away $30,000 and getting loud and obnoxiously drunk , irrational rages.. The list
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-23 23:01:37	@bullfrogr yeah but maybe that's more your feeling ashamed rather than a true reflection of their view.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-23 22:59:51	@bullfrogr true but u can ask for more its all a matter of give and take
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-23 21:58:51	@bullfrogr iv found that u can only expect the best from urself and that's on a good day. From others it's a gift not a right IMO
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-23 21:56:41	@bullfrogr maybe ur a moon shadow :)

393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-15 16:34:37	@K_is4Kellies that's funny boring tweets? Twitter can b the playground of the banal. That a when it's not tragic!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-15 16:30:11	@FlorencinaHymns And the truth is I am unlikely to come off meds. They may be reduced but rhat's all
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-15 16:28:55	@FlorencinaHymns @smileypeanuts I have found Seroquel has fewer side effects than AntiD s. any way if u come off gradually it's not a probl

393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-15 12:11:38	@SmileyPeanuts it's sort of average for bipolar . 150 treats anxiety. 400 to 800 for depression (also helps with mania)...

393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 13:55:53	@SmileyPeanuts that's a relief. Driving while manic is very dangerous
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 13:55:17	@K_is4Kellies yes I have final cone to ferns with the fact that I will be on meds forever
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 13:53:46	@swanners272 that's my mania. And I am overflowing with ideas. Ur so reckless
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 13:52:56	@swanners272 yes! It!s like my brain lights up like a Xmas tree. Everything is bright and clear and I have unlimited ants of cash to spend .
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 13:48:46	@SmileyPeanuts I had a friend who stopped taking psych Ned's suddenly - while driving she 'saw' asheep on the rd & almost crashed.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 13:36:04	@SmileyPeanuts sorry I was tuning in to ur convo with Kellie. I used to feel better then come off meds and inevitably crash:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 13:31:12	@K_is4Kellies @smileypeanuts I'm not sure abt this but I feel the more u expose urself to the rawness of ur emotions u become more vulnerble
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 13:29:33	@K_is4Kellies @smileypeanuts I agree with Kellie u want to avoid a bad crash it might take weeks or even months to recover from....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 13:20:09	@Polarbear3127 I am so sorry to hear that. Do u feel capable of working or r u afraid of losing ur job so u think u shld go back now?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 13:16:38	@BipolarBimbo apparently it's very rare but it helps with depression. I gather ur mood swings are pronounced gun?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 13:10:58	@BipolarBimbo yes my worst behaviour has occurred on AntiD s. I hope u get a better result with ur. New treatment.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 00:17:20	@ItsJackOk if he is negative all the time towards u and no love u need to discuss this your carers IMO
393296907	garbosmc	2012-06-11 00:15:26	@ItsJackOk well I don't think it is helping you. It sound like yr dad is not coping. Does he have any support? Is yr mum arnd?.....

393296907	garbosmc	2012-05-25 20:32:01	@bipolarvoice yes when brain becomes a cold alien landscape there seems no way out. Even if u make the effort it can leave exhausted

393296907	garbosmc	2012-05-22 12:17:42	@swanners272 is he/she very focused on symptoms and not u as a person? Iv found that is quite common

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 23:12:14	@SmileyPeanuts @swanners272 ouch. My self harm was limited to gouging my arms. I did it constantly
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 23:07:43	@swanners272 you have so much to live for.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 23:06:58	@FakeSmile222 I no u feel like that but how u feel is not reality but a painful lie. U r unique and very vulnerable darling
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 23:04:48	@swanners272 with DBT there is a high rate of success. Is that the therapy they are offering?

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:44:17	@FakeSmile222 it gives u something to work with. Ur not the wicked witch of the west:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:43:19	@FakeSmile222 now that's a far cry from ur initial statement. And a very brave admission....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:41:09	@SmileyPeanuts @swanners272 I am feeling quite a lot better now. On 400 Seroquel which helps with dep and anx
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:39:35	@swanners272 I no but it frustrate me that I have to be on enough trances to down a bull elephant in order to feel functional
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:37:51	@FemalePTSD do u have sleep routine? Relaxing music. I like white noise myself.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:35:47	@FakeSmile222 u have a choice to stay or go. Some ppl r only there for the good times
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:34:40	@FakeSmile222 yes but that's not 'wrecking them' its very sad for u that u feel that way. When u r close to someone..
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:33:01	@swanners272 @smileypeanuts very erratic behaviour and mood swings. Full of compulsions too. Lucky to b alive
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:31:18	@swanners272 @smileypeanuts it's taken me years to be open abt my issues I nearly acknowledged them myself.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:27:54	@SmileyPeanuts @swanners272 u r very fortunate to have such an understanding and supportive partner x
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:26:37	@FemalePTSD do u have any thing u can take ?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:26:03	One thing life has taught me is that most ppl are remarkably resilient. MH can kick u down but u can't let it keep u there
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:23:30	@FakeSmile222 I can't see how that was wrecking other pool. Just hurtful to u

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:12:58	@FakeSmile222 sorry no one has that much power. It's takes a systematic effort to wreck someone
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:11:06	@swanners272 u have beautiful eyes and lovely smile
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 22:09:14	@FakeSmile222 nohastgat much power. After all even Hitler cldnt do that and he's the benchmark for pure evil.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 21:46:53	@BipolarBimbo no man is worth the effort or angst. If its not working there's plenty Tom take their place
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-22 21:45:03	@SmileyPeanuts I do but I haven't used it that much

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-20 08:53:52	@bullfrogr it's important to find friends who have the same interests. Otherwise why would we bother?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-20 08:52:57	@Owl615 @swanners272 r u worried about Elena?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-19 07:23:24	@Owl615 @bullfrogr yes an emotional holiday is what we need. I feel drained from feeling too much:( an emotional zombie with the lot thxs

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 22:44:58	@autiepower just remember u r worthwhile. To be brutally honest being a good worker is convenient for others really .
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 22:43:18	@autiepower struggled. But wk is not worth dying for. There r other options out there. I no lots of ppl redundant who now consider it good
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 22:41:39	@autiepower and I no how it feels to think u r not good enough at wk. I used to have a lot of responsibity but this lady year I have..

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 21:29:59	@PoopyPeanuts yes that's what happened to me too
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 21:28:55	@KismetLady yeah it's been ok. Since I've gone up to Seroquel 400 I am really feeling brighter

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 21:23:25	@PoopyPeanuts @schizoartist I felt very vulnerable when I first started on mood stabilizers. Bc anti DS took away anxiety but they made me..

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 21:17:56	@PoopyPeanuts @swanners272 Lisa is very courageous and has endured so much over the year. Xx
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 21:16:11	@bullfrogr it's too sad and makes me feel too lonely
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 21:15:48	@bullfrogr @owl615 I still drink but only on weekends and not to get drunk. I share a bottle with my partner. I hate drinking alone ..
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 21:13:34	@bullfrogr factor but the stress of modern life and self medication has increased the incidence of BP

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 21:08:44	@Owl615 @bullfrogr yes i sort of acquaint it with eating disorders in that resect.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-18 09:02:35	@bullfrogr I think it depends on the addiction. Alcohol is death by inches. Whereas illicit drugs (most) will kill u quickly
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-17 21:32:15	@bullfrogr oh does that mean its infectious? Ducking for cover now!

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-17 14:37:08	@MinutePoetry I woke up exhausted. I didn't get to work until midday. I must take my meds earlier. How r u going?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-17 14:36:02	@bullfrogr thank you that a truly lovely compliment humongous hug((((())))
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-17 14:35:10	@bullfrogr Crikey then it's got to the booze (although I don't drink that much !)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-16 22:28:57	@bullfrogr oh Elena that makes me so sad for. U deserve better than that.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-16 14:48:23	@grizzlybaz g'day it's Monday evening here and I've just finished wk. the only thing holding me is public trpt
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-16 14:45:01	@floridlymad well that's a price of black humour
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-16 14:43:32	@Owl615 bc that wkd be presumptuous. I only supported ur desire to go. Of course I am a Leo:P
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-16 14:42:49	@Owl615 well I may a bit like that but I don't offer advice unless willy nilly. Eg I wldnt have lectured u abt exercising..
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-15 22:10:43	@Owl615 I'm in denial. I mean I don't th ink a nice cuppa and a walk around the block is the miracle cure. But it beats doin nothing for me
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-15 22:08:05	@Owl615 I take pol's suffering seriously but yes maybe there is a cultural divide. And I hate the thought that I can't control myself. Maybe
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-15 21:49:38	@Owl615 I no im not trying to make light of it. ..sigh. God stimes i just want to scream or stay inn bed forever

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-15 21:28:51	@bullfrogr I'm confused did I say sthing to upset u? That wld never be my intention
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-15 18:54:44	@Owl615 how's ur wknd been? We have had rhe most glorious weather and my draughts soccer team won

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-15 18:15:23	@MinutePoetry @bullfrogr yes I think that's true
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-15 18:14:55	@MinutePoetry @bullfrogr

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-15 08:34:00	@MinutePoetry in one episode I was convinced I was starving my child that's scary. I felt evil and helpless to stop myself at the same time
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-15 08:29:55	@Owl615 well if nothing else it will get u out. Also exercise lowers levels of depression and anxiety
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-14 12:48:24	@Owl615 that's what I want to do stimes it's hard to resist I try to exercise to compensate

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-14 12:32:56	@ProofInProgress try to remember a feeling is that. It's subjective and not necessarily ground in reality. Just keep change to baby steps
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-14 12:31:26	@ProofInProgress we all cling to all habits even when we don't need them anymore ore they r hurting us. It scary trying a new way...

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 20:50:53	@Owl615 well I did go to the gym. Feeling quite high tonight. That's about the first time in a week
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 20:48:12	@MinutePoetry bc I have suffer acute panic which has overwhelmed me
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 20:47:23	@MinutePoetry I just can't stand the thought of being trapped by anything. I have had to crawl on my hands & knees out of shopping malls..
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 20:45:51	@MinutePoetry yes I suffer depression with 'soft' psychotic symptoms according to my pdr. That includes paranoia....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 20:44:09	@misslolitalove I work as a senior policy analyst in the public service
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 15:05:18	To all of you in twitterville who are waking up. I have just abt finished work!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 14:49:32	@swanners272 I reckon u cld but it might be best to s/ thing that treats hair as well so it does go dry and frizzy
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 11:48:04	@schizoartist possession for personal use.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 11:47:46	@schizoartist yes it's appalling. Over here there is some talk of relaxing the laws against weed. In most possession the cops turn blind..
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 11:40:20	@schizoartist @saltysmile a seriously drunk person is more dangerous than s/ one stoned
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 11:39:39	@schizoartist yeah anti weed laws a ra wast of time and taxpayers money. They have clearly failed and were never required in the first place
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 11:36:29	@SaltySmile not sure how realistic that is though
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 11:36:06	@SaltySmile yeah thats a pretty good way of going abt it. I'm always scared if I don't keep driving myself I will spiral out of control.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 11:33:56	@schizoartist yes to be flawed is to be human really. It's just a matter of degrees.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 11:22:50	@SaltySmile it can be a struggle but it's the sort of thing u get benefit from after the effort rather than during I think
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-12 11:21:18	@SaltySmile stop it I can hear u from hear. It is the most over played song:(

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-08 22:13:11	@bullfrogr there's alway twitter now. A truly fab invention. It's not abt having no triggers its abt learning better ways of coping

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-08 08:42:43	@Owl615 it's most unfair. I am not deprived of Seroquel but the price is prohibitive. $262AUD for a pack of 60. Might as well be heroin
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-08 08:40:00	@bipolarvoice I love handcrafted jewelry. We have a craft market beat where I live once a month. I go there when I have the willpwt

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-07 21:34:04	@bullfrogr yes here and now. It's lie meditation. You centre on the sensations of yr body. U don't reject ur thoughts. You let then wash
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-07 21:24:12	@bullfrogr well I know that's not true 'cause I've seen yr photo.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-07 21:23:17	@bullfrogr and observing your thoughts without fear or favour. Then letting them go.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-07 21:01:17	@bullfrogr yeah I know that feeling. Last time I tried to go w/ out meds I lasted about 4 months I got more anxious and paranoid. ....

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-07 18:50:40	@bullfrogr ppl tend to hurt by ominous soon rather than intentionally. Of course the state is a different matter.....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-07 17:49:12	@bipolarvoice I had that problem. There a fix if u go to #support . U need to login and out and load a new free app that fixes the problem
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-07 17:45:29	@suicidaholic r u feeling ignored Hun?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-07 17:43:59	@bullfrogr never try to read the hearts and minds of others it's a waste of time. The best advise I ever recovered from my mother

393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-07 10:21:47	@PoopyPeanuts yes but like all compulsive behaviors it won't be conquered on the 1st attempt or more..
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-07 09:28:16	@PoopyPeanuts it doesn't mean I'm slacking off but I won't catastrophise my shortcomings either.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-07 09:24:48	@PoopyPeanuts Uni think so self acceptance is cer important. I'm practicing it right now because didn't to the gym this morning
393296907	garbosmc	2012-04-06 17:52:14	@Owl615 and then shot himself. Child killing is the most evil Il of crimes IMO

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-30 19:22:03	@bipolarvoice @lexywhispers that must b very unnerving. R u really that isolated or do u isolated yrself when u feel unwell?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-30 19:20:17	@bipolarvoice @owl615 yes I'm a bit puzzled by the timeframe too.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-30 19:00:54	@floridlymad @barbiebites did they seek yr permission tohave them present?

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-30 06:17:43	@Owl615 hmm more anxious I think plus being on public transport....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-30 06:14:37	@BipolarSanity I never get how they make the distinction btwn diagnosis . It seems a very in exact science IMO

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-28 21:30:16	@Owl615 in Australia access to free health service is means tested except for basic care our oublic and private health don't cover all

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-28 21:13:33	@swanners272 @poopypeanuts a sense of connectedness fosters resilience. Often when ur down u hide but it's the worst thing to do eeally
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-28 21:11:55	@Owl615 that's the NHS for you I have another in UK with similar situation. It's free health at a cost the irony @@swanners272

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-28 20:46:11	@Bob_Steinmetz gee it's sort of scary that some pol need aspects of this advice. Like not having a sexual relationship....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-28 20:34:02	@swanners272 hi Lisa how's it goin sorry I haven't been in touch fun finding ft work rather draining. Have u darted therapy yet?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-28 20:32:03	@PoopyPeanuts that's so true. But some ppl r more suited to the task than others
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-28 20:28:39	@BipolarBlogger yeah ur stress levels go down 2 or 3 levels. It's like turning off a smoke alarm lol

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:48:29	@BipolarSanity my latest dr has taken away Xanax and given me Valium. I am trying not to take it.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:47:19	@BipolarSanity yeah I had access to sera pax and OD 'd in it when I got desperate. Stimes my moods just bottom out in a matters of moments
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:45:13	@bipolarvoice that's why I tweet partly to chat but also to give back to my pals in #TwitterPsychWard #TwitterBuddyScheme
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:44:13	@bipolarvoice yeah when I freaked in Jan I found twitter was a godsend. Got lots of support...

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:33:45	@BipolarSanity psychotropic drugs r handed out like cant yet they r very powerful and can do more harm than good
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:32:42	@BipolarSanity my pdr thinks I am and I am not denying it really. Thxs for pointing out that causal

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:18:32	@puddyuss I never noticed it before. I think I anti dep have ruined me. Destroyed my mind
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:15:00	@puddyuss I just find it hard to accept my moods can change dramatically over a day what's that abt
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:11:11	@Mjab1616 I'll take flattery ad an act of generosity:)

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:06:56	@bipolarvoice the more time I spend on twitter the more I realize what a lifeline it is for me and others.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:06:00	@bipolarvoice so if we get a wee bit manic and tweet over zealously we're hoofted. That's discriminatory
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 21:02:31	@puddyuss oh rewind I was diagnosed with BP 2 in 2011 and wonder abt the diagnosis.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 20:59:52	@puddyuss hi I find mood swings unnerving bc what I can do on one day seems impossible on another.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 20:56:41	@bipolarvoice oh I thought it wld only happen if u tweeted spam. And u don't do that
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 20:53:47	I spent 4 months off work with bipolar and then gradually returned to wk over the next 3 months. So don't despair
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 20:47:32	@Polarbear3127 @psychosis2407 @puddyuss it can b hard to believe how Yr reality can change. The loss of control is unnerving
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 20:42:54	@bipolarvoice maybe u cld have changed it from club to ace:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 20:42:00	@autiepower I hate 'performance' feedback. It's so riddled with agendas . Constructive fdbck is priceless bc it's so rare
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 20:39:37	@bipolarvoice ooh what's that. Sounds awful

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 12:11:50	@HealingFromBPD gosh no one apart here wants to talk abt it. If I raise the subject ppl want to change it pronto

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 11:47:42	@bullfrogr so we have to make some peace with ourselves. It's just learning how to do that:D
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 11:46:23	@schizoartist they don't have a clear diagnosis. Is it a burger with aside Of fries or a side of fries w a burger?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 11:44:55	@schizoartist and u suffer mood swings. I hope u don't mind me asking but a coke of ppl I know r schizo effective/ bipolar.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:41:05	@GingerSeer my pdr and I discussed lithium but my family has history of thyroid problems:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:39:20	@schizoartist that must be very hard. I hope u have found a way to cope with them. A lot of ppl insult Thales they just can't 'hear' it
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:37:28	@bullfrogr I'm glad to hear that Hun. I find my moods seem to 'bleed' thru meds. It's good u can work too:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:36:07	@bullfrogr depression brings the fear. I can't believe how my moods can change so dramatically. I feel imprisoned by rhen
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:32:30	@Owl615 u must get bored being at home. I must admit I complain abt work but the routine is good 4 me

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:22:07	It occurred during my adolescence I used to fantasist about historical figures and the I was convinced they cld 'hear' me
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:22:07	@bullfrogr always this feeling equates with shame, guilt and depression.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:16:48	@fireryhart but u enjoyed u need a little pleasure:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:15:44	@schizoartist @autiepower is it like u know it's not true but u react to it anyway?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:13:18	@bullfrogr I used to think my thoughts were broadcasting to ghosts. I tried to stop thinking but I cldnt. Always felt guilty & ashamed
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:08:35	@bullfrogr it can b a letdown:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:07:27	@Owl615 what do u do for a crust?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 08:06:53	@schizoartist that's hard. Do u drive Hun? I am too sight impaired to do so. So I have no choice either

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-20 06:25:09	@schizoartist :D I get very tense in certain places like on public transport.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 22:00:42	@PoopyPeanuts @schizoartist @blissfulblues sweet dreams of success
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:59:55	@PoopyPeanuts I am resigned to the fact that I will vex on Ned's for the rest IMF my life
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:58:57	@PoopyPeanuts I tried it was a disaster for me I'm aomrry to say. U had to have 4 months ff and 5 week S in HOSP
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:57:26	@schizoartist Ian on Valporeate , Seroqel and Valium
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:56:43	@schizoartist whoa that is a lot of sedation there. U must suffer a gr8t deal of anxiety.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:54:25	@schizoartist ur doing a 'swell' job here lady:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:53:39	@blissfulblues yes it makes my blood boil. I had 4 months off. If I had had a heart attack no- one wld have questioned my ability to wk
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:48:47	@schizoartist @poopypeanuts @blissfulblues I am wkg but I can't see myself wkg to the capacity that I used to
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:46:54	@PoopyPeanuts I've the no meds path. I hope it will work 4 u. In may find u can raise ur stress threshold if u restructure yr l Ife
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:41:13	@schizoartist which meds?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:39:40	@PoopyPeanuts @blissfulblues @schizoartist I find I can assume a role at work which puts a barrier be me & reality.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:38:29	@PoopyPeanuts @schizoartist @blissfulblues yes that how I felt when I had my first meltdown but the price is high
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:27:59	@PoopyPeanuts @schizoartist @blissfulblues it does take its toll. I believe attempting to keep up appearances lead to my b\down last yr
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:18:57	@PoopyPeanuts @schizoartist @blissfulblues but u manage the job don't u. A lot of ppl r bluffing their way thru life
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:17:19	@schizoartist I have a bad tendency to drink to relieve anxiety then lose control.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:16:04	@blissfulblues u don't know what's going on in other people's minds. They cld b. screaming on the inside.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:14:48	@ellabella1792 it's better than work believe me
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:13:58	@GingerSeer getting there slowly. The routine of work is helpful. Still a lot of rapid cycling but getting on with life.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:12:30	@blissfulblues big hugs back. They feel so much better on twitter:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:11:13	@blissfulblues it's a form of anxiety I suspect. For me its like I'm watching me watching them watching me like mirror image repeating.....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:08:37	@schizoartist The McDonalds of the caffeine world eh? AND the coffee's lousy anyway!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:05:44	@CatalystInc I find that hard to believe
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 21:02:41	@schizoartist @blissfulblues I agree. I always feel awkward and insincere when I try to social.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:59:45	@schizoartist Melbourne is well known for its coffee. Quite like Seattle. We despise Starbucks on principle.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:57:51	@schizoartist it seems the way to sanity is like life some religious order. Everything enjoyable is a no-no
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:47:09	@GingerSeer hi Jenny how r u? R u fully recovered now?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:45:49	@BipolarBlogger I feel like that a lot
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:44:53	@MikaFreak123 do u ever take it l8 so u can stay up? I get so annoyed when dopes me early
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:43:30	@polarbirdie aww don't be so hard on yrself. It happens to even the sanest ppl:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:41:26	@bullfrogr @owl615 I'm butting in but if u can work and function u don't need incarceration
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:39:27	@polarbirdie I find gardening helps me calm down. U wldnt think so if u saw it though
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:37:33	@schizoartist I still love a good expresso Latte though:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:36:55	@schizoartist ur lucky. I'm too scared to drink coffee. It set my latest round of panic ambushes that started in Jan:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:25:37	@schizoartist absolutely agree. And tea is anti- oxidant too
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:24:35	@BipolarBabble oh pleease
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:23:48	@BipolarBimbo do u know what BODMAS means. One hour of sanity for the correct answer!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:22:44	@BipolarBimbo that's too easy 40
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 20:22:00	@BipolarBimbo yep 9\27
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 18:06:33	@Owl615 did I tell u the tickets were free?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 18:05:39	I can report the night was very positive. It's all abt learning to monitor bipolar so we can raise the threshold stress inducing illness
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 18:04:12	@schizoartist pls don't go darling!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 18:03:42	@MyBipolarBrain agreed. And drive shldnt be mistaken for obsession. It seems yr recent illness had a silver lining.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-19 18:02:14	@sedate__me yes I want to keep well way from them. They're not for me

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-18 21:50:52	@fogartyelaine yeah it's a 10 week course run by a private clinic here. The place has a really good reputation for anx & dep illnesses
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-18 21:48:22	@bpluv stories of police brutality against mentally ppl are alarmingly common. While organized crimes runs rampant.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-17 19:07:59	@TallaTrialogue I eat a healthy diet and it doesn't seem to help. It's easy to generalize.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-15 20:59:36	@Miss_Gibson91 well if they're on a leash they can't hurt anyone. And walking them will teach them to behave
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-15 20:57:52	@FemalePTSD ur fighting ur demons just chill and they will dissolve. They feed on negative energy
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-15 20:55:50	@Miss_Gibson91 s/times I find u just have to project urself out rhe door even though every nerve in ur body cries no!

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-11 11:38:39	@SawHole I've heard many similar tales. I think ADs in general have made me worse. I have PAs & anxiety so often:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-11 01:51:38	@thelionwhoroars @sawhole @jemfmurphy uhave been on it too?

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-10 12:44:02	@earthatmilkyway @saltysmile actually from the way u describe them they sound like a easy insular lot
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-10 12:43:12	@earthatmilkyway @saltysmile I'm using ignorant in a broader way. As in lacking understanding, empathy and stereotyping ppl with MH.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-10 12:36:43	@earthatmilkyway @saltysmile of friends who accept her.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-10 12:36:18	@earthatmilkyway @saltysmile suffer a MH in their lifetime. They won't b laughing then. My neiva has BP too and she has found a gr8t group
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-10 12:34:28	@earthatmilkyway @saltysmile kids ca b cruel like that. Remember they largely ignorant and a good proportion will..

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-09 07:23:07	@SawHole @jemfmurphy I know a psych who has prescribed 8 mg a day of Xanax for a friend. Freaky stuff.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-09 07:22:12	@SawHole yeah Xa Anax is tricky stuff. My ex psych gave me the Effexor first off. My GP gave me X for panic disorder but low dose
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-09 06:02:27	@fireryhart anytime Liz:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-09 06:01:39	@jemfmurphy that's how I felt on Efexor at first. It stopped the anxiety. Now I'm not expecting much just a little control over my life.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-08 09:48:28	@jemfmurphy I didn't realize I was engaging in damaging behaviour. Spending sprees, drinking, gambling & rages.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-08 09:44:14	@jemfmurphy I wld last a couple of months then the anxiety wld return. The periods in between got shorter. Also I didn't realia I was...

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 21:14:47	@MyBipolarBrain good to hear u r going well. U no s/times irritability is a sign of recuperating not necessarily a mood swing
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 21:13:14	@Miss_Gibson91 pretty blah. Finding f/time wk hard but I keep going cause I have no choice really. My life is not my own
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 21:08:24	@LastSalmonMan my favorite for of revenge is to enter my victim into every comp or holiday share program. That way they get spam/jmail
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 21:05:58	@GingerSeer good to hear u r getting better. I am getting there slowly but EKG full time is harder than I right it wld be

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 20:50:02	@LastSalmonMan afar homosexual isn't that a tautology?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 20:38:14	@schizoartist yeah I find it's hard to b compliant when I have just come to terms with taking meds permntly:(

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 20:28:05	@Miss_Gibson91 so ur off quetiapine now? I must admit I only want to take for acute symptoms.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 20:25:13	@schizoartist I just feel there has to be more to life than work, meals and attending my child. I just want that extra time for me
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 20:23:13	My head is just in the right space I feel so messed up. Just don't no the way back my skin is crawling.....

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 20:13:04	@HavenNyx 'cause otherwise it wld be afternoon. It's not the time it's waking up that's so devastating I find
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 20:10:45	@BipolarBimbo awwww factor of ten out of ten:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 20:02:13	@jemfmurphy @sawhole a roller coaster mood swings of greater intensity and frequency until I became suicidal last year.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 20:01:05	@jemfmurphy @sawhole I suffered thru them with little recourse to medication. Hever once I was put in Effexor for PND at 40 life became..
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 19:59:09	@jemfmurphy @sawhole for the next ten yrs I had periods of remission and long periods of hmania and mild depressions.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 19:57:59	@jemfmurphy @sawhole I think I had it. During my 1st brkdwn I took a trycylic at 29. In hindsight I don't think it did anything to help

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 11:34:49	@BipolarBimbo the second series is better than the first IMO
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 11:34:07	@SawHole I think ads have made me worse particularly in the last ten years when I was out in SSRNs.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 09:17:07	Good Morning all I hope ur day/ evening is going well xox
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-07 09:15:52	@SawHole the depression is the worst I think. I used to take anti DS but now I realize they made me 'switch' feel very discouraged now

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-04 20:53:52	@fireryhart may be coupled with extreme agitation. High suicide rate than unipolar depression
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-04 20:52:30	@fireryhart read Natasha Tracy's latest article soft signs of bipolar. I'll RT it again
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-04 20:51:24	@fireryhart bipolar depression is part of manic depression cycle. It is often, as in my case resistant to anti ds. Also excessive sleep.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-04 20:44:39	@bullfrogr supercalafajulisticexpealadosiuos:) @GingerlyRobin
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-04 20:43:08	@bullfrogr it is one of the earliest rules u learn and it's stupid. Spelling is simple a standard it's not an indisputable truth.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-04 20:09:50	@bipolarclub it's not the full story for a significant minority:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-04 20:07:46	@bipolarclub our peak org for depression/MH is BeyondBlue. They do a lot of good wk and I shldnt belittle their work but... Shrug

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-04 13:13:07	@bipolarclub there is this assumption that treatment is straightforward. Just go see ur dr and get some pills...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-04 13:10:38	@bipolarclub not sure where u live but what annoys me in Australia is the advertising regarding depression....

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-01 11:02:23	I laugh on the outside so no one can see my despair. I truly feel a lost cause. I live out of duty no out of desire.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-01 10:52:41	@Miss_Gibson91 just seem to have racing thought s and weird surges of energy. Just treading water..

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-01 10:42:07	@bipolarbearnz Effexor is a bitch to w/ draw from. For 1 thing it made me manic then w/drawing wld lead to mixed episodes.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-01 10:36:38	@Miss_Gibson91 oh that's no good. Did u make it to ur volunteer job? I no u were very anxious abt. I hope things start improving 4 u hug

393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-01 06:07:25	@Owl615 avoidance is so seductive but it's a siren that will leave shattered on rocks of hopelessness and despair
393296907	garbosmc	2012-03-01 06:05:41	@bullfrogr u had almost teach my akf to read again

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-29 12:55:21	@SaltySmile but we all need to resist the urge to wipe ourselves out with a potentially lethal dose of substances legal or othwse.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-29 12:54:03	@SaltySmile u no I think it's all a matter of degrees. There r just some days which r unbearable and u need some relief.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-27 19:57:42	@autiepower I note one rhe forums that ppl are taking far higher doses than that as well.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-26 19:42:05	@swanners272 sorry ignore that tweet! That makes sense is what I meant to say. For me I suspect being anxious is aboutc self anger.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-26 19:40:35	@swanners272 agh. That makes-
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-26 19:38:09	@PoopyPeanuts venting is NOT about weakness! It is a healthy response to stress
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-26 19:37:05	@PoopyPeanuts no matter how many times I say it's just a mood it feel so real. Feel discouraged now:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-26 19:35:35	@swanners272 well that's got nothing to with anger. It's about resolving conflict effectively.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-26 19:28:13	@fireryhart hi how r u? Gaven't chatted for a whike

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-26 19:18:51	@PoopyPeanuts the annoying thing is that after feeling crap all day I feel better now. I hid out in my bdm stubpid
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-26 19:17:34	@swanners272 a bit basic maybe?:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-26 19:16:44	@FemalePTSD I don't think so! We need goals to take us beyond our daily struggles/ tunnel vision of MH
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-26 18:43:04	@LexyWhispers I love wine. I try not to drink too much. Just a bottle over a meal with my partner.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-26 18:10:40	@bullfrogr that's a very profound or Orn. How can we exist w/out our face? We can but it is a perfect metaphor for self enlightenment IMO

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 21:03:55	@oxymoronic82 some pol need the reassurance of a crowd maybe. I think it will settle down.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 20:58:33	@PoopyPeanuts a and thats 100% ok
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 20:55:38	@oxymoronic82 I prefer summer bc its light and seems full of potential. I often get quite down in autumn and winter

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 20:26:07	@oxymoronic82 I still think the scheme has merit. I think a lit of ppl depend on the support they get thru twitter. It's sort of organic

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 11:33:17	@garbosmc @saltysmile that's shrug btw. Sounded like a great dream:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 11:28:23	@SaltySmile just hate wk sheug
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 11:26:33	@polarbirdie I think u need to get up. Willi g yrself to sleep never help. Do u have athing u can take or maybe watch TV to calm down
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 11:24:55	@bullfrogr I love that sobs In fact I loved the Smiths gr8t band
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 11:23:41	@polarbirdie if u were a man u wld be angry and blaming the world for ur 'failure'
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 11:22:02	@bullfrogr @mybipolarbrain they can the worst.,
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 10:16:38	It's pretty bad when the only emails u received come from Tumbleweed
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 10:13:42	@blissfulblues no no and NO I find that creepy really I do.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 10:12:34	@SaltySmile I've taken Zoplidem but didn't!t have that side effect. Maybe u cld ask for s/ thing else.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 10:08:38	@blissfulblues if she's any good she should get the message.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 10:08:11	@blissfulblues I don't think u gave to say anything just son't respond to the hug. A bit like a cat that doesn't like being pckd up.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 10:06:42	@SaltySmile ick Btw how r u? I spoken to u in a while.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 10:02:32	@SaltySmile is that med?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 10:01:42	@blissfulblues yes but the therapeutic relationship is not a 1 size fits all program. She sold not presume a hug is wanted or required.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 09:45:58	@nerdsrockk that's it he down sized:) I like it!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 09:45:12	@living_as_if well they at work no I have an illness but it's no more disabling than many physical illnesses. I feel sidelined now grrr
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 09:38:39	I am scared of the darkness but the worst darkness is ignorance really.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 09:37:08	@SamCruff still in the 30s Celsius here. I got a bit sunburnt on the wknd

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 09:21:05	I woke up feeling ok if drowsy from meds now going downhill. Work makes me depressed and paranoid. I feel useless and unwanted:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 09:19:27	@blissfulblues @marina_russ @aliquant I don't no if I wld like it. It wldnt seem genuine first up IMO

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 09:10:14	@Owl615 try some distraction. Music or writing or even a word puzzle. Remember it won't last. Big hugs xox
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 09:08:26	@MyBipolarBrain @barbiebites @thewayimfeelin I think everyone shld shop arnd and find a dr they can talk to. If u can't talk it's no good
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 09:07:05	@MyBipolarBrain @barbiebites @thewayimfeelinyes my GP has been really good to me over the years. He knows more than anyone

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 07:03:49	@GingerSeer @miss_gibson91 I agree and it can ramp rite up into panic which unbearable. I think ppl whisper abr me behind my back

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 06:52:43	@Thewayimfeelin @barbiebitesi wld find that a daunting prospect but that's just me.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 06:50:41	@GingerSeer @miss_gibson91 ah paranoia and I r close companions:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 06:48:37	@GingerSeer @miss_gibson91 good luck! Unfortunately this while MH is !thingy' is trial and error. Big hugs toto y both
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-20 06:46:15	@autiepower that's appalling. Not only is it a poor test, it has the potential to set ppl back if they cannot keep up a facade of coping

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 13:37:42	@MyBipolarBrain night Kristy:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 13:35:22	@LastSalmonMan u have better computers than I do!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 11:05:09	@PoopyPeanuts @bipolarclub it helps with anxiety I find too. Epilin alone does not do that. I find these drugs have far less side effects.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:59:15	@bipolarclub I do too
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:57:10	@punkoj @bipolarclub with growing frequency. I am so tired now. I broke down last year. I was suicidal I had nothing left to throw at it.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:55:56	@punkoj @bipolarclub but sent me high do I gambled drank was irritable etc and if I came off them I'd crash within months
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:53:58	@punkoj in hindsight they were a disaster. The first I think extended the illness. I took Venlafaxine which cured the anxiety
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:50:08	@PoopyPeanuts @bipolarclub @owallflower that!s Sodium Valporeate. I take 1500mg
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:49:09	@bipolarclub it got worse after the birth of my daughter. Do the last 9 year have been unrelenting. Took AntiD which made it worse.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:47:16	@bipolarclub yes 20 years on and off if not not more. Looking back I was quite depressed and1st panic episode at 18
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:45:00	@bipolarclub r u in lithium I am in Sodium Valporeate
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:44:08	@bipolarclub I wonder why?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:43:14	@garbosmc @mybipolarbrain @punkoj I mean not drinking damned typos!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:42:17	@bipolarclub not some moral turpitude or weakness of character.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:41:45	@bipolarclub yes sure is! We had no hope. The only comfort I can derive is that it makes it clear that it is an illness u r suffering
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:38:11	@bipolarclub yes to all and it's got worse as I ' e got older. Mind u I wasn't diagnosed until last year.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:36:26	@MyBipolarBrain @punkoj I just monitor my drinking and make sure I put together more datmys of not drinking than forking
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:34:55	@bipolarclub thxs that's it:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:34:10	@bipolarclub @punkoj @miss_gibson91 I find that anxiety can reduce my world to a minute by minute ordeal
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:34:08	@bipolarclub @punkoj @miss_gibson91 which is just intolerable at times. It is quite degrading really.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:21:18	@punkoj @bipolarclub @miss_gibson91 I think mine have driven me to the edge more often than not
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:19:40	@BarbieBites sounds like an excellent idea. Xox
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:18:58	@bipolarclub @punkoj @miss_gibson91 my dr told me it's ranked above heart disease and some cancers by the WHO.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:17:54	@MikaFreak123 no the feeling hun
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:14:57	@BarbieBites it's hard but I hope u feel u r getting s/ thing out of it. S/times we have to leave our comfort zones if we want change.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:12:58	@bipolarclub @punkoj @miss_gibson91 that's why bipolar is such a serious illness. I have one major OD but more to escape not die.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:11:37	@MyBipolarBrain @punkoj well I'm 50 and I've avoided out and out alcoholism. But I've had short periods of heavy drinking.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:09:32	@BarbieBites and be more patient and compassionate with yrself(())
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:08:58	@BarbieBites but ur working on it. I totally understand yr frustration cause I feel that way too. Consider yrself a work in origress
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:06:47	@punkoj @bipolarclub @miss_gibson91 my Bruce has it too but her father ( my bro in law shot himself). So I think she got it both sides.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 10:01:04	@BarbieBites thats a shite feeling do u no what ur angry about? I mean DBT triggered it but do u why? Don't expect u to tell me just asking.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 09:59:32	@punkoj @bipolarclub @miss_gibson91 my gran committed suicide it was considered depression it was not her 1st attempt
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 09:56:39	@bipolarclub @poopypeanuts @owallflower do you take it all at night?

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 09:52:42	@BarbieBites r u feeling under control again or is the rage still inside u?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 09:51:09	@Miss_Gibson91 @bipolarclub having an understanding partner does help. I reckon mine's as loopy as me in his own:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 09:49:51	@bipolarclub @miss_gibson91 it's in my family but my parents struggle with it. Everyone is better than they were now.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-16 09:46:56	@bipolarclub @poopypeanuts @owallflower sort of me too but 25mg is losing it efficacy. R u on higher doses?

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-08 10:59:41	@seekhappyville I know that feeling!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-08 10:59:00	@mysilversecrets no u cannot Hun talk to us #TwitterPsychWard

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-08 07:42:19	@WelshSwan a girl at gym swears by muscle building and a diet high in animal fat. She is as skinny as a rake w/ out being unhealthy
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-08 07:41:00	@Miss_Gibson91 yeah sort of like the song 'echoed Beach'

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 23:41:55	@LastSalmonMan yes I'm less tolerant these days. I can't be bothered with others' baggage and won't let them off load on me.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 23:36:58	And there is a mosquito buzzing round my bed grrrrr... I need to sleep
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 23:35:56	Ok it's 2.30am. I have just spent2 hours trying to download a TV series unsuccessfully. #I HATECOMPUTERs
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 23:32:24	@LastSalmonMan at least u know it will pass:( I get worked up and irritable too. I lash out verbally at pol I love which is so bad
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 23:27:40	@oxymoronic82 sounds pretty good to me. Most things I slant do r more fun than those I shld
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 23:24:52	@LastSalmonMan ur lucky u can fit yr enemies in one room. I'd need a stadium
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 23:22:53	@LastSalmonMan u sound pretty down. Has anything happened?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 23:20:36	@LastSalmonMan count me in:( although I didn't really want to die I just cldnt stand living anymore if there's a difference
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 23:18:26	@LexyWhispers he says if I overdo it I'll crash. So it's try to wind down when I'm high and push myself when I'm low aih titbit I!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 23:16:22	@Miss_Gibson91 yes but we do get howling southerlys from Antarctica even in summer
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 20:15:38	@SaltySmile that's the spirit!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 20:14:51	@LexyWhispers have I told u I used to have a cat called Lexy:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 20:14:07	@LexyWhispers my dr wld tell me to take some Valium or Seroquel to settle. What goes up must come down.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 20:12:14	@PoopyPeanuts one thing I've learnt here in #TwitterPsychWard is that people are compassionate and tolerant as well as genuine.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 20:10:58	@PoopyPeanuts @kismetlady u can't say that cause u don't know what we've been thru. Everyone has a story
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 20:06:37	I think I might b getting a bit high I don't want to sleep and I feel a compulsion to dance. S/times I do this for he's at night
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 20:04:42	@PoopyPeanuts @kismetlady is that really accurate. Ur twitter mates care abt u (())

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 19:57:28	@PoopyPeanuts @kismetlady u must believe it will pass. It need not b a life sentence. U r going thru a low period and it's hard
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 19:55:32	@KismetLady @poopypeanuts yes Lady u have he right of it. U cldn't make him stay if he didn't want to.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 19:51:26	@Miss_Gibson91 good to c s/ one is happy and relaxed. And they call us rhe intelligent species.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 19:46:28	@PoopyPeanuts does rate as a delusion? That u feel that way even though it is contrary to reality.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 19:44:17	@NicoleAches that's good News
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-07 19:43:04	@SaltySmile I get mine done regularly. I get them shellacked now'cause it doesn't wear off

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 21:15:34	@PoopyPeanuts @mralbionman I didn't I'd to die I just lost control and cldn't face another day.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 21:13:59	@swanners272 ssri r like Prozac and ssrn r like Venlafaxine and Cymbaulta. Have a look on Wikipedia. The other class of ad r tricyclics
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 21:07:50	@PoopyPeanuts all a rather pathetic saga really
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 21:07:20	@PoopyPeanuts @mralbionman I od'd during second bd after my daughter was born after my medication failed and I panicked.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 21:06:19	@PoopyPeanuts @mralbionman my mind chased around this one sequence of thinking every 30 secs.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 21:05:25	@PoopyPeanuts @mralbionman I felt like I was disintegrating I was severe ly depressed. The world was black and chaitic
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 21:02:52	@PoopyPeanuts @mralbionman the first lasted abt 9 months it was the worst b/c I had no way of coping with the cheer terror.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:58:55	@swanners272 I am beginning to wonder if SSRIS and SSRns r beneficial for u.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:56:59	@FakeSmile222 good u r not a failure u r doing it tough but that is not failing.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:54:43	@mralbionman @poopypeanuts I say I have had 3 major breakdowns but I have had many prolonged panic stats
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:53:42	@mralbionman @poopypeanuts we're they accompanied by anxiety? Just curious what do u consider abreakdown?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:48:24	@FakeSmile222 no IMO life is to exist. It's a state not an acheivement IMO
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:46:43	@LexyWhispers I ma trying'
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:44:49	@swanners272 do u have any PRN u can take? Sometimes I find it provides the distance I need to grapple with angst
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:40:54	@LexyWhispers it'll last until tomorrow am if the pattern continues. But I think Ian gradually gaining some stabilty
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:38:40	@FakeSmile222 I know but it breaks my heart to think u feel like that. U can't b a failure at life. Life just is what is there to fail at
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:36:24	Sitting in bed feeling foolishly cheerful WHAT I S GOING ON?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:34:30	@FakeSmile222 the first I want u to do is change yr name sweet! It's just too negative
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:32:14	@autiepower well I feel fine now 'cause its the evening. This morn I felt like topping myself. I want off this roller coaster!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:30:54	@swanners272 keep reminding yrself it will pass. And tweeting is an excellent distraction:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 20:29:57	@swanners272 I know I think anxiety is the worst feeling. It strips u bare and all u can do is survive. But ...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:55:53	@swanners272 fingers crossed. If it wks it kicks in quite suddenly I found.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:53:50	@floridlymad well I was just a turtle hehehe
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:48:05	@BarbieBites @floridlymad relationships TNT all any the good times. S/times it's any weathering the rough patches
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:44:13	@swanners272 I hate that feeling. Don't wait longer than 4 weeks. It's not for everyone and u seem quit sensitive to A/DS.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:42:13	@misslolitalove @gingerlyrobin @mybipolarbrain if it works that's goid
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:40:39	Damn I caught the wrong train:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:40:04	@floridlymad @barbiebites I think it was very brave of u.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:38:26	@swanners272 is that Venlafaxine? It makes u anxious b4 it wks properly. A downer I know. Give it 4 wks
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:17:58	@owallflower happy birthday sweetie! Make it a gr8t day(()) xox
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:15:57	@swanners272 who is he if u pardon my ignorance?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:15:15	God some of the middle managers here r should be pushed off a cliff! Except they'd probably float they're so puffed up with sed imptnce
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-06 14:12:53	@floridlymad oh I'm not trying to trivialize yr exp. we all endure our own brand of misery

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-03 08:32:12	@Miss_Gibson91 in some ways it's the most tangible proof I'm not 'normal' crippling anxiety that seems to come out of the blue.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-03 07:28:28	@natasha_tracy u can still have valid opinions and not sidelined by others bc of BP.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-03 07:27:09	@natasha_tracy thxs good points. The issue is dealing with how other people view yr personality in view of yr illness.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-03 07:19:54	“@jglass79: @GameOfThrones Done, love the show cant wait for season2! #thekingsroad #gameofthrones ”yes!

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-03 07:15:06	@punkoj @mybipolarbrain @truthaboutcrazy the Sodium valproate helped curb the worst of the hyper mania ( over spending gambling etc)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-03 07:13:44	@punkoj @mybipolarbrain @truthaboutcrazy my dr seems to think it will help with. The depressive side of my moods.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-02 16:37:57	@autiepower @femaleptsd yeah that's really good advice. Finding the balance is the challenge
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-02 16:33:53	@MyBipolarBrain @punkoj @truthaboutcrazy do u think it wld work better than lithium. My dr wants me on lithium but I'm not keen:(

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 17:34:52	@LastSalmonMan well I guess that's why he's clueless!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 17:26:08	@LastSalmonMan has he still got one?

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 10:22:11	@BarbieBites @mindofmedusa they've only just started to realise the extent of my illness and it's effects. They don't ? Their behaviour.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 10:20:53	@BarbieBites half my family haven't spoken to me b/c of one outburst 5 yrs ago. I didn't even hit or break anything!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 10:18:42	@x_Hellenni_x I can't wait to retire! AND I have at least 6 yrs to go! How's that for pessimism:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 10:17:20	@SaltySmile yeah well a lot of ppl r more than willing to offload their shit like that. Try to resist the tempting to yield to guilt!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 10:15:39	@blissfulbluesGood for u! It's amazing how one success can spur u in:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 10:12:58	@Thewayimfeelin @barbiebites @mybipolarbrain Berr than Metal Hammer? Gosh very flattered!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 10:11:39	@Miss_Gibson91 maybe u just need a higher dose of Seroquel.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 10:10:43	@Miss_Gibson91 the one I'm on seems to curb the worst aspect of mania spending but not depression.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 10:09:51	@Miss_Gibson91 yes that!s what u take. I take another MS but Dr wants me in Lithium fit depression and anxiety.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 08:50:55	@Sectioned_ u have a right to feel angry.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 08:50:14	@Sectioned_ yeah weight gain can be really bad with just about all psych drugs. In reality they're pretty serious stuff.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 08:48:03	@BarbieBites @thewayimfeelin @mybipolarbrain it totally rocks. I live the series and the Lord John books too. DG is a gr8t author
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 08:46:29	@Truthaboutcrazy oh that's awful I hope u can calm down today. I find therapy makes me anxious. Thxs for the follow too
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 08:45:01	@Miss_Gibson91 if u don't mind me asking what dose RY in now? I have just started on it so I'm not just curious.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 08:43:26	@MyBipolarBrain yeah we'd go crazy hahahs!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 08:43:04	@KismetLady thxs I don't mean to whinge so. I rapid cycle so my mood in the mornings is never that good.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:58:04	@MyBipolarBrain I know love we all work so hard grappling with our demons that's venting here is so good
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:56:59	@MyBipolarBrain messy messier and messiest. That is kinda awkward
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:54:42	@MyBipolarBrain but he makes u feel ynconfortable
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:50:38	@MyBipolarBrain do u think he's just trying to be nice? Tentatively suggested
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:47:56	Huge of sigh of resignation/quiet misery/ god is there a future?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:46:14	Well I feel like a bad of pooh today not happy sick of moods. I just want to get on with life w/out it being a drama in my head!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:45:00	@MyBipolarBrain yeah I think it makes me feel shit too but try to remember whether the trigger is worth the angst. Not preaching though
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:27:45	@Miss_Gibson91 hang in there just take enough to get a good sleep that's what u need by the sound of it.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:26:17	@MyBipolarBrain ha that's one advantage of mood swings if u no the right triggers:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:24:23	@owallflower u go girl!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:24:08	@GingerSeer I want to hide in a dark room and never come out.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:23:38	@GingerSeer somehow the meds help but knowing I am taking them make me anxious too. I feel e/ thing is too bright.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:22:34	@GingerSeer yeah I am still on edge with tingling all over my body.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:15:18	@crazywhisperer my sister's wedding anniversary is on the 39 February she has only been married about '5' years:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:13:19	@GingerSeer I ruined mine well at least half of it by being an anxious wreck.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:09:43	@WelshSwan I can't even watch my team ( except my daughters soccer). If my ftball tram is losing I meltdown!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:07:58	@BarbieBites hugs headaches r bad enough migraines r a nightmare(()))
393296907	garbosmc	2012-02-01 06:07:58	There a guy opposite me on the train wearing a t shirt saying 'Be True'easy to say so hard to do ( sigh)

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:40:02	@NoahJ69 well dear back at work now so on the treadmill. The best thing is that I have confronted my fears
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:38:07	@swanners272 u were hearing voices? Have u changed meds yet?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:36:06	@unbalancedAbby men r really hard to buy presents for
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:35:16	@NoahJ69 good evening:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:34:07	@amy_geek cool!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:30:52	@oxymoronic82 aww u need a cuddle and a good cupoa!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:26:42	@Thewayimfeelin sweetheart what do u do? If I may ask
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:23:43	@KismetLady brrrr and it was 20 here and I thought that was cold!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:21:03	@Thewayimfeelin yes u r my echo I still feel that way but I am going to make myself relevant
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:18:09	@Thewayimfeelin that's how I felt last year! It's not true u know.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:14:21	@BarbieBites @mybipolarbrain I've done both and I agree. The connection with tr own offspring is powerful.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:11:03	@MentallyGB gosh that's hard I hope u feel better soon(())
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:09:21	@swanners272 I can bring anxiety into line eventually but it seems to b s/thing I can't control occurring. It's very frustrating.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:07:45	@swanners272 ok I am edgy but much better just ruined my hols. I know it's irrational but it's like a beast
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 21:06:04	@MarkPacitti It's gr8t to see a bloke encouraging others to seek treatment
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 20:21:37	@MarkPacitti whilst this relieves anxiety and depression it can have adverse effects upon my behaviour.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 20:20:50	@MarkPacitti thxs I will read with interest. Unfortunately b/c I suffer from Bipolar illness A/DS have a tendency to send me hypo manic:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 20:11:39	@suicidaholic it's always hard changing therapists u need to build up trust.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 20:10:48	@SaltySmile more in the anticipation it will take a while to settle down but I have to work:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 20:09:40	@blissfulblues I know just sing to yrself Bob the Builder can we do it yes we can!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 20:08:36	@BarbieBites but thanks:) I now have some strategies I have mustered over that time. X
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 20:05:34	@BarbieBites thanks unfortunately it has been s/ thing I have lived for at least 20 years
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 15:01:10	@blissfulblues it's taken the best part of 3 wks to calm down!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 15:00:31	@blissfulblues it's weird but it happened tome too. I was in a cafe tlkg about wk and I melted down.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 14:58:27	@BarbieBites oh so do I or sit on the end of the table. My stress levels rise on public transport too.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 14:17:23	@SaltySmile survived my first day of work so ok thxs

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 14:16:46	@BarbieBites @hellenni_x they suck do much. Leach joy out of life. I feel I ruined over 2 wks of hols being so anxious. Not fair:/

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 10:58:02	@BarbieBites @mybipolarbrain yes they take it very personally when it might b more ant what u need
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 10:55:57	@SaltySmile well that's sort of what yv been doing on twitter. I am far more honest here than I am anywhere else..

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 10:53:05	@suicidaholic why? Have u run out of sessions?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 10:28:28	@BarbieBites @mybipolarbrain HOSP blew! They're like airports u lose control of person and b/come dependent on other to provide basics
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-31 10:23:18	@SamCruff @sum_of_us done i

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 08:49:52	@Miss_Gibson91 just worried how I will go after the recent panic episode. Just got to give it a go.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 08:48:46	@Miss_Gibson91 I am a bit anxious I go back to work next week and I've been on hols since Christmas.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 07:56:56	@NoahJ69 I know I always feel a bit of a hypocrite but I know the advice is true
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 07:55:12	@quendrida try to cut off catastrophic thinking? Remember u r doing nothing u haven't done b4.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 07:53:58	@quendrida I suggest u break what u have to do into manageable parts. Make a list of what u have to do to move. Don't forget ur gd support.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 07:52:13	@quendrida I'm hopeless. So if I am hopeless ahhhhh. I' m hopeless I can't do anything! U see?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 07:51:16	@quendrida Iona all those feelings r so familiar. The garble dwnwd spiral of I'm so anxious how can I do anything? If I can't do anything..
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 07:47:46	@Ellenaauw two factors caused me to start drinking 1. My then partner drank heavily 2 later anti depressant seemed to turn me to alcohol.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 07:46:22	@Ellenaauw yes I have drunk too much for occasional periods in the past. Now I just have a few drinks on wknd.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 07:39:07	@mythoughtandI I think that's the nub of it. So many people want to be free of fear. That's often unrealistic.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 07:37:37	@StevensMyName does that mean u won't tweet anymore:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-25 07:34:39	@AlbertBrooks @ReelTalker too true or maybe just the media in general aka News Ltd.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-24 19:00:00	@marielouiseplum @wfaclub congrats:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-24 18:59:15	@quendrida it's a fickle beast. Why r u so worried abt moving. B/c leaving parents home?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-24 18:58:16	@quendrida anxiety always passes or at least ease. It's-

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-24 00:41:29	@MyBipolarBrain but I think it needs to be honed far more than it present is.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-24 00:40:11	@swanners272 I attend to but I am almost incapable of editing my own work for some reason.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-24 00:19:56	@MyBipolarBrain I wondered if there was potential for such a technique to be applied to ppl suffering mental illnesses that cycle/repeat
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-24 00:17:09	@MyBipolarBrain use other other undamaged parts of brains. In effect they form new neural pathways for the functions lost...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-24 00:15:41	@MyBipolarBrain ok. By analogy I considered the treatment of stroke victims and how they rehabilitate ppl 2

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-19 07:51:06	@natasha_tracy #mental health I agree thAt subjectively the worst mental is yr worst. But the rate of suicide for ED is heartbreaking.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-18 09:04:02	A good therapist will tailor a program to yr needs. Above all we remain unique Iill or otherwise. That must recognized and respected
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-18 09:01:16	@suicidaholic @thewayimfeelin ur not Robinson carusoe:) even the Dr's are quibbling over it
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-18 07:28:18	@KismetLady hi KismetLady thanks for following me:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-18 07:21:49	@suicidaholic @thewayimfeelin u may come under a broad class but there's no one size fits all program IMO
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-18 07:21:02	@suicidaholic not in denial but everyone experiences mental illness differently.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-18 07:20:14	@suicidaholic @thewayimfeelin it's a bit like any tag. I 'm almost thinking of removing it from my profile.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-18 07:18:27	@LastSalmonMan @gingerseer @mybipolarbrain @barbiebites sash I see there been some action while I've been catching a few zzzzz:)

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-18 07:12:53	@grizzlybaz I assume u've read the CMI so u u will be alert for any side effects. Of course there's always a risks is suggestion then.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 21:07:06	@grizzlybaz if u had one on Prozac be wary of SSRIs (Prozac is of that class of drugs)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 21:05:41	@NoahJ69 leighton Hewitt and some German guy. Hewitt won in 4 set after being down 2 games inthe 4th
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 19:58:20	@NoahJ69 @wtfuckfacts lolololol:::)))
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 19:57:43	@NoahJ69 good evening to u watching the tennis at the mo
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 19:56:44	@GingerlyRobin can Hewitt do it?! He chokes so often!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 19:27:32	My daughter is reading her diary to me so sweet
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 19:10:49	@FemalePTSD cool I love that stuff!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:56:50	@grizzlybaz normally a fairly reserved person too
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:56:18	@grizzlybaz and obviously it didn't:( I have done some pretty OTT things in the past. Too embarrassed to say.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:54:12	@FemalePTSD I just din't know. I just intend to do my best! I hate feeling helpless!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:53:04	@GingerlyRobin that's a cool place in more than one sense of the word
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:48:41	@grizzlybaz I'd seek more info if I were u. The problem is that suffers seek treatment when down. It appears like deprsn.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:43:14	@grizzlybaz I gambled way $30,000 so ashamed:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:41:43	@quendrida @mentallygb hope she rings soon
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:40:37	@FemalePTSD much better thxs:) I am so tired of this rapid cycling business!

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:36:15	@grizzlybaz it seem so obvious now. I keep a mood diary and I can see my moods shifting. Very unstable at the mo.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:35:17	@grizzlybaz I went hyper manic if not worse on the last AD. S/times it's via the failure of ADs thT they reach a diagnosis of BPD.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:24:00	@FemalePTSD ((hugs))
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:19:03	@grizzlybaz now off ADs and on anti convulsants and a little bit of Seroquel. Valium as PRN.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:17:44	@grizzlybaz I'm booked into a ten wk course at a private clinic here. Misdiagnosis has lead to me deteriorating lately

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 18:15:11	@oxymoronic82 soooo much better I can't believe. I don't know whether it's the Seroquel or I just got thru

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 17:14:59	@grizzlybaz when u r up it almost impossible to imagine being down and vise versa.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 17:12:39	@GingerlyRobin watching the Hewitt game now. He just won the set. I don't think Hewitt can do it

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 06:30:03	@SaltySmile @thewayimfeelin I think there must have been something bad in the atmosphere these last days:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 06:25:58	@NoahJ69 oh how very royal:) my Nana had Corfu called Taffy. 'cause they're a Welsh breed.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 06:24:33	@Thewayimfeelin still anxious or just miserable? A bath is a good idea it is soothing. I'm off for a shower.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 06:12:26	@Thewayimfeelin I need to get up. I plan to at 9.30am. I suspect staying in bed may increase anxiety.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 06:11:07	@NoahJ69 hey u have a dog right. What breed?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 06:10:00	@Thewayimfeelin how bad is the downer? D u have s/ one to turn to close by?

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 05:52:22	@fireryhart u know it's very common amongst authors to suffer writer's block. U may be reading too much into it

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 05:43:45	@oxymoronic82 Sophie the worst part for me is I know that and then I crash and ca't imagine it. Cruel and inhumane either way.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 05:41:58	@fireryhart less worry have some faith a lot of writers have to have a few go's b4 published.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 05:40:19	@StevensMyName I responded as soon as I cld but I think time zones can be an issue. It is early morning here and I have just woken up.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-17 05:37:52	@LastSalmonMan because the debate distracted me and got me out of my miserable thoughts.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 08:24:34	@floridlymad had to deal with a lot of ENTJs very bossy and INTJs often good ppl but seem distant.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 08:21:32	@autiepower thanks I've replied appreciate the advice. Ox
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:54:54	@floridlymad @gingerlyrobin @saltysmile @punkoj I am close INFP.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:53:24	@autiepower I have DM u. Hope u don't mind just looking for advice.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:32:21	Have to get up 10.30. Been awake since 7.30am. Must make an effort.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:29:21	@LastSalmonMan :( I won't mention it again. Don't they say never talk about politics and religion. Maybe that includes tweets.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:25:29	@LastSalmonMan sorry being further away I was behind the convo. Wasn't trying to flog a dead horse:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:23:24	@LastSalmonMan I think u argued pretty well myself. It went off the rails somewhere.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:20:38	@LastSalmonMan @bipolar2gurl and even that is now being challenged by quantum physics. Science is a work in progress.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:19:17	@LastSalmonMan @bipolar2gurl which head successfully challenged by Einstein's law of Relarivity.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:17:46	@LastSalmonMan @bipolar2gurl the best example that has been rewritten is Newton's law of Physics which has been ...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:15:53	@LastSalmonMan but nothing is set in stone in science when it is used and conducted properly.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:14:56	@LastSalmonMan I think this argument has degraded somewhat. Evolution in scientific parlance is an established theory.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:02:20	@LastSalmonMan @bipolar2gurl there is a lot of unhealthy rivalry in science. This can acre the 'facts'.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 07:00:42	@LastSalmonMan @bipolar2gurli like that as a creed. Sort it of karmic what comes around goes around.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:54:58	@bipolar2gurl @lastsalmonman yes religion is tinderbox for wars and cultural bias.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:48:50	@BipolarChatroom yes it is. I' m having a rough week but I can go for months without feeling really bad.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:46:50	@oxymoronic82 @gingerlyrobin I think it might be best to let it grow organically.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:44:49	Woke up early feeling dreadful. Do u think I should take PRN. I felt so much better last night. I hate mornings
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:43:23	@bipolar2gurl @lastsalmonman at age 11. It dictated what type of high school children went to. Their futures.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:41:28	@bipolar2gurl @lastsalmonman it depends on your viewpoint. In UK kids were given botched IQ. Which...
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:40:05	@bipolar2gurl @lastsalmonman no u have too much to give to do that.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:33:23	@bipolar2gurl and ut's personal thing I understand that. Faith can heal I do not debt that. It's complex.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:30:10	@MyBipolarBrain damn I was too late!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:28:23	@MyBipolarBrain sapphic girl wonder
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:24:49	@Miss_Gibson91 oh an international one?:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:24:04	@autiepower thanks I've woken up pretty uptight. I am tingling and burning in my too of head, arms and chest plus pains. Pure anxiety.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:18:43	@spareribBellamy oh I'm so sorry. That must be so hard for both u.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:14:26	@Miss_Gibson91 I think it's like a placebo if u believe in it it nay work. But behind is the power of the mind to heal itself.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:10:23	@oxymoronic82 I thought it was kinda nice but I was a little afraid u had been taken icicle by a bot
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:08:22	@LastSalmonMan yep can't argue with that. Science is just a modern version of religion.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:06:58	@BipolarChatroom hi thxs for following me
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:05:59	@owallflower just so disappointing. I just have to work my way through it
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:05:05	@owallflower I just ask cause I have to go back to work. I was feeling great 5 days ago but I have crashed now in a panic state.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-16 06:02:41	@BBlluurryy73 @Miss_Gibson91 I just read your blog on mixed states. So familiar mine can go for days (and s/times weeks).
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 22:09:12	@LastSalmonMan it's a matter of science versus religion u get to choose:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 22:01:22	@fireryhart yes don't give up. U can get thru the tunnel((hugs))
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:55:54	@LastSalmonMan that uses an outrage!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:54:01	@FakeSmile222 that'll work everything!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:50:26	@autiepower btw taking daily but not permanently.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:49:25	@autiepower oh damn so it's like anti dep. I was hoping it would work quicker. It's ruining my hols!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:44:10	@LastSalmonMan RCA are full of shit anyways.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:38:38	@LastSalmonMan don't change! Just be yourself it's too damned hard being otherwise anyway.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:34:48	@owallflower what do u do? I work for the public service.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:29:52	@autiepower still a bit shaky but I did some wii fit stuff and gardening. And how r u?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:28:19	@autiepower hi Hun a little better no much I think took the 25mg and woke up at 10am.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:27:05	@FakeSmile222 still puts the day on the wrong footing. Don't know about u but I am very reactive
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:24:10	@LastSalmonMan I thought you were over women
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:18:55	@FakeSmile222 and whose doing the shouting? It!s never helpful
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:13:36	@floridlymad is that mere coincidence.... Or something deeper....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:11:13	@floridlymad u know I'm been shocked how many RLPs have been in the same boat when I've confided.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:09:40	@Behind_Facade it's warm here now
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:08:44	@oxymoronic82 something to do with peckers:)
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:08:03	@FakeSmile222 not sure what that means?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:05:33	@MentallyGB have u got plans for the day. Something u enjoy
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:02:19	@MentallyGB hi Hun how's it going for u today?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:01:41	@oxymoronic82 but you have created something 'bigger' than u. Oils have imagined!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:00:23	@LastSalmonMan :(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 21:00:01	@thescarecrow_ I just dread because I think too my h lying awake
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 20:58:32	#TwitterPsychWard any support is better than doing it alone. That is where I have gone wrong in the past.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 20:51:20	@spareribBellamy his meds sound dreadful. What do u think is causing such a reaction? It's not right
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 20:48:40	@owallflower I'm intrigued !
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 20:45:19	@oxymoronic82 see u r a superstar! #TwitterBuddyScheme
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 20:44:08	@MikaFreak123 yeah I've read some pretty outrageous posts about Seroquel and alcohol. I mean OTT I just want a drink or 2 in wknds.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 20:35:25	@oxymoronic82 hi how r u today. Did u get a good rest yesterday?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 20:34:22	@floridlymad ha I told u vigorous exercise to improve yr core ha ha!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 17:24:16	@MikaFreak123 it's madness! Pardon the pun
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 17:23:21	@floridlymad it's the manic aspect I have release the energy
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 17:22:17	@floridlymad at the mo I am only taking 25mg Seroquel andValium up to 20 mg a day (which u never do). I try to battle thru but.....
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 17:20:00	@floridlymad I. Old uses one of that now. Very guilty about taking tranqs
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 17:07:49	@MikaFreak123 thanks for that. Have u ever drunk alcohol as well. Not that I do enjoy a drink on the weekends.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 16:31:36	@floridlymad exactly. My best resort is vigorous exercise. And a bad habit of huddling in bed!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 16:26:33	General question does anyone know how long it takes Seroqel to work. Is it like anti depressants and have to build up in yr bloodstream?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 16:24:32	@floridlymad I have tried CBT as an 'amateur it works when I'm mildly anxious but not when I am in a manic panic state
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 16:22:11	@Kimmittable @LastSalmonMan so true. Haven't felt it for a long time though. That's old age:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 16:18:24	@bipolar2gurl r u having a bad day hun?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 16:13:49	@floridlymad @saltysmile @punkoj @barbiebites do you think DBT is better than CBT? My sr advocates mindfulness every day.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 16:06:03	@LastSalmonMan excel lent advice!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 16:01:57	@Ellenaauw I've been taking 5 -10 (s/times15mgs but rarely. For almost 9 months. It does lose its porency

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 15:09:09	@LastSalmonMan thxs for letting me know that, some ppl more fkd than others.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 15:05:30	@SaltySmile yeah it's like being up and down at the same time. Eg misery but racing thiyghts

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 14:19:04	Yes, yes and yes to all of those. Mind you the hardest thing is telling someone they have bad breathe

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 11:41:35	@BarbieBites oh that's fine just curious to 'see' who I am talking to but don't want pressure anyone.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-15 08:25:50	Godcmorning! Well I think 25mg Seroqel is much better. Still a bit tense but not panicking and I woke up at 10.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-14 19:43:37	@autiepower have u taken it? I will reduce the dose to 25mg. I just wish the anxiety would go.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-14 16:34:22	#bipolar I felt ok after I got up and did some gardening but still a bit shaky and anxious. Hope it improves soon.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-14 12:48:58	#bipolar I think I will try 25mg instead.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-14 12:48:15	#bipolar well I think 50 mg of Seroquek might be a wee bit too much for me. Dealt with the anxiety but couldn't gy out of bed till 3.30pm!

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 15:34:55	@Miss_Gibson91 it's not the quantity of the followers it's the quality. It seems to me u have formed a solid support group. Well donrc

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 11:25:43	@andbenrow I have had days where I just don't care but feel so guilty at the same time.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 11:23:23	@andbenrow if I may ask why?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 11:12:57	Now I'm going to fill out my mood diary I am so behind:(
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 11:11:58	@andbenrow try to do something distracting or relaxing. I know it's hard when yr kids are at go home.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 11:09:18	“@ReyCutts: RT if you have 30lbs or more to lose! I need people to follow!”yes but I want to a healthy weight not skinny
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 11:07:27	But it rips me up inside.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 11:06:56	Had a dreadful night felt so depressed and angry. I take fighting really badly. It's not that I'm afraid of conflict.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 10:59:09	@BarbieBites I love white noise. I g Have an overhead fan I run at night.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 10:57:41	@GingerSeer those speeches e so predictable and boring! I find
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 10:56:42	Yeah I hate that my partner can lay his head down and be snoring in secs. And then complain in the morning he didn't sleep well.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 00:10:33	@Fallen2Darkness do u have a psych or therapist?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 00:08:38	@FemalePTSD what happened?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 00:07:15	@Miss_Gibson91 gr8t!
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 00:05:21	@autiepower my dr days I can take up to 6 a day if absolutely necessary. I can't imagine doing that. I would feel like such a failure.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 00:02:31	@Fallen2Darkness u r making the first step and being honest about it. Does your family know or care? Do u have help?
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-08 00:00:25	@oxymoronic82 I used to have to go conferences a lot I always ended up with a knotted tun. Took me ages to work out it was anxiety
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-07 23:58:54	@oxymoronic82 I am wither too talkative too quiet or say rhe wrong thing.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-07 23:57:38	@quendrida Effexor makes u very hungry and it's a butch to withdraw from I know. On and off it several times.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-07 23:54:32	@autiepower to know it will pass any pens are a bit of a luxury. I've had 3 major breakdowns and I'm still here
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-07 23:52:45	@autiepower it's really me not wanting to take more meds. I've got so used to high levels of anxiety. The trick is not to to be afraid.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-07 23:48:20	@autiepower A. I no die me they send NW manic - mixed episodes. I mead r rhe. Hard wag
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-07 23:09:29	@autiepower assumed I suffered from depression. But I call them black frenzys when they spin out of control.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-07 23:08:24	@autiepower mostly I try to tough it out. I never had much pens until 6 months ago. Drs just wouldn't take my anxiety seriously.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-07 23:06:41	@autiepower just Valium 5 mg
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-07 23:05:56	@Miss_Gibson91 how u doin hun. Do u need to keep chatting. U sound in a bad way.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-07 23:04:12	@Miss_Gibson91 I am reading and sulking at the mo. Very mature of me! Hey bipolar2gurl is in a bad way tonite too,

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-07 22:39:17	@oxymoronic82 good analogy I find dealing with people is like wearing a wooly jumper

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-05 01:37:20	@sgbrownlow to suggest you are motivated to dissociate is an oxymoron
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-05 01:36:05	@sgbrownlow so true it happens without conscious effort.
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-05 01:34:29	@Miss_Gibson91 now on mood stabilizer but still on edge all the time. Feel like a UXB
393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-05 01:33:26	@Miss_Gibson91 really melted down. Went off meds b/ c they weren't helping. Antidepressants

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-05 01:26:14	@FionaArt at least grief is a natural response. I can only think it would intensify depression.

393296907	garbosmc	2012-01-05 01:22:03	It's funny when I go start rapid cycling and mixed episodes I need darkness and silence. Light freaks me out

393296907	garbosmc	2011-12-24 21:56:28	@BipolarGirl82 yep' cause any attention is better than none to a 6 yr old
393296907	garbosmc	2011-12-24 21:53:51	Sorry sounding like a misery guts. My achievement? Made all the desserts for family Christmas
393296907	garbosmc	2011-12-24 21:51:45	@MiaVee it's been the lack of support. I spent 5 in hosp and. I no one even rang or visited
393296907	garbosmc	2011-12-24 21:48:57	I think my faith in drug treatments is pretty low at Rhett's no and my partner and family are pretty negative about it
393296907	garbosmc	2011-12-24 21:46:29	@BipolarGirl82 I gain weight on every drug. Also I feel like a walking chemical factory.
393296907	garbosmc	2011-12-24 21:45:04	@MiaVee sorry I meant my neice
393296907	garbosmc	2011-12-24 21:43:42	@Miss_Gibson91 some women take to mhood I struggle

393296907	garbosmc	2011-12-24 21:36:18	@BipolarGirl82 I am on Epilin now but my dr wants to put me in lithium as well. I am not keen
393296907	garbosmc	2011-12-24 21:34:03	@TheBlueRhino_ yeah treatment helps but I went misdiagnosed for 20 years. Anti depressants made it worse but they seemed ok at first
393296907	garbosmc	2011-12-24 21:30:56	@Miss_Gibson91 I spend at least a month stressing over my daughter's birthday
393296907	garbosmc	2011-12-24 21:27:14	@BipolarGirl82 yeah I didn't get a correct diagnosis until 6 months ago. Aropax and cynbaulta almost killed me
