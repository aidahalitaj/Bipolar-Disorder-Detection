304020839	fellownerdling	2016-12-20 18:34:44	@realDonaldTrump You do realise the terrorist attack in Switzerland was committed against 3 muslims who were praying? And not by ISIS?
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-12-20 18:30:22	Today 'we're' ignoring the 3 muslims shot while praying, possibly in retaliation for attacks like the one in #Berlin . Hate begets hate.

304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-25 02:20:56	@david66073509 Because they're not that intelligent - they struggle to think for themselves, so just spout rhetoric as it's all they 'know'.

304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-25 00:57:07	@CarlosKillface you achieve it, and how is the government going to achieve it? You apparently voted for a plan, so what is it?
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-25 00:56:17	@CarlosKillface So what's the plan then? Step-by-step and in details please. Not "I voted [right-wing buzzword]". The actual plan. How will

304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-25 00:54:19	@CarlosKillface @david66073509 So basically you have nothing. Like all dim-witted trolls you hide behind a fake profile and spout nothing
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-25 00:53:20	@CarlosKillface Really? Explain to me - extensively - what specifics and step-by-step processes and policies exist in this plan, then.
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-25 00:48:13	@CarlosKillface And if you're justifying the murder, you're as bad as her killer is.
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-25 00:47:46	@CarlosKillface If someone is being murdered because you're stupid enough to vote for a non-existent plan, you *should* feel bad.
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-25 00:45:31	@david66073509 Yep. IMO all it has done so far is wreck our government and economy, and cause unbelievable animosity on both sides.

304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-25 00:35:41	Why? Because that would mean that the @DailyMailUK would have to admit their hero Farage is radicalising terrorists with lies over Brexit. https:// twitter.com/guardian/statu s/801825047350542336 …

304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 19:12:28	@deller_mark If you've done nothing wrong, you should expect to be treated that way. You shouldn't have to live under the assumption you

304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 19:07:44	@deller_mark nothing to hide, after all. You don't need any privacy!
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 19:07:26	@deller_mark why even shut your front door? Why not allow people to freely walk all around your house and go through your things? You've
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 19:06:50	@deller_mark and it's not catastrophising - you should have the right not to be spied on if you're innocent. If you're that unbothered by it
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 19:04:12	@deller_mark Well if it won't happen until you do something wrong, they don't need the bill do they? They can do what you're saying now...
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 18:11:49	@deller_mark that doesn't mean you should expect to have all your privacy freely violated.
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 18:10:58	@deller_mark I assume if she asks for the key to your house, you'll hand it over without protest. You may not have "something to hide" but
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 08:31:24	@ChristoHaunted Allegedly it is still one of these "only if we need to" scenarios, but if that were the case, they don't need the law anyway
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 08:29:53	@ChristoHaunted around, they may do a 180 so quick it'll make your head spin! What do they say about being able to dish it but not take it?
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 08:28:54	@ChristoHaunted On the other hand, the second a group like Anonymous hack and release a shit load of private information MPs have floating
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 08:27:59	@ChristoHaunted to decrypt it. It's a no win situation. But if they see you encrypting things, you're (probably) more likely to be watched.
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 08:26:44	@ChristoHaunted If it can be encrypted, it can be decrypted. The likelihood would be you'd be charged with a criminal offence if you refused
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-11-01 08:22:27	@ChristoHaunted That'll most likely put you on a watch list... and be pointless as they'll be required by law to decrypt them.

304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 18:34:13	@HayleighFlak I think Asylum was my favourite overall, but I agree that the alien storyline was totally surplus to the main story.
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 18:18:18	Good morning Bristol. May your mornings be grey and your pigeons many!
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 07:05:28	@HayleighFlak Personally I thought her best role was Misty Day, but she was great in Asylum. Sister Jude was Jessica Lange's masterpiece!
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 06:16:07	@HayleighFlak but again I thought he was always a bit samey - although I thought he really pulled it out of the bag in Hotel.
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 06:15:24	@HayleighFlak I like Jessica Lange a lot, but you know she's *always* the bad guy where as FC plays a whole ranger of characters. I like EP
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 06:10:21	@HayleighFlak always completely different - a lot of them tend to play the same type of character over and over.
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 06:09:52	@HayleighFlak I think Frances Conroy is my favourite actress in every season she's in. IMHO she is the best actress, her characters are
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 06:00:28	@HayleighFlak Fiona Goode kicked ass, but I'm afraid Myrtle Snow was my favourite that season. For the comedy alone!
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 05:57:34	@HayleighFlak wondering if Gaga's witch is a ghost or possibly the original 'Supreme' which ties it back to Coven somehow?
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 05:56:48	@HayleighFlak I *think* the ghosts are the original tribe. The pig-man is a ghost(?), the rednecks are... well, redneck cannibals(?). I'm
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 05:55:44	@HayleighFlak monster. Maybe a werewolf or the mummy or something.
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 05:54:47	@HayleighFlak concentrated on ghosts. Although they didn't need to do a haunted house so soon, IMO. I'd love it if they did a classic
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 05:54:07	@HayleighFlak going to explode. TBH, I think they'd have managed something scarier if they had just kept the documentary concept and
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 05:52:21	@HayleighFlak I'm so confused. There are ghosts, 2 (?) sets of murderous rednecks, the pig man, and then people killing people. My head is
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 05:43:57	@HayleighFlak The concept was such a great idea... I just can't help but feel it seems to have gotten a little lost.

304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-29 05:42:24	@zimgodesstweets Yeah, I know what you mean. The idea they had this season was great, as was the twist. But now it seems to have spiralled

304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-25 05:12:59	@Jennibopscouse or lower him feet first into a wood-chipper!! My heart rate has still not subsided!
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-25 05:09:14	"Has #TheWalkingDead gone too far with the violence?" It's a show about a zombie apocalypse. You've literally seen them eat people alive!
304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-25 05:07:08	@Jennibopscouse I hope Maggie finds a chainsaw and splits the fucker from bollocks to skull!!

304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-25 03:38:34	@Tesco date isn't going to hook-up with him while he's serving us so he may as well focus on the job in hand... excuse the pun.

304020839	fellownerdling	2016-10-24 07:37:20	@TUID the trick is buying a lot of crap over a very long period and then throwing it all into one space without paying any attention! ;)
