66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 14:17:19	@Rebellionista That I've been? The Amazon rainforest. 5 minutes there and you think you're going to die.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 14:10:55	@Rebellionista I've been there before. 2nd scariest place on earth TBH.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 14:07:01	@Rebellionista If I see it I'm not going near it. It's the ones that you don't see that get you.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:52:56	Not sure if it's bad parenting but I let my kids stay up as late as they want as long as they don't have school the next day.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:50:17	People say @amazon Prime is awesome yet this happens 50% of the time when I order. pic.twitter.com/Ccl9DXEB1N
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:47:10	My new goal is to have hair like this so that I can hide my face. Halfway there. pic.twitter.com/PCoh0pk8wo
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:46:18	@Rebellionista Yes I would. They eat the rats! I have a rat phobia because I was bit by one as a kid.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:44:24	@Rebellionista I prefer snakes.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:44:10	@JoetheSicilian It was weird that they released it on the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney's death. I bet it made him roll over in his grave.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:42:22	@Rebellionista I hate rats!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:41:32	I've noticed that a lot of people have been on vacations away from twitter this month.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:26:11	@leah_michal What!? I'm sorry
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:24:38	I bet Alec Baldwin is praying that Trump is in office for 8 years. He needs that SNL money.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:20:47	I bet it sucks to be a person who had a popular meme made of them.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:15:04	@Cap_Kaveman A lot of people say that it's not Christmas until Hans Gruber falls from Nakatomi Tower.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:12:06	@Ihatethisugh1 I go back to work in eight hours so I probably should go to bed soon.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:11:09	@Mandaohfive Let me know if it's any good. It looks interesting.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:09:48	I just got off of work. How is everyone else's Saturday going?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 13:07:47	@jaklumen @LAYS iI actually kind of tastes like what it's supposed to be.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 04:09:00	@EleanorSegall Thanks! I have Monday off.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 04:05:28	@JoetheSicilian Me? pic.twitter.com/bfkYwAKHH4
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 04:04:47	@Crymsen_Skye @LAYS It's growing on me. Way better than any of the other new flavors.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 04:03:59	@EleanorSegall I work every weekend
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 04:02:47	Biscuits and gravy @LAYS tastes kinda weird.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 02:53:37	Shout out to @USPS @UPS & @FedEx workers. They are working super hard this time of year and are rarely thanked.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-18 02:28:12	I'm worried that my dog might be sick too.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 14:08:22	#ParanormalLockdown is so bad I'm waiting for @Kia to sponsor a ghost.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 13:03:27	Never cry over spilled milk because you're lucky it could've been beer.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 12:59:25	Please stop using the words "Trump taps" it conjures up really disgusting thoughts… https:// twitter.com/AP/status/8099 85988722356224 …

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 12:39:30	Why doesn't @BillGates send me stuff? I never got anything from my Reddit Secret Santa's http://www. 12news.com/opinion/talker /reddit-user-gets-bill-gates-as-her-secret-santa/372004096?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5854c07604d3012f6967e6dc&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter …

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 12:15:49	I really don't like the fluctuation in my 401(k) plan. I really need to fix this soon…
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 12:04:46	@Rebellionista Awesome. Those things are expensive!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 12:03:58	@Ihatethisugh1 I need to have that type of thinking more often.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 11:49:27	Also, an edit option would be nice.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 11:49:01	Twitter should always give you a short summary on why something is trending so that you don't have to click the link.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 11:47:04	I wonder if I will do anything big enough to where at least my great-grandchildren will remember my name.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 11:45:02	@HarleyQuinnRN I know it has to be hard to be in that situation. You are awesome for being able to raise those kids by yourself.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 11:42:25	@HarleyQuinnRN I almost did that when I went off my meds. My wife would have had to raise 3 kids alone. I feel bad about it now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 11:40:48	@HarleyQuinnRN I know if I ever lost @ErinLand20 I'd never remarry.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 11:39:49	@kimlockhartga Really? I thought it had carbs. Guess I can put it on the menu now.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 11:06:00	@nativeangelaz I'm just spending $50 a kid. Even that put's me on PB&J until the 1st though. Have decent food for the kids though...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 10:59:03	@Rebellionista Sorry. I'm glad you have pain meds.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 10:57:30	@nativeangelaz I agree. I wish we could take a break from bills in December.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 10:43:09	@Rebellionista I always look and sometimes they trigger me.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 10:42:41	@Rebellionista It's an antibiotic used for treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 10:41:50	Guess who figured out Blues Clues? Not me. That show is for rocket scientists when you have been drinking.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 10:35:46	@Rebellionista You still get them from people you follow. I just want a break from DM's not looking to unfollow people.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 10:17:42	I'm pretty sure that everyone can agree with this. pic.twitter.com/GvdXVSZIEq
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 10:09:41	Is there anyway to turn off DM's?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 10:01:10	Time for Cops! I don't know why I'm obsessed with this TV show.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:58:40	I thought it was supposed to be cold. It is 77° right now in my house.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:54:11	I'm starting to think I pay for cable just to have background noise while I'm on the computer.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:46:12	Windows ten sucks. I hate that it keeps trying to get me to use Edge.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:44:31	@Rebellionista How's the pain level btw?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:43:53	Might have bought too big of a dog bone. My dog looks like he has a dinosaur bone right now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:41:37	@Rebellionista Be sure to get lots of pics because time goes by so fast and I'm sure you're going to want to remember it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:39:49	@Rebellionista I can't imagine how hard that is. I know you can find a way to make it special for the two of you.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:36:50	I know how hard this time of year is so if anyone is having trouble dealing with Christmas I'm here if you need to talk to someone.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:34:03	Christmas used to be super hard for me mentally until I decided to try to make every Christmas special for my kids.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:29:27	@Rebellionista I'm here if you need to talk.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:29:03	@Rebellionista I will get the things my kids make but that's it. Never celebrated Christmas as a kid.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:28:25	@Rebellionista I hope you feel better. You are important to me and I really don't want you to feel that way.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:23:16	@AmbAdAstra Yep. I can't wait for Cops to come on tonight so I can change the channel.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 09:20:44	I, Frankenstein was such a crap movie.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 08:17:09	@xxhatred Awesome! That took a long time.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 08:15:22	Watching the 25 days of Christmas on @FreeformTV is a pretty good way to spend my nights.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 08:08:52	I want the @FBI and @CIA to follow me on @twitter so I can show my therapist I wasn't lying about getting followed

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 06:27:05	@TubingTyler @purple_n_orange It depends. They may have a breathing issue triggered by the pepper spray. Happens on Cops.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 06:23:33	Shockingly I stayed within my #Christmas budget. One of the benefits of being #Poor is that you watch stuff like that.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 06:02:16	Watching Hitler's Messiah Complex on AHC. I love these types of shows.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 05:58:19	@Rebellionista Me too! Makes me feel like I failed as a parent.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 05:54:59	@Ihatethisugh1 I know but there's no redo. We're stuck with Trump so might as well just be quiet and gear up for 2020.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 05:40:21	We have Pokémon Go and Super Mario Run. I wonder how long until we get a Grand Theft Auto app.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 05:36:25	I forgot to pick up treats for the dog while I was out so it looks like I get to go out again today.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 05:26:01	@Rebellionista At this point, you need to just wrap your body in bubblewrap so that you don't get hurt anymore.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-17 01:06:45	Same @big5since55 and this time I wasn't yelled at for starting a homeless camp. So today is already looking better.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-16 23:51:23	I am going to head out to the dollar store and I am actually going to go inside! Baby steps…
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-16 23:46:04	Looks like a good night's sleep a lot of medicine didn't help me get over this yet.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-16 23:31:46	It's actually cold outside! What happened Phoenix?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-16 23:22:10	It feels like @PlanetFitness is never going to let me cancel. It has been 13 months and they say that I am still under my one year contract
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-16 13:39:57	@Coximus2 I actually think he's a bad coach. He throws his players under the bus during his press conferences.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 13:21:40	@always_az I refuse to let them in. I ride the person in front of me's bumper
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 13:20:07	@Rebellionista That actually sounds like fun. I need to catch up on my sleep.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 04:47:06	I wish @Oreo sold jars of just the filling...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 04:45:46	@cherryb1ade I wear one and actually know why I do. Seems like a lot of people are doing it just because it's an in thing right now.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 04:13:57	@Mike_Douglas_ Just did.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 04:12:19	I didn't think they would even hire any... https:// twitter.com/KTAR923/status /807679028341645312 …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 04:07:30	@cherryb1ade That's true. I asked a kid why they were wearing one and what it meant and they said "No idea everyone is doing it though"...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 03:19:22	Back in my day safety pins were something used when you popped a button not a statement.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 03:03:36	@whiskeysquicker Men waiting on their wives to shop season is upon us.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 03:02:35	@whiskeysquicker @FrysFoodStores my camp is growing. Guy in the minivan next to me is wearing a snuggie too
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 02:58:08	I miss Polaroid cameras
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 02:54:24	@whiskeysquicker @FrysFoodStores Then again I'd run too if a homeless looking fat guy in a snuggie ran at me yelling.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 02:53:04	@whiskeysquicker @FrysFoodStores I scared them so bad their car is still here. They scattered and left it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 02:52:11	@whiskeysquicker I wanna just get rid of my cell tbh. I'm like if you need me call my wife we're always together.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 02:09:36	According to the @big5since55 manager falling asleep in your car while waiting for your wife to finish shopping= starting a homeless camp
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 01:55:39	Had my snuggie on and people kept tapping on the window asking if I was ok. Also told that I can't start a homeless camp
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-11 01:51:02	Fell asleep in the store parking lot with a caugh drop in my mouth. Almost choked to death...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-10 14:49:01	My mother-in-law borrowed my hoe when I lived in California. I had to buy a new one here so now I can say I got hoes in different area codes

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-10 14:30:14	I sometimes wish we just didn't have a President and just let Congress run it all.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-10 14:27:54	Back in my day, we didn't have screenshots. We had to use a camera and usually ordered double prints.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-09 06:44:46	@AmbAdAstra I've been trying mindfulness. It helps.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-09 06:41:49	@AmbAdAstra I used to take Ativan. I can take up to 3 Xanax a day but really try not to take any.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-07 12:42:01	@Patsnation87 @Suns That's why I only watch every 3rd game.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-07 12:40:18	@Patsnation87 @Suns I think that's the master plan this year though…
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-12-07 12:34:09	The @Suns should trade Knight and Bledsoe

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-29 12:16:17	Maybe my avi and header were not a good choice. I got 3 dick pics today...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-29 09:51:25	@Rebellionista That happened to me earlier.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-29 09:47:01	@HarleyQuinnRN I hope your week starts improving soon.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-29 08:56:53	@TweetLilLatina My work day went by pretty fast. Now I'm on the couch just relaxing. I guess that it was a pretty good day.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-29 07:47:01	I'm not looking forward to the narrative that's sure to follow the violence at #OhioState . There will be/have been a lot of stupid tweets...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-29 05:01:19	I didn't see very many good deals online today. Thus far Cyber Monday has been a dud.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-28 08:14:06	@ArizonaHiggins I'm okay with politics because I don't take them seriously. I mean I registered to vote as a communist.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-28 08:10:38	Religion is really the only subject that I refuse to talk about online.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-28 07:47:41	I would try this, but then I would have to drink Bud Light. https:// twitter.com/12News/status/ 803021852457123840 …

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-28 06:50:37	I like taking pictures but I miss putting film in the camera.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-28 06:46:30	I actually went to the store by myself to pick up my prescription. I did take my dog and use the drive through but it still counts.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-28 06:44:19	@Rebellionista Sorry. They do say pain makes you feel alive, so I bet you feel really alive right now. Get better soon.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-28 06:39:29	I see more people on @twitter call for B.A. to be fired than people wanting Todd Graham fired. What's wrong with this picture?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-28 06:31:50	@Rebellionista How is your pain today? I hope you're feeling a lot better.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-28 06:29:41	Anyone else with bipolar disorder get like a mini mania at night? Lately, I've been sober but act like I've been drinking.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-28 06:27:40	I should've made that that about the Cardinals not making the playoffs. I couldn't do it because it means rooting against my favorite team.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-28 06:26:27	You call it a Christmas tree but my dog calls it an indoor bathroom.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-27 15:32:40	I did it!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-27 15:28:19	@Rebellionista I was physically, mentally, and sexually abused by them as a kid and maybe in some ways, I'm still afraid of them.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-27 15:26:05	@Rebellionista Tried that for a few years but then I felt guilty when my mom died.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-27 15:25:20	@JoetheSicilian Need it for work and like the funny pages. Have like 20 family members as friends, including my wife and kids.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-27 15:23:30	Only thing is I'd feel guilty. They bring me down...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-27 15:07:01	@ClintonMurphy2 I changed my @today because I didn't want them or the people I work with finding me.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-27 15:04:50	@ClintonMurphy2 I cut my Facebook down to nothing but somewhat immediate family members and it still sucks. Twitter is better!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-27 15:02:35	@ClintonMurphy2 I can't delete my Facebook account because I have to use my Facebook login to access things for work.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-26 16:20:28	@ClintonMurphy2 No matter what you think of someone you shouldn't be celebrating that they died. Just my opinion.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-26 16:19:09	You know it's getting late when you start to see chat line commercials on TV.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-26 16:13:24	I can't believe that some people on twitter are actually cheering Fidel Castro's death. What a sick world!

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-26 14:35:12	@Rebellionista In the US some places offer delivery. Do they do that there?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-26 14:34:37	@AZJoshM You had to look that up. I never even heard of him until I did a Google search for the number.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-26 14:32:51	@Rebellionista It might help the pain.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 07:11:43	@JoetheSicilian Did you ever find anyone worth a follow?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 07:05:54	Why do movies add the sound of a dial tone when someone is disconnected from a cell phone call? Do cell phones even have a dial tones?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 07:00:28	@Rebellionista Congratulations!

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 06:46:09	@AL2TheB I need it to counteract some of my other medication or I wouldn't be able to work.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 06:43:31	@AL2TheB I didn't really have this problem until I started taking Adderall.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 05:43:26	@Cap_Kaveman It probably will be until January.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 04:55:27	On social media when people post about a brand 99% of the time it's negative. I'm going to start posting about positive experiences I have.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 04:53:12	@Petco My dog Doodle and I had a great experiance at your Laveen Village, AZ store. A+ and helpful staff! Kudos!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 04:49:51	Dear @WWE , put @itsvadertime in the hall of fame before it's a posthumous induction! @VinceMcMahon @TripleH #VaderHOF
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 04:47:09	It's always weird when you go to follow someone only to learn that they have blocked you.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 04:44:10	@kbellak91 I hope it gets better for you! I wish this year would hurry up and finish.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 04:22:31	I really appreciate them calling to apologize. Most stores won't do that these days.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 04:18:33	I went back and deleted the post I made on @DollarTree 's Facebook page and instead put up a thank you to the guy who reached out to help.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 04:15:17	@JimSonOfGreg He does answer, though. It is a yes if he starts licking my face.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 04:13:48	So @DollarTree reached out to me this afternoon and assured me that they will make sure that the issue I had never occurs again. I'm happy.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 02:00:48	I think I annoy my wife because I talk to my dog a lot. Is it going to far when you ask your dog for opinions?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 00:56:01	@JimSonOfGreg on a leash and following heal to toe. No barking. Completely calm.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 00:54:58	. @JimSonOfGreg he also was well behaved and were told the second we walked in.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 00:53:44	. @JimSonOfGreg nope. Said too many service dogs have given them issues so all are banned.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 00:52:15	Guess when I need dollar store stuff I'll go to 99 cents only. They allow service dogs.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 00:39:59	It's sad @DollarTree doesn't follow the Americans with disabilities act. They don't allow service dogs. Please RT so this gets attention
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-16 00:26:49	Hey @DollarTree was denied entry into your store and told service dogs are not allowed. You know that's illegal right?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 15:35:12	It kinda sucks that they charged me for three paychecks worth of benefits at once when I didn't know I had benefits those three checks.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 15:34:03	@PHXCards11 Woot!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 14:45:11	I'm a little disappointed in my paycheck. This is my first week where they took out my benefits and it makes my bank account sad.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 14:31:14	@ClintonMurphy2 @JeffMoore78 You might have to travel to Flagstaff for that.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 14:29:08	@ClintonMurphy2 @JeffMoore78 I'm sure I'll still be wearing shorts on Christmas.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 14:24:48	@JeffMoore78 It's supposed to hit 90° tomorrow.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 14:15:11	@JeffMoore78 The only show I watch regularly is Cops.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 14:13:06	@JeffMoore78 I got rid of my DVR because I never watched anything and it would fill up.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:49:13	@nativeangelaz LOL. My wife works for the same company and from home so probably the best thing is I get to hang out with my best friend.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:46:35	@nativeangelaz I like it because I get to spend more time with my family and watch my kids grow up.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:44:27	@nativeangelaz I have benefits just not those two. It's probably because I work from home.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:43:38	I wonder how hard of a time my family members are going to give me at Thanksgiving dinner this year...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:40:43	@nativeangelaz My work doesn't offer sick days or vacation days.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:40:01	I'm pretty sure that Donald Trump is going to win @TIME 's man of the year this year.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:37:50	@nativeangelaz I hope you don't end up needing them.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:35:49	@nativeangelaz Does it reset at the end of the year or do you have to work a set number of hours to earn them?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:08:14	@AZJoshM I never watch them but I've always been intrigued by this case.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:04:33	@AZJoshM I should have known better than to trust Fox.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:01:54	@AZJoshM 1978 but the commercials said they would reveal his killer tonight. They didn't.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 13:00:10	@ScottHoward42 All it really showed is that John Carpenter didn't do it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 12:57:25	The Bob Crane murder revelation on @FOX10Phoenix was nothing more than a cash grab to get ratings. Murder is still unsolved.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 07:41:03	@HarleyQuinnRN I hope one day my anxiety will let me do that alone. Right now my wife has to do that for me.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 07:37:17	@futieton So do I! J/K...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 07:35:23	@futieton That's a little mean.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 07:28:25	@HarleyQuinnRN I wish my family could do that. We always seem to forget something even when we have a list.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 07:23:29	Had to break out my emergency supply of Xanax. I don't know why I'm feeling so stressed today. #Anxiety
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 06:56:22	@purple_n_orange I think you're just working too hard and looking at a computer screen nonstop. Time for some Workmen's Comp.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 06:54:51	@purple_n_orange How did you get that in both eyes?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 06:49:20	@kayemclaren2 Wearing headphones and avoiding eye contact.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 06:44:12	@kayemclaren2 It is getting better with medication. Thanks :-)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 06:25:57	I'm not sure to blame the supermoon or the presidential election for my twitter feed being filled with such weird stuff.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 06:23:06	@kayemclaren2 I can't even go to the store without anxiety medication because having the cashier even look at me triggers me.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 06:17:55	I think I'm going to buy @findingdory
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 06:15:52	@kayemclaren2 Severe social anxiety and I work from home so I only talk to people via Internet chat.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 05:36:09	My dog is very particular about the treats he will eat. His favorite ones are from Family Dollar called triple flavored twist.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 05:24:33	@JoetheSicilian I used Dragon NaturallySpeaking on that last tweet. It should have read I'm sorry to hear that. Stupid technology!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 05:05:36	@JoetheSicilian I'm starting here that. I really hope things get better for you.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 04:26:09	@purple_n_orange That's a valid point.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 04:24:03	I think @VinceMcMahon and the @WWE should give Brendan Dassey From Making a Murder front row seats to Wrestlemania. Lots of free press.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 04:19:13	@purple_n_orange Okay, I was talking about if you're thinking of muting me. If you do that just block me.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 04:17:53	@Rebellionista That's not good! You seem to have a lot of accidents. I hope you feel better and don't get hurt anymore.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 04:16:05	If you're thinking of muting someone you should just unfollow instead.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-15 03:57:20	@mechanical_meat It's intermittent but should be up completely by the time I start work. Thanks.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 13:06:20	I've never heard Ignition all I've ever heard was The Remix to Ignition. What's up with that R. Kelly?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 12:54:08	@_WordMistress I don't think they're allowed to do that unless you go to a different therapist.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 11:52:42	@TweetLilLatina I put a filter on my twitter and block most of the stuff related to it except memes. Only see it if someone @'s me.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 11:49:23	@TweetLilLatina I decided to just stop thinking about it since it's out of my control.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 11:42:37	@mechanical_meat Same
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 11:42:27	I'm really looking forward to payday on Tuesday!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 11:39:44	@TweetLilLatina Same
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 11:33:45	If you have a typo in your tweet do you delete it and tweet it again or do you just let it be?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 11:28:55	@mechanical_meat I work 2 hours tomorrow night so it's like I have the day off.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 11:21:36	@JoetheSicilian Do your feet hurt?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 11:16:27	@mechanical_meat Good. I worked a lot today. Got up really early and plan on staying up late. How are you?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 10:46:48	@mechanical_meat I never heard of that movie. I'm going to look into it. Thanks!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 10:42:28	@ClintonMurphy2 @TubingTyler The amount of time is going to take to count all the votes is embarrassing.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 10:37:17	@ClintonMurphy2 You could always just start blocking any account that does a sponsored tweet and you'll see a lot less.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 10:35:18	@ClintonMurphy2 Try using a different app. A lot of them block sponsored tweets now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 10:34:16	@Ihatethisugh1 That's awesome!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 10:33:53	@ClintonMurphy2 Are using a computer or your phone?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 10:16:11	Not all moons can be heroes but the #supermoon can.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 10:06:49	@JimSonOfGreg @12News It's supposedly a mummified mother and child. Looks fake.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 09:51:42	@JoetheSicilian Check the dryer.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 09:49:57	@Ltd_To_Two That's a great one!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 09:45:59	@FlyByKnite Please tweet it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 09:25:51	@kayemclaren2 Pretty much lol

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 09:11:52	My dog just got a bath with vanilla and oatmeal shampoo. He smells so good!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 08:55:56	I've been there before and it's a complete waste of money. https:// twitter.com/12News/status/ 797964241068134401 …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 08:51:59	@mdrnlifeisrbsh I'm sorry that you have to go through that. I feel that way in public to a lot.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 08:49:18	@mdrnlifeisrbsh I know for a fact I'm weird and I decided to just own it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 08:47:36	@mdrnlifeisrbsh Because they are jealous of you.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 08:42:25	@Coximus2 I'm actually worried. This is a game we should've easily won.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 08:25:55	@BipolarHeaded Love your tweets BTW

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 08:07:38	I follow anyone who follows me. I only unfollow if they are a bot or link spammer. I love hearing people's opinions on a variety of subjects
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 08:02:03	I hate that @google Hangouts no long ding on my laptop or desktop. At least it still works on my phone.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 07:58:37	@DayneSvendsen Tweet what you feel. We're here for you.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 07:47:02	Probably a good time to sell this on Ebay... pic.twitter.com/cD0J5GH7Eb
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 07:14:34	@Rebellionista Probably not too well.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 07:12:48	@ScottHoward42 You know it's going to be John Henry Carpenter and he died a long time ago.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 07:09:43	@ScottHoward42 They claim they will reveal the murderer Monday because they got to run some DNA tests.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 06:51:59	I need a Twitter friend named Annie so that I can tweet to them every day and ask if they're okay…
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 06:47:52	@tonetalk It's more like I get death threats from people with egg avi's.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 06:46:28	@Rebellionista I'll be anxiously awaiting your drunk tweets!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 06:45:31	@tonetalk I just get you emotional and it's a subject I read a lot about so I love to express my opinions.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 06:43:44	Now that the presidential election is over I need to stop tweeting about politics. For some reason it seems to send me into mania.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 06:42:51	@Rebellionista Do it!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 06:42:05	@SimbaTalks Good luck!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 06:20:44	@Darlene44575635 I hope you're able to get a good nights sleep.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 06:17:17	@balloons_brain Have a great night!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 06:13:19	A few years back my brother-in-law gave us a copy of the movie Elf. Maybe one day I'll get around to watching it. pic.twitter.com/WyrGxezVmB

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 06:00:36	@jaklumen BTW thanks for telling me about @Wheatie1966 I'm following them now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 05:59:47	@jaklumen @Wheatie1966 I work on social media accounts and they don't want us to post our tweets to the client's account accidentally.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-14 05:57:13	@jaklumen @Wheatie1966 Thanks! I would've responded sooner but we're not allowed to post to social media at work.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 15:44:45	I have to work in 6 hours so I'm going to bed. Tweet at you later guys and thanks for all the positive tweets today they really helped.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 15:43:10	@midnight_vampkc That's so true!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 15:41:08	I'm agoraphobic so if you ask me to join a protest I'm like sure I'll post a link on social media. Close enough right?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 15:28:23	@ArizonaHiggins At a bar and it was about Trump possibly getting rid of Obamacare. They've done it before so no O.R. stuck til Monday.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 15:26:46	@Rebellionista Cute!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 15:25:59	@ArizonaHiggins On the bright side, it wasn't at a protest and it was about the same candidate they both voted for.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 15:23:46	@LiVNiZZZLE You need some caffeine.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 15:10:08	@ArizonaHiggins Really. They're idiots.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 15:03:38	@Coximus2 That would fit on vine.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 15:01:05	Two of my family members got arrested tonight because they got in an actual fight over the election. Politics make people crazy! pic.twitter.com/KBl7Qje4CG

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 14:39:21	@Gibberman10 @thrillathechase I bet he goes to the WWE when he leaves the UFC.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 14:38:46	I love snakes and alligators but bugs freak me out.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 14:36:53	@MayTheCourseBWU @ClintonMurphy2 @rez_devil Oh. How did you do?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 14:32:44	@MayTheCourseBWU @ClintonMurphy2 @rez_devil Isn't your race tomorrow?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 14:30:50	@nativeangelaz LOL!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 14:19:15	I kinda wish that Follow Friday was still a thing. It helped me find so many great people to follow.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 14:17:03	It's about 100 times easier to get up at 7:00am than 6:00am for me. I'm thankful for daylight savings time.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 14:15:35	I seem to have mysterious cuts and bruises popping up every day. Either I'm sleepwalking again or my wife is beating me up in my sleep.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 14:13:41	@Coximus2 That's sad but awesome. At least it didn't die alone. Thanks for being there.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 14:10:43	@jayjayGoFast I don't know. He owns a dispensary in California and said how much it helps him.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 13:59:56	@LindaChilders1 Awesome!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 13:59:07	@jayjayGoFast Probably get a contact high.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 13:57:06	I wonder how thankful @GoodwillIntl is for @macklemore 's song Thrift Shop? #poppintags

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 13:19:28	@jaklumen It gets annoying because they RT it then unRT it and RT it again. Then repeat.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 13:10:16	It was a 4 1mg of Xanax kind of day. #stress #stressedout
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 13:09:10	Why do people RT their own tweets? Not saying it's wrong just curious.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 13:06:42	Work was so slow tonight that I almost fell asleep. #NeedCoffee
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 04:33:32	So many people look alike on Twitter. It's kinda scary that most of them try to sell stuff here too! pic.twitter.com/liQeiWKuli
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 04:28:59	I'm convinced that when my dog licks my face he's really just tasting me and plotting my murder.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-13 02:08:23	I know that they are bad for me but I love these bacon cheddar fries!

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:27:17	@Rebellionista I work on social media all day and just get sick of seeing it even if it's posted in a positive way.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:24:18	@paolohu @KimKardashian LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:21:57	@ClintonMurphy2 I blocked those then.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:20:14	@ClintonMurphy2 I might have depending on what you tweet. I played for ASU so I don't mind ASU sports tweets.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:18:30	I have found that since I started filtering trigger words and subjects social media is so much better. Also blocked profanity.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:16:36	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista People probably would prefer Nixon even.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:13:51	@ClintonMurphy2 I don't like to block unless they actually threaten me harm. I usually just unfollow and ignore.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:13:04	@ClintonMurphy2 I had been using my laptop and forgot to use my twitter filter. I set it to not let me see tweets with annoying keywords.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:11:38	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista I'm waiting for him to screw up so he gets impeached TBH
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:11:05	I need to learn to stop talking politics on Twitter. It gets people emotional and a lot of times seems to cause hard feelings.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:08:25	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista True. He was elected though so nothing we can do but give him a chance.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:06:20	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista They never wanted him and pushed people's buttons. Protest here had 1000 people they left when media did.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:04:13	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista The MEDIA hated him. Just didn't have social media to push their agenda.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:03:05	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista Because the election is over and we have to live with it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:01:24	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista And they all hated him his first 4 years
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 15:00:57	@Rebellionista @Ihatethisugh1 Probably. It's only 4 years though. Think of it as a prison sentence.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 14:59:54	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista because social media wasn't around then
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 14:58:19	@Rebellionista @Ihatethisugh1 Other than the experience part that's what they said about Reagan.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 14:56:43	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista Could have Jill Stein...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 14:54:51	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista Could be worse
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 14:53:21	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista I didn't vote for him but I'm sure we'll be fine.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 14:50:11	@Ihatethisugh1 @Rebellionista Give it a chance. He might get bored and quit in a few months.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 14:07:20	Why does Twitter want me to follow @KimKardashian so badly?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 14:02:26	I have no idea how to use @Snapchat

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 08:28:38	America is great because not only can we vote for our leaders we also have the right to complain and protest it as long as we're civil.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 08:04:08	@JoetheSicilian I saw the popup. If it's in my filter and I don't see the popup I will never see it.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 04:05:49	@tapeparade @BeautyCreep I'm actually excited about Trump even though I didn't vote for him. America needed a change so give him a chance.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 02:18:03	@futieton @bookmansphoenix Okay the Phoenix library then.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 02:16:42	@futieton @bookmansphoenix But during the PURGE no laws right :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 02:15:22	@futieton @bookmansphoenix I love books. Purge you can take anything you want so I figured semi truck and books.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 00:57:36	@AZ_Charlene If it all goes to hell you can always move. However, you might as well give them a chance to prove you wrong.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 00:50:28	To be honest every day we should thank our veterans and our active military for defending our freedom, not just one day year. #VeteransDay
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 00:46:53	@laurajswift That's great!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 00:43:52	So there's a rumor going around that Facebook is attempting to buy @snopes . I probably need to check out Snopes to see if it's true.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 00:40:36	@mechanical_meat I mean we need to do something to get them quality care. The suicide rate among veterans is super high.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 00:39:22	@Pinkishlypink66 I also want to thank him for his service.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 00:38:26	@DnyLdn I'm not a fan of any Kevin James TV show or movie.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 00:32:41	@futieton I would have to say @REI #OptOutside
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 00:31:37	Our military veterans deserve quality medical care and right now they're not getting that from the VA. #VeteransDay
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-12 00:31:00	I didn't think of it until today but a great way to honor our veterans may be to hold a peaceful protest outside of the Phoenix VA.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-11 15:21:26	Protests should be over in what 2 weeks or so?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 03:11:30	@mechanical_meat Can you believe news stations were broadcasting the suicide hotline over Trump's win?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:54:18	I'm going to start an online gym for internet tough guys.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:52:08	If the US collapses because of this election, the upside is we can finally use the blue starry part of American flags to make wizard hats.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:50:13	Somebody give Trump a Snickers bar so when he takes a bite he will instantly turn into Bernie!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:49:11	Wonder if the @phoenixnewtimes will throw Joe a going away party.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:41:32	Some of my Twitter followers today. Cheer up and let's see what happens. Don't assume the worst. #PositiveThoughts pic.twitter.com/RHo4qyZUs1
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:34:05	@futieton I'll let you cool down a bit. Let's just see what happens. Have a wonderful day.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:33:14	@futieton Congress won't allow that.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:32:51	@Cap_Kaveman I saw a tweet showing him doing coke recently.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:31:45	@futieton Sex assault is unproven. If you went by rumors Hillary has had people killed. I'm just accepting the fact Trump won.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:30:18	Let's stay positive people and not stress about a man who hasn't even been sworn in yet. Obama is still @POTUS right now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:27:49	@futieton Islamophobic people have been around since 9/11. Can't blame Trump for that. He never said kill anyone.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:25:59	@futieton So Trump told that person to kill someone? Everyone is responsible for their own actions. Crazy evil people everywhere.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:24:36	@futieton Most republicans hate him.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:24:13	@futieton We get that all the time too
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:23:45	@futieton No political cause someone to kill anybody. The killer was just an evil person. Did Trump hold a gun to the killer's head?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:22:16	@futieton One serious question. Can you wait until he is sworn in before you are all doom and gloom? Congress can keep him in check.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:20:37	@futieton The violent protesters.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:20:13	Dow up more than 200 points
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:18:50	@Coximus2 RIP nasty ass burger
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:18:03	Time to invest in Taco Trucks!!! #yum
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:16:17	@purple_n_orange I better not see you on the news or I'm telling :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:14:48	@mechanical_meat I don't care to be honest. Not like I control any of it. Best I can do is complain on social media.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:13:07	@futieton If you check Wikileaks a lot of those were paid for by Hillary. I read a lot. Not trying to start a fight I swear.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:12:12	Is there an estimate of when Twitter will get back to normal? Go @Suns @AZCoyotesPR @AZCardinals Yeah Sportsball!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:10:47	@mechanical_meat It's actually 3 places all together, plus let Russia handle Syria. Pull the US out.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:09:59	@futieton If you read his transcripts he said CRIMINAL Muslims and minorities. So yes a criminal should be scared.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:08:39	@mechanical_meat I know. I was talking about both. There is an island near Alaska both the US and Russia claim I can't find it's name.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:06:46	@mechanical_meat Yep. Crimea.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:05:17	@futieton You know I'm just teasing. I didn't want any of the candidates but we're stuck with Trump. Might as well give him a chance.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:04:15	@mechanical_meat He actually wants to give Russia the disputed land near Alaska.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 02:01:08	@futieton People were embarrassed of Regan too and now he's beloved.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 01:59:03	@futieton New president is in the WWE Hall of Fame.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 01:18:03	@SB_MikeMay I might try someone you hate more. Started mild.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 00:38:14	@identitydiss RNC didn't pay for a single Trump ad. They usually spend around 100 million.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 00:35:34	@identitydiss They were like whoever the people with money want to win will win.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 00:33:56	@identitydiss I voted. Didn't want to but I did it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-10 00:22:39	@identitydiss I can count about a 100 that didn't vote because they said that it is rigged.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:38:15	@IQinspector We are starting a budget Jan 1st so that should help. Sometimes I get manic and waste money.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:36:55	@ClintonMurphy2 Politics seem to always screw with my money...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:36:00	@ClintonMurphy2 The market just hates change. Not sure the Peso will make a full recovery, though.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:33:55	@ClintonMurphy2 So you remember the fall when Bush won in 2000?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:33:05	@IQinspector Yes, it does! I have $8 that has to last me until the 15th
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:32:22	@ClintonMurphy2 Time to invest. Everything will go back up in a week or two. Happens after every upset election.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:29:34	The peso is dropping. Time to take a road trip to TJ and buy a ton of tacos!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:25:11	@PhoenixFireScan My investment account for sure...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:24:46	@IQinspector I hope you find a way to get your work done that still lets you keep your money.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:23:52	@TubingTyler I wanna know how he will build a wall on 70 miles of reservation land along the border. That's a big hole.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:22:44	@PhoenixFireScan Another at @HillaryClinton 's campaign headquarters.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:22:01	@IQinspector I am missing a lot of teeth so at least you have that going for you.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:16:16	@ScottHoward42 He actually didn't come up with it. His employee friend did off the clock but Cuban had a contract to give him the rights.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:12:32	@EmperorNorton Nope. She said someone filed on her behalf. She never wanted the lawsuit.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:11:06	@futieton @ErinLand20 If we're still alive. :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:10:03	@EmperorNorton Umm, she dropped the case for the 3rd time.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:08:52	@futieton Well you got him too. Lol
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:07:53	@futieton @ErinLand20 Have you read the transcripts of his speeches or only went by what the media said? He was a better choice than Clinton
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:05:03	@futieton My wife is though. I hated everyone running.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 16:02:09	@futieton I'm okay with Trump.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 11:14:52	@IQinspector @mechanical_meat It might be days before we know.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 11:13:35	@IQinspector @mechanical_meat I'm not going to stress over what I can't control. I don't like Trump or Clinton TBH
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 11:10:06	@IQinspector @mechanical_meat Trump has spend 1/10 of what Hillary did. I voted for Johnson so my pick is going to lose.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 11:06:43	@mechanical_meat @IQinspector Not the end of the world though...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 10:58:44	@IQinspector Really?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 06:54:14	@marblekyle @TubingTyler Most of them thought Hillary and Trump were "mean". They were required to watch the debates.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 06:46:27	Today I learned that all these get (Insert product here) free if you voted promotions are illegal.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 06:42:10	@TubingTyler McCain and Sheriff Joe also won.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 06:38:15	@TubingTyler Jill Stein won in my son's class. I don't think that many parents will be voting for her.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-09 06:35:09	I'm a fan of kid's voting at school. It's always interesting to see a child's view of people running for public office.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-08 03:23:54	I still haven't seen a television commercial for @realDonaldTrump this presidential election. I have seen a few anti-Hillary ones, though.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-04 09:07:52	I uploaded a few thousand photographs to Facebook and it's been a real challenge tagging and writing the descriptions.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-04 07:31:57	Wife and I are thinking about having another kid. I feel a little old (38 years old) to have one, though.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-03 02:21:29	I'm am looking forward to Friday because I'm going to a different location that should have that laptop in stock.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-11-03 02:19:56	Feeling a little down because Facebook reminded me that 5 years ago today my mom died of cancer.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-29 13:26:30	@tonetalk At least I'm not alone then. Social media is my only real link to the outside world yet sometimes it just feels pointless.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 16:02:08	@JeffMoore78 My closest McDonalds is 24hrs...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 16:01:11	@JeffMoore78 But I have needs. I need candy bars and Big Macs...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 15:59:04	@JeffMoore78 So Jeff... Can I have a small loan that I won't repay?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 15:57:32	@JeffMoore78 Say your feet hurt
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 15:55:01	@JeffMoore78 Just call in sick
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 15:54:06	@JeffMoore78 So like $5 in tips would be okay with you?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 15:53:12	@JeffMoore78 So we should hope for an empty bar?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 15:51:46	@EmperorNorton What do you mean?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 15:51:14	I don't think I can handle a haunted house anymore without punching someone. #Anxiety
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 14:38:42	Wonder if this will be worth anything if he's elected #trump @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/gKsqwUNsmZ

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 14:31:41	When I see @JeffMoore78 on Twitter I check the clock and think it's almost time for bed...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 14:27:12	If you fart on your wallet does that mean that you have gas money? #randomthought
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 14:23:30	@JeffMoore78 Hope you have some good shoes.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 14:21:19	I wonder if I bought milk from the same cow twice... #randomthought
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 14:17:13	My life has really changed since I was able to get a service dog. Dogs are so amazing!

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:56:39	I like that I now know my work schedule until the end of the year
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:47:15	Scratched up my bumper. Wish I had it on film...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:46:44	I remember a few elections back when Dan Saban was running for sheriff I had a MCSO deputy take my bumper stickers of my car.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:43:37	@EmperorNorton I've been an actual mental patient the last 2 years on Halloween (hopefully, not this year) and totally agree it's offensive.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:37:30	I'm stuck somewhere in between happiness and depression and it's not a good feeling. #bipolar
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:36:02	Watching @CopsTV and some of these cops are really weak on their probable cause. I bet a lot of these people get off TBH.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:33:30	I'll be honest I'm lazy and have social anxiety so the only protests I do are from home. Email, fax, social media and phone. #NoDAPL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:31:34	@identitydiss Same. I chose to live the hermit life for now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:24:48	Too bad Twitter didn't just sell Vine to Facebook. #RIPVine
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:21:54	@TubingTyler I was thinking he would decapitate it dressed like Mel Gibson in Braveheart and hold up the head in victory.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:14:11	@jaklumen I just want my right to die via clogged arteries back.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:12:11	@Kandancearagon Same.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:07:46	@TubingTyler Also had the weirdest sense of humor. Probably would vandalize his own statue or something...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:04:00	@TubingTyler He honestly would be pissed by the amount of attention he gets. He was a very humble man. #RIP
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 13:01:21	Obama getting a Nobel Peace Prize was the equivalent of George W. Bush being accepted to Mensa.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 12:24:47	@bobstroup True but this has been going on for 2 months and a lot of people have no idea about it.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 12:22:22	@bobstroup My question is where is the media? This is a BIG deal.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 12:21:21	Forget America let's make french fries great again and bring back trans fat #Murica
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 12:18:16	I thought this @USArmy Cyber Warrior commercial was going to be a Trump commercial for some reason...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 12:16:22	I'm going to just assume that Trump or Clinton can't do any worse than George W. Something to look forward to I guess.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 12:11:44	@bobstroup According to his people they egged him on with the same questions for 20 min.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 12:09:54	@bobstroup Looks like a really bad WWE promo TBH.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 12:02:42	That Gary Johnson video looks like a really bad @WWE promo.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-28 12:01:03	@purple_n_orange Yep

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-27 11:33:59	@hanlich Talking about preseason performance.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-27 11:29:31	It's kinda nice to see Jared Dudley back in a @Suns uniform again.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-27 11:26:43	Marquese Chriss > Dragan Bender at least right now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-27 11:24:17	@hanlich Mine has a lot of people hating on this team. Same one's that were excited last night. This team is young and it's a long season.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-27 11:22:49	This team is young but will find it's way. I'm excited about the @Suns future. #SunsVsKings
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-27 11:13:08	@Patsnation87 Not on defense.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-27 10:05:45	@Realjmannarino Cemeteries?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-27 09:44:13	I wonder why the media hardly covers the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Protests have been going on for more than two months straight.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 15:27:07	The only downside to early voting by mail is that you don't get an I voted today sticker. #Election2016
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 15:26:03	@Ihatethisugh1 I just want this election to be over. Then again, I already voted.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 15:22:20	@Ihatethisugh1 I think if/when Trump loses we end up with a civil war.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 14:56:45	@identitydiss #kindnessmatters in fact, that and a sense of humor are mainly all that matter.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 13:52:19	@LindaChilders1 I've read about that. I'm blessed in other ways with many things that money can't buy.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 13:50:41	Really liking work this week. It's been busier than usual.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 13:43:49	@JoetheSicilian I don't block. The worst case scenario is that I unfollow. Even those people the other night telling me to kill myself etc..

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 13:17:56	Watching Forensic Files right now. It's probably my 8th or 9th favorite show.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 13:14:40	Thanks (Insert Celebrity name here) for telling me how to vote. I guess I didn't really need to do my own research...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 13:10:06	I think @POTUS should step in and help stop the Dakota Access oil pipeline. #DakotaAccessPipeline

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 13:05:03	I found a candy corn eating contest. $15 to enter. I wonder if I should for the $100 prize. #diabetes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 13:03:28	@SB_MikeMay He did RT so probably.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 13:02:37	@identitydiss In that case go for it. If it doesn't work then you can drop weight.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 13:01:30	@SB_MikeMay I did call out Colt Cabana around the same time on something that was a complete lie on his podcast and he blocked me too.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 12:59:47	@SB_MikeMay I never tweeted him so have no idea.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 12:58:55	@identitydiss It does sound badass so if you go heavy weight you're going to have to be faster to make up for weight.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 12:57:44	@SB_MikeMay What does it say? I'm blocked.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 12:57:11	@AZJoshM You mean Baby Jordan?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 12:56:38	@identitydiss Drop is usually better because if you go up they will have a lot of weight on you unless you gain more before the fight.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 12:36:14	@atownbrown08 They wrote them off because Duncan is gone.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 12:18:46	@projectmonark Didn't know that. That's a good reason not to do it then.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 12:17:47	@AZJoshM I think Johnson's is hilarious. Don't like either candidate? Now you have a 3rd option. Says nothing about himself.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 12:16:22	@jayjayGoFast That looks really bad!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 12:15:44	Wow! I saw a Johnson for president commercial and still haven't seen one for Trump.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 12:11:29	They should have a test you need to pass before you can vote. Maybe force you to read about who/what you are voting for or something.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:50:17	@bt602 I did go to public high school for a bit but got stabbed and my parents forced me to go to a private religious school.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:46:44	@bt602 @paolohu I went to public school until High school. Private school was much more challenging and I loved the smaller class size.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:45:16	Not sure if I should take "You look like a homeless serial killer" as a compliment or not. I'm guessing no.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:43:31	@bt602 @paolohu My kids go to public school so they need it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:42:23	@JoetheSicilian If you ever need to talk let me know. Life can be hard.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:41:40	@Ihatethisugh1 Having the most runs at the end of the game #WorldSeries
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:35:35	@JoetheSicilian Try @craigslist . Seriously though, you okay?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:33:41	Looks like the @warriors won't go 82-0. Maybe they only were winning because of Luke Walton.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:30:03	@bt602 Really? I probably will now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:29:04	@jaklumen @thedailybeast Woah!

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:22:12	@SunsofPHXfan Just close your eyes and pretend he's Tim Duncan.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:19:49	@JoetheSicilian Well, one night your parents had sex and...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:16:22	@paolohu @bt602 I'd prefer that. Only good thing about this is @verizon pays for the data used.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:14:07	@bt602 @paolohu Because they were free? I have no idea...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:13:29	Can people stop tweeting pics of the shot Salt River horses, please? We get the point.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:12:06	@bt602 @paolohu They had Chromebooks instead of textbooks but had to leave those at school. Everything they use is on Google Drive.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 11:09:03	@paolohu @bt602 @verizon Still a book won't break if you drop it.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 10:59:41	@abc15 Why do you have to tweet a pic of a dead horse? Gross!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 10:58:28	@bt602 Well the iPads were donated by @verizon so I guess. Except it isn't $800 if your kids breaks a book.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 10:57:18	@Ihatethisugh1 Actually it's mostly about Rose.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 10:55:25	Can you believe schools are now giving kids iPads to take home like they're a school book? Times have changed...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 10:54:14	@Ihatethisugh1 My timeline seemed to that.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-26 10:53:48	Like how the @littlecaesars commercial has do not attempt disclaimer when the guy is holding his kid upside down shaking out the change.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 12:46:25	With those things filtered my twitter is pretty bare. Mostly cat photos and baseball talk.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 12:40:35	I decided to filter all political tweets and tweets that contain profanity from my twitter timeline. Just trying to be positive now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:46:26	@EndTheStigma_ie I get this way a lot, especially after hearing a few loud noises. I don't think I would be alive if it wasn't for my wife.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:42:57	Where can I buy this #Election2016 #noneoftheabove @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton #debatenight pic.twitter.com/5AacciOCjG
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:40:40	This is pretty much my cat since we got my service dog. pic.twitter.com/LNHefXbSCR
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:36:33	I may have wasted my vote but I voted for the person with the best mental health planned policies.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:32:43	If I had a dollar for every lie told at tonight's #debate I could buy something pretty nice.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:28:55	@undilutedfreak Someone just told me you can control who sees what by making lists and posting in those. I'm going to unfollow and try that.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:24:54	@undilutedfreak I'll give unfollow a try though. Thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:23:50	Just having a rough week. Maybe I should take a Xanax...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:23:24	I have people from Twitter I've never met as Facebook friends and they are way better people than most of my family.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:22:21	@undilutedfreak My problem is they comment on my wall and posts though.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:21:44	40 minutes until work. At least my mind will be busy for 8 hours. pic.twitter.com/mVgTIvUmNk
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:20:03	I keep hearing people at work say we need to hit the ground running. I'm like Nah I'd rather crawl... #lazy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:18:37	Would it be wrong to unfriend my family members?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:18:17	Just checked my Facebook and apparently my siblings and a few aunts are made at me because I said I can't handle the funeral.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:12:05	@undilutedfreak I don't because my dog always follows me and stares at me and wines making me uncomfortable so I rush.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:09:32	I find that the best way for me to stay out of trouble is to go in my room and take a long nap.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:05:18	@AngryRaccoon2 Thanks. I finally realised I could just block people and not feel guilty about it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 04:02:50	My brother seems to always drop his phone in the toilet. Do you take your phone in the bathroom with you?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 03:59:26	I felt I needed to pin that since I got over 100 DM's making fun of me and my illness last night. Some people did have my back though
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 03:57:01	I make a lot of jokes on here but one thing I will never joke about is #mentalhealth . If you think #Bipolar isn't real, please don't follow.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 03:52:56	Next tweet is going out so I can pin it to my profile.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 03:32:58	@JoetheSicilian I should make a pinned Tweet.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 03:31:39	@IQinspector What!!!! I can't even imagine the pain you must be in. I'm sorry.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 03:30:24	Do you read people's Twitter bio's before following?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 03:27:38	Needed groceries but couldn't get myself to go inside because of #anxiety I'm lucky my wife went in while I wait in the hot car.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 03:22:23	@tlscadden1 I'll probably just make my account private for a few days.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 03:02:28	I remember when I stole Santa's naughty list and it had nearly every one of my Twitter followers in it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 03:01:06	Sometimes I wonder why I even bother with social media.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 02:54:11	@JoetheSicilian Glad to hear that you're back home. Get plenty of rest and keep us updated.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-20 02:51:47	@IQinspector Sorry to hear that. I hope they at least gave you something for the pain.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 15:20:28	Goodnight Twitter. pic.twitter.com/kF2xwTBkZf
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 15:17:54	I need to find a better way to warn my followers that I'm Bipolar...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 15:15:08	@IQinspector @mechanical_meat OMG!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 15:12:31	@IQinspector @mechanical_meat You didn't get pain pills?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 15:10:24	The block button is so much better than arguing. Lesson learned.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 15:08:40	@IQinspector Ouch!!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 15:06:40	@piersmorgan but there are 4 people. Trump, Clinton, Johnson, and Stein.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 15:02:16	They make Pumpkin Spice Breakfast Sausage. WTH...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:59:57	I guess the bus driver was lucky it wasn't a frozen turkey.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:58:50	So tonight I learned don't get into twitter arguments and that a frozen chicken makes a handy weapon...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:57:13	@JeffMoore78 Better than getting hit with a shoe... pic.twitter.com/SMNfaWpE1l
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:54:25	@JeffMoore78 driver's face was damaged so badly, he needed gum surgery.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:52:54	@JeffMoore78 When the bus driver stopped the bus to help the woman. Russell swung the bag at the driver, hitting him in the face
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:52:28	@JeffMoore78 Police say Caleb Russell, wasn't happy a woman didn't respond when he tried to talk to her. So he hit her with a bag of chicken
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:49:17	@JeffMoore78 I got beat up with a tub of lard at food city when I was a teen.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:47:47	It's almost that time. #mentalillness #medicine #Bipolar pic.twitter.com/O0tPBfRxSi
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:42:50	@JeffMoore78 Be like come back when it's fried...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:41:42	@JeffMoore78 I'd be like what no biscuits?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:40:21	@JeffMoore78 I can think of a lot of better weapons than a frozen chicken.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:38:13	@JeffMoore78 http://www. cnn.com/2016/10/18/us/ frozen-chicken-bus-attack-trnd/ …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:37:20	@JeffMoore78 Chicago?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:36:22	@JeffMoore78 @Goldberg Undertaker causes a no contest and we get a 3 way at mania with no idea who wins...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:34:17	@JeffMoore78 @Goldberg They should've waited for Mania...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:33:21	@JeffMoore78 @Goldberg He said it's his last match so you know Brock wins.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:31:00	@JeffMoore78 @Goldberg He did for a 60 year old
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:29:59	@JeffMoore78 @Goldberg He looks older IMO. Maybe it's all the roids.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:28:57	@JeffMoore78 Isn't @Goldberg almost 60? He may be younger just seems really old.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:27:37	@JeffMoore78 Worse than Warrior?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:25:49	@JeffMoore78 Just give him a bucket of roids and he'll be fine.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:24:19	@JeffMoore78 Hope he paid his AARP insurance. Brock will kill him.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:19:59	@ClintonMurphy2 @JeffMoore78 @KCBrackley Only thinking of Jeff
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:13:43	@ClintonMurphy2 @JeffMoore78 @KCBrackley Poor Jeff... RIP mentions.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:10:52	@JeffMoore78 @ClintonMurphy2 @KCBrackley Well, I do take risperidone. Maybe my Moobs will lactate...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:09:44	@JeffMoore78 @ClintonMurphy2 @KCBrackley I can't taste it so I eat too many and don't feel it until the way out.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:08:49	@ClintonMurphy2 @JeffMoore78 @KCBrackley What about breast milk Jeff?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:08:10	Can I buy this for work and claim it on my taxes? pic.twitter.com/AycTB9r2ii
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:05:33	Should the public be allowed to vote? We voted for Ruben Studdard to win @AmericanIdol after all...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 14:00:15	Be honest with me Trump or Hillary?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:40:06	@Ihatethisugh1 I just have a short fuse this week because my Grandma died Sunday night.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:38:01	I'm not sure if I'm an asshole or a hemorrhoid because I seem to irritate everyone TBH. I need to get people preparation H to help I guess.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:31:29	I wasted so much time being angry. I need to learn how to be more civil.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:29:45	I need to grow thicker skin to survive on twitter #SickNotWeak
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:25:02	@jaklumen @wavemistress I saw my pregnant fiancé hit by a train and was with my mom for her final breath when she died of cancer.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:19:41	@jaklumen It's actually bringing back my fiancé's death and my mom's death, which are still big issues/triggers for me sinceI saw both die.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:17:36	Is it weird that @Jumpshot8 is my all time favorite @Suns player? He was the first player I met and he was so nice to me.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:12:50	@jaklumen I usually do. I'm just having a bad week because my Grandma died and I broke my sobriety vow.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:11:10	@bt602 @KCBrackley @BigBigstickaz @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon @TubingTyler WHAT! They said they were out. Those bitches!!!.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:09:59	@bt602 @BigBigstickaz @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon @TubingTyler Hey,I got my free tacos so I'm happy.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:09:25	@BigBigstickaz Not trying to start a fight, but can you please try not use bipolar as a negative. I get made fun of by my own family over it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:03:30	@bt602 @BigBigstickaz @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon @TubingTyler I used the drive thru lol and parked for like 2 min
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:02:56	@BigBigstickaz Let's just move on and forget what was said agree? Twitter friends still?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 13:00:13	So today I learned I'm more like a Chihuahua when it comes to a twitter pissing contest.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:58:07	What's up with all the Christmas decorations at Costco?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:55:19	@BigBigstickaz I apologize I may be oversensitive about my bipolar. I've been having a bad week since my Grandma died. I'm sorry.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:54:12	@BigBigstickaz @PHXCards11 @goatactual @TheWrightMyke @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon Avoid the one on 75th and Lower Buckeye

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:49:23	@jaklumen Just bothers me when they make fun of me for it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:48:36	@BigBigstickaz @PHXCards11 @goatactual @TheWrightMyke @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon The one's from @JackBox are good.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:43:53	@goatactual @BigBigstickaz @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon I know right something is wrong with @BigBigstickaz

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:42:11	@BigBigstickaz @goatactual @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon Pretty much. I can pull up tons of racist tweets by you but choose not to
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:40:44	@BigBigstickaz @goatactual @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon So let's just be civil and end it there.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:39:53	@BigBigstickaz @goatactual @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon @TubingTyler Wasn't even human, but was a better human than you.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:39:14	@BigBigstickaz @goatactual @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon sure.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:38:56	@BigBigstickaz @goatactual @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon No you brought up bipolar a legitimate illness

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:37:15	@BigBigstickaz @goatactual @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon Not really it's on you for perpetuating the mental health stigma
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:36:15	@BigBigstickaz @goatactual @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon @TubingTyler All I said is I'm at Jack in the box
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:35:45	@BigBigstickaz @goatactual @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon All I said is basically your tweet was insensitive to a disease
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:34:50	@goatactual @BigBigstickaz @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon Say's the guy who fucked his mother, according to his bio...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:34:02	@BigBigstickaz @goatactual @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon @TubingTyler I didn't threaten assumed it was agreed upon.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 12:33:22	@BigBigstickaz @goatactual @KCBrackley @azwake17 @JimMcFierceSon I didn't view it as a joke and said as much in my very first tweet

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:43:09	@BigBigstickaz @JimMcFierceSon @KCBrackley @TubingTyler @azwake17 No, I could care less. Just draw the line at making fun of sick people.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:37:52	@BigBigstickaz @JimMcFierceSon @KCBrackley @TubingTyler @azwake17 Not saying that saying Bipolar is a disease and deserves same respect.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:36:57	@tlscadden1 Check my @'s
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:36:36	@BigBigstickaz @JimMcFierceSon @KCBrackley @TubingTyler @azwake17 Just because you can't see an illness doesn't mean it isn't real man.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:34:45	@BigBigstickaz @JimMcFierceSon @KCBrackley @TubingTyler @azwake17 So you would joke about cancer? You're a very classy dude.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:33:40	So apparently I'm in a twitter argument with someone who thinks Bipolar isn't a disease...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:32:07	@BigBigstickaz @JimMcFierceSon @KCBrackley @TubingTyler @azwake17 Bipolar isn't a choice, it's a disease and you're pretty ignorant.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:29:59	@BigBigstickaz @JimMcFierceSon @KCBrackley @TubingTyler @azwake17 Bipolar is a disease just like cancer man. Not a joking matter.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:28:29	@BigBigstickaz @JimMcFierceSon @KCBrackley @TubingTyler @azwake17 You used bipolar to make fun. Would you say the same about cancer?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:27:40	I hate it when people use the term bipolar to make fun of things...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:25:52	@JimSharpe Thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:25:39	@BigBigstickaz @JimMcFierceSon @KCBrackley @TubingTyler @azwake17 Just saying it is adding to the mental illness stigma.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:23:43	@JimSharpe What is tomorrow's debate format?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:20:32	@purple_n_orange @TubingTyler @lumpdog602 @DiscountTire You'd think weed would cause more flat tires from hitting curbs...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:19:06	@BigBigstickaz @JimMcFierceSon @KCBrackley @TubingTyler @azwake17 I'll be honest. I'm Bipolar and this tweet offends me a little.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:07:58	@mechanical_meat WOW!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 11:05:43	After #ProjectVeritas where is the call for @HillaryClinton to drop out. Those actions are illegal.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:38:13	Congress and the Senate should be chosen via a draft lotto that way every class truly has a say so in government.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:35:44	Congress should just meet via secured video chat. That way they spend more time with the people who elected them and save some money.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:17:09	@TubingTyler @bobstroup @bt602 @KCBrackley I gave up on being a Mormon when my parents tried to send me to Detroit for my mission.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:16:10	Not that it's a good thing but I get away with a lot because people blame my mental illness.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:15:17	@TubingTyler @bobstroup @bt602 @KCBrackley But the rule on a mission must go in pairs.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:14:21	@TubingTyler @bobstroup @bt602 @KCBrackley I was a Mormon growing up. They will avoid the entire street.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:13:26	@bobstroup @bt602 @KCBrackley Give me the address I''ll scare them. I'm bipolar so the police give me a lot of wiggle room.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:11:21	@bobstroup @bt602 There's an online app you can use to take pics and report. Seems to work better.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:10:43	@bobstroup @bt602 I just stop taking my meds and become "crazy" for a few days scares the F out of them and they avoid me at all costs.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:06:49	' @bobstroup @bt602 Don't forget animal abuse. Tell him you're calling the news stations about it too
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:03:30	@bobstroup Yeah, he said made more doing construction in Vegas. He has like 8 kids though.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:02:02	@bt602 Call Sheriff Joe and say you suspect it's a drug house or full of illegals. Swat team and tank in 10 min maybe
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 10:00:47	@bobstroup Well, he said so when he did a Q&A at Gameworks back in the day. Said not a living wage so he did construction in the offseason.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 09:59:23	@bt602 How many rooms? There's a law limiting people per room in a home.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-19 09:42:21	@bobstroup Kinda sucks for the players. Their pay drops down to like $250 a game.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-17 09:51:56	WOW! My family is pretty messed up arguing on Facebook right now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-17 09:34:27	@TweetLilLatina It's how I found out my mom died.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-17 09:33:33	@TweetLilLatina Now she's going on about my aunt who took care of my Grandma posting about a few hours later. If anyone should post...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-17 09:26:43	So my brother didn't tell my sister–in–law Grandma passed away and she found out via facebook from one of my aunts...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-17 08:32:40	As tough as it may be there is a positive side to her death. I know she was in so much pain every day for the last decade. She's free now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-17 08:29:14	And there goes my sobriety... It was fun (Not Really) while it lasted.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-14 11:01:40	I hate it when someone says "I'm not white, so I can't be racist" they are a special kind of stupid.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-14 06:41:10	The thing I find funny about these "Election Polls" is they only poll people with landline telephones. At least here in Arizona, that is.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-10 12:30:37	Don't trust my political opinion. I voted for Ross Perot in 1996.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-10 12:18:08	One day I will try applying for one of these job openings at work. I think I need a better control of my illness first. #mentalhealth
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-10 12:08:00	The #Debate should have ended with a priest administering last rites to America.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-10 05:10:25	I can't decide who to vote for so maybe I should actually watch the #debate #elections2016
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-10 05:09:32	It's scary that I don't think things can get much worse for Trump yet he is neck and neck still with Hillary.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-10 05:08:13	It's #Debatenight and I bet because of the latest outrage it gets really good ratings.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-08 00:46:28	@purple_n_orange I liked watching how people last week were "The season is over" and now they are saying "Here come the playoffs"
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-08 00:38:53	@purple_n_orange @KCBrackley @marblekyle My mom died of cancer and I won't donate any money to them. I avoid all the pink products too.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-08 00:30:06	It's 2016 and we have holograms and stuff but no edit tweet button.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-08 00:28:55	@thecupcakegirl8 You're very brave and always make me feel like I'm not alone. #SickNotWeak
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-08 00:24:33	I find hurricanes super scary. I've been afraid of drowning all of my life which is why I can't swim.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-08 00:20:21	@JoetheSicilian I need to see if my work will approve those days off. Hopefully, at least one day.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 23:44:33	@marblekyle @KCBrackley I read an article in June that they were trying to distance themselves from Susan G. Komen because of backlash.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 23:32:15	Seeing all these people post about evacuating in Florida. Do you really think someone was thinking I'm not going until Hillary says so?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 23:29:34	The Cards may have gotten Kap his job back. TBH he can't do any worse...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 04:32:31	Almost time to go to work. I wish I could be on Twitter while I work.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 04:31:06	@SimbaTalks "Bipolar disorder is just a made up disease and you just say you have it because such and such celebrity said they did..."

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 04:25:18	@JoetheSicilian @SimbaTalks You're just lazy and made up this illness so you don't have to grow up and have a real job...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 04:23:20	@SimbaTalks "Why can't you just act normal"
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 04:21:36	@purple_n_orange I should've charged you $5 to get it back
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 04:21:02	@SimbaTalks "If you stop taking those meds and stop being such a baby you'll get better..."

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 02:57:14	@SB_MikeMay I'm going to watch
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 02:54:20	@SB_MikeMay I've listened to the games, but haven't watched one yet because of other things going on.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 02:34:11	@ScottHoward42 It's not going to @LarryFitzgerald He rarely throws to him for some reason.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 02:28:41	@knownasharley Hope you feel better soon.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 02:17:53	@xxhatred Have you tried listening to Tibetan bowl music when you lay down. It's really relaxing and helps me when I don't take a sleep aid
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 02:01:06	My daughter's school is handing out iPads for kids to use during the school year. I wonder if they thought this through...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 01:45:47	My dog almost got away while I was walking him. So glad he listens when I say sit.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 00:53:41	. @dougducey hasn't really done anything other than cheat schools out of money. What a legacy!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-07 00:23:59	I thought I spotted a creepy clown today but it was just my neighbor in a muumuu with heavy makeup on.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 23:35:49	@purple_n_orange You going to find him and beat him up? I'll help.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 23:33:50	I'm rooting for a @Browns upset this week.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 23:31:26	The only reason Carson Palmer would've been in the hospital this week would be to visit the sick kids.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 23:29:10	@TubingTyler Mosquitoes because I'm allergic to bees.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 23:28:29	I bet at least 99% of these clown reports are fake.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 23:27:03	@PHXCards11 Sources say he died and will rise again in 3 days to become football Jesus.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 23:23:02	@JoetheSicilian is that our plan for today? We can be the anti-social media dynamic duo!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 23:22:19	Do all dogs like to play fight? Mine has been doing it all morning today with me.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 22:17:59	@RichBiscuit21 You'll get one. Just keep trying.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 21:51:28	Can someone please hide all the early ballots for voters in Sun City so that @RealSheriffJoe doesn't get re-elected?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 21:48:29	@JoetheSicilian I will look into her today. It would be nice to vote for someone who isn't an idiot :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 21:45:34	@JoetheSicilian I may vote for @GovGaryJohnson He won't win, but if he gets enough votes it will show the 2 party system isn't working.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 21:43:40	@JoetheSicilian I'll vote for whoever if they buy me a bottle of tequila.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 21:38:55	My mouse sucks. The scroll wheel doesn't wanna work right. Looks like I have to buy a new one.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 21:34:13	@JoetheSicilian Good morning!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 21:33:55	The main reason I will never live on the east coast is I'm afraid of hurricanes. #HurricaneMatthew
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 20:58:40	@MiggyMoonbeam I'm sorry. I hope things get better for you.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 20:54:24	Can't sleep and don't work until this afternoon so I guess I'll just catch up on Twitter.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 08:44:06	@purple_n_orange Looks like it's Johnny Manziel or Tebow time
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 08:42:46	@kinseyschofield Obama had your phone hacked by the NSA lol...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 08:37:40	@Patsnation87 @Browns I wonder how much a $20 bet on the Browns win would pay out.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 08:36:12	@Patsnation87 Watch the @Browns shock everyone and win.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 08:34:33	@thecupcakegirl8 It's okay to hide for awhile. The important thing is you climb back out from under that rock eventually.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 08:28:14	@thecupcakegirl8 Oh, no! Keep moving forward and this feeling will pass.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 08:26:00	@knownasharley Lots of steroids and bad money management probably.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 08:24:42	@paulcoro Just keep him away from the Kardashians.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 08:08:31	So Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar at Survivor Series. Not sure how I feel about that.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 07:01:01	@JoetheSicilian That sucks. Do you have any hobbies that can help distract you?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:50:39	@IQinspector Nice!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:48:56	@ddlovato Best of luck!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:43:44	Google Pixel looks amazing. Too bad it's exclusive to @verizon
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:31:30	I read a fan article today saying that the Cards should sign Manziel if Carson can't go next week either.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:25:35	@SimbaTalks I hope you weren't hurt.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:20:36	@Pinkishlypink66 Can you return it if you don't want it now?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:18:21	@BrandonLeeTV I've seen 3 so far this week.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:17:43	The worst part of having #anxiety is thinking that you're going to die every time you do something that is out of your comfort zone.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:12:36	To all those who have been affected by Hurricane Matthew I hope you are well and unharmed.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:09:34	@JoetheSicilian Glad you have them now. I'm sure waiting sucked. Hope you never go through that again.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:05:50	@purple_n_orange WOW! That was the real account. They're definitely different than most brands I see.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 06:03:06	@TubingTyler @SB_MikeMay They can cover what @realDonaldTrump ate for lunch but not this. This is why I hate the US media.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 05:54:16	@MentalHelpNet Don't be ashamed and never ever apologize for having an illness.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 05:52:08	@JoetheSicilian Did you ever get your pain med situation fixed?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 05:50:46	@MentalHelpNet If people would just share their stories most people will realize that anyone can have a mental illness.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 05:47:14	@georgevaraiza @MentalHelpNet My dog helps a lot with my anxiety. Less attacks since I got him.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 05:44:39	I hate when someone does something that makes the news they dwell on mental heath issue and not that they were a bad person #mentalhelpchat
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 05:42:11	@projectmonark Not sure about that. I do know that I am though...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 05:41:05	If more people were open about their health we could end the stigma #mentalhelpchat
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 05:38:00	#MentalHelpChat Twitter follower conversations have done way more for me than going to therapy. Thanks for the help everyone.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 05:34:11	@KingLouieLouie Just run the ball every play and we don't need a QB

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 03:33:42	@JoetheSicilian They may be related to him and rich though so don't be too picky.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 03:27:36	@FlyByKnite Let me know who "wins"
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 03:24:55	@SB_MikeMay @bt602 @49ers Just run the ball every play. They won't be able to stop us.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 03:21:55	@SB_MikeMay @bt602 It's the @49ers of course we win...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 02:50:01	@Mr_Farenheit_ It's actually really good. *Disclaimer: I'll eat almost anything.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 02:43:24	Woot! Stanton is getting his time to shine. #BirdGang @AZCardinals
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-06 02:35:52	Kinda makes we wish we had kept a 3rd QB. https:// twitter.com/AZCardinals/st atus/783735600562089985 …

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-05 10:29:17	Clowns are threatening schools. What are they going to do make balloon animals?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-05 10:26:31	@JoetheSicilian The scary part is most of the people I follow have some type of mental illness...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-05 10:22:08	According to Twitter Pence is doing better than Trump and should coach him for the next debate... #VPDebate
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-05 10:17:35	Does the Vice presidential debate even matter? We had freaking Dan Quayle in that position at one point. Just appoint a potato. #VPDebate
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-05 09:59:55	Are people watching the debate or just tweeting about it? I've never watched one...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-04 07:13:18	The Dbacks should make Mark Grace the new coach.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-04 06:51:32	@purple_n_orange Also, stay off the Suns Reddit page. There are people talking about winning the title this year...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-04 06:48:39	I can't go to @Walmart without having a #anxiety attack. That place is too crowded especially at the checkout.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-04 06:44:22	I still am an undecided voter though.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-04 06:42:12	Heard someone say "Trump will bring America back to God" I was like why because they will be praying that they can survive his presidency?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-04 06:09:13	@IQinspector HMMM. I never was screened for that as far as I know. I was diagnosed as Bipolar 2 with PTSD and Socaial Anxiety.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-03 09:19:30	If I didn't need it for work I'd probably delete my Facebook.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-03 09:18:44	@JoetheSicilian Because my wife can't work more than 30 hours a week because the company she's at doesn't want to provide insurance.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-03 08:13:44	@JoetheSicilian I like them because I have to work every single one. Since football season started they are really easy days.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-03 08:12:35	@Coximus2 Play a drinking game and take a drink every time he throws an interception ;)

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-03 08:05:40	I'll be honest I don't care about W-L. I only really care that the game is fun to watch.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-03 07:26:55	Someone needs to teach the @AZCardinals the heimlich maneuver because they're choking.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-03 06:49:16	The @RAIDERS might actually be a contender this year.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-01 11:52:55	@mechanical_meat Nice! Great job!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-01 10:33:44	@astigmafreezone It's hard and unfortunate but you did the right thing in the long run. No room in life for racism.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-01 08:29:48	I've seen so many Facebook friends unfriend each other over this election.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-01 08:06:44	I think social media is better than having a therapist. #mentalhealth
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-01 08:05:11	@thecupcakegirl8 Oh no!!! I hope you are able to fight it off and feel better soon!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-01 07:53:14	@DunlapSports Would be worse if no results came back.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-01 07:37:21	@projectmonark I am a completely different person off my meds and I don't like that guy.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-01 07:35:19	@SimbaTalks It will :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-01 07:34:51	@projectmonark They told me because I'm #bipolar I will be on meds for the rest of my life...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-01 07:29:46	@projectmonark I don't think I will go off. I think wanting to go off them is a sign that I'm stable TBH.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-10-01 05:56:04	If the cop that shot had a dash cam it would be at the perfect angle to see exactly what happened #ElCajon

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-09-22 14:37:21	@JeffMoore78 I went to school in the same time frame but only saw them in stores...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-09-22 14:35:45	I'm still sad that I never got to use a Crayola sharpener as a kid...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-09-01 04:32:10	I never realized that @Costco sells their own brand of alcohol
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-09-01 02:14:38	Lunch with the wife. Island fire chicken https://www. instagram.com/p/BJyGJ85BeH7/
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-09-01 00:42:34	@purple_n_orange shhh! We don't use that name anymore like Voldermort
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 14:48:25	@JoetheSicilian Try drinking some coffee.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 14:17:55	@AngelTilaLove how much bath salts do you smoke a day?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 13:26:13	Are there any good Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton parity accounts? All the ones I've seen so far have sucked.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 13:15:39	@thesplat 12
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 13:14:22	Actually, Goodfellas was made in 1990 so it was a 26-year-old spoiler.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 13:11:55	Can you really get mad about a spoiler when the movie is over 10 years old?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 13:08:48	The @Dbacks should sign @TimTebow just because his name alone will put butts into the seats.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 13:06:40	I think Arizona is full of crazy people and people who are possibly too old to know what/who they are voting for.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 12:36:08	Can anything else go wrong for @SecretaryReagan
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 12:29:59	@purple_n_orange So she will turn into a flesh eating zombie soon? https:// twitter.com/purple_n_orang e/status/770840717551767552 …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 12:26:11	I wonder what kind of drugs Tila Tequila is on? Whatever it is I definitely don't want to try them.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 12:13:10	I guess worst-case scenario we end up with a bad president for four years.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 12:05:16	Saving up to get my medical marijuana card. I know it will help my pain and PTSD.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 12:02:10	I'm feeling pretty good right now. I just wish my left knee would stop hurting.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 10:45:13	@bobstroup @whiskeysquicker Totally agree!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 10:30:47	@purple_n_orange I wonder if they were extra crispy when they died. Lightning can do a lot of damage. #carnivore
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 10:13:56	Did you remember to vote today?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 09:50:44	@AriannaBayBay @UnderhookDDT The same thing that happened to his inability to speak.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 07:03:08	@fluffyguy just by a 3XL coffin. You're pretty well-off. Then again, there is always cremation.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 06:08:11	I learned a valuable lesson today. Never do your fantasy draft before the end of the preseason.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 06:07:11	Arizonans whose worse @RealSheriffJoe or @realDonaldTrump ?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 06:04:05	Wait… Did he die? I thought it was just a knee injury. https:// twitter.com/JayGlazer/stat us/770732099661815808 …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 05:56:06	@nativeangelaz In that case, it might be worth it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 05:55:12	I feel bad for the @Vikings . Teddy Bridgewater going down was the last thing Minnesota needed. Somebody call Brett Favre.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-31 03:04:40	@nativeangelaz I did but it wasn't really worth it for my cats.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 12:14:43	@JeffMoore78 @FightOwensFight . Now, we probably get a Triple H versus Stephanie McMahon feud
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 12:08:40	If God is real then why doesn't he make Christian music sound better?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 11:56:37	Today was just a really long boring day. I'm glad that I only work three hours tomorrow.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 11:52:33	Someone didn't show up at work today so I had to do an extra shift.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 04:16:21	So sorry to hear of the death of Gene Wilder. Huge loss of an amazing talent. pic.twitter.com/kbZNOIGdQm
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 02:06:40	It's one thing to send out pictures of yourself, but putting your son into the picture is really disgusting Anthony Weiner.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 01:54:05	@Greinkschmidt I bet he was a @Suns fan since his cousin is the mascot.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 01:52:12	@darrenrovell That looks delicious!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 01:51:28	@azredlizard You too!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 01:50:12	@PunkSyndarela Have fun!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 01:49:14	I like to plan out my week in advance. I always get upset when something or someone causes a change to my schedule.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 00:20:47	Don't know why but I volunteered to do extra work today for free.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-30 00:07:58	Some 90 year old looking man asked me "What up dog. Then told me my shirt was dope.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 23:18:21	Mark Sanchez to Arizona if he gets cut?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 23:11:08	I'm finding out that I'm blocked from some people that I've never even heard of.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 23:09:11	My goal is to follow 200 people today. Send me your suggestions of good people to follow.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 22:58:23	I would really like a hamburger. What a weird feeling to wake up to.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 13:32:00	However, the second and third one were trash.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 13:31:21	Jurassic Park was such a great movie!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 13:15:03	@JeffMoore78 It seems like Sunday nights would be semi-busy.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 12:30:07	@jayjayGoFast no but players need to practice against someone it might as well be against a player on the cusp of making the team.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 12:16:44	Had Ramen noodles with chicken added to it for dinner.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 12:14:24	@jayjayGoFast and who do you keep around for the final roster and practice squad.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 11:48:07	@Suns6thMan @purple_n_orange What about competitive speed walking? It's actually an Olympic sport.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 11:39:43	Are selfie sticks still a thing?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 11:33:56	I have the soundtrack of the movie/musical Rent stuck in my head tonight for some reason.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 11:28:42	@Cap_Kaveman Why not just hire somebody to write you a summary of the show highlighting what went on?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 10:38:06	If you get a medical marijuana card your insurance should have to buy your weed.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 10:35:54	@kinseyschofield Post a video and have people bombard Beyoncé's twitter with it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 10:33:57	They should have a lottery when people vote. Pull three names in each state and give the winner cash. That would get more votes.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 10:28:49	I'm starting to think that the Dallas Cowboys are cursed.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 10:27:44	"MR. Fuji" HARRY FUJIWARA passed away. I remember always hating his character on TV. He was a great heal.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 10:25:59	@jayjayGoFast Do you think he just has some undisclosed injury?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 10:25:16	@jayjayGoFast Would they save any money by cutting him?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 10:21:08	Is there any chance that Barkley beats out Stanton for the number two job?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 10:17:52	Cardinals needs to bring in one solid backup offensive lineman.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 09:39:40	@MHWarriorMegsy I need to do one for the medication my insurance won't cover and I can't afford.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 08:17:20	I'm not sure if the Cardinals looked bad or if the Texans were really good...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 06:09:45	Kaepernick to AZ or nah?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-29 06:07:57	@AZCardinals are looking pretty terrible today.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-28 20:36:22	Up early for a morning shift.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-28 00:29:58	I respect Colin Kaepernick for sitting down for what he believes in.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-28 00:00:21	@KCBrackley She is @EviQuaid on twitter but Youtube is https://www. youtube.com/channel/UCPdxE vJXVJPYBN9EGR6yD0w …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 23:51:41	@KCBrackley If you want to see something really bad check out his wife's YouTube channel.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 23:46:37	@KCBrackley yes I did
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 23:45:24	@KCBrackley My worst fear is that one day I end up like him.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 14:43:45	Free 8x10 photo from Walgreens until Sunday with the coupon code "FREESTUFF"
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 14:38:50	@crobin500 Best of luck on whatever you choose.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 05:43:05	@Ihatethisugh1 I thought a Glock would be enough.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 05:31:04	I had the hiccups for more than a day now
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 05:28:40	@notmydisability I hope you feel better soon!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 05:12:28	@notmydisability At least they didn't have people escort you there. Being forced to go is scary.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 05:00:27	Don't buy blue @MarthaStewart bedsheets unless you want to look like a Smurf when you sweat at night.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 04:54:56	No sign yet of the Serial Street Shooter. I am actually looking for him though because I want that reward.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 04:18:10	My wife is addicted to watching all of these ghost/paranormal shows on @DestAmerica
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 04:01:10	Cymbalta has helped my depression and my arthritis pain at least.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 03:57:14	@pup_ear_nibbles I think I will once I get off the Risperidone
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 03:55:30	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm on Cymbalta, Prozac and Risperidone which have resulted in about an 80 pound gain over a year.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-27 03:50:34	@TheWrightMyke I didn't like that book

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 14:01:35	I need money! Who wants to help me hunt down this serial shooter?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 13:50:59	I think I ate too much at @Outback
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 10:24:57	At least @Costco has cold water bottles for a quarter
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 10:15:02	I feel like an outsider around my wife's family
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 10:03:42	I should have brought my painkillers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 10:01:06	I think @Costco should sell giant bags like @IKEAUSA
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 09:57:51	The swarm app makes me feel like Waldo except nobody ever finds me
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 09:29:27	I wanna wish my wife @ErinLand20 Happy Birthday
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 09:25:56	Thinking about keeping the kids home from school tomorrow because their grandma is in town and they haven't seen her in years.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 09:23:52	@purple_n_orange I'm sure they've dealt with worse
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 09:21:36	I like that @Costco now takes @Visa
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 09:19:03	Hate when I get a bloody nose for no reason
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 09:16:47	Sinkholes keep popping up in places I seem to drive by daily
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 09:15:14	I really like @twitter night mode
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-26 09:14:01	Too stressed and tired to go walk around @Costco with my family so I'm chilling on a food court bench.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 10:41:20	Put my recliner at my desk so that I can be more comfortable while I work
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 08:39:26	@Pinkishlypink66 My son's teacher
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 08:35:47	So my kids got questioned by CPS today at school because my youngest has eczema. What a great use of tax dollars and time...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 08:30:25	I'm kinda glad Hope Solo got suspended. She has been giving women's soccer a bad name.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 08:08:52	Saw this on Reddit pic.twitter.com/ZaS5l8XqSv
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 07:43:10	@purple_n_orange I bet it is the Los Angeles Lakers account.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 07:42:23	My wife cooked some chocolate cake and said it was for dinner. I kinda wanted something with meat.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 07:40:40	@purple_n_orange Oh, I thought you meant your switching accounts with them. So that you would have the millions of followers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 07:37:56	@purple_n_orange That's why you always have a fall guy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 07:06:18	@fluffyguy Did you down some waffles to celebrate #NationalWaffleDay ?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 06:28:53	@fluffyguy @Patron @DietCoke Have you tried Diet Dr. Pepper?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 06:07:42	I always tweet when @Walgreens makes me mad. Today however, they got my meds right...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 06:04:22	Xanax works better than Lorazepam.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 05:54:29	. @Lesdoggg is one of the funniest people alive and deserves nothing but good things. The internet is full of racist, woman hating cowards.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 05:49:07	My kittens have discovered that they can go outside.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 05:37:25	@DEPRESSI0NISTA I did that yesterday. It's not lazy it's recharging.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-25 05:33:09	Well, My My My! I'm watching @DiscoveryID #HomicideHunter @LtJoeKenda

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-23 06:14:02	I hurt everywhere today
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-21 10:05:54	@BeauS23 @ufc Unless you are ringside at the fight
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-21 10:03:08	Was Logan Thomas the biggest miss during the B.A. era?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-21 09:57:53	@futieton So what did you learn young lady?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-21 09:50:45	I hope it rains
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-21 08:58:18	Baton Rouge has seen more rainfall in a week than Phoenix has gotten in over the last two-and-a-half years
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-21 08:55:16	Now that Gawker is gone can @TMZ be next?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-21 05:56:52	If @RealSheriffJoe is convicted he will say jail the way he runs it is too harsh for people like him.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-21 03:54:58	@JeffMoore78 WOW
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-20 12:44:47	Doctor said I should try it

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-20 12:37:23	It would be funny to see @RealSheriffJoe in tent city
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-08-20 12:36:04	@FlyByKnite Have them compete against each other. Problem solved.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:49:20	Ever think that some people weren't made for life
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:44:19	Why do people blindly believe the media? They always have an agenda.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:40:39	Irresponsible news coverage ruins lives.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:36:19	@dumbafpower You need life alert bro
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:34:59	I wish @olivegarden delivered
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:34:20	Have you ever done a ride along with a cop?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:31:47	Is @Carrabbas any good?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:24:27	Glad my wife's @JaredDudley619 @Suns jersey is relevant again…
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:21:51	I hate all shooting regardless of what the person's skin color is. Badge or no badge killing somebody is just completely wrong.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:19:24	Some of these commercials make me want to buy these crappy as seen on TV items.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:17:24	Not saying the shootings were justified but if you don't want to get shot don't fight the police...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:13:44	I don't like guns but I support your right to own one.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:11:12	Can we just go back to the days we fought with swords instead of guns?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 12:07:59	Murder is wrong whether you wear a ski mask or a badge.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 11:59:53	@purple_n_orange Is it an app? Real game?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 11:59:06	Why didn't the cops have a taser?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 11:57:26	@907dbackfan @KCBrackley I want that!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 11:56:49	Shoot targets not people
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 04:55:40	I think my new heart med is working. I feel a lot better on it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 04:54:57	I hate these ASPCA commercials.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 04:53:08	@purple_n_orange I get it. Hard because he's admitting that he can't win one on his own.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-08 04:44:00	They had to poke me a total of 5 times to get blood out of me. I wonder if I'm dead and just don't know it.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-07 13:12:21	How do people get their five recommended servings of fruit when they only make four flavors of Starburst?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-07 12:41:08	@purple_n_orange Changes Twitter name to Purple_n_Gold
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-07 12:38:31	Named one of our kittens John Cena because it's always hiding and we can't see it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-07 12:36:33	I've seen so many different opinions of the shooting of Alton Sterling. I have no opinion because I refuse to watch the video.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-07 07:03:18	@purple_n_orange I definitely don't want to see that!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-07 05:48:53	Erik Estrada is a real cop now? Weird
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-07 02:29:11	Don't you hate it when someone dents your car in the parking lot and just leaves.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-06 06:40:36	I hate the @Cavs but I hope they keep the @warriors from getting the title next season.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 11:22:35	Thinking about deleting my twitter
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 11:21:07	@SDO4540 @RednekMeskinBoy @goatfuqactual They pushed me too far. I can't even right now...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 10:49:16	PTSD is a disease that more than just Vets have. Some people are just ignorant.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 10:44:27	@SDO4540 @goatfuqactual @RednekMeskinBoy Cause it's none of your business TBH
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 10:36:09	@SDO4540 @RednekMeskinBoy @goatfuqactual It is but others can get it. Just need a traumatic event.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 10:32:14	@goatfuqactual @SDO4540 @RednekMeskinBoy Yes. But you seem so ignorant no need to share
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 10:31:39	@RednekMeskinBoy @goatfuqactual @SDO4540 Anyone can get it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 10:24:23	@SDO4540 @goatfuqactual @RednekMeskinBoy Sorry you feel that way. PTSD is real though.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 09:51:44	@SDO4540 PTSD centers around shooting and killing a guy who tried to rob me at gun point.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 09:50:39	July 4th and Jan 1st are bad days for me
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 09:46:33	@SDO4540 No, just been around a lot of death involving gun shots. It's hard to even function with loud noise.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-04 09:40:03	Drugs INC is pretty interesting.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-01 13:56:28	Just think of what it would discover
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-01 13:55:54	Kim Kardashian is so loose that she probably could fit the entire Mars rover inside of her vagina.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-01 13:53:29	I want to try to get blocked by celebrities
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-07-01 13:51:26	I don't wanna go to sleep

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-06-14 10:36:22	Trying to explain mental illness to someone who's never experienced it is like trying to explain color to a blind person.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-06-14 10:34:57	Unhealthy attitudes about ourselves changes the game. We need to focus on practicing self-compassion if we want to pull out of despair.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-06-14 06:43:55	I have depression. But I prefer to say I "battle" depression instead of "I suffer" with it. Because depression hits but I hit back Battle on

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-06-14 06:34:32	I over analyze situations because I'm scared of what will happen if I'm not prepared for it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-06-14 06:32:14	Telling someone "why are you depressed Look at how great life is" is same as saying "what do you mean you have asthma Look at all this air"

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-05 06:43:33	Brace yourself Arizona. It's take a picture of the temperature inside your car season.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-05 06:22:00	Anyone ever hear of or use CBD oil?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-05 06:16:01	Today is the perfect day for a Star Wars movie marathon
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-05 06:14:47	@purple_n_orange some dudes look like they need bras so maybe
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-05 06:13:25	@purple_n_orange Plot twist: It's an all male review.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-05 05:19:19	I feel pretty good today
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-05 05:10:30	I wish I could take my cat to a Diamondbacks game @Dbacks #cats
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-05 04:23:24	More bread. Kids love sandwiches (at @SmartFinal in Phoenix, AZ) https://www. swarmapp.com/c/ljszobeWc78

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:50:08	It looks like I have to stay sober on Cinco de Mayo since I work that night. No cheap drinks for me.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:48:48	As a wannabe Jedi May the 4th is one of the greatest days of the year
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:47:53	I love it when I find bonus food in my beard
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:46:44	@mechanical_meat what really would be shameful if it is Trump versus Hillary
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:39:27	@TehManBob I will be watching
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:34:07	Time for my nighttime insulin. #Diabetes

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:30:06	@BigBigstickaz I have no friends so want to meet my social media one's
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:28:21	@BigBigstickaz South Phoenix. I can make it worth your while though with a couple hundred bucks worth of booze and a whole lot of barbecue.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:23:15	Anybody down for coming to my birthday party on June 25 for free food and drinks? I'd like to meet my twitter friends
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:22:50	Anybody out there having an NBA draft party lottery? I'm thinking about having a barbecue
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:13:19	I'm looking forward to going to @olivegarden before I start work tomorrow
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:12:19	@JoetheSicilian better yet count missed laser shots
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:11:44	I would vote for almost anyone over Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:11:03	@JoetheSicilian try counting the amount of storm troopers in all of the Star Wars movies
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:09:38	Why do girls get tattoos on their breasts? We are already looking there and don't really need the reading material
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:06:42	Anybody want to hear some heavy breathing for me? I will be working out at @PlanetFitness tomorrow
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:05:26	My mouth is so big I probably could fit three or 4 feet before I feel uncomfortable and stop talking
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:04:30	When telemarketers call I like to say you're on the air so tell us about your small penis. They hang up almost instantaneously.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:02:15	If your wife is not controlling your life she really isn't that into you.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 14:00:06	If Hillary gets elected I will build a survival bunker in the woods. If Trump does I will get Mexicans to do it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:59:18	Dear Cinderella. If you find yourself losing your shoe at midnight you might want to slow down on the tequila.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:57:53	I think recipes are worse than online dating profiles. They definitely never look like a picture.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:57:01	Shout out to my Amish friends who will never read my tweets.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:56:28	Life would be fun if it was as easy to get rich as it is to get fat.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:55:25	If my car alarm sounded like Hillary Clinton's giggle no one would dare touch my car.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:53:33	@_NPOB one out of five probably
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:52:53	I can totally see a commemorative Prince plate going for 19.99 on the Home Shopping Network
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:51:27	I need to make a voodoo doll of myself and force it to go to the gym
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:50:41	Only thing I lost during my diet was the will to live
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:50:07	Nine out of ten of my Facebook friends are into pyramid schemes apparently
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:49:21	If you accidentally swallowed the seven scrabble tiles do you think you can make a word via your poop
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:47:41	I want to take my cat to a Dbacks game to see how the dogs would react.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:46:33	Have you ever had a song stuck in your head that you didn't know the words to?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:45:52	@IGotTuckerFever how many days of school do you have left?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:45:38	If I didn't have to deal with people I totally would be a people person.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:45:06	Worst bank to rob is probably a sperm bank. Unless you're lacking a lot of protein
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:43:51	I would run away to join the circus but they stopped having elephants as part of the show.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:42:52	My first car had a chalkboard so that you could write down the speed you thought you were going.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:42:01	Can you just use your mug shot as your updated DMV photo?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:41:00	I am the creepy person that walks behind you and forces you to jog faster
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:40:00	Weird thought of the day: That blood you donated for 20 bucks could be in someone else's boner right now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:35:54	I survived work tonight. So it's time to reward myself with a couple alcoholic beverages before bed.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:29:59	I'm downing some ibuprofen for my toothache
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 13:27:32	@SB_MikeMay then go to sleep
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 08:24:47	The @olivegarden went out of their way to make up for my bad experience.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 04:40:33	Please don't work on your own car if your entire working knowledge of automotive repair is derived from the song "The Wheels on the Bus"
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 04:05:55	@Keurig should have a national descale your brewer day. Maybe 10% off solution
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 04:02:03	Thanks @CoxComm for fixing my bill. You guys are awesome
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-04 03:45:33	Getting my bill straightened out. Overcharged 75 bucks (@Cox Solutions Store - @coxcomm in Tolleson, AZ) https://www. swarmapp.com/c/emxrZQALIkk
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 17:42:10	Can't sleep
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 12:09:18	My blood sugar is probably why I haven't been feeling well.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 12:05:15	My blood sugar tonight was 216 after my meal :-(
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 11:54:08	I need a vacation
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 11:50:59	@IGotTuckerFever I wish you were my kids teacher
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 11:50:28	Those diet Dr Pepper commercials are creepy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 11:10:12	R.I.P announce table #WWE #RAW
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 11:00:49	When it Reigns it bores #WWE #RAW
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 10:53:59	AJ Styles is a darn good wrestler @WWE #RAW
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 10:50:08	I'm sitting here craving @KFC coleslaw
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 08:00:12	Kinda disappointed that "Naked" Cops on Spike TV only has naked dudes.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 06:50:49	I bet @WWEAaLLday21 has one hell of a concussion. #WWEPayback
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 06:49:06	These Dr Pepper cherry commercials are stupid.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 04:42:02	@JeffMoore78 To find out who the father of a kid is?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 03:02:43	Not feeling that satisfied after visiting @olivegarden today
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 03:01:23	Okay Doctor you got my attention at insulin pump #diabetes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-03 02:57:51	@JeffMoore78 @WWEAaLLday21 Probably has a wicked concussion
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-02 03:09:04	Does Grant Hill still drink @Sprite inquiring minds want to know
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-02 03:04:49	One year from now ESPN will run an article about whatever happened to purple shirt guy.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-05-01 02:40:03	Kirk Cameron is an idiot
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 12:27:24	@AZJoshM is there anything you like? I know you hate the @Suns right now
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 12:25:25	I voted for prop 123 because I don't think the governor or the legislature in Arizona will follow the already passed laws
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 12:24:09	@AZJoshM I don't mind them when they're losing
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 12:22:32	@AZJoshM he is an upgraded coach though
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 12:06:38	I'm watching @GhostBrothersTV
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 11:58:34	@KennyAndCrash @SpeedFreaks I think that the NFL draft is the bigger story in Phoenix at least
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 11:57:56	The @Lakers are still going to be a lottery team next year regardless of who the coach is #LukeWalton
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 11:55:10	@purple_n_orange Cards getting some value guys
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 11:54:38	Cards draft has been pretty good so far
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 11:53:43	@purple_n_orange you really don't follow college football do you?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 11:50:02	Is my bipolar disease a death sentence?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 11:48:48	My teeth hurt
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 11:34:08	Another @WWE Announcer Released: Kyle Edwards, real name Arda Ocal, has announced on Twitter he has also parted ways with WWE.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 11:29:23	#90 will always be Dockett even though he blocked me on Twitter
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 11:28:28	WWE's Dolph Ziggler's brother Donald Nemeth wanted for aggravated murder!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 11:21:48	@TehManBob I have like 3 I no longer use since we moved to a newer place. No more brick blocking the signal
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 10:46:17	I hope that the @MiamiHEAT don't make it out of the first round.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 10:43:29	@KCBrackley No. It's squeals every time it sees my cat
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 10:42:52	I'm ready for the @LAClippers to get eliminated tonight
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 10:40:30	Luke Walton definitely is an upgrade for the @Lakers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 10:39:06	My neighbors have a pig. It's so weird hearing it squeal when they let It outside.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 10:38:14	I think Cops is one of the best shows on TV. What's weird is I always seem to see someone I know every few months.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 10:36:46	One thing I learned from watching Cops is never run from the police. Then again I'm fat so I wouldn't get far anyway.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 10:35:50	Luke Walton to the @Lakers ?! That's interesting.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 10:32:19	Love watching Cops
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 07:48:14	@TweetLilLatina That's a great photo!

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-30 07:22:45	I wish my lorazepam worked better
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-29 04:59:25	I'm loving the weather this week
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-29 04:53:52	Kids today will never know the struggle of typing a school report with a manual typewriter. That sucked.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-29 04:42:40	@ElPolloLoco Yep, I just had one today.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-29 04:33:32	@JeffMoore78 Hope you make some extra money at least then
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-29 04:05:34	Only a couple more weeks before my kids have summer break

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-29 02:58:03	I really like @ElPolloLoco salads
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-29 02:55:11	Wow! @ElPolloLoco is so crowded I feel like I'm at Walmart with just one lane open
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-29 00:35:07	I wonder if the Cardinals will trade out of the first-round.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-29 00:25:00	@JimSonOfGreg I really think both of them are going to end up being busts. Of the to the Wentz is better.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-29 00:20:23	@JimSonOfGreg More like Wentz is the Leaf Goff is the Tebow
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-28 23:06:13	Have you ever been angry at your body for getting sick?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-28 13:53:40	@AZ_Charlene will they pay if this fails
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-28 13:48:42	He's not getting me today! My numbers are lower than they have been a while. #diabetes pic.twitter.com/nzJ2fwYbUm
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-28 13:43:46	Would a Kevin McHale led Houston Rockets team have beaten the injured Golden State Warriors?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-28 13:42:14	@mechanical_meat That sounds like fun! Enjoy!

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-27 06:49:49	I wonder if the @Suns will try to trade for Blake Griffin this summer...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-27 06:42:10	@purple_n_orange seriously, though, thanks for the tweet. I have a lot to dispose of...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-27 06:27:10	My son is student of the month at his school :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-27 05:54:01	Poor Clippers.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-27 05:49:27	@JimSonOfGreg You vote for the delegate not the actual presidential candidate.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-27 04:37:45	@mechanical_meat it's okay. Now that I got a new doctor it's starting to get under control.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-04-27 04:34:05	According to Swarm I visit a lot of home improvement stores which is weird considering we rent our home.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-26 11:44:31	I filled in my early ballot today for @BernieSanders
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-26 11:11:39	This beard balm has my beard filling amazing!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-26 11:08:22	I've got to doctor appointments tomorrow and the entire weekend off. Time for some mischief.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-26 09:58:12	3 days off. Time to relax, write and maybe drink.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-25 11:15:03	I wish I was an ostrich so that I could put my head in the sand right now and hide.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-25 10:06:18	Finally over the flu. Only took 11 days.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-25 10:03:24	This stuff feels amazing in my beard!!! pic.twitter.com/NHRVySfraR
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-25 08:49:02	Suns interview question #1 probably is can you drive a tank?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-25 06:21:05	Grabbing some @Arbys then back to work...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-24 11:40:35	Internet is back!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-24 11:15:05	Great internet outage of 2016 is now at two hours. Send snacks and board games. #cox
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 10:15:45	I find listening to a police scanner is good for my stress levels.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 10:14:35	Shane McMahon is trending. It feels like 1998.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 10:13:36	@futieton I could use one.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 10:12:56	@mechanical_meat Good luck my friend!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:51:27	Will we hear more about this lockbox? #WWE @RAW
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:48:58	How long until they do a Shane buys TNA angle?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:48:15	Sting comes out during Shane vs taker and sets up sting vs taker for SummerSlam?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:47:37	He has to beat Taker. Fans want Shane to win but don't want taker to lose, good booking right there.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:47:04	I care much more for Shane vs Taker than any other match at WM 32
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:45:56	I need a box of #BootyOs . All I got is Wheaties and those are for losers.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:43:21	Shane O'Mac will probably beat the Undertaker with the help of @JohnCena
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:42:38	Shane O'Mac got way bigger of a pop that I thought he would. People miss the old days! #WWE
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:40:45	@Cap_Kaveman isn't it just a filler pay-per-view anyway?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:40:26	No matter what they do on #Raw after the Shane O mac segment this was a great episode
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:31:36	That was a good 30 minute opening segment #RAW
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:30:44	OLD guy vs super OLD Guy @WWE
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:26:59	You can always tell when Vince forgets his lines…
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:15:23	Shane's shoe game is strong!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:13:17	Shane is back!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:11:53	Gotta be an angle. @StephMcMahon !!! #LegacyofExcellence
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:10:08	I hate these WHAT chants. They ruin the show @WWE #RAW
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 09:03:23	I always preferred the face chasing the title to them winning it @WWE .
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 08:51:44	Every business step Amazon takes is to increase its Prime subscription. They raised the free shipping minimum to $49.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 08:50:31	Deadpool set to surpass Passion of the Christ for highest grossing R-rated movie to date.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 08:49:33	Who is the best @Suns player that isn't hurt?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 07:55:44	Happy National Margarita Day!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 07:54:49	I need better anxiety meds...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 04:05:18	I'm really weird when my meds aren't working...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-23 03:54:03	Antonio Cromartie had/had a weird relationship with the @nyjets
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 13:11:49	I wonder what the best way to scare away stray dogs is. They are aggressive.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 12:45:12	Police scanner lady seems a little flirty tonight

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 12:21:02	I like listening to 911 scanner to relax
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 12:14:55	We should be able to text or tweet 911 services...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 12:13:49	I want a police scanner
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 12:09:41	listening to the police scanner...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 12:00:24	Could have gotten 3 stars if Brock won @WWE
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 11:58:46	Edge and Christian was the only good part of the show...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 11:57:23	@Matmenpodcast Awful show. 1 out of 5 stars
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 11:56:12	Wrestlemania is going to suck...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 10:56:33	WWE is getting kinda predictable.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 10:44:05	I hope Jared Fogle gets fat again in prison.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 10:42:31	@Greinkschmidt Try drinking a lot. It helps
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 10:41:40	Let's go Styles. @WWE
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 10:38:54	Don't shoot your gun into the air unless you want to go to jail...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 10:19:47	Hope Charlotte loses @WWE I hate her because of her dad
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:59:44	Shoot a gun in the air? Go to jail loser...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:29:41	Rooting for Dolf to win the IC title.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:27:22	I hate when people shoot guns in the air.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:24:20	Suns need a better 4
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:19:39	After work I will get drunk and watch @WWE
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:18:51	I think @HeymanHustle is probably the best person on the mic in the @WWE
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:17:44	The @Suns show a lot of heart but fall short in the talent department.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:17:15	I hope that Brock wins tonight #WWEFastlane
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:05:35	Del Rio will lose tonight...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:04:45	Brock vs HHH at Mania IMO
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:03:29	Watching WWE Fastlane on the WWENetwork
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 08:02:39	I always get chases/bit by dogs. Maybe I should buy a baton to protect myself.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 06:26:32	Suns earning those ping pong balls today. #TankMode
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 06:25:33	@TubingTyler @Suns I'd rather give a D league guy a shot.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 06:15:54	Wish the @Suns would offer Ronnie Price a buyout. I'd rather play younger guys more.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-22 06:12:12	@Cap_Kaveman But 99% of race cars use metric sizes now...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:21:24	@bobstroup On 2 wait lists
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:17:16	@bobstroup I tried that but everyone was a Dick
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:16:50	I have the brains for war but not the body.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:16:25	I watch videos of the rebels taken on Isis and think all they need is some common sense and military strategy and they can do so much better
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:15:10	I couldn't even make it as a police officer.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:14:52	I'd gladly serve in the military but I'm too old and fat. With mental health issues.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:13:54	Also require three years of military service 18 to 21 so that everyone is ready for an impending war.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:13:17	If you did that you see less mass shootings
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:13:07	Do you want to see less mass shootings? Issue every American 18 and older a 9 mm handgun when they turn 18. Require them to have it 10 years
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:10:45	When Trump or Cruz says he will "utterly defeat ISIS," all he's proving is that he utterly has no understanding of the situation in Syria.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:09:56	Rejecting ISIS brand of Islam, many Kurds turning to Zoroastrianism. "Good words, good thoughts and good actions”
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:08:40	@TheDailySchmuck @ShawnRivard777 A little worse. More like our Kanye and Paris Hilton clone...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:07:09	If I was younger and without health issues I'd join the marines. ISIS must go!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-21 12:05:26	We need a woman's special forces to take on ISIS.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-20 08:59:21	I still don't understand why the @Suns fired Jeff Hornacek if they're in tank mode anyway…

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 13:15:09	@thrillathechase there are so many e-books out there on twitter marketing it's ridiculous. If you can be funny you can get retweets
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 13:13:31	@thrillathechase it helped that Lewis Black retweeted it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 13:12:35	@thrillathechase I have one sponsored that grossed over 10k before
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 13:10:28	@thrillathechase tweet some funny jokes and sponsors will pay you $.20 to a dollar per retweet of an ad

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 12:54:06	I miss Mitch Hedberg he was a good friend and very funny.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 12:50:36	Were they afraid that a satanic prayer would steal their souls? I see nothing wrong with praying to a fictional character.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 12:45:36	If you're a member of the church of Satan DM me because I have questions.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 12:44:19	I was curious about what the Satanic prayer would sound like at the Phoenix City Council. Now we'll never know

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 12:36:23	@Patsnation87 The day after should be one. Half-price chocolate day.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 12:26:05	Robotexts from @SenSanders :(
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 12:08:26	Two more days then I get the weekend off and go to watch Supercross at University of Phoenix Stadium. So excited!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 12:06:49	@yvonnewingett @dustingardiner they should've just let the Satanists pray
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 12:04:34	Handing my problems to God...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 11:53:57	I just discovered that you can stream music online via @air1radio so awesome!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 11:46:43	@FlyByKnite that's at least five seconds
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 11:43:34	City Council should just the Satanists pray to their fictional leader like they do the Christians.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 11:40:19	Not to mention a new desktop computer for work.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 11:40:03	I need a new car tires and a windshield.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 11:39:49	I can't wait till I get my tax refund. I have a good chunk of it already spent.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 11:35:18	The oven is fixed! Now I don't have to worry about my home burning down.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 11:09:41	Already got my stove fixed!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 08:51:11	Oven broke tonight. It wouldn't turn off.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-04 06:07:39	Really @kfc ? A new Colonel to debut at Super Bowl? Just pick an actor already.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 12:58:12	@kinseyschofield making tons of mistakes. As it should be
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 12:05:23	My goal is to one day have my own bobblehead. I mean after all, I have the giant head already.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 12:03:36	Will the new @Suns coach get a bonus for every loss?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 12:02:15	@TheWrightMyke I wish we could vote none of the above
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:54:35	@KennyAndCrash these bets are dumb. I'd rather see Curry without a shirt...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:51:54	@KennyAndCrash Bus wreck means good luck?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:44:57	Maybe I'm nuts but @KennyAndCrash help me relax at night
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:40:15	@KennyAndCrash Have a caucus where candidates have to fight it out UFC style
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:35:29	@KennyAndCrash Suns are a dumpster fire? LOL... That's an overestimate.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:25:34	@the_real_sunz @Suns Sounds legit.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:23:48	Can @tedcruz be president. Wasn't he born in Canada?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:18:33	@KennyAndCrash Manning doesn't need another ring. Dude is one of the all time best.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:14:27	I hope the Raiders move to Las Vegas
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:12:31	The @Suns are not the Browns of the NBA. The @Suns have only had issues for a few years.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:10:49	@JimSonOfGreg @KennyAndCrash Supercross
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:09:22	Like how real and honest about the @Suns @KennyAndCrash are.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 11:02:50	Just won tickets on @KennyAndCrash
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 10:43:13	@KennyAndCrash Not rock bottom yet. They can fall farther because of Sarver.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 10:39:00	@KennyAndCrash the @Suns probably couldn't even beat the majority of the D-league teams.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 10:34:32	. @KennyAndCrash Earl Watson is Lindsey Hunter 2.0
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 10:29:37	GET WELL SOON @BRETHART
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 10:28:20	The @suns should just have an inflatable tank balloon be the head coach for the rest of the year.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 10:26:01	@KennyAndCrash The @Suns need a basketball minded person running the show and a hands off owner.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 10:23:26	@KennyAndCrash @Suns They needed defensive minded coach. Defense is something this franchise has never done in its existence.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 10:16:08	@KennyAndCrash That and the talent underachieving.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 10:11:28	@KennyAndCrash @Suns The team just isn't built right. The talent does not complement each other in any way.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 10:10:10	If @realDonaldTrump fails at becoming president he can always buy the @Suns I'm sure he would be a better owner.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-02 03:17:18	@mechanical_meat I hope that she feels better soon.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-01 09:46:29	Can we vote none of the above?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-01 09:45:50	The @nytimes and @HillaryClinton both endorsed the war in Iraq so I don't trust either's opinion.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-01 09:42:54	Hillary supporters are like high school cheerleaders. They cheer hard get emotionally invested but don't even know how the game is played.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-01 09:39:22	I never got the whole newspaper endorsement thing. Shouldn't the media be impartial?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-02-01 09:38:14	No person who endorsed the Iraq War should be given the opportunity to be president.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-01-31 09:15:28	. @HillaryClinton Being accountable for your actions & Integrity are expected from the military. How come Hillary doesn't have to be?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-01-31 09:13:55	I think my biggest problem with Hillary's campaign is the fact that she lies every third sentence.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-01-05 11:33:20	The @biggestlosernbc is so fake. It pretty much sets unrealistic and unhealthy weight loss ideas.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-01-05 11:23:39	Seems like the bus drivers are always going on strike.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-01-05 08:29:22	Then again I'm smart enough not to commit a murder in the first place...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-01-05 08:28:42	Have you ever watched Forensic Files and thought "I could've done that way better and not have gotten caught"? These people are dumb.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-01-04 08:25:48	Where have all of these @Seahawks fans been all year? Some of these people were rooting for @AZCardinals just last week.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2016-01-04 08:24:32	Glad the @AZCardinals treated like a preseason game since nothing was on the line.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-12-10 12:44:17	The most amazing thing in the NBA is that there are people still willing to pay to see the 76ers play.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-12-10 06:41:50	The @Dbacks gave up too much! That trade is like stealing second, third and home and then farting in the catcher's face as you slide in.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-08-02 12:44:00	@InboxVoodoo I've used one before. They kinda talk you down and make you realize it isn't as bad as you think.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-08-02 12:42:08	I'm shocked that they haven't gotten to #RondaRousey yet. Probably because it is going to be a 16-second fight.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-06-11 11:25:38	Stop talking about moving the Coyotes to Seattle. You're going to overwhelm people in Seattle who just found out they have an NFL team.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-06-11 10:42:19	Okay, City of Glendale you just lost my tax dollars... #ArizonaCoyotes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-06-11 10:41:05	Even if Glendale votes to break the lease there is no way the coyotes take it lying down. It will cost the city millions of dollars in court

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-06-06 06:48:40	Duggar family might actually be worse than the Westboro Baptist once we learn everything that went on there,
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-06-06 06:47:25	This week I learned about the Duggar family and decided that they are pretty much an evil cult that needs to be broken up.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-06-05 11:11:46	@XaneVic He has said many times he will play two years in China when he's done with the NBA
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-06-05 10:57:16	@XaneVic I think he goes 4 more years. At least two of which, however, will probably be in China.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-06-05 10:54:09	@XaneVic he has one year left on his contract after that I think he is kind of pushed out of LA.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 06:08:14	I don't know what a Liam and Sophia is but it definitely sounds like an alcoholic beverage.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 06:06:36	You know you're fat when your sweat smells like bacon and can double as tanning lotion.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 06:04:34	Trying to figure out how to make my neighbors dogs stop barking. Maybe I should stop standing next to the fence using this air horn.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 05:59:23	@Suns6thMan I hate when people do that!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 05:58:22	The @bep asked what you going to do with all that junk inside that trunk and I'm like take it to the dumpster and properly dispose of it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 05:55:47	I wish the sold a BBQing steak smell air freshener. I'd totally buy that! #randomthoughts #meat
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 05:53:59	How has @JohnStamos not played a used car salesman? He has the hair for it!! #FullerHouse

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 05:46:18	@JeffMoore78 Have fun. Don't take any wooden nickels.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 04:32:38	My @klout score went up. I guess that's what happens when you actually tweet.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 04:31:52	@KCBrackley We were going to do that, but it wasn't allowed on our street for some reason.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 04:10:34	@KCBrackley which is why we got some people to help and used @uhaul
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 04:09:36	@KCBrackley I did get a quote from a moving company who told me $1250.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 04:08:50	I don't understand all of these mock drafts. We all know the @Suns will take the best player available and at 13 no idea who it will be.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 04:07:37	@KCBrackley WOW. It cost me about $100 with @uhaul
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-28 04:06:38	Off of work until Sunday! Now to prep for the @PhoenixComicon #Cosplay #nerd #ComicCon #PhoenixComicon

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 12:35:51	I'm okay if the @cavs win it all this year. Cleveland needs to have a championship in some professional sport soon.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 11:54:04	They really should cancel #19KidsandCounting No matter what the ratings are there is no way it's worth keeping on the air.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 11:40:41	@AZJoshM Newest stuff. I'll check the older stuff out then.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 11:33:06	@AZJoshM I checked them out and didn't like any other music.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 11:32:39	I wish someone would invent a way for people to stay awake and not sleep ever. Like, plug us into an electrical outlet or something.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 11:24:54	@Coximus2 Someone posted a picture similar to this on @reddit and attributed it to Einstein. However, Hemingway is the one who said it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 11:21:54	I really like the business cards @ErinLand20 designed for us and had printed.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 11:13:51	I'm looking forward to my next visit to @UptownMarketAZ
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 10:20:58	@SB_MikeMay @AZSports I may just have to get one from @GoodwillIntl
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 09:55:20	@hanlich I'm not. @ATLHawks were never going to make it to the finals even if they were the better team which they're not.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 09:37:40	@SB_MikeMay @AZSports I resorted to listening to Spotify instead today.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 09:37:09	@SB_MikeMay @AZSports Kinda the same but my stream always has issues and only time I have an actual radio is in the car.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 09:15:27	@SB_MikeMay @AZSports Yep, I don't think I'm going to listen anymore. So annoying!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 09:11:23	I only work tomorrow and Sunday this week. I guess I will just annoy people via social media for entertainment purposes. #BoredToDeath
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 09:06:59	Somehow I expect to see @TheRock in the new #JonnyQuest live-action movie.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:56:10	@KCBrackley I will look into it. Thank you so much!!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:55:16	@KCBrackley There's a Harry Potter land? Really! WOW!!!! My kids would love that.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:53:35	@JimSonOfGreg mine was. I saw a Vine about it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:53:12	@KCBrackley I know I was just making fun of myself because I realized I might've been wrong.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:52:53	@KCBrackley LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:52:38	@JimSonOfGreg I've done something similar but it was about how to eat a KitKat.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:51:05	I love hearing different opinions. And always reserve the right to change my own.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:50:42	Other than the possible fact that I may be wrong about Harry Potter.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:50:24	I think I reached the next level! As a grown man, I am having an argument on twitter about a kids movie. What is wrong with me?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:48:03	@KCBrackley Well, he was only there to protect Harry. Harry tells the order and nobody dies. Snape was in the Order.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:46:23	@KCBrackley perhaps he only acted that way because he had a piece of Voldemort inside of him.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:45:20	@KCBrackley Had he just went to Snape Serius Black wouldn't have died. For example.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:44:34	@AZJoshM I will have to look for them online.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:44:02	@KCBrackley True but once he got the Hogwarts he changed. Perhaps the Dursley's were only mean to him because he was a Horcrux
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:41:37	@KCBrackley He was a spoiled brat and by not using his head he caused a few characters deaths.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:25:56	@ZiaRecords @PhoenixComicon I will make sure to look for you!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 08:25:10	@AZJoshM I've heard of them. Are they a band or something?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-27 06:50:08	Mania is running wild today. I wonder if I have the @HulkHogan version of bipolar. I hope my brain calms down soon.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 16:22:26	@Patsnation87 @JeffMoore78 that's why you open and use it at the store without buying.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 07:47:11	I truly think Dragon NaturallySpeaking was a great investment. It really helps my arthritic hands.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 07:41:22	This pretty much sums it up. #MemorialDay2015 #thankyoumemorialday #MemorialDay pic.twitter.com/SZ4hxogVXs
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 07:39:46	@PeteyPablo623 Been doing that. Thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 07:11:13	It's getting really hot outside in Phoenix now. Don't forget most homeless shelters can use some bottled water, sunscreen and hats.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 07:09:24	@NOH8Campaign I learned firsthand how bigoted some people can be. Such a rough night last night.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 06:39:13	@NFLChurch I will block the team!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 06:38:49	I think @BearGrylls is gritty enough to be a believable James Bond.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 06:37:49	I hope everyone is staying safe today and found a way to honor those who protected us. #MemorialDay2015
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 06:36:48	My iPhone keeps freezing. I think it's this new app I installed. Time to remove it I guess...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 06:22:35	I'm looking forward to going to the @PhoenixComicon in a couple days!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 05:50:35	Never trust someone who draws on their eyebrows. Because obviously they fail at making good life choices.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 05:49:19	@BasketballFctss until someone pulls a Ron Artest and changes their name to Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Johnson
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 05:48:08	@VancityReynolds You need to star in a movie where you combine all the superheroes you've ever played. Maybe have multiple personalities.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 05:46:34	I know he is innocent until proven guilty but I can't help but think Ray McDonald is an idiot.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 05:22:17	@PeteyPablo623 Thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 05:22:04	Hardcore rap followed by country music from the 40's. Yep, that's my crazy Spotify playlist.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 05:18:34	I've drank so much coffee the last couple days thatI think I might eventually wear out my @keurig . Seasonal flavors are the best!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 05:16:17	@NFLChurch I really hope that doesn't happen
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 04:40:27	I'm having car trouble today and hope I don't end up having to walk home.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 03:32:54	I think the portions were just too big! I'm stuffed! Thanks @onobbq
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 03:28:41	@PeteyPablo623 is it a hard trail? I'm just starting to hike.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-26 03:15:43	Lunch at @onohawaiianbbq pic.twitter.com/aOyMBwdnu2
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 10:51:53	Assuming I don't follow up on my stored in shame I will talk to you later Twitter. Good night all!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 10:45:19	@JustinGr8house @hanlich I would if people would stop telling me to die
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 10:34:33	Something just clicked in my head and I realize if I can't be me what is the point of life?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 10:34:00	I have been so honest on Twitter night I felt like in the morning my wife is going to beat me to death with a hammer LOL.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 10:28:49	I lost 46 Facebook friends tonight as well! Goodbye bigots of the world!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 10:17:56	@XaneVic I'd rather not. Maybe Orton's theme...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 10:16:11	@DunlapSports @P_Dors @ATLHawks @cavs Boo!!! Don't rain on my parade
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 10:15:22	@P_Dors @DunlapSports I will laugh nonstop for a month if the @ATLHawks make it instead of the @cavs
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:57:28	Wow!!! Death wishes via Facebook! I'm flattered.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:52:53	Wow! I can't believe the on my Facebook to "coming out" as a bisexual male. Somebody already wished death upon me. #crazy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:47:47	I am a Fat bisexual man! What you knew about it? I can still kick 99% of your asses.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:46:24	What's the worst that will happen? I live in the United States so it's not like I'm going to get stoned. That is unless I smoked Mary Jane
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:45:27	the only person I have to be honest with is myself. And yes sometimes I do like the cock!!!! Are you shocked? I've never posted this before.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:44:34	I already know that my family disowned me that I don't care.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:42:52	Twitter is kind of imaginary anyway. I don't really care who follows me I only talked to kind of clear my mind and conscious.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:41:59	74 followers left my twitter account but that dosn't matter. Haters be gone!!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:40:40	I don't really care what anyone other than my wife thinks I'm just being honest with myself at last!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:39:40	Stop! You are just a little insecure person pestering me via DM! Grow up man!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:38:52	Gay not Gay who really cares?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:38:25	@hanlich So many people I've talked to/ been with are too scared to talk openly.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:37:46	@hanlich Why not. Fuck the haters. More that leave gives me more reasons to keep it real
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:37:03	Yes I am not joking. Just being real right now.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:36:12	It's not about sex rather how you stimulate my mind.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:34:53	Boom! 8 more gone!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:34:23	Yes, I am ugly and fat. I am just a typical bisexual male. If you don't like it go away
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:32:16	Haters really sent me death threats for admitting I"m bi. I guess they can't handle a bisexual fat guy...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:29:48	@Coximus2 I might just do that but 54 is a lot
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:28:10	The very next person who DM's me is getting a screenshot posted
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:27:01	Stop it you are giving me an erection OMG!!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:25:54	WOW!!! I can't believe the profanity people are using with me right now via DM! If we were in bed I probably have an orgasm. Silly boys
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:22:38	HA 47 unfollowers. Bigots
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:18:01	if I made you feel awkward I'm sorry
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:17:38	I'm honest because in the words of Sir mix A lot I like big butts and I cannot lie
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:14:33	When I die can people sing everything is awesome?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:11:58	wow74 direct messages in less than 10 min? I should've started talking like this sooner
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:11:25	@XaneVic I just wanna be me and if people can accept that then they are stupid
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:09:56	@XaneVic Okay 49. If I hit 100 I will tweet a nude pic of my ugly ass
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:08:33	@XaneVic I only lost 41
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:06:41	23 more goodbye
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:06:05	@hanlich I've just been in the shadows too long
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:05:35	@hanlich sorry if I'm sharing too much
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:05:20	@hanlich I was raised to think that this is a sin but my wife taught me otherwise.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:04:36	@hanlich Girls though have been more recent but like I said we are open...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:04:09	@hanlich However it's been like a decade since I've been with a guy...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:03:12	@hanlich I'm honestly bi but love my wife so much who is also bi more than anything. Our marriage works because it's open.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:01:56	@hanlich That is awesome!!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:01:30	Wow 10 followers gone LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 09:00:48	Sexuality only matters if you are trying to make a baby tbh...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:59:47	@hanlich Thanks. I did realize many years ago that my book is the only one that matters though. I do appreciate the support.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:57:37	If you are bisexual is a really coming out of the closet?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:56:43	@hanlich actually other than telling my wife this is the first time I've actually admitted it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:52:57	@hanlich However, it is the reason I stopped playing football at ASU.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:52:03	@hanlich @hanlich No real reason to talk about it. Not like there's anything wrong with it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:50:26	@hanlich I'm okay with anything as long as it's fun.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:48:01	@hanlich What? I'm not joking.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:42:43	@hanlich NAh. That happened when I sucked my first dick...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:42:23	@azredlizard Same plus PTSD
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:41:54	@TheWrightMyke True but he is a nice guy and doesn't want to make the producer mad
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:41:11	@hanlich Me either but it paid the bills when I was almost homeless...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:38:07	@ErinLand20 fingers crossed that you don't blow us up
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:36:57	@TheWrightMyke it's because he listens to the producers in his headset way too much instead of saying what he thinks.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:36:13	@Coximus2 and it is sponsored by United Airlines
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:34:15	I honestly think that the people who run the @ATLHawks twitter account should be doing some standup.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:32:55	@azredlizard My doc keeps saying marijuana will help my anxiety and PTSD
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:31:45	@MarcusPap_ Yep. It was back when the Suns play the Lakers in the playoffs. All I did was make fun of the size of his head.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:31:06	@hanlich Well, I am really good at voice impersonation and played a girl 90% of the time.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:30:21	@azredlizard I take alternative payments. I need to get a med card.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:29:31	@SunsNguyenVu if he is their target I hope they trade down because he's a 16 through 20 pick.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:23:52	Weirdest job I ever had has to be the time I worked as a phone sex operator.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:23:08	The @ATLHawks vs @cavs better go at least 6 games.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:21:57	@azredlizard Google glass should be close enough. Wanna buy it from me?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:21:11	@MarcusPap_ @HayleyAtwell I hope they use James D'Arcy more. He has range.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:19:02	@MarcusPap_ @HayleyAtwell Season 2 has a full pickup.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:17:16	@MarcusPap_ Love that show. I have a crush on @HayleyAtwell
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:14:18	@KCBrackley Yes. You can get like 20 bucks from recycler
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:13:50	I know that celebrities die every day, but today was an extremely devastating day for me.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:12:23	@Saimaeve @purple_n_orange I need one to take my place at my doctor appointments
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:11:37	@hanlich Make sure you purchase the road hazard warranty. So much crap on the freeways here it will save you a lot of money
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:08:05	@hanlich I've gotten like 10 pictures via DM
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:07:07	Just because I tweeted about Kobe's penis does not mean I want you guys to send me penis pics. Unless you're cute that is ;)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 08:05:48	@AZJoshM People with low self-esteem?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:47:37	@hanlich worst-case scenario we get some SportsCenter non-player highlights. Like best chair to the face of the fan
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:31:46	They should remake the 3 Amigos with @SethMacFarlane @RealDLHughley and @Sethrogen
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:27:54	I wonder if Kobe or the Lakers will ever unblock me on twitter...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:26:52	@hanlich Just don't give out bats or any other blunt objects and they will be fine.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:21:54	I was saddened to learn of the passing of Actress Anne Meara. She was such a nice lady.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:18:27	Arizona sports teams should start serving hard liquor. It may make some of the games more enjoyable.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:17:32	Twitter has saved my mood today. I love getting to be a dumbass sometimes. Well 6 days a week or so...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:16:26	@purple_n_orange @Saimaeve only a lot whiter.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:14:47	@AZJoshM don't worry Josh it will be our secret ;)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:14:04	@ErinLand20 other than the penis amputation part.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:13:11	@AZJoshM obviously you're just jealous of Kobe's penis...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:12:23	@purple_n_orange @Saimaeve Don't you remember Jason that was her hologram.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:10:38	@AZJoshM don't forget he sold his soul to Satan. Or was that he gets his shoes including the souls from Nike. I forget...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:06:53	@AZJoshM I think so. I thought my tuna fish tasted a little fishy.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:05:22	Somebody should open up a sandwich shop in Bumble Bee, Arizona specializing in tuna fish sandwiches.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:02:30	@AZJoshM is that what Kobe calls his package?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 07:01:11	@AZJoshM There's no recount when you don't get up from the 10 count bro.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:59:51	And the winner by knockout over @AZJoshM is @hanlich
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:55:33	@hanlich @AZJoshM LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:55:05	@AZJoshM @hanlich They're not gangbangers they are just really young and immature.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:53:53	@AZJoshM @hanlich That's a horrible thing to say!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:53:01	@hanlich @AZJoshM I'm sold that the sex happened, but I think she claimed rape after without speaking up during.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:47:24	@hanlich @AZJoshM Fight Fight Fight... Josh is going down LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:46:20	@AZJoshM I'm sure he did but he was never convicted of it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:39:56	@AZJoshM *alleged
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:33:38	I wonder how many Diamondback players the average Phoenix resident can name.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:30:52	I really wish I had access to a swimming pool.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:26:03	Why do they always talk about penis amputations on River Monsters?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:22:35	If next year is truly Kobe’s final season how will he be remembered?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:16:31	@Cap_Kaveman has anyone ever told you that you could probably get work as Damien Sandow's stunt double.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:13:28	The worst thing about having shaved my beard off is that random people no longer walk up to me and give me money.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:03:25	@Cap_Kaveman Nice!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:02:47	@Ronbearable Not only that, but the ones we bought had room enough for like four more in each row.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 06:01:45	Why does Lindsay Lohan always look like she's about to stab someone?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-25 05:36:00	Maybe I'll unpack it's only been about 3 months
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 13:07:49	@XaneVic People are escaping the Matrix!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 12:38:12	Imagine if the @Suns had gotten @StephenCurry30 in exchange for @Amareisreal a few years back like they thought they did.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 12:32:39	@grav3yardgirl @JOYRICHLA Love it!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 11:00:01	If the @HoustonRockets lose this year maybe Harden will finally learn to play defense.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 09:57:04	Taylor Swift borrowed over $13,000 worth of clothes from a sex shop http:// juicycelebrityrumors.com/taylor-swift-b orrowed-over-13000-worth-of-clothes-from-a-sex-shop/ …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 09:25:11	@FOX10Phoenix Could be like my wife and can only hear out of one ear.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 09:23:28	If any of my friends drink and drive this weekend I'm going to their house, filling their car with rotten fish and welding the doors shut.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 09:14:25	HMMMM... I checked all the sinks and I have the water! WTH?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 09:09:46	@futieton that video should come with a warning! It moved so fast that I almost had a seizure!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 09:08:16	Thank you to all the active & retired veterans for your service & doing something I didn't have the ability or courage to do. #memorialday
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 09:04:31	@MarcusPap_ To be honest I'm just hungry and will use this as an excuse to get some chicken.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 09:02:51	What if they were only taking the hobbits to Isengard so that they could take part in a surprise birthday party for Sauron? #NoCake4Hobbits
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 08:58:52	@MarcusPap_ I will sacrifice a bucket of Kentucky fried chicken to lift the curse.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 08:58:00	I wonder how many psychics are actually making money? They totally should get a lottery pool going or at least some fantasy football pools.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 08:22:52	Do they still do tubing down the Salt River?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 08:06:37	@Goldrumbo Nice car, but that's a really bad parking job!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 08:05:11	I'm running out of documentaries to watch on @netflix
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 07:17:57	@SB_MikeMay Pics or I'm going to assume you just went out and got that cellophane wrapped stuff from @FrysFoodStores
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 07:16:20	Is @Pharrell ever allowed to be sad? Gotta wonder if Happy set some type of impossible expectations.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 07:11:11	To cure the jinx maybe @JHarden13 should shave his beard before the next game.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 07:09:23	@yo Probably enough that if they all paid up you would get diabetes.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 07:08:26	@n930jd that looks so good!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 07:07:45	My Spotify playlist usually goes from teenager music to geriatric old man within three songs. #guaranteed
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 07:06:02	Looking for interesting people to start following today.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-24 06:23:16	I hope so. Then at least someone might be alarmed when leave home. #hermit https:// twitter.com/abc15/status/6 02235286169526272 …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-23 08:39:56	@Suns6thMan Yep. I always just do my State myself and E-file Federal.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-23 02:06:35	Finally Friday!!! pic.twitter.com/N7Tjw8n5Ex
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-22 11:58:33	@purple_n_orange @Suns6thMan so then just curse the rest of the teams
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-22 11:56:05	@purple_n_orange @Suns6thMan if that is true let's take up a collection so that he can make the Suns win next year.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-22 11:52:02	@Suns6thMan More like a 6 year old.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-22 11:07:33	@kinseyschofield Great job tonight! pic.twitter.com/Li1Vic0lpY
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-22 10:25:33	Idea for the Phoenix Comicon https:// instagram.com/p/296UJiKg4l/
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-22 10:21:44	Rediscovered my Instagram https:// instagram.com/lonniesmalley/
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-21 06:57:01	@Suns6thMan Free ice cream so that everyone can get diabetes? Healthcare job stimulus right there.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-21 00:54:12	I survived the doctor and got my prescriptions. 3 cheers for anxiety meds!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-20 22:45:44	Trying this doctor visit again. Hopefully they see me this time.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-20 11:25:41	Falling asleep outside sucks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-20 02:10:26	@KCBrackley yep. They also said I need to call and make a new appointment because they're having computer problems
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 23:50:13	Get to the doctor and they're like oops we forgot to call and tell you you're doctor isn't in today
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 13:35:07	@KCBrackley @Coximus2 @DraftOrtiz @thrillathechase If he was younger I'd say maybe
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 13:34:18	@KCBrackley @Coximus2 @DraftOrtiz @thrillathechase I hope they don't even let him buy a ticket
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 13:33:03	@KCBrackley @Coximus2 @DraftOrtiz @thrillathechase Exactly he's been through it before. People don't bounce back after the second most times
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 13:32:20	@Coximus2 @KCBrackley @DraftOrtiz @thrillathechase I guess if all else fails they can go get @RyanLindley14
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 13:29:16	@Coximus2 @KCBrackley @DraftOrtiz @thrillathechase I don't think he will be very good after that injury.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 13:27:53	@KCBrackley @Coximus2 @DraftOrtiz @thrillathechase I know. Just saying I wish they would/could
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 13:26:10	@KCBrackley @Coximus2 @DraftOrtiz @thrillathechase I actually hope that the do trade him. With the QB play his contract just isn't worth it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 12:58:32	We all know the @NBA draft lottery is more fixed than anything the @WWE has ever done.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 12:56:57	Are Sarver and Adam Silver friends? I'm just wondering because if they are maybe the @Suns can actually have some lottery "Luck" for once.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 12:51:35	They should replace American Idol with a bunch of people competing to see who is the worst singer. That's why a lot of people watch anyway.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 12:48:17	Why does Aquaman wear a disguise in the old Super Friends cartoons? Is he going into a pet store and afraid the fish will recognize him?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 12:43:15	The biggest change that @POTUS made was improving people's manners. You can't go a day without hearing someone say thank's Obama.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-19 12:36:17	@atownbrown08 I started watching Penny Dreadful because it is a show that you don't need to think to watch.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-18 09:43:18	Bill Nye, the Science Guy is on Netflix Instant!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-18 09:00:37	So Warriors vs Cavs it is...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-16 11:26:23	@KansasCardinal Someone gave me a crank cell phone charger.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-16 11:24:57	@KansasCardinal WOW! What's next a cell phone with a rotary dial?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-16 11:20:31	@KansasCardinal Is that real?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-16 11:20:16	@Draft_Packers @Coximus2 Test your acting skills and call in sick.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-16 11:09:14	I actually really like Penny Dreadful.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-16 11:07:48	I think I will skip sushi until they figure out the cause of this salmonella outbreak
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-16 02:38:51	@JimSonOfGreg I'm glad I rarely need it then. Btw are you going to the @PhoenixComicon
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-16 02:18:48	Today was the first time I had to buy gas in a month and a half. When did it go up?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-15 18:30:24	Keeping @ErinLand20 company at work.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-15 14:13:17	RIP BB King
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-15 05:47:08	I found it pretty hard to watch pro sports for the last year and a half or so.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-15 05:41:29	I cant believe my kids last day of school before summer vacation is just a week from today!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-15 05:38:20	It sucks when you're talking and nobody actually hears what you say.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 16:25:02	@bobstroup @KCBrackley Not according to the Federal Gov.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 15:30:17	@bobstroup @KCBrackley Well maybe once I don't have to be drug tested :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 14:57:20	@bobstroup @KCBrackley even if he did, I'd say no. I would rather exhaust all other options first.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 14:52:04	@bobstroup @KCBrackley My doctor wants me to get a card lol...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 14:51:01	@BiggieSmalley Yep, and the on-call person hates me. They never help...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 14:49:07	@KCBrackley Tried that. They're gone until next week...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 14:47:58	Out of Anxiety meds. I only have to last 6 more days without them. SEND HELP,,,
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 12:54:10	Grizzlies just seem to have run out of gas.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 12:47:32	With all these remakes going on I wonder when Hollywood brings back Mr. Belvedere. Maybe have Jack Davenport play Mr. Belvedere
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 12:39:21	@VancityReynolds It's called the nutcracker and it will kill you. Only do it dressed as @Deadpool
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 12:26:57	@VancityReynolds So you join Facebook just as it is dying. Well played.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 03:39:58	@KCBrackley I find it funny when someone who I know that does have kids and all of them are in prison try to give me advice...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 03:29:13	I guess I can't be trusted since I have an egg Avi on twitter.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 03:27:39	@JimSonOfGreg Mine are show tests, tests, tests, yelling at me, tests, doctor doesn’t show up, tests, results and more yellinng...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 03:26:09	@SunsNguyenVu Agreed. If he starts then this team has a lot of talent issues. Good 6th man though.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 03:25:18	@JimSonOfGreg I've had over 40 this month already!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 03:14:50	I'm actually glad I cancelled my doctors appointment this week. I needed a break from the negativity.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-14 03:11:18	I can't believe how loud it is outside today. Not a good day so far. #PTSD
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-13 06:02:36	@KCBrackley I've been a few places he fishes so I love it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-13 05:42:15	I need a cheap BBQ grill this week.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 13:36:07	@LanceStorm maybe the internet championship
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 13:34:00	@SunsNguyenVu he's better suited on a different team.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 13:30:55	@KCBrackley that's why I use streaming services.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 13:29:35	@KCBrackley I like it. They catch some crazy fish.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 12:09:41	@ErinLand20 @LocksLove http:// gif.co/qBa9.gif
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 12:08:46	I don't know where I'd be without my wife @ErinLand20
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 09:21:48	@SunsofPHXfan I think he only likes it because we play the video games and Paul Wright is like his uncle IRL.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 09:18:54	@SunsofPHXfan My son like the flips and stuff. Not the talking. Sometimes watches it muted.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 09:16:00	@SunsofPHXfan @WWENXT @LuchaElRey however I would rather surf the internet. I only watch with my son.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 09:12:35	@SunsofPHXfan It depends I like @WWENXT and @LuchaElRey everything else is Meh...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 09:11:55	I just read an article saying that the Lakers want Andrew Bynum back.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 09:10:11	I want the Griz to win
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 09:09:31	@SunsofPHXfan Was it me? I trash the dumb stuff, but still watch it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 09:00:15	The @WWE needs a monster baby face, not another so/so heel.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 08:57:21	@futieton Time to start cooking a delicious meal?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 08:53:21	@Goldrumbo @azsportsguy I met him before. I worked in wrestling off and on 96-2000
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 08:51:16	@azsportsguy @Goldrumbo I actually got offered a job for the Hitmen, but they didn't pay well enough to justify going to the East coast.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 08:43:58	@hanlich I play that when my kids get cookies.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 08:00:56	@JimSonOfGreg Same. I say go harder after DUI, Domestic Violence and PED's.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 06:12:37	Suspended one game for each championship ring?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 06:10:36	The @NFL needs some consistency with punishments. I'd hate to break the rules when it is Goodell's time of the month.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 06:08:53	@Coximus2 Don't forget murder. This is the NFL after all...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 06:07:58	@JimSonOfGreg Yep.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 06:05:23	So they can punish without proof. This is a bad precedent. They gave into public perception instead of facts.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 05:59:20	@atownbrown08 But wasn't he warned a lot?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 05:58:28	@hanlich https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=FxAEXO 1lxpA …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 05:53:30	I think they went overboard with Tom Brady
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-12 05:19:42	I hate over sleeping
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-11 12:52:08	It's a @netflix night. I guess...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 11:04:07	Nothing worse than the smell of burnt popcorn
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 10:56:47	Happy Mother's Day ladies. Especially the ladies who have to be both mom and dad.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 08:38:50	I was lucky enough to see a hawk today
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 08:37:56	My new hobby if you can call it that is laying outside on a sleeping bag and watching the sky.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:38:00	@KCBrackley we moved to south Phoenix to help save even more money lol
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:36:50	@KCBrackley in this market that's amazing
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:36:22	@KCBrackley we have a contact in place but only good when she retires
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:35:25	@KCBrackley I'm buying my aunt's when she retires in Napa valley.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:34:25	Finally took down my Gortat and Morris twin @Suns
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:32:30	@KCBrackley we have decided to rent until we have cash to buy a farm. Probably will be like 6 years
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:30:41	@KCBrackley that's what mine said... 1 year later it sold
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:29:06	@KCBrackley so we're renting now until we can buy a farm
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:28:33	@KCBrackley that's awesome. I held mine too long and the bubble popped
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:27:16	@KCBrackley I've sold a few but honestly never did better tan a 10k profit
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:25:45	@KCBrackley it's pretty simple you just sign your soul away
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:24:47	@futieton we should hang out one day. You just seem cool to talk too
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 07:22:38	One day I will get a tan
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 06:09:19	I could go for some wings today...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 06:08:54	@futieton I read everything Phoenix related.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 06:08:05	@futieton Read it online. 90K to remove it. They were seeking bids.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 06:07:09	@futieton Yep, had a lot of asbestos. That's why I skipped that spot.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 06:06:08	@futieton @Danzeisendairy Only if you want all the boys in your yard.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 06:02:24	@HayleyAtwell I'm so excited that your show is coming back! We've watched each episode like 10 times!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 05:48:25	@TonyDoesComedy with me?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-10 05:47:29	@futieton It sucked anyways.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-09 03:30:36	It's raining!!! pic.twitter.com/ciHK71TLxR
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-08 08:00:53	@Suns Ed Nealy #SunsTBT
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-06 13:58:17	Bipolar mania is awesome and sucks at the same time...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-06 08:28:46	I asked my son if he wanted some Nachos and he said "Only if it doesn’t have cheese". My boy is weird...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-06 08:20:37	I wonder if you could get a DUI if you're in a self driving car. #randomthought
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-06 07:51:00	Looking for a new doctor. This one has the worst office staff imaginable and the doctor isn't much better...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-05 09:35:00	The Cardinals should go after La’el Collins
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-05 08:31:08	Say what Google+ pic.twitter.com/xbcSpaelFg
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-05 06:50:44	@futieton That sucks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-05 06:50:06	Is it supposed to rain or just have dark clouds today?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-05 06:40:44	@JeffMoore78 @WWE I skipped it and just watched the highlights.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-05 06:39:38	@JeffMoore78 Personally I'd rather watch UFC or even the @WWE

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-03 13:30:00	Spelling is hard when you've been drinking...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-03 13:06:40	@CaptainCrakhead I just haven't liked boxing in over a decade. Seems faker than the @wwe

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-03 13:02:06	How many of you wasted a $100?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-03 11:58:08	Please let them beat each other up and finish in a draw.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-03 11:43:39	Buffer seems to stay the same age.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-03 07:19:15	So much talent undrafted
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-03 07:18:46	Mark my words. This will be the year of the UFA in the NFL...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-03 07:15:23	@Coximus2 yes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-03 07:09:36	I think Gerald Christian could be a pretty good player
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-03 07:08:10	I got it right. $$$ #KentuckyDerby2015
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-02 10:53:00	My timeline looks like it has been hijacked by owls with all these @AZCardinals constantly saying who tonight.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-02 10:43:25	@futieton 602-262-6151 Maybe?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-02 09:25:49	@Coximus2 When they bought a magic 8 ball at Target.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-02 09:20:27	I hope Mayweather VS Pacquiao ends in a draw.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-02 09:11:34	I think he may have been there at the end of round 3...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-02 06:09:33	I can't wait until my kids school year is over. I hate waiting to pick my son up in the heat.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-02 05:51:27	@futieton @HipsterToast Technically, no. Illegal to post not to view according to TV today at least.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-02 05:47:38	@futieton Pretty much.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-02 05:46:36	@futieton I work every weekend to get weekdays off :D

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-02 05:45:11	Decided to get Spotify premium again. I really just wanted to get rid of the extremely loud ads.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-01 10:52:45	I don't know enough about D.J. Humphries to have an opinion.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-01 10:27:32	What's the opinion of Arik Armstead?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-01 08:58:33	Most players taken in the 1st round never seem to live up to expectation IMO...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-05-01 08:57:06	Jets are going to be a lot better this season.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-30 15:06:55	@JeffMoore78 A QB goes #1 and lots of receivers end up getting drafted.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-30 14:54:10	@PeteyPablo623 She died of cancer like 3 years ago.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-30 14:49:29	@PeteyPablo623 I already got my mother in law a gift and am taking my wife out.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-30 14:47:45	@PeteyPablo623 You still have a week
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-30 10:16:44	@SunsofPHXfan They usually only seem to get the first three or so selections correct.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-30 10:10:02	Baltimore's baseball game today only had a few less fans than some Suns games...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-30 10:00:15	@TheFabulousOne Thank you.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-30 09:54:09	@TheFabulousOne Just been sick with a lot of issues. 3+ doctor visits a week for awhile is getting annoying.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-30 09:38:42	Getting sick of going to the doctor so much! I think I'd rather stay ill...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-29 14:06:35	@JeffMoore78 Oh. I was thinking if you were there it would be busy with basketball, baseball and hockey going on.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-29 14:05:36	@JeffMoore78 Still at the sports bar?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-27 07:08:14	I need a Vegas trip soon!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-27 07:04:57	I drank way too much coffee today! I did discover how great Green Mountain Golden French toast is though. Thank you @Keurig
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 10:49:33	@KeshaRose I don't think that was glitter on the floor at that dirty free for all...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 10:44:55	Hooking my big screen to the computer via the HDMI port was the best decision I've made in awhile.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 10:43:57	@Goldrumbo Happy Family and Salt & Pepper Shrimp are my favorites.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 10:42:19	@Goldrumbo siu wok on Central is pretty good.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 10:41:17	@JeffMoore78 @gurleygurl Both
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 10:41:03	@Goldrumbo what kind?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 10:34:01	So @brittneygriner won the mugshot of the day on the MCSO site.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 10:24:42	Are they really making a Toy Story 4?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 10:18:15	Found my old WCW autographed stuff. Forgot Melissa Petersen aka Spice signed with her number back in the day. I wonder if it still works.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 10:06:23	People are already posting Avenger cams online. SMH...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 10:01:21	@futieton Yes, I am now that my doctor got things figured out. How are you doing?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 09:58:29	@futieton Is it weird I'm recording it? No spoilers :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-26 06:48:52	Accidental naps suck
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-25 06:18:05	Got a bunch of these for my yard. The cats seem to hate them. pic.twitter.com/KilZUsXcBq
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-25 05:28:02	I have the AOL mail greeting as my email alert on my new phone.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-25 05:27:38	@JimSonOfGreg nope. He was a rheumatologist
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-25 03:54:32	Doctor told me to take pictures of my hands and bring them on the next visit. Weird!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-25 03:53:05	You know your older than you look when you accidentally refer to your wife as your daughter and people think it's true.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-24 08:03:20	I wish I could transplant my brain into a new body. This one needs serviced.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-22 09:24:06	If you had to lose on AZ team who would it be? Suns or Cards?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-22 09:14:51	I wonder if Stacy's mom is locked in a basement somewhere by that psycho from the song.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-22 09:13:46	Finally finished the X-files on Netflix and found the Lone Gunman spinoff. It is so bad!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-22 08:28:58	Nice day to just chill out on my porch and try to relax.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-21 15:36:48	I need more serotonin
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-21 13:50:05	Catching up on my timeline. For some reason, I haven't been using twitter much the last 3 months
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-21 09:58:36	This was my daughter's least favorite teacher this year. She hated being in his class and was happy when we moved. http://www. fox10phoenix.com/story/28851998 /2015/04/20/police-elementary-school-teacher-tried-to-start-relationship-with-12-year-old …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-20 08:12:13	Why all the Tebow hate on Twitter? He's a great practice 3rd string QB
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-20 08:10:50	It's Tebow Time again!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-19 05:57:12	My wife loved the Doctor who earrings I got her yesterday
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-19 05:55:30	I need a bbq grill. I wNt to cook up some carne asada and maybe some ribs.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-19 05:53:12	I wish anonymous would go after TMZ. Those people are slime.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-17 13:38:33	I need to watch a @Dbacks game soon!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-16 15:09:31	I think I've watched each episode of MASh at least 100 times each.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-16 14:40:22	Would love to see 1/3 of the current @Suns team in new uniforms next year. Twins and Bledsoe gotta go.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-16 14:38:43	@danjmcs LOL. I deal with social media at work and just feel too tired of the drama to use my own.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-16 14:34:58	Getting back onto all my social media accounts and trying to update regularly. This feels so weird!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-16 14:34:11	Saw a few pics of @pamfoundation at the jail today working with @RealSheriffJoe at the jail and she looks way better than a few years ago.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-16 14:30:49	Got into an accident during my morning commute to work. I tripped over my cat on the way to the computer in my living room.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-16 14:27:18	Brownie points would mean a lot more to me is they actually included real brownies.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-16 14:26:30	Tomorrow is too late. Unless you happen to be a procrastinator, then tomorrow is absolutely perfect.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-16 14:24:07	My anti-theft device for my car is that I drive a station wagon.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-16 14:22:15	Video work meetings would be a lot more interesting if my wife would let me buy a horse head mask
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-16 06:40:24	Not a fan of the new @Chase banking experience. I preferred having bank tellers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-15 02:38:14	Finally getting over this cold.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-12 06:25:27	@JimSonOfGreg fish
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-11 13:26:27	Upgraded my phone today
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-04 12:52:19	Been trying to chase a fly off my computer monitor with my mouse cursor for the last 5 minutes.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-04 02:53:38	Walmart has the Disney infinity with 4 of the 5 avengers for 50 bucks. Wow
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-03 03:33:49	I haven't been to Walmart in a long time but went today and some dude was actually smoking inside the store.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-04-01 04:13:36	I wanted to share a smile with you. I hope it makes your day a little better. https:// myhappiness.io/?uid=ODQ0&t=Nj JwMmw4NmY3eXMxNDI3ODMyODAxODE0 …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-31 12:56:09	Trying to ignore this pain because I hate the way pain pills make me feel.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-29 14:04:35	I'm really surprised by how well my bracket is doing
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-29 14:01:58	@purple_n_orange I would hate that job. I bet you saw some weird stuff
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-29 14:00:12	@purple_n_orange it was like your tip is we didn't rob you I guess
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-29 13:58:03	@purple_n_orange I bet if you did they would tip in weed if you lived.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-29 10:47:41	My new hobby is to sit outside my house and watch all the weird people walk past.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-29 06:46:32	@futieton hello
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-28 07:18:36	Checked my Facebook to discover that post a picture of the temperature reading from inside your car season started without me.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-28 03:53:15	Went to @BurgerFacEggery for lunch. They have a really good and cheap cheeseburger combo! I will be back!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-27 12:13:25	It's so nice to have high speed internet again. I was having withdrawals.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-27 12:01:54	@hanlich @Coximus2 I don't think so
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-26 12:59:18	After many years it is a little weird living in the West Valley. I actually missed the atmosphere
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-26 12:22:52	Tweaker tried to sell me 30lbs of bologna
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-26 11:20:38	Using some of my club orange points tonight
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-26 10:35:23	I can't wait until the internet gets installed tomorrow
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-25 14:27:27	Will ASU ever have a good basketball team?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-25 11:08:11	@MikeRoe That's what I'm trying
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-25 10:21:01	I think the best thing about this moveis that this house is a single story. No more steps!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-25 10:06:44	This new place is full of tons of friendly old people. Obviously this place has to be full of pod people from Mars.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-25 09:29:09	Sitting outside enjoying "free wifi"
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-22 12:52:30	Need help moving 2 heavy things down the stairs (Chest Freezer and Entertainment Center) Tuesday morning. Anyone willing to help around 10AM
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-22 12:36:42	Need to move a few super heavy items into the Uhaul around 10am Tuesday anyone wanna help a guy with a broken toe?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-22 07:55:18	@sarahmc24 We are moving now and have boxes from both places. Home Depot ones are a pain to carry. Good luck.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-22 07:53:07	@sarahmc24 Lowes boxes are better because they are a few cents cheaper and have handles.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-22 07:44:46	Trying to move with a broken big toe is kinda hard.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2015-03-20 11:33:05	Any good movies out right now?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-23 04:48:03	Keep forgetting to mail my netflix movie back. Had it like a month now...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-23 04:47:14	Maybe @RealSheriffJoe should start taking his chain gang up north end of winter early spring to clear dead grass/weeds to prevent fires
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-23 03:11:12	Last day of school for the kids. Two weeks and they go to San Diego for the summer

66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 15:49:25	At least the pain meds are working well
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 15:48:57	Got a feeling with this infection/injury I'm going to gain some of the weight I lost back...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 15:44:05	Already looking at what to get the kids for Christmas
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 15:42:14	@IamHardkor3 Sounds like a plan...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 15:07:49	@shewchuk Makes me miss Vegas. Man I gotta get back soon

66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 12:42:07	@Suns6thMan Is that show still on?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 12:28:08	@SunsofPHXfan No we have Aquaman
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 12:22:41	@SunsofPHXfan He's more like a Robin and most teams need a Batman

66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 12:03:44	If all these fires would stop that would be great...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:52:39	@Nguyen_Cow_Moo @AZJoshM I agree plus Goran is going to get better I think
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:51:36	@SB_MikeMay You should have to go to tent city for at least the whole summer if you do that. Longer if you start a fire
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:49:18	I'm thinking about going fishing/camping soon
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:48:16	Friend in Minnesota is saying sports radio is claiming Suns offered Markieff, Goran and Archie + #14 for KLove. I wouldn't make that trade
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:42:44	Decided the @WWENetwork isn't worth the money...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:41:22	If LBJ goes back to the Cavs this year I'm done watching the NBA
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:40:21	Twitter should start showing how many people you have blocked and make you put a reason why. Could be a fun contest getting blocked. #Troll
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:38:35	So it seems it takes a little alcohol to make my pain meds work...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:36:25	@SB_MikeMay @BradBaker81 I also sent it to someone who was placing advertising with his company and happens to be homosexual. No more ads
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:34:40	@SB_MikeMay @BradBaker81 I would but it would violate my works social media polices for personal accounts and I'd get fired
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:33:00	@SB_MikeMay Yeah I forwarded it to his boss it was very homophobic and inappropriate
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:31:14	@SB_MikeMay What's bad about Gambo though before he blocks you he follows you and sends you very messed up DM's at least 4 me
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:27:44	I'm amazed by how much such a small thing can hurt. Stupid toe
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:25:01	My goal is to one day be blocked on twitter by all the awful sports reporters
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:23:08	@SB_MikeMay @BradBaker81 @KCBrackley HAHA I forgot about that...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:17:21	@RyGuyAZ @SB_MikeMay @KCBrackley Wojnarowski blocked me as well but I deserved that one
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:16:24	@SB_MikeMay @KCBrackley My question was only like do you think we take so in so in the 4th round. So weird
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:14:53	@SB_MikeMay @KCBrackley It was like 3 paragraphs word for word without giving credit
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:14:16	@SB_MikeMay @KCBrackley Gambo blocked me because I called him out for copy and pasting someone else's work and putting it up as his own
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:12:17	@SB_MikeMay Yes I asked him a question about the draft like last year and then Blocked
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:11:18	@SB_MikeMay I'm blocked...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 11:09:01	Dollar store had gifts for Fathers Day display. On it were some coffee cups that said "#1 DUD"
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 10:54:04	@PeteyPablo623 Bring me some
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 10:51:01	Looking forward to this years @PhoenixComicon

66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 05:58:16	Yay my wife bought me fireball... I wonder if it would be okay to have a little even though I'm taking Vicodin
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 05:44:44	Maybe I'll look for a contest that's giving away a new car lol
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 05:40:41	@PeteyPablo623 Got a recharge and apparently it all leaked out. Need to find a better mechanic
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 05:39:25	Oh no!!! No A/C in my car!!! Summer is going to suck unless I get it fixed
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 05:33:51	@purple_n_orange I honestly hate the XBOX One and my son hogs the playstation so wife and I want our own
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 05:31:07	@purple_n_orange I'll trade you an XBox One with Wolfenstein for a PS4
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 05:09:01	X-ray tech took a selfie with my foot before he did the Xray this morning. #WeirdPeople
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 05:04:00	Energy drink kicking in... To bad my foot is messed up and I can't move around
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 04:36:17	Can't do @DDPYoga until my toe gets better. Hard to do yoga when it's super painful just to stand.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 04:33:24	I need new glasses
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 02:27:02	Broke up a fight in @FrysFoodStores parking lot
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 01:08:33	At least this time I get Vicodin
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 00:47:00	@Sunz_Chick @Suns6thMan I know that happens last time I was there I saw a floater
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 00:45:52	My toe is infected again. Stupid toe
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-22 00:31:36	Toe again (@Alliance Urgent Care) http:// 4sq.com/1sUPXYH
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 14:01:42	So my kids yearbook this year is on CD instead of an actual book. Where's the fun in that?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 13:47:44	@KCBrackley or maybe rotate a fixed position where eventually every team gets a number #1 over time. No more lottery
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 13:44:12	Who thinks the NBA draft is rigged?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 13:43:34	Might need to go to Urgent Care in the morning. My toe isn't looking to good again
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 13:39:03	At least the Lakers didn't get the #1 pick
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 06:37:35	@purple_n_orange I really do do that LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 06:32:55	@purple_n_orange Yep with a game bundle
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 04:17:16	With my future uncertain I think the best thing I can do is find a part time job. If U know of something with AM hours in Sales let me know
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 03:48:02	Arizona summers wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for those darn high electric bills
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 03:45:18	Hope the Suns magically get a top 3 pick or make some sort of trade for an All Star caliber player
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 03:17:57	Keep getting contacted about jobs that don't interest me. I guess it's a good thing to "be in demand"...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 03:15:56	@IamHardkor3 ER visit is probably required
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 03:06:21	I really hate waiting for UPS to come. FedEx is so much better because they always come early in the morning
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 02:54:13	What time is the draft lottery (Phoenix time)?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 02:40:38	My email is blowing up with spam today
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-21 01:28:28	@purple_n_orange Just hit Filibertoslike you always talk about wanting. That stuff will just slide out quick :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-20 14:05:50	With summer electric bills & other extra expenses this is probably the worst time to have uncertainty at work. Paycheck to Paycheck struggle
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-20 14:02:48	Work your ass off even when off the clock and then are rewarded with uncertainty. I feel like this place just doesn't want me
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-20 14:00:01	I really am feeling frustrated. Good news turns into not so good. Then into uncertainty...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-20 04:29:35	Hope I get some good work related news today...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-20 04:12:36	@purple_n_orange Makes sense. They have more to offer than most teams. Hate it if we give up a lot and get him but he ends up walking

66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-18 04:37:02	I hate being treated so unprofessionally. How hard is it to answer an email
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-05-18 03:24:06	Resume finished time to blast it out to a few jobs I like... This sucks

66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-03-03 12:02:11	@Nguyen_Cow_Moo @Jeramie Like every 3 weeks after Mania until Summerslam I think
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-03-03 12:00:28	@Nguyen_Cow_Moo @Jeramie They have all month. No PPV's in March
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-03-03 11:57:34	@Nguyen_Cow_Moo @Jeramie Unless authority turns on him
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-03-03 11:55:29	@Nguyen_Cow_Moo @Jeramie Good when it works. Has a few glitches but kinda expected it. Only way the main event would work if they turn Ortan
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-03-03 11:52:36	@Nguyen_Cow_Moo @Jeramie All I know is Mania isn't looking very good. Glad I have the network because I wouldn't pay $60 to see it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-03-03 11:50:12	@Nguyen_Cow_Moo @Jeramie I agree. Just would be happy to see him back
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-03-03 11:47:16	@Nguyen_Cow_Moo @Jeramie He wan't to be a heel so I think they let him be one
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-03-03 11:44:07	@Nguyen_Cow_Moo @Jeramie @WadeBarrett For some reason I think he becomes corporate punk suit and all. With Punk vs Bryan at mania
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-03-03 11:40:10	@Nguyen_Cow_Moo @Jeramie I hope they play his music at the start and bring out Bad @WadeBarrett though to get a lot of heat
66619679	fluffybipolar	2014-03-03 11:39:34	@Nguyen_Cow_Moo @Jeramie Yes. I heard he will be from people I know at WWE as well.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 08:30:56	@AZJoshM @MykeWright4 @senorjessroot Rondo
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 08:27:34	@MykeWright4 I see D12's problem is he has so much talent but never really has grown up
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 08:26:55	So my wife is forcing me to see a doctor for my PTSD. Guess meds alone are not working
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 08:24:37	Going crazy with all this peace and quiet
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 08:16:55	@MykeWright4 Maybe the Suns can unload one of theirs
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 07:56:03	@bobstroup @SethCoxFB @grilling24x7 I want some of that!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 07:48:48	@ColeyMick to be fair I think his back was really messed up most of the season
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 07:42:46	Day off so might as well have a few drinks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 07:21:36	Wonder if I can get a Sarver jersey with $$ instead of numbers. He'll be around for awhile
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 07:20:30	Was going to buy a Gortat jersey but think I'll get a Len instead
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 07:19:02	@purple_n_orange I still have Barkley, KJ, Majerle and tons of others. Heck I have a Lampe
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 07:18:02	@purple_n_orange I have no problem with Nash the player but do not like him as a person
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 07:17:15	@purple_n_orange I still have all of mine. Weird that I have tons of Jerseys but only current Sun is the wrong #Goran Dragic
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 07:13:03	On paper multiple Stars look good but there is only one ball
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 07:12:06	Will the Rockets be able to challenge the Superfriends (Heat)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 06:41:10	WOW all the Laker fans got real quiet
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 06:38:54	@vegascardfan I say send the Gorilla
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 06:26:04	@standurdmc Then you probably won't like that I won them twice
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 06:25:18	@Nathanbailey76 I was lucky enough to get 2
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 06:24:27	Thinking the Mavs have to go after Bynum now
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 06:03:54	Always a good day when the Lakers lose
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 05:42:20	@Suns6thMan Hope Beasley plays 40+ min a game so we know the Suns can lose a lot
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 04:59:34	No idea of what to do on my day off today
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 04:22:04	If I owned an NBA team I'd worry about Dwight Howard's back but no matter where he goes that team is going to be better
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 03:20:23	@BradBaker81 @therealdarion Cool. Thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 03:02:41	@GomerBones I have a feline
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 03:02:02	@BradBaker81 Any idea when it's supposed to happen?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 02:55:55	@MykeWright4 No they'll just pretend it never happened. After All they're Laker fans...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-06 02:55:07	My cat's getting fat
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 13:55:37	I have this fear that one day I'll end up locked up in a mental hospital...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 13:50:57	@SunsofPHXfan Hope you're doing okay...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 12:41:11	These fireworks are giving me flashbacks. #PTSD
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 12:17:49	Love watching H2
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 09:58:21	The joys of multiple twitter accounts....
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 09:21:58	@purple_n_orange Same here
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 08:45:24	@purple_n_orange I'll probably get one regardless of what they look like. I'm a sucker for anything with a Suns logo
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 08:38:39	Saw a tweet about sleeved NBA jerseys which reminded me. Has anyone seen the new Suns sleeved jerseys?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 08:30:11	Need something fun to do
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 06:45:56	@AZJoshM hope you get well soon
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 06:25:57	@Sunz_Chick Not true. What if he has so much body hair you could braid it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 06:14:20	@GomerBones LOL yes Hot dogs...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 06:01:43	@GomerBones I can't even eat 69 in a year
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 05:31:10	@Suns6thMan okay thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 05:29:51	@Suns6thMan Thought he was traded to the Kings?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 05:10:34	@SunsMarketing @Suns So does that mean you hope none fans run with scissors?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 05:04:11	The 4th of July is the one day of the year that Americans take a break from trying to murder each other and try to murder the sky

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 04:47:57	@JeffMoore78 Eating leftovers...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-05 04:46:22	No mail service so I have no reason to go outside today...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-03 08:05:02	Hope this trade is the first of many for the Suns
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-03 08:03:19	@AZJoshM @purple_n_orange Maybe so but how many championships that win them?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-03 08:01:01	213-271-1645 = scammers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-03 07:55:45	Got a scam phone call trying to raise money for the dead firefighters...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-02 09:55:54	Actually craving some taco bell...So weird
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-02 09:32:31	Maybe they'll teach me how to wrestle a gator
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-02 09:23:31	Planning on working at my cousins gator farm next summer. Craving those tacos and Alligator jambalaya
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-02 09:19:54	Is it wrong as a kid I played with snakes. In fact like snakes more than dogs
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-02 09:18:23	@purple_n_orange Caught 4 Southern Copperhead within miles of your home in 2000
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-02 09:14:16	@purple_n_orange Where you live I'd be more worried about snakes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-02 09:04:49	Got to get new meds from the doctor tomorrow and not looking forward to it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-02 08:11:41	@ChrisMandell72 YES. I'd donate to make that happen
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-02 07:08:20	@JeffMoore78 someone has to hand players the towels
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-02 06:35:26	Not buying this Gortat to the Spurs rumor

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-07-01 13:18:04	Thoughts and Prayers out to the families of the 19 firefighters that lost their lives today. Such a Horrible tragedy. These men were heroes

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 09:16:44	I feel bad for all the people who have to be outside in the heat
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 09:14:53	After stocking up last night at the grocery store my goal is to not go outside this week
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 09:13:28	Best thing about working from home is I can go days without venturing outside into the heat
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 09:06:15	@CaptainCrakhead I probably would but my car doesn't have one of those temperature displays. #BeingHonest
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 09:03:30	So bored. Wife is training for her new job and kids or out of state. Maybe it's time for video games lol
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 08:50:20	Tweet about NOH8 and Equality and lose 31 followers. Didn't want you anyway then...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 06:47:28	@Suns6thMan It's a fair price assuming they use him
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 05:48:01	@vegascardfan still have it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 05:43:59	@vegascardfan Go for it. I did that the other day
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 05:36:28	@purple_n_orange I can picture you doing the Carnivore Challenge if you do go LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 05:33:59	@purple_n_orange have you been to Big Pie in the Sky Pizzeria yet?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 05:29:02	Facebook is full of people taking pics of the temperature inside their cars...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 05:24:29	Feel bad for the people working or living outside today
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 05:20:12	@Suns6thMan Thought he had potential if he could get consistent playing time
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-30 05:00:20	Don't forget about the Valley's homeless. Bottled water donations are always appreciated.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-29 15:03:32	Maybe soon I can become MediumSmalley...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-29 15:02:25	@Sunz_Chick or just find a store that delivers

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-29 15:00:41	@Sunz_Chick I hate it to that's why I stocked up :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-29 14:57:48	@Jana_Notah @innoutburger I don't have that problem. I'm already fat :) so they make me feel normal...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-29 14:57:15	Don't plan on leaving my home for a few days. Just stocked up on supplies at the grocery store
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-29 14:55:57	So full from IN-N-OUT
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 15:41:30	slowly becoming a hermit

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 15:25:26	PTSD sucks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 15:14:54	Wonder if any team would be dumb enough to take Beasley to get Gortat
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 15:11:34	So Hernandez is a suspect in other murders....
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 15:10:26	Did a double take when I saw Rasheed Wallace signed with the Pistons. Apparently he's now an asst. coach
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 15:07:14	@Sunz_Chick My only issue is I must keep it pg-13 since it's linked to my work. I use a different account for my outthere stuff
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 15:05:43	Older I get the less sleep I need
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 15:03:26	@Sunz_Chick Don't know most twitter people IRL so it's okay

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:53:40	@Sunz_Chick NEVER! Your to interesting ;)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:53:13	Did I miss something? Is David Stern retiring?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:51:43	@Sunz_Chick I don't know why you just seem that way to me. You shock me daily
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:49:46	@SethCoxFB Looking at youtube vids I'd say at most Tom Chambers worst case Robin Lopez 2.0
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:43:59	@Suns6thMan @the_real_sunz Trade all the players for picks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:43:38	@dogphnx Been looking at video of Len and he reminds me of a tall Tom Chambers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:42:58	@Sunz_Chick Sure you can. You still shock me by what you say. Thought you were "innocent girl"
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:42:10	@the_real_sunz @Suns6thMan I hope we do
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:40:25	@Sunz_Chick I had in the past
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:40:11	Been reading on twitter Suns didn't go after Noel because of his Knee issues
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:38:53	@dogphnx Suns resigned the training staff so I think he's in good hands
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:33:09	I need to make some real friends
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:32:58	Working from home is great other than you really don't have coworkers to hangout with
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 14:28:31	@Sunz_Chick So not PG-13....
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 13:13:58	@Suns6thMan @fastlane_351 He's going to wan Max money but isn't worth Max
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 13:05:56	@Suns6thMan I'd be happy with a late 1st round next year it's going to be a deep draft
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 13:05:15	Don't know much about LEN but if my timeline is to be believed he's Robin Lopez 2.0 I'll hold off judgment until the end of next year
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 13:03:15	@Suns6thMan Gortat has to go before the trade deadline
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-28 06:25:53	@caseytaggatz @Suns Noel
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 15:59:12	Have trouble sleeping more than a few hours anymore
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:54:25	@Sunz_Chick sleep well and ask that guy out already
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:51:40	@Sunz_Chick :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:47:08	Thinking of moving out of state
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:46:36	@Sunz_Chick Not like you need the beauty sleep :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:36:35	@dogphnx @jayjayjewett You mean you're not the same person?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:31:23	@dogphnx Andrew Wiggins
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:30:29	@jayjayjewett @dogphnx lol
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:25:05	@dogphnx I hope we do. Next years draft is going to be good
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:18:24	I say the Suns trade as many players as they can for draft picks this year and next
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:12:52	@dogphnx I've heard 30th pick and Gortat for #10 was on the table
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:07:03	@dogphnx I think we will trade the pick and move down
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:04:27	@Sunz_Chick Then don't say anything about it :) Trust me he'll say yes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:02:48	@Sunz_Chick I won't. I'd give you some wine if it happens
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:02:22	@dogphnx Any of the top 5 can be picked 1st!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 14:00:42	@Sunz_Chick DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! we just wanna see you happy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:57:26	@Sunz_Chick just put yourself out there. If you don't do it you've already lost him
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:54:34	@Sunz_Chick Girl he'd be lucky to get you
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:52:02	@Sunz_Chick If it is meant to be he'll say yes. Trust me most guys who are single say yes when asked out
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:50:14	@jayjayjewett No it's been going on for years I've watched since the mid 80's. They say it helps harder to exhale hard on contact
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:48:07	Bored...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:46:07	@jayjayjewett The men grunt to but nobody says anything
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:44:27	@Sunz_Chick if you never take a chance you'll never get what you want
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:40:24	@Sunz_Chick You need to go for it. Heck I'll go there and ask for you. If he says no I'm just some crazy guy you don't know lol
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:39:33	@SethCoxFB Gortat has to be on the move
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:38:07	Aaron Hernandez will go to jail as a tight end and if he ever leaves he'll leave a wide receiver
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:32:50	@Sunz_Chick Did you ask your crush out?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:25:10	Last full day of Gortat being a Sun. Probably...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:21:00	@AZ_Charlene Real but it's only over the lost $$
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:18:14	@the_real_sunz no need. I'm sure they will but at least it will be fun to watch :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 13:14:55	Just off of work. Time to unwind
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-27 03:46:38	@purple_n_orange and neck tattoos
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 15:08:05	I mean you should at least have 30-40 bots following you
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 15:07:06	How the heck do you have a twitter account thats over a year old with over 800 tweets and only have 16 followers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:59:05	Just realized I carried on a multiple conversation and accidently left @purple_n_orange in every tweet. Sorry man
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:45:15	@bbrriiaann1973 @purple_n_orange go to a game or buy merchandise. Complaining on twitter won't do anything
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:44:41	@bbrriiaann1973 @purple_n_orange Bottom line is your opinion doesn't count. The Cardinals can do whatever they want You don't like it don't
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:38:12	@bbrriiaann1973 @purple_n_orange He easily could have made millions more. Very few people would walk away from that to serve
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:32:47	@bbrriiaann1973 @purple_n_orange It's about life not football
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:32:14	@bbrriiaann1973 @purple_n_orange It's not how he played it's the fact he gave up his career and $$ to serve in the military
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:27:40	@bbrriiaann1973 @purple_n_orange Why? Can't the Cards honor him as well? He was part of the team I don't understand what you have against it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:23:24	@bbrriiaann1973 @purple_n_orange Why not? He made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. It's not about football
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:19:00	@bbrriiaann1973 @purple_n_orange I don't care about the statue and neither would he. Just be very careful about what you say about his life
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:13:25	@KCBrackley @purple_n_orange I dare that guy to say anything negative about Pat in front of me. However it's twitter people say dumb stuff
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:10:30	@KCBrackley @purple_n_orange saw that. He's just a troll based on his 16 followers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 14:07:42	@bbrriiaann1973 @purple_n_orange Better be careful what you say bro
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 12:36:35	Think I ate to much pizza
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 12:03:08	Shaved my head but kept the beard
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 10:00:24	I'm going to be mad if the Suns draft another PG
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 09:53:39	4 years ago today Michael Jackson died and the Suns drafted Earl Clark
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 09:31:19	@Bourdain Happy Birthday. We were born the same day just a few years apart
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 07:13:04	So I discovered I still have my old Sega Dreamcast and games. Maybe I'll hook it up
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 07:00:07	@JeffMoore78 I don't know still on 13 lol
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:58:39	@JeffMoore78 I know the Demo is usually released 2 weeks after E3
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:54:18	@AZJoshM yes :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:50:27	@AZJoshM but if you wanna save something google drive is free and better
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:50:03	@AZJoshM yes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:47:27	@AZJoshM Acer is good too. I just liked the other a little better for work stuff

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:41:47	@purple_n_orange to make matters worse it was on their 10th wedding anniversary
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:40:30	@purple_n_orange that's nothing I have a friend who found out her husband was divorcing her via facebook post
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:39:37	@Jeramie @Suns congratulations! You are awesome at your job too
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:38:13	@AZJoshM and they can't delete anything operating system wise
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:36:16	@AZJoshM I'd say go for it. They can't get viruses
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:34:07	@AZJoshM I ordered one
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:33:49	@JeffMoore78 Thanks

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:32:31	Need to get into baseball. Turned down behind home plate tics Arizona Diamondbacks vs. Los Angeles Dodgers because I have to work
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:30:26	This year I plan on going to a few Suns games. Win or lose I'm excited about this season
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:29:37	@sunsfan1013 I'm actually slowly hitting the hard stuff. Just trying to have fun and relax on my birthday since I have today off at work :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:25:32	@TomLeander Hope he gets a HC job soon
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:14:12	Nicki Minaj has the perfect sized head for a bobble head
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 06:02:23	I'd like to see the Suns get McLemore
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 05:59:37	I'm excited about the NBA draft. Anybody think they know who the Suns will target?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 05:53:19	@SnarkSprts I think you're right
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 05:50:47	@SnarkSprts until someone gets fired early in the season
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 05:46:59	Had a nice free lunch today :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 05:12:56	@Sunz_Chick Thank you
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-26 05:12:45	@sunsfan1013 Thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 15:48:04	Sometimes twitter sucks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 15:28:34	@Patsnation87 when you get them hold your breath and put your tongue against the roof of your mouth
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 15:23:54	Probably the biggest thing I miss about my birthday is my mom calling me no matter where I was at
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 15:04:35	Happy Birthday to me :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 13:46:35	Gortat to Portland supposedly picking up steam
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 13:44:20	Glad the Blackhawks won
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 13:43:29	@AnneWheaton Please don't twitpic it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 13:42:07	Stocked up on alcohol so I can have some fun tomorrow :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 13:33:15	So in just a few hours I'll be 35. Mentally though I'm still a 12 year old :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 13:26:26	@Sunz_Chick guess it's time to go for something stronger...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 13:08:32	Just got off of work time to catch up on my twitter
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-25 13:07:49	@futieton I will
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 15:37:32	@Sunz_Chick Which is why I don't text
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 15:37:09	@AZ_Charlene Hope it's better soon. You've been through so much this year already
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 15:31:36	@AZ_Charlene I liked it :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 15:12:48	@rustyrockets Any plans on coming to Arizona, USA anytime soon?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 14:36:00	Hate the way people treat me when they find out I am Bipolar with PTSD
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 14:25:41	LOL "go to work" my commute is walking from my bed to my computer
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 14:25:04	Love the fact I can stay up late since I don't have to go to work early this week
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 14:21:07	@futieton 2 at the same time
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 14:16:56	Thankful I've been losing weight without really trying
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 14:13:44	Thinking of shaving my head but keeping my beard
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 14:13:01	@IGotDudleyFever Yep
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 14:11:57	@IGotDudleyFever Make a wish
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 14:01:41	@SunsofPHXfan I was but really think it's dumb to risk your life especially if you have a family.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:59:53	@IGotDudleyFever Love passion Hope
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:59:08	@SunsofPHXfan It was just not the park itself
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:54:01	Saw that guy walk the wire across the Grand Canyon and all I could think is he's a horrible dad risking his life like that
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:47:06	Kids are at Disneyland this week. I've never went and probably never will
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:43:28	Maybe I'll gain followers for once. I can't seem to get over 350

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:27:46	@tifahthompson I'm glad too. Maybe she can actually leave the hospital. Basicly been there for months
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:26:50	Can't wait til Aug 1st so I can get a new phone
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:25:49	@Sunz_Chick @KCBrackley Played there gotta root for them :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:25:05	@Sunz_Chick @KCBrackley Go Sun Devils :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:23:42	@tifahthompson She was only on the list for a little over 2 weeks. Shows how bad of shape she was in
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:21:06	@Sunz_Chick @KCBrackley Halloween is my favorite holiday

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:12:07	@Suns6thMan Maybe he can get a job wiping down the court during games
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-06-24 13:06:28	If every other tweet you send has profanity I gotta unfollow you

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-03-12 07:23:59	It annoys me when drive thru's ask you to pull up even if nobody is behind you Especially when the lane is only big enough for 1 car anyways

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-25 13:48:04	@NikesOnMyTweets I liked Finding Nemo better
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-25 05:30:06	@Sunz_Chick Yes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-24 14:09:20	@Sunz_Chick @Suns I don't get what the big deal is? What is it?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-24 14:04:02	@azsportsguy Same stuff just been watching carbs and sugar
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-24 13:57:47	@azsportsguy Think most of it is I'm off some meds but I have been eating better and not drinking alcohol. Also joined a gym

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-21 14:05:16	Just got off work time to catch up on my timeline
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-21 10:31:36	@PHXSuns6thMan Who did they release?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-21 05:34:55	Snow just doesn't look right in AZ
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-21 05:03:59	My wife keeps playing the songs that like to get stuck in my head...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-21 04:52:37	@purple_n_orange at this point I just hope the Suns make a trade any trade...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-21 04:39:36	So NBC liked my treatment :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-21 04:05:51	Lost 30 followers in a day. That's harsh
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-21 04:00:42	Been away from my computer any crazy new Suns trade rumors
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-21 03:56:24	This cold weather is hard on me because of my arthritis
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-21 03:53:04	@Sunz_Chick Carefree
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-21 03:47:55	IT'S SNOWING....
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 14:03:33	@SunsofPHXfan Yep We had to get a Wii, PS3 and Xbox360 because each had a least 1 game we had to have
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 13:34:45	@SB_MikeMay I'm a fan too but I actually think they should lose this one to help with the draft
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 13:26:50	@SieraSantos Speeds up muscle recovery
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 06:58:36	@purple_n_orange I thought you just changed because you got old
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 06:26:20	@SunsofPHXfan Guy with a gun was going to shoot me. Had a kid with me so I fought back. Hit him a little to hard...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 06:22:30	@Sunz_Chick @PHXSuns6thMan Accidentely yes I guess
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 06:21:56	@PHXSuns6thMan Yeah at least that's how it was for me been 14 years and I still remember that week like it was yesterday
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 06:19:49	@PHXSuns6thMan Then she probably will remember even the slightest detail. It's something that just sticks with you
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 05:52:55	@PHXSuns6thMan Was it around the time she killed the guy? Memory of the days around the time you kill someone stay clear & with you forever
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 05:50:52	@purple_n_orange Only now they really don't have anything anybody really wants
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 05:26:14	Happy to see AMC adding more horror. The Terror will be coming to a TV near you soon.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-20 02:44:11	@BurnsAndGambo Fire the GM

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-19 12:05:30	@SunsofPHXfan @PHXSuns6thMan I know he will just don't think he's worth max
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-19 11:13:17	@SunsofPHXfan @PHXSuns6thMan But not worth MAX $
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-19 11:09:50	@PHXSuns6thMan I'd rather see them go after another 1st round pick
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-19 11:06:28	@KCBrackley THAT'S SICK
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-19 11:05:02	Hope the Suns trade off some guys for picks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-19 09:57:44	@purple_n_orange Just don't try to do it for an entire Suns game
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-19 09:53:33	@purple_n_orange Try putting it near a TV and force yourself to use it whenever you're watching TV
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-19 09:16:53	@bobstroup Thanks I'll definitely check it out
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-18 12:44:10	Met Mindy McCready back in 1998 and she seemed like a sweet but troubled soul. #RIPMindyMcCready
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-18 12:37:50	@SunsofPHXfan I think it's mostly because I stopped stress eating...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-18 12:29:38	Down 50lbs...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-18 07:59:32	I'll never look at a Capri Sun the same again... http://www. todaystmj4.com/news/local/191 116521.html …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-18 04:42:05	Been eating badly and skipping the gym and still dropping weight. Starting to wonder if my weight problems were stress related...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-17 14:55:59	Addicted to Words With Friends...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-17 14:44:33	@Sunz_Chick I'll take your word for it :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-17 14:35:53	1st time in awhile that I skipped NBA All Star Saturday and from the tweets I've seen I really didn't miss much
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-17 14:26:07	@Sunz_Chick Sounds like a beverage
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-17 14:22:25	@Sunz_Chick What are you now?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-17 14:19:41	@Sunz_Chick Robbing more cradles?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-17 13:58:15	Thinking of renewing my Mensa membership but $70 is a bit much IMO....

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-17 08:01:49	@purple_n_orange Yes. I've noticed that the last 4 years...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-16 14:05:35	Off work and catching up on the DVR
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-16 14:02:20	@purple_n_orange If they make that trade still gotta trade 6 mil more worth of players
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-16 05:53:51	@purple_n_orange @NikesOnMyTweets You say that now :P.....
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-16 05:51:27	Need to drink some caffeine quick! I start work in 10 min and I'm sleepy!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-16 05:42:06	@purple_n_orange I actually enjoyed reading those tweets because it let you sort out who the crazy people are
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-16 05:40:48	@purple_n_orange I wasn't on either side but I think that guy has a special place in hell. So do the cops he testified against
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-16 05:38:43	@purple_n_orange I know but she just got sick of hearing about him at all so she just unfollowed everyone temporarily
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-16 05:36:55	@purple_n_orange @yrite007 Not offended you were probably tweeting about that cop killer. She unfollowed people tweeting about him

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-15 06:53:17	@Sunz_Chick @the_real_sunz Okay makes more sense now
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-15 06:46:21	@Sunz_Chick @the_real_sunz I'm more against the 5 year old wearing the knee brace. At 5 years old ace bandage is all you need
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-14 05:46:13	@SnarkSprts Or they just didn't want you named the new pope
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-14 05:44:55	@IamHardkor3 Is she? Had no idea. probably was then.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-12 07:51:31	@BradBaker81 you see the stories of cops shooting at people unprovoked because they thought it could be him.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-12 07:43:11	@BradBaker81 & had time plan everything out. Reportdly he makes plans with multiple options just 2 shop imagine the plans he must have ready
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-12 07:41:47	@BradBaker81 What's scary is the guy has better training than those hunting him. More weapons. Can make improvised explosives, fly airplanes

66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-05 10:54:38	@AZ_Charlene Yep no anxiety and weight loss. Great combo.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-05 10:48:49	Parfois je me demande combien de personnes réellement lu des trucs sur twitter et combien de tweets aller ignoré
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-05 10:45:02	@tarcoman Peki arkadaşım dedi
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-05 10:40:54	Starting to think this weight loss is a side effect of my meds. Down almost 40lbs now...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-05 10:39:21	@the_real_sunz I have the same problem
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-05 10:38:40	Got run over by some huge lady on a scooter today. It actually hurt... People need to watch where there going...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-04 21:51:17	It was the 1st super bowl in awhile that I didn't really pull for either team to win
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-04 21:50:23	I do think however the 49ers got robbed...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-04 21:49:55	Congrats to the Ravens & 49ers on playing such a great game. I hadn't planned on watching but glad I did.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-04 13:36:39	@jmcpeek I thought Bane was coming out lol
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-04 10:39:38	@ohhijones Game isn't either :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-03 11:35:34	@Sunz_Chick Based on earlier tweets he sounds perfect for you :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-03 10:29:55	Hot Mess burger from @JackBox looks so GOOD!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-03 10:13:40	Looked away and missed that fight...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-03 10:11:25	Wish there was a way to just watch the super bowl commercials without watching the game :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-03 09:57:26	@JeffMoore78 He did
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-03 09:29:10	Who's going to watch #UFC156 ?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-03 09:25:16	@purple_n_orange Exactly!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-03 09:24:07	@MGortat Czy uważasz, że chłopaki mogą obrócić się i walczyć do tego 8-cie nasion?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-03 09:22:26	Mimi haja ya kuanza kufanya mazoezi yangu lugha nyingine. Mimi nina nzuri katika kusoma na kuandika lakini si kuzungumza.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-03 05:20:43	@Sunz_Chick Just making sure that was the one you were talking about :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 15:28:53	Neighbor so drunk he broke his window to get in his home because he forgot his key. Funny thing is his door was wide open...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 15:20:24	@draidayeveryday @azfamily GEZZ scare me before bedtime. Now I gotta look under my bed
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 15:15:59	@NikesOnMyTweets I've never watched an episode is it a good show?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 15:14:49	Regarder la TV avec ma femme n'est pas très amusant parce que tout ce que nous regarder est à la maison montre une amélioration
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 15:08:31	Barely starting to relax after working til 11pm and wouldn't you know it twitter is dead
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 15:07:15	Peut-être que je vais faire un voyage en France cet été parce que ma femme n'a jamais été là.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 14:44:26	@Sunz_Chick But he's legal ;)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 14:41:06	Weekend off and nothing to do. Guess I'll get some sleep in...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 14:28:21	@Sunz_Chick MY BAD :(
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 14:26:10	@Sunz_Chick Not Dragic is he? ;)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 14:23:17	@Sunz_Chick someone has to be :D
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 14:02:33	@Sunz_Chick Cradle robber :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2013-02-02 12:47:52	@the_real_sunz Keep calm and unfollow :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-11 05:42:03	Suns add Jermaine O'Neal. Hope the medical staff still has some magic left
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-11 05:33:34	I actually think the Lakers got worse with this trade
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-11 05:13:48	I gave a friend who stopped breathing CPR and there in ICU. Their mom is now saying I'm an ass for causing all these medical bills WTF
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-10 06:22:41	First time out with the guys in YEARS and figures someone ends up in the ER
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-09 07:38:26	Kids school bus was an hour late and then I get a phone call after they arrive saying the bus is running about 15 minuets late #FAIL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-09 07:08:01	@bobstroup @KCBrackley LOL! Good luck fitting it on the grill
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-09 07:07:33	@KCBrackley @BiggieSmalley Angry but we didn't really care she's kinda the Ahole relative anyways
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-09 06:33:09	@KCBrackley yep they had just introduced a new male into the exhibit. Learned that rhinos can spray up to 50 feet. But she got a free shirt
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-09 06:30:24	@KCBrackley My aunt got soaked with Rhino piss there
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-09 06:13:03	@Moran_Brothers hows your week going? I've been doing better with weight not that I go to physical therapy regularly and can move now
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-09 06:08:43	I gotta get out of Phoenix!!! 114 YUCK
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-08 14:48:27	@Bridget @itsmeLoreen Stay safe :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-08 14:45:44	What's with all the "accidental" nude pics on twitter and facebook today?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-06 14:34:05	@Hardkore_3 No Cardinals player died. That's about it for positives
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-06 09:37:36	At ST Joseph's hospital at least I get to watch the Cardinals game on tv
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-06 09:02:39	I hope Kolb comes around but Skelton is looking a lot better than him
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-06 03:00:04	If you have a facebook please vote for Longview elementary so they get $ from Target https:// apps.facebook.com/givewithtarget /schools/75318 … THANKS
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 10:47:40	Robin Lopez underwent surgery for a medial meniscus tear in left knee. Good luck with this guy Hornets
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 08:48:40	@mosa77 have fun ;)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 08:42:13	@purple_n_orange I think I will its not like I'd have to pay for it...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 08:41:11	My cousin lost his home in the Oklahoma wild fires. On the bright side he recently added a large insurance policy covering against fire
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 08:37:13	@purple_n_orange I need to look into that
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 08:36:21	@dogphnx @fluffyguy not that I saw but then I googled it and found info on last nights show. Kinda bad promotion
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 08:28:37	@purple_n_orange whats redzone?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 08:18:18	@dogphnx @fluffyguy I didn't see a single advertisement for the show
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 08:15:07	@purple_n_orange if I found that out I'd have a late night horror movie marathon with my wife just to freak her out
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 08:12:38	@dogphnx @fluffyguy I'm but apparently he did a show last night
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 08:05:59	@purple_n_orange thank goodness you have a minister following you then. LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 08:03:12	Had no idea @fluffyguy was in town or I would've got tickets to his show
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 07:59:48	First time @fluffyguy and I have been in the same state at the same time. If we both jump will Arizona have a earthquake?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 06:26:18	@purple_n_orange Don't worry it's not a ritual to get rid of ghosts. It's to get rid of demons...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 06:15:21	@purple_n_orange Any strange things like mini graves in the yard or salt or sage on the window sills?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 06:11:19	I'm getting tired of the Olympics. Everywhere I go it's on the TV. Guess I need to take my tablet with me and watch Netflix
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 06:08:38	@purple_n_orange It's Georgia so if they knew it was "haunted" they would have had to disclose it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 06:03:13	@SunsfanJohn Holding you to that Baxter
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 05:42:11	What's up Baxter? Why did you pick @SunsfanJohn instead of your old handle?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 04:52:57	I think I've been spending too much time reading tweets because twitter handles and AVI's keep popping up in my dreams
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 01:31:00	I'm happy my kids are coming back from a month vacation with their grandparents Monday
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-05 01:30:04	@purple_n_orange Not very many people even entered which is the only reason I won. I think they thought it was a facebook scam.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-04 14:18:17	@purple_n_orange I already got it credited. They had no rule against it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-04 07:52:41	@CoxArizona Thanks for the Free year of service from your Facebook contest
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-04 06:51:57	Sometimes I wish I could punch people through the internet. Such F'ed up people sometimes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-04 06:10:41	@Moran_Brothers I think I will. I'm sick of my Wifi only tablet plus the apps seem better
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-04 04:12:45	Checked out the I pads at BestBuy and decided I want to get one to replace my tablet when I can afford it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-03 03:55:37	Won another free year of cable, internet and phone from Cox
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-03 02:16:56	@Moran_Brothers Thank you Quincy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-02 09:21:29	New booster seat law kinda took me by surprise. You'd think they would have advertised it more
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-08-01 03:04:16	I was driving down Central and saw some guy on the side of the road in a bra & panties holding a sword. WTF
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-31 14:48:15	> @RandomHusband : Hey I just met you, turns out you're crazy. So delete my number, and keep the baby.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-31 05:18:36	I don't remember ever seeing negative ads this early before
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-31 05:18:03	I can't believe Obama has already started with negative ads. I know that you only do neg ads if you can't win on the issues.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-31 05:14:54	So @LSola4 scored 32 points to lead Argentia over Lithuania. I'm excited to see him on the Suns this year
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-30 14:14:03	I hate the way NBC has covered the Olympics thus far. I needs to move to another network.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-30 10:01:59	As cocky as some of these NBA players are about being better than the Dream Team it makes part of me hope they end up with a loss.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-30 10:00:05	@yrite007 She's on CSI now with Ted Danson
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-29 07:44:35	I can finally see the Suns front office actually has some sort of a plan
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-28 10:00:23	@SunsofPHXfan LOL. I feel that way while I'm there but have noticed a major improvement since I started
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-28 09:09:22	Got my ass kicked again at Physical Therapy but at least I see some improvement and less pain.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-27 09:00:15	@PHXSuns6thMan Well I won a free year of cable in the past so they are okay with me
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-27 06:52:29	@PHXSuns6thMan What do you have against Cox?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-26 10:01:36	#BringBackBarbosa
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-26 09:56:30	You'd think Suns could package the Memphis pick, with their own and the Lakers to move way up next year
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-26 09:54:50	Really liking the Suns moves this off season
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-26 09:50:27	Physical therapy kicked my ass today
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-25 13:26:46	Guess this cold didn't want to stay in Vegas
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-25 11:42:01	@PHXSuns6thMan (Agreed!) @yrite4 go to Sugar Factory if you get down to Vegas. They have amazing waffles
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-24 11:47:56	Can't believe my kids summer vacation is almost over...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-22 04:24:23	Going to spent today just being lazy & resting
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-18 04:50:15	Looking around (@Ceasers Palace- Fourm Tower) http:// 4sq.com/Nw88A3
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-16 14:23:51	@PHXSuns6thMan I'm cool with that. Staying the week so plenty of time so no need to rush. Plus can use the exercise
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-16 08:57:04	@PHXSuns6thMan I'm heading up there Tuesday
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-16 07:07:22	Waiting....... (@St. Joseph's Hospital) http:// 4sq.com/Nu3Lt2
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-15 06:52:07	What disrespect! NBA,com doesn't even list the Suns as playing in summer league/ Go to select teams @http://www. nba.com/summer-league/ gameline/20120714/ … & you'll see
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-14 09:31:51	More rain!! We really need this
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-13 07:02:13	@JeffMoore78 No
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-13 01:39:52	@purple_n_orange Price isn't everything. Tried them and unless I got some bad ones they make the picture quality shit
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-13 01:29:14	Greg Oden decided to come back and try to play this year. If the Suns can get him cheap they need to take that gamble
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-11 06:14:19	@PHXSuns6thMan @EspoAZ I'm pretty sure he's playing in the Italian league still
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-11 06:11:58	it's so freaking hot outside
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-11 06:08:51	I can't wait till the gym they are building a block and a half from my house opens. Then I'll have no excuse not to workout
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-08 15:38:06	@dogphnx LOL I meant my home LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-08 09:13:36	If NO doesn't match or we figure out a S/T I think the Suns will have built a nice young basketball team that can make the playoffs
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-08 09:09:37	@dogphnx at Home..LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-07 05:09:02	I'd like to see the Suns pickup Elton Brand to play PF
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-06 08:41:55	What's with all these naked criminal stories lately?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-06 05:02:21	@Moran_Brothers No prob I hope he wins a ring
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-06 02:16:43	@Moran_Brothers Thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-05 14:13:17	I think Marshall , Dragic, Beasley and Gordon (Fingers crossed) will be a major upgrade over last years roster
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-05 14:00:51	Happy to see Goran Dragic back with the Suns. Maybe we can resign Brooks and use him as an undersized 2
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-05 09:15:46	Good luck in LA @SteveNash hope you get a ring while the Suns are still in rebuilding mode
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-05 09:08:11	I have no problem with Nash to LA because at least he has a shot at a ring. Personally I don't thin he'll stay healthy in LA
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-05 08:32:48	@bobstroup where at?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-05 08:18:53	Gambo is hardly ever right. He'd report it as a done deal if he heard for a friend of one of Nash's friends
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-05 04:52:08	I think I'll give fantasy football a try this year
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-04 11:00:17	I say try to trade Gortat for a 1st and a young guy. Without Nash he may just be a backup type center
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-04 09:58:24	Kids are looking forward to the fireworks tomorrow
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-04 09:40:01	@Moran_Brothers Great to see multiple tweets from you guys
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-03 06:20:58	@purple_n_orange They also say he's not a good locker room guy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-02 09:09:58	@dogphnx @purple_n_orange @Cesspool66 How about his fro
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-02 02:35:49	No it's time to blow it up RT @purple_n_orange : Suns fans...3 years $36 mil for Nash. Do you do it?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-01 08:49:22	If the Suns can get Barbosa on the cheap I think we should bring him back
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-07-01 08:38:05	Without the Suns training staff does anyone think Nash will have a very productive year this season?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-30 09:22:35	I think rule number one for building a quality NBA team should be don't sign players with neck tattoos
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-30 06:40:46	@Moran_Brothers Can you guys please help me? I was wondering if you could send a nomination email because I'm told that really helps

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-24 04:46:39	@Moran_Brothers so anything I should know or do before I go to BL casting next weekend?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-22 06:37:11	I'm at Your Neighborhood Healthcare Center (Phoenix, AZ) http:// 4sq.com/NoK7O1
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-21 11:33:11	Finally! It looks like college football will have a playoff!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-21 10:31:46	Catching up on DVR
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-20 09:27:47	My BzzAgent BzzScore is 3.4 out of 10 - how good is your Bzz? http:// bzzagent.com/user/lonniesma lley … #imabzzagent
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-20 05:36:37	Hate these bipolar mood swings
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-16 10:15:03	CBS is making a show based on Draw Something. WOW...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-16 08:30:05	@Moran_Brothers Think I will do the video submission & go to the casting to double my chances
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-16 07:43:20	@Moran_Brothers yes June 30th
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-16 07:34:17	@Moran_Brothers thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-16 07:32:37	@colinferg Voted for you and a few others :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-16 07:27:56	@Moran_Brothers I'll be on skype today and most of the weekend.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-16 07:23:29	@Moran_Brothers Thinking of applying to be on the biggest loser any tips?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-16 07:22:25	Mostly bugs me when they take the scooters and people on crutches or really old can't get one
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-16 07:21:35	Pet Peeve: People who aren't disabled just obese & get on the scooters at the store. If they can walk from their car they can walk in store
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-14 06:13:01	Until the NBA broadcasts the actual lottery I will be convinced that it is rigged
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-14 06:08:06	Woohoo! Only 44 days until the Olympic games begin!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-14 06:06:36	@JeffMoore78 I do
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-11 07:54:37	@KCBrackley I have some friends with rentals I'll see what they got available and if it fits your need I'll send you details...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-11 07:50:16	@KCBrackley What area? How many rooms?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-08 05:58:00	Would anybody like to see Ochocinco paired with Larry Fitzgerald?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-08 05:23:08	@PHXSuns6thMan how'd your wiring adventure go last night? I hope everything's all right
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-08 05:21:38	@CVS_Extra I already called and don't feel really it was made right. I think some of your employees need lessons in customer service
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-08 05:20:18	@Moran_Brothers that's fine just some comments I felt were inappropriate not just yours. Just saying I probably won't be watching anymore
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-08 05:11:17	I hope Boston wins tonight. I don't care who wins the championship as long as it's not the Miami Heat.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-08 05:10:03	@Moran_Brothers just sit back and forth bickering not just you guys the other people in the thread as well. Really left a bad taste...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-08 05:08:29	Hey @CVS_Extra your customer service sucks! Read what happened at my most recent visit to your pharmacy http:// lonniesmalley.com/cvs-pharmacy-s ucks/ … #donewithcvs
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-08 05:06:23	@Moran_Brothers I really disliked the Facebook thread about the announcement & it kinda changed my opinion about you guys
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-07 11:20:42	Come on Thunder!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-06 12:23:29	Fed-ex just delivered our package 9:22pm
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-04 12:52:08	Been having trouble sleeping past few days. Time to take my sleeping meds cause I have to get up early tomorrow
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-04 09:06:25	@PHXSuns6thMan I agree but think if Nash leaves front office will panic and trade Gortat because he can get them the most in return
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-04 09:00:26	@PHXSuns6thMan I think we make a lot of trades if Nash leaves. Probably Duds and Gortat at the very least
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-04 08:49:18	@purple_n_orange Thunder remind me of the 90's Suns...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-04 08:48:15	@PHXSuns6thMan I kinda hope we go after Jeff Green. Should be cheap because of his surgery & has a better upside than most available FA's
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-04 08:45:22	@purple_n_orange Doesn't matter. Whoever comes out of the West will be the Champs
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-04 08:42:33	@PHXSuns6thMan I hope he doesn't. I'm not a fan of his attitude
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-03 06:10:18	@PHXSuns6thMan I've heard of people getting deliveries on the weekends after 10pm from them so you're lucky
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-03 06:09:10	@azmadame_x No clue. Kid worked hard and should be rewarded
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-03 02:35:43	I just posted about my Bipolar & Depression, read it here: http:// wp.me/p2jmul-kM
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-02 06:38:14	@purple_n_orange That's why my twitter timeline slowed down so much...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-02 06:07:49	I wonder if the Suns will make a run a Jeff Green during Free Agency
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-02 04:04:07	RIP Orlando Woolridge.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-01 09:06:40	@purple_n_orange That's like living in the dark ages...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-06-01 08:58:21	@purple_n_orange Sports bar?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-30 08:55:34	@purple_n_orange Will do
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-30 08:41:02	@purple_n_orange I have A LOT of family there
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-30 08:35:12	@purple_n_orange It's $50 to try and if you finish you get $250. I'm a big guy and love pizza but no way I could eat six pounds of it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-30 08:27:21	@purple_n_orange 2 people have an hour to eat an entire 12 pound pizza
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-30 02:04:38	@purple_n_orange I've been there before and the Bacon Cheeseburger was my favorite. You going to do the challenge?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-30 01:43:00	@KCBrackley Yes it's the Dolphins
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-30 01:42:30	@jmcpeek No idea how to kill the time but have a safe flight when you catch the next one
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-28 14:11:01	@AnneWheaton At the Phoenix Comicon wife said she'd rather get a picture with you than Wil because she thinks your more awesome
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-27 08:55:22	I'm at Phoenix Mercury (Phoenix, AZ) http:// 4sq.com/JX0gdC
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-26 12:40:38	@AnneWheaton You need to tell him to give them back. They don't fit
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-26 11:57:26	@wilw @sirwheaton Now I can follow Ryan for all the good tweets...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-26 11:40:37	@DFarentino Loved your Woman of Sci-Fi panel at the @PhoenixComicon You were awesome! Hope 2 see you on TV again soon
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-26 02:58:32	I'm at the @PhoenixComicon this place is nuts
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-25 14:04:32	Exhausted after just one day covering the Phoenix comicon. I'm probably going to need a week to recuperate after it wraps on Sunday
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-24 00:43:37	I won tickets to Saturday's @PhoenixMercury game so I think it will be a fun way to get my 10 year old daughter interested in basketball
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-24 00:39:25	At my kids school waiting for the next award ceremony to start. All together I have 3 to go to plus a kindergarten graduation #prouddad
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-23 22:41:15	Attempting to set up interviews with a few comicon guests...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-23 04:01:12	Can't wait for the NFL season to start. Not really into baseball or hockey and I hate all the teams left in the NBA playoffs
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-23 01:42:47	@Hardkore_3 I actually have been diagnosed bipolar... They put you on a lot of meds
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-23 01:39:50	Now I remember why I keep thinking of moving away from Arizona #ItsHot
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-22 23:08:20	Crazy PTSD nightmares last night. Glad it's morning... I wish there was some magic pill for them
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-22 06:12:18	I think it was a mistake for Orlando to fire Stan Van Gundy especially sense Howard still wants out of Orlando
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-22 06:04:20	If the 76ers win the title I would finally be convinced that the NBA is not rigged. The draft lottery well that's another issue...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-22 05:58:14	@ZoDogg34 I agree. However, unfortunately the Suns have never done anything lately that makes sense as far as basketball goes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-22 05:47:53	I agree he has a lot of talent and would be a good fit @ZoDogg34 @PhoenixSuns @Cdouglasroberts
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-22 05:12:59	@Hardkore_3 I personally would rather just buy tickets then deal with that hassle in order to "win" them.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-22 05:10:37	is it just me or does the Phoenix Sun's draft lottery contest seem like they've resorted to the same pitch timeshare company's use
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-05-22 02:19:41	@AnneWheaton Are you coming to the Phoenix Comicon with Wil?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-04 02:51:23	Finally shaved off the beard I had been growing since October
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-03 22:57:47	Had my new eyeglasses for just a little over a month now and the lens already popped out. GRRR
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-03 06:43:11	@PHXSuns6thMan Yep, it's so vague it's ridiculous
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-03 03:09:23	So if it passes HB 2549 would even make twitter beef's illegal if one the people live in Arizona. That's just crazy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-03 02:47:02	@purple_n_orange apparently David Spade was named Worst Supporting Actress as well. I'm sure I'll never watch that movie
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-02 12:37:12	Watched the Red Band Trailer for American Reunion and I know it's going to be dumb but I have to watch it now.. It's like a train wreck
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-02 11:01:45	Almost passed out at the dollar store. Guarantee I have low blood sugar right noe
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-02 08:45:36	What's with all these people on youtube recording their TV with a camera?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-02 01:40:56	Feeling Grumpy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-01 14:21:05	I wonder what April Fools day joke most of twitter will fall for...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-01 06:31:17	I think it would be better if the Suns started Childress instead of Brown.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-01 06:13:52	@davis8207 At least on twitter I have to click them to see it...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-01 06:12:13	Now that it has hit 90 in Phoenix I'm expecting the never ending photo's of pics of car thermometers on Facebook
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-01 05:55:33	Good Grief Ryan Leaf was arrested again... He needs to get some help
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-01 05:05:01	Clearing out people on my facebook and twitter who cause a lot of drama feels pretty darn good
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-04-01 03:27:54	My blood glucose levels are ridiculously high today #annoyed
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-31 14:16:35	@ZoDogg34 @paulcoro Wonder if Sarver actually paid for the trip or they put Blanks in a box and sent him airmail
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-31 10:16:23	So who bought a mega millions ticket?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-31 07:33:55	@KCBrackley Don't worry it's almost never anyone from Arizona anyway...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-30 12:42:51	@yrite4 I purchased 1 ticket. I feel a little like Charlie Bucket from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-30 12:40:48	One of my neighbors said her office pool purchased 1000 mega million tickets. $20 a person. That's a lot of tickets...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-30 11:49:47	@Moran_Brothers Yep I'm looking forward to that one
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-30 11:26:17	When I first saw the Charles Barkley Weight Watcher pics I was like what the F happened to Jennifer Hudson...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-30 11:07:39	@Moran_Brothers http:// juicycelebrityrumors.com/twins-sequel-i n-the-works/ …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-30 11:05:59	@Moran_Brothers Nope. They really are
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-30 09:36:36	Apparently they're making a sequel to the movie Twin's and calling it Triplets with Eddie Murphy playing the third brother...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-30 06:32:43	@ActuallyNPH @DerrenBrown 1,098,611
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-30 01:03:43	With all these birds chirping outside I have to wonder if those damn pigs are hiding somewhere nearby with their eggs...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-30 00:10:33	Purchased Mega millions ticket and if I win I hope my wife enjoys the money because I will have died of a heart attack
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-29 23:56:57	@TheRealRoseanne you're campaign slogan should be "I can't do any worse and at the very least you're going to be entertained"
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-29 23:52:07	@TheRealRoseanne I'll probably vote for you just to see you tell off all the dumbass's in Washington.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-29 23:48:33	Didn't get to watch the game last night but if my twitter feed can be trusted I'm guessing we lost
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-29 09:53:17	Never got that many prescriptions at one time. If I didn't know better I'd say I was dying...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-29 03:43:21	Standing outside my doctors office waiting for my 1pm appointment had no clue they close from 12 to 1 so this sucks...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-28 14:49:07	@dogphnx Thanks. Just seems like it's going after everyone I know...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-28 14:43:10	So My friend is undergoing mesothelioma treatment and I'm not taking it well... : http:// wp.me/p2jmul-i4
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-28 12:04:50	I wonder what @draidayeveryday thinks of the Dodgers sale
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-28 11:47:31	@Moran_Brothers His health is far more important than a video. Praying for you guys...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-28 11:28:03	@Moran_Brothers Get well soon
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-28 11:19:52	I'm craving chicken gizzards with sour cream...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-28 09:02:52	Thanks anyway twitter spammers but I don't need a new job or an ipad3 or iphone. Twitter spam is up this week
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-28 05:25:03	Took my wife to see Hunger Games & I can't decided which is stranger watching a movie for the 2nd time or actually paying to watch a movie
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-27 13:15:54	@yrite4 what's that like 5 gallons...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-26 11:32:19	Wonder if James Cameron was just down there looking for that diamond from his movie...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-26 06:44:27	@yrite4 I watch golf only when I need to force myself to sleep...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-26 06:27:55	Fresh & Easy Lime & Cilantro Marinated Chicken for dinner tonight. YUM....
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-26 05:48:23	@sepinwall @annabellekline Agreed NYC is the worst by far...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-24 15:01:35	I think they should have just ended Spartacus when Andy Whitfield passed because I just can't get into it with the new actor
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-24 15:00:07	2 min left #ff @purple_n_orange @ErinLand20 @draidayeveryday @the_real_sunz @Hardkore_3 @davis8207 @jmcpeek @KCBrackley @yrite4

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-24 11:40:05	Missing 5-year-old Jhessye Shockley's mother is pregnant again. OMG poor kid
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-24 08:19:49	@azmadame_x Is it tonight? Is the jackpot big?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-24 07:13:47	Feel like I belong in a Dr Scholls commercial because my compression stockings are eliminating my foot and leg pain
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-24 05:16:28	@purple_n_orange Congrats
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-24 04:12:25	@purple_n_orange I think it was just a publicity stunt to make people feel sorry for her.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-23 13:37:48	A Cabin in the Woods has some nice plot twists and an OMG cameo but still not my kind of movie
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-23 12:52:06	These allergy's are killing me
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-22 05:12:36	@the_real_sunz But it would be big a big help for all the food places here
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-22 03:24:38	Can anything ever get completed with Tim Tebow? Passes, trades... Good Grief..
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-22 03:19:25	Boris Diaw waived? Anybody want him back in Phoenix?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-22 02:17:19	If you thought Linsanity in NY was bad imagine what it's going to be like if Tebow wins the 1st game he plays in....
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-22 01:02:53	Contemplating getting a B12 shot
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-21 03:55:14	@PHXSuns6thMan So nobody can see them play of course. They're that bad
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-20 01:08:06	Downloaded a new clock widget app for my phone and everything worked great except the clock, It didn't work at all. Great job guys...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-20 00:43:05	Why was everybody shocked Peyton went to Denver? I thought everyone knew Colts grow up to be Broncos!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-20 00:09:04	With the whole PM thing sorted out isn't it about time for the Cards to go after a legit #2 WR?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-20 00:05:38	@purple_n_orange Won't happen he'll be the #2 in Denver. He only get's like a million bucks this season
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-19 12:58:01	Is the rain and cold finally over or is it supposed to stay Monday as well?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-17 12:22:24	So much for going for a top draft pick. Just make sure you make the playoffs Suns

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-17 10:01:37	Duke, Memphis AND Missouri all out after their first game. I'm going to say anyone with a winning bracket tossed darts at a list of names.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-17 10:00:01	@azmadame_x Same for me. It's been one of those days
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-17 09:19:38	I'm going to laugh if Peyton Manning goes to the 49ers and Alex Smith leaves. I stand by my PM hurt inside of 6 games prediction
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-17 09:05:17	My knee is acting up today. Must mean it's going to rain #arthritis
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-17 07:16:40	@SunsGorilla Because it probably freaks them out

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-16 09:59:20	@bobstroup in the summer we run ours at around 78 to 80. I'd hate to have these guys summer electric bill

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-16 09:44:15	My neighbors are actually running their A/C unit already and have it set on 60. I wonder what they're going to do come summertime in Phoenix
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-16 09:25:01	@davis8207 you can always work on your cardio which is a must and your punching angles for your stand up which is always neglected
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-16 09:24:25	@Moran_Brothers I'm fine with that just hate all the rumors. Just wish he'd pick someone already

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-16 08:28:10	I'm pretty sure if it isn't announced by 4PM ET tomorrow then Peyton Manning isn't signing with the Cardinals
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-16 08:21:33	it's funny watching the progression of Peyton Manning rumors first it was the Dolphins then Broncos and now Titans. #BSRUMORS
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-16 08:13:41	Feel bad for Greg Oden getting cut by the Blazers. The guy must be cursed...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-16 02:36:31	I have a feeling that the Cardinals locker room is going to be an awkward place to be next season with Kolb at QB
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-16 02:32:46	Anyone think the Suns pull off a last-minute trade like last year?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-16 02:13:16	Sometimes you just gotta wonder if there's some under the table payments being paid out when the Lakers make a trade
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-16 01:29:33	Agreed RT @the_real_sunz @the_real_sunz @wildfirediva @mosa77 @DudleyJSPN @NicciNite @IGotDudleyFever @draidayeveryday

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-14 07:49:36	@Moran_Brothers I know cause that's a lot of views IMO
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-14 03:44:53	I'm sick of speculation and from now on wish they would just stick to reporting the facts
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-14 00:59:29	@Moran_Brothers WOW over 6k video views this week for you guys! That's awesome

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-12 13:39:58	I hate getting all this twitter spam about ipads, jobs and dating sites. No thanks on all of the above
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-12 12:53:47	@draidayeveryday I mean if it were true we lose Nash, Dudley, Lopez, Morris and Warrick. That's A LOT of parts to move so I say BS
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-12 12:42:04	WTF is with all the Steve Nash to Lakers BS again...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-12 09:16:12	I've been offline any news on PM to AZ?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-12 06:59:02	I just posted The Power Of Words, read it here: http:// lonniesmalley.com/?p=1062
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-12 04:31:17	@purple_n_orange I originally was against them getting Manning but if there's even a chance he's healthy they gotta do it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-12 04:28:55	@purple_n_orange Most of the time Gambo uses his gut and twitter as sources so I never put to much faith in the guy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-11 14:40:04	@draidayeveryday @abc7 Not here in Arizona
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-11 11:44:18	@KCBrackley Some apps let you
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-11 08:59:04	@JohnBaxter13 Did you really paint your cast Purple and Orange for the Suns game?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-11 08:47:13	The Cardinals should look into getting the Suns medical staff to work with Manning. Then they can offer him the fountain of youth
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-11 07:15:37	Trimmed up the beard a bit so at least I no longer look like a member of ZZ Top
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-11 05:48:21	Anybody else always seem to go overboard when shopping at Total Wine and More?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-11 05:36:05	If PM signs with Denver can you imagine how many people on twitter would probably compare him to Satan for taking Tebow's job
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-11 05:16:14	@bobstroup tastes like someone spiked it with alcohol and maybe some illegal drugs
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-11 05:08:32	@KCBrackley so I'm guessing she let you win this one. LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-11 05:07:40	I guess I'll drink the Manning to AZ kool-aid now
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-11 04:51:56	@KCBrackley pretty sure you only think you won. Watch out I bet this comes back to haunt you later

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-10 06:10:54	Question to all the Peyton to AZ people. If he won't be ready to go from game 1 would you still want him?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-10 06:08:33	A Thousand Words probably kills off Eddie Murphy's career. Anybody else remember when this guy was dangerously funny? What a waste
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-10 04:06:08	This is the first time in 6 months that my back wasn't killing me.Thank goodness I found a good chiropractor. Wish he took my insurance

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 14:23:11	@ZoDogg34 They wanted someone to balance out the gravitational pull of Barkley's head...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 14:21:04	@ZoDogg34 He'll pay someone to come. Probably overpay but he will pay
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 14:18:08	@ZoDogg34 Get someone solid and get some FA in 2013 instead?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 14:15:39	@ZoDogg34 It's a deep draft so either way it's alright...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 14:12:57	Come on Los Suns!!!!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 13:58:55	Every time I see Grant Hill's name in a tweet all I can think is "Grant Hill drinks Sprite"...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 09:19:19	My beard is getting kinda thick so I'm trying to decide if I should shave it off
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 08:04:09	@Hardkore_3 That's my point. They try and fail. I think that's going to happen with Peyton Manning too. We'll try but won't land him
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 07:42:19	@Hardkore_3 We were 7 million under the cap
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 07:37:28	@Hardkore_3 Most FA's were an improvement over who we had...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 07:30:11	Cardinals couldn't even get a legit #2 receiver last year and people really think we're getting Peyton Manning?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 05:54:30	@PHXSuns6thMan True. it just strikes me as odd that people who are against violence are sending me threats. Funny in a way I guess
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-09 05:50:28	@PhoenixSuns I was born a Suns Fan so no idea as to why I am one. #WhyIAmASunsFan

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-08 14:27:50	@the_real_sunz The other thing they don't mention is last year in November Obama sent 100 special forces to capture or kill Kony
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-08 14:24:02	@the_real_sunz Yep both sides are bad it's all in how you spin it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-08 14:14:34	@Moran_Brothers Thanks. I kinda ranted a lot but that's because I'm passionate about this issue
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-08 14:11:32	@the_real_sunz I was in Uganda back when Kony and his thugs were terrorizing it's people and still speak to many people who live there

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-08 13:58:56	@the_real_sunz Yep. I just hope people actually do take the time and look into issues not just this one instead of just believing trends
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-08 13:47:08	@draidayeveryday I did that on facebook today and cleared almost 100 people
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-08 13:15:49	@Moran_Brothers That's my point they're trying to raise all that money but don't even know if he's even still alive
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-08 11:19:34	@Moran_Brothers I made a blog post saying I didn't like how the money was spent and that they were twisting facts & I guess made people mad
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-08 10:18:31	@KCBrackley @BradBaker81 @TheNewMSMF9 You mean renegotiate his deal?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-08 10:07:17	@951trkr29 LOL I always thought he looked constipated. I guess that's kind of the same thing
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-08 10:06:09	@Moran_Brothers have you not been on the Internet in the last 24 hours? Just google Kony 2012

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-07 09:49:44	Did you hear about the injured Colt put of its misery? Yep, the Colt's waived Peyton Manning after he broke his neck...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-07 08:48:50	If Peyton goes to the Broncos imagine what that team could do with a QB that can actually throw
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-07 08:24:20	@davis8207 ours was like 45lbs and almost 4 feet long
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-07 08:16:56	@davis8207 I know what you mean. Most people at first would think ours was a dog
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-07 07:59:41	@davis8207 Yes. I'll dig it up and scan it for you.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-06 05:27:00	@purple_n_orange Well I only did it as revenge against @JohnBaxter13 I've even seen the yet to be aired so I had a lot of spoilers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-06 05:22:30	I guess I need to learn internet etiquette. A large number of my friends are mad about me posting Walking Dead spoilers.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-05 05:10:08	Kobe in a mask is fitting. After all the Fakers are a bunch of criminals

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-02 04:51:39	What is the point of an investigation when Hawaii has a privacy law that shields birth certificates from release without person's consent
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-02 04:47:49	I wasn't aware that Maricopa County was now crime free thus allowing Joe Arpaio to waste tax money looking at birth certificates
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-02 02:30:10	Forget drug test for welfare we need to start drug testing before you can submit a Nash trade rumor...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-02 01:09:42	Whats with all these fake celebrity twitter accounts? Don't people have better things to do than pretend to be a celeb? #NoCheckNoFollow

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-01 09:30:25	it's always scary when you take off your shoe and have a bloody sock
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-01 05:10:36	@mosa77 He was way to young had to only be 65ish... Loved his music
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-03-01 04:55:27	Damn,Davy Jones died?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-29 04:41:54	@Hardkore_3 LOL me too...Most of the rumors I've heard however involved either Dudley, Warrick or Lopez but you know how rumors are
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-29 04:29:12	@Hardkore_3 I don't think anybody would trade for him and the Suns probably will end up using amnesty on him next season
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-29 04:22:50	I'm willing to bet we see a few Suns trades before the deadline. Probably contract dumps however
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-29 03:32:22	I have so much energy I just can't sit down today
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-29 03:31:27	@Moran_Brothers New challenge. Here's the basic outline of it http:// lonniesmalley.com/the-300-workou t-and-what-it-can-do-for-you/ …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-29 02:03:38	@Moran_Brothers thinking of pushing the intensity and maybe incorporating the 300 workout. what's up with you?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-28 06:56:07	@yrite4 I always hated those but 3 isn't so bad I guess
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-28 06:23:06	@Hardkore_3 probably something started by some bored sportswriter or fake twitter post. I'd be shocked if Nash ever got traded
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-28 04:31:01	I wonder if @govbrewer really just skipped the White House dinner or if she just wasn't invited after that finger pointing fiasco
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-28 03:45:55	@theAdamGreen @KCBrackley I say he goes in the 7th
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-28 03:31:56	@Moran_Brothers Just watched it. I've been offline for a few days
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-28 01:10:33	Going to go out for a few hours and try my new hydration pack out.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-28 00:48:53	After a short break I'm now back on twitter... I guess I couldn't stay away
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-22 06:45:14	I just ordered online at Five Guys 7th & McDowell! #SkipTheLine http:// gofiveguys.com/Order/Order.as px?VendorId=4128 …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-22 04:01:22	Was checking a NFL mock draft and they had Brock Osweiler as a 2nd round pick. WTF
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-22 00:48:54	@yrite4 Yes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-22 00:22:38	I'm at Complete Family Eye Care - Robert J. Maynard, O.D. (114 W Camelback Rd, Phoenix) http:// 4sq.com/yY4Tjf
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 09:40:19	So now there is a Facebook app that lets you leave a message after you die. Now I've seen everything
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 09:21:52	@purple_n_orange @mosa77 I agree. It's funny I remember him bitching about not many front office options for him. I wonder why...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 09:19:38	@mosa77 With people at ESPN getting fired you never know... His twitter is all kinds of crazy. Hard to believe it's a verified account
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 08:44:42	@ItsaMeMaaario I still believe he be a great player. The Trailblazers medical staff sucks maybe he'll come to Phoenix next year on the cheap
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 08:40:46	I wonder how long until Rex Chapman's twitter ends up costing him some work...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 07:52:51	If your in charge of the Portland Trail Blazers at what point do you fire the medical staff? No player can be this cursed
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 06:34:13	@PhoenixSuns willing the Suns to victory with loud cheering so loud in fact you make their opponents start missing shots
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 05:31:26	@draidayeveryday @abc7 It's an election year so I doubt Obama lets that happen. They'll let us be afraid that it will and then "save us"
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 05:30:09	why is it that every time I find a hat whose design I like it ends up being a snapback
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 05:08:11	@purple_n_orange no need to thank me. Hope your birthday was a fun one especially since the Suns won and the fakers lost
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 03:47:50	My Thoughts on NBC’s New Show Smash, read it here: http:// lonniesmalley.com/?p=993
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-21 03:16:30	@maxmcc11 @MGortat because after the Suns drafted him in the second round they traded him for future cash considerations to the Magic
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-20 06:14:39	@Moran_Brothers my detest for the Lakers almost makes me unfollow you. Just kidding but I do hate the Lakers...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-20 06:11:22	Happy Birthday @purple_n_orange if you're not following any should he's one of the coolest guys on twitter and a major Suns fan
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-20 06:08:13	@mosa77 yes it really works I learned that when I played college ball you drink about 6 ounces
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-20 06:05:50	I need to get some pickle juice these leg cramps are ridiculous
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-20 05:56:52	I was shocked to learn that the Koala could be added to the list of endangered species: http:// lonniesmalley.com/?p=987
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-19 11:21:03	@JohnBaxter13 That's 7 more days than you right?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-19 09:34:22	Why Did They Have To Bring The Snapback Hat Back? Read my blog post about it here: http:// lonniesmalley.com/?p=983
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-19 05:46:51	It's hard trying to get back into the habit of working after taking such a long break
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-18 08:25:10	@KCBrackley If you want but I think Suns get the W tonight
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-18 08:22:38	I'm hoping Gortat will show everyone why he should have been an All Star instead of Bynum. Unleash the Polish Hammer
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-18 08:17:56	Weird that I haven't seen any tweets from @Luck_The_Fakers Step your game up it's Suns and Lakers tonight!
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-18 08:15:13	@scottwill42 I would say Metta World Peace, Luke Walton, Jason Kapono, Derek Fisher and Steve Blake not sure who #6 would be however
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-18 07:48:47	I'm not sure why but I'm taking great pleasure in watching one of my drunk neighbors attempted to catch a feral cat
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-18 02:00:36	Back in the day being an entrepreneur meant something. Nowadays it just means you're unemployed without any job prospects
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-17 12:05:28	Suns need a legit scorer. Even with all the headaches it may cause I'm surprised we haven't called A.I.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-17 11:58:17	Been feeling like it's supposed to rain all day and still nothing. Come on and hurry up sky I hate this knee pain
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-17 11:54:53	@PHXSuns6thMan Maybe that's what they're planning. When can he be traded?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-17 11:33:47	@PHXSuns6thMan I'd actually like to see the Suns pick him up. He's very athletic and has tons of upside
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-17 08:39:28	Wonder when Obama steps in to lower gas prices... It's an election year after all
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-17 06:52:04	Dunk contest looks crappy this year
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-17 06:41:36	You know I'm not a violent person. Except when I get mad & punch people in the face for no reason. Other than that I'm completely nonviolent
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-17 06:26:14	Sometimes I wonder if Sarver is just looking for that point that is between really bad and profitable
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-17 03:18:26	Lunch with wife (@Red Lobster) http:// 4sq.com/A4kNLx
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-17 02:07:02	Always bugs me when people let their kids extremely misbehave in stores. I have 3 and can keep them well behaved in public
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-15 05:06:19	Took my wife for Valentine's Day lunch and movie before the kids get home from school
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-15 00:08:36	Got to the eye doctor early so I'm actually finished before my actual appointment time

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-04 05:13:32	I want Greg Oden to pick me some powerball numbers because with all the bad luck he's had he's due for a major good luck streak
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-04 05:10:50	I never would have believed you a few years ago if you told me the Clippers would get this amount of talent on one team
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-04 05:09:28	I'm starting to believe Greg Oden is cursed or something. These injury's are unreal...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-03 14:22:20	My wife punched my arm. So I texted cowardly "You hit like a girl" to my wife's phone after I was sure she had left left the room.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-01 11:04:00	Some of the Suns fans on here are batshit crazy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-01 10:32:41	@Moran_Brothers Looks good
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-02-01 08:44:50	My cable bill freaked me out today. It said amount due $2,962.67 but then I noticed the negative in front. Still have my credit....

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 09:59:16	@Moran_Brothers Good luck. Hope you feel better 2
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 09:08:57	My mind is blown. I just learned Jack Blacks parents were rocket scientists and worked on the Hubble Space Telescope
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 09:05:19	@ZoDogg34 Ok never saw her. If you were going to say that one was hot I'd say you had issues
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 09:01:53	@ZoDogg34 Um you really think one of his daughters is hot? Then again I haven't seen them all. The one that works there is Jenna Bush Hager
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 08:59:09	@ZoDogg34 Yep so is Bush's daughter
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 08:45:37	Outside the box idea for the Suns. Bring back Oliver Miller he can "fall" on the other teams best player.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 01:02:13	@EspoAZ I hope so he's a class act and deserves it. Great stand up guy unlike so many of today's players
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 00:59:59	@draidayeveryday Except it was a Seattle radio station. Then again I don't think the salaries would work
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 00:58:12	@EspoAZ If it wasn't for all those hamstring injury's KJ would have been in the Hall of Fame
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 00:54:37	@Moran_Brothers Ok great. I'll watch and share it when I get home. Thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 00:53:31	@draidayeveryday what I gather based on the tweets some radio station is saying Nash asked to be traded to LA
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 00:45:37	@purple_n_orange @draidayeveryday that one about the Lakers is so pathetic that part of me thinks there may be some truth to the rumor
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 00:14:44	@JohnBaxter13 @hardkore_3 I think the Suns can do A lot better
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-31 00:04:56	@Moran_Brothers Can you message me when it's up? Thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-30 23:44:18	Happy Monday everyone. It's going to be a great week I can feel it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-30 23:43:35	I think it's funny that Lady La of 101.5 Jamz reads TMZ articles verbatim then adds according to her sources. Why not just give TMZ credit
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-30 23:00:27	Sometimes your the window sometimes your the bug but today I am the squeegee.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-30 12:57:38	Nash is hurt. This is BAD

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-30 05:31:52	My back feels better than yesterday. It just feels like I have a Rambo size knife in it so I'm on the road to recovery
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 08:32:09	@PHXSuns6thMan I agree. At this pint might as well play whoever is hot nothing to lose. Nobody should have guaranteed minutes
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 08:16:57	@PHXSuns6thMan Plus I think they need to give Childress a legit chance and if doesn't work amnesty him at the end of the season
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 08:14:37	I wanna see a starting lineup of Nash, Redd, Gortat, Morris and Childress
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 07:52:05	@purple_n_orange @jmcpeek I agree, I think it's awesome he offered to give you the literal shirt off his back
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 07:48:53	@purple_n_orange Did @jmcpeek ever send you that one he said you could have?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 07:36:09	@purple_n_orange I know right. If I wasn't so tore up from my back I'd have gone. Esp. since they were great seats...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 07:33:13	@purple_n_orange It was actually a little hard to give the tickets away people kept turning them down. LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 07:31:02	Amazing how much Vicodin helps with my back pain...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 07:28:58	@purple_n_orange Same for me. I was going to go but totally forgot about it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 07:26:33	@JohnBaxter13 Ok I have someone in mind to give them 2. I will make the next one I promise just a lot going on
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 07:12:53	Trying to figure out how to do a movie review of a film I fell asleep watching because it sucked so bad
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 07:07:44	@PHXSuns6thMan @KCBrackley I went to Frys today and a lady actually parked on the sidewalk while she went in to buy ice
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 07:02:27	@JohnBaxter13 I forgot you gave me tickets. I don't know if I can make the game
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 06:59:21	@KCBrackley I hate the people who block the lane waiting for a close parking spot instead of taking the extra 20 steps
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-29 04:01:29	@SunsofPHXfan because he's injury prone

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-28 16:30:20	@Hardkore_3 Me 2 except I've had it for almost a year. My wife forbids me from having it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-28 13:44:34	I wonder how Aaron Brooks is doing?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-28 13:35:20	@draidayeveryday @AAnnddrreee @SteveNash If he really wanted the team to get better that's the only way
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-28 13:32:39	@PHXSuns6thMan That could also be a bad thing....
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-28 13:26:50	@EspoAZ More like the empty cardboard box the nails were in. At this point they can only aspire to be the nail
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-28 12:41:10	On the bright side Suns fans at least we're not the Wizards
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-28 12:38:57	@PHXSuns6thMan No I mean he seemed off and even a bit stiff
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-28 12:37:42	Nash must be hurt.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-28 12:34:37	To bad this isn't the NFL with Suck For Luck because then this would make sense to me
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-28 12:32:25	@JohnBaxter13 @erinland20 Suns game that bad to watch in person that you got drunk?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-26 06:27:55	@Moran_Brothers @BunnyBridget why would anyone unless they had an allergy to it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-26 03:51:41	I'm feeling really embarrassed right now. I didn't realize my face could turn that shade of red
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-25 14:15:39	@ZoDogg34 Oh I agree with that. Let me rephrase it. Without a Nash IN HIS PRIME and a lot of good outside shooters it will not work
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-25 14:10:15	@ZoDogg34 No team will ever win a title with this style of play. If it clicks it's fun to watch but won't get past grinding teams
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-25 14:09:11	@KCBrackley Thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-25 14:08:56	@KCBrackley Sounds good I just need someone good til I get back surgery.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-25 14:04:40	@KCBrackley If they are good I am willing to go as far as AJ
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-25 14:04:10	The D'antoni styled offense the Suns have been using in the Nash era is flawed. They need to start working on all around game not just O

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-25 04:50:23	@PHXSuns6thMan That's why they should trade him now
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-25 04:41:54	@purple_n_orange @azcsports @PaulCoro If only he'd take his contract year as serious as Amare did
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-25 04:27:36	At least 3 times a week while on my regular walk the same guy comes up to me and asks for $ saying he just ran out of gas.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-25 01:38:14	I bet Flip Saunders is happy to be free from Washington
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 10:04:46	@SunsKayte Yep @realgranthill33 is nowhere near over the hill yet
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 08:00:00	@PHXSuns6thMan When he gets ring #2
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 07:23:24	@purple_n_orange Other than she's a scary looking chick
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 07:21:56	@purple_n_orange My wife hates me getting UPS because the UPS chick is always trying to get me to go out for drinks with her after work
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 07:19:33	@purple_n_orange I hate it too. I'm always the last stop of the day and the driver always tends to creep me out a bit
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 06:55:45	Trying to figure out google plus.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 06:36:20	@mosa77 Actually I'm great at Math LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 06:20:11	He's in kindergarten should've given a day notice so we could do the shopping.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 06:19:04	My kindergartners teacher sent home today and due tomorrow an assignment that calls for 13 different types of craft material. #sucks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 05:20:54	I remember going to Metrocenter as a kid. It must have really gotten run down to have had sold for only $12.2 million
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 04:26:12	Catholic Healthcare West became Dignity Health. Wonder if that means St. Josephs will change their name now that it's no longer Catholic
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 03:56:53	I must be weird because Monday is my favorite day of the week. So peaceful when the kids are at school
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-24 03:50:51	In a good mood for the first time in awhile. Just got back from a LONG walk.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-23 03:45:04	If it's Football Sunday and the Cards aren't playing it feels kinda pointless to watch
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-23 03:41:22	Sad but necessary that Gabby Giffords is stepping down. At least by waiting this long she gets her pension. #goodluck
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-23 02:37:57	@davis8207 I respect the 49ers game so they're ok with me. I however can never root for Eli after his draft day temper tantrum
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-23 02:28:38	I don't care who wins the Superbowl this year. I just don't want the Giants to play in it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-23 02:27:28	@yrite4 Is he actually dead this time or twitter dead? Be weird if he walked into his own funeral
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-22 08:48:48	@scottwill42 Not really. They were reportedly having issues when she wanted to adopt after meeting Sandra Bullock's kid & he didn't
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-22 08:46:16	Stat needs to stop chucking up shots and go to the basket
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-22 06:03:32	@draidayeveryday Wife got it today. Thanks again
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-22 05:47:49	It took many hours of listening and rating but I now rarely hear a song I dislike on pandora
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-22 05:44:05	I hate the Giants! I hope they get knocked off this week.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-22 04:02:23	Seriously considering heading over to urgent care today to try to get some pain meds for my back.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-21 08:21:19	Starting to get bored with twitter
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-20 12:36:14	Just filed my Federal taxes now gotta do my state
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-20 09:47:13	@draidayeveryday Any reasonable person would
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-20 09:42:45	@draidayeveryday That sucks! Was it coming from Seattle and the snow delayed it? They usually issue a credit if you complain enough
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-20 09:34:02	I wonder if they'll be arresting Swizz Beatz soon as part of the Megaupload arrests
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-20 09:28:01	@draidayeveryday They always make me the last stop of the day and come at like 7:30pm
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-20 05:28:09	@Moran_Brothers Actually they say it leveled off in the last 3 years but it may be due to a rise in obesity related deaths....
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-20 05:26:06	@mosa77 That's another great point. They should have to give a discount for taking up so much time
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-20 05:25:15	Overheard a lady ask her maybe 5 year old son what he did today a& he said "Dad took me to a place called the hood and we bought weeds"
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-20 01:26:39	Why do doctors even make you get an appointment if it always takes them over an hour after the appointment time to see you
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 10:24:14	My back is creaking & popping pretty loud maybe I should spray it with WD-40
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 07:08:30	So the cruise ship captain of the Costa Concordia says he didn't abandon ship. He tripped and fell into a life boat
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 06:56:32	@JohnBaxter13 you had me for a sec
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 05:25:55	I always forget we have a hockey team here in Arizona. One of these days I may have to go watch them play
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 05:13:47	Google should have wen't the Wikipedia route and completely blacked out the entire day. Reps would've caved in hours... #Sopa
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 05:07:09	@NewMario2010 They may need more than that but it's a start
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 05:05:48	@purple_n_orange @Hardkore_3 Let's make it really creepy and get all your followers to do it. Like a cult of Jason....
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 05:04:36	LOL I meant unfollowing wtf Auto correct. What the hell is nollowing
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 05:03:19	@Hardkore_3 @purple_n_orange LOL next thing you know you'll have his pic as your avi
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 05:02:39	I'm going to start unollowing these people who use twitlonger for every tweet. You don't need your life story in every tweet
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 04:55:55	I wonder if Rob Lowe was Harold Campings end of the world source...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 04:53:19	@Hardkore_3 I'm going to have to try that one. I'd probably just get blocked
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 04:51:58	Watched ALCATRAZ on FOX off the DVR it was pretty good
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 04:48:32	Why do people beg celebrities for a dumb ass retweet?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 04:26:53	@draidayeveryday OK I mean *IF ... I actually hope the 49ers win
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 04:22:03	@PHXSuns6thMan Then no matter how they lose it's his fault
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 04:21:12	@EW I already have and it sucked
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 03:55:17	@purple_n_orange just wait till we get to grandma's with tramp stamps
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 03:53:16	Still can't get used to the name Waste Management Phoenix Open. Probably would have been better to let the next sponsor on the list name it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 03:50:32	Who has better numbers tonight Gortat or Amare?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 02:44:28	Lets stop SOPA http:// lonniesmalley.com/call/sopa.php
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 02:23:21	The best thing about the Suns struggling right now is that a lot of Suns merchandise is marked way down and tickets are easy to get #Score
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 02:21:53	@PHXSuns6thMan Because he never had one to begin with
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-19 02:20:38	It's kinda sad but after the way they lost to the Bulls I wanna root for the Suns more. Gotta love an underdog
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 13:21:18	@draidayeveryday If I'm not mistaken they only have to follow the laws of port it's birthed.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 12:07:24	If the Suns can't trade Nash to a contender they need to offer the guy a buyout. He deserves better
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 11:01:45	I gotta find someone to take this rabbit. I really don't want it anymore and the kids don't take care of it.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 08:09:01	@JohnBaxter13 The plate or some bacon?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 07:28:05	So now McDonald'ss has McProstitutes? Hope hope she was at least trying to get a 20-piece
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 07:01:20	@JohnBaxter13 Saw your TV appearance LOL. So they're letting you be an extra now as well?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 06:52:06	Wikipedia goes down for 24 hours tonight in protest SOPA so all you copy and paste school kids better get busy stealing your homework
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 06:47:57	@DudleyJSPN ME! Time to get the W #GoSuns
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 06:45:35	@KCBrackley I spent that in like 2 days. LOL
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 06:26:31	@Moran_Brothers Happy Birthday Quincy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 06:25:23	I blame most twitter errors on auto correct
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 06:07:00	@purple_n_orange Yep. At least I don't have to spend much on my car because my Dad and brothers have an auto shop so cheap work for me
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 06:02:36	@purple_n_orange Could be worse. I'm planning on using mine for the dentist and wife's bills
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 05:52:02	@purple_n_orange Other than the Flux Capacitor that shouldn't be that bad as far as $$
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 05:48:49	@purple_n_orange What's wrong with your car?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 05:28:12	@KCBrackley Illegal as in go to jail or just pay a fine?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 05:23:12	@KCBrackley what about the sumo's
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 05:21:12	According to the FDA walnuts are drugs? That's crazy! http://www. thenewamerican.com/usnews/health- care/8294-walnuts-are-drugs-says-fda …
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 05:00:11	I wish they made phone keyboards for people with fat fingers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 04:23:45	I love the omelet maker we got for Christmas
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 03:40:11	@purple_n_orange he'd never come to AZ because he'd get killed. I hope he retires
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 03:34:49	@purple_n_orange I just think this team needs a few W's to get some confidence. They're starting to look like they don't think they can win
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-18 03:31:47	Kinda glad Derrick Rose.isn't supposed to play tonight. Still gonna be tough to get the win #GoSuns
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 11:42:05	@PHXSuns6thMan In December. Like right before Christmas
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 11:23:15	Had to start using my bodymedia fit again.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 11:13:24	@draidayeveryday Thanks
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 11:05:14	@PHXSuns6thMan Actually it's 4.0.3
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 11:02:17	@draidayeveryday She loves Nash. She would love it...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 10:19:34	@PHXSuns6thMan Mine did that until I got all of my firmware update.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 10:11:19	@draidayeveryday @the_real_sunz @PHXSuns6thMan @purple_n_orange my wife does
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 10:03:21	Thinking of getting a Gortat jersey
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 07:22:41	My brain hurts from writing so much code today.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 07:14:14	@Moran_Brothers That's fine.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 07:08:56	@Moran_Brothers sure
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 06:09:11	@PHXSuns6thMan @draidayeveryday @purple_n_orange @the_real_sunz You sure it w Coro? Don't see it on his FB
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 05:37:45	@Moran_Brothers Just watched it
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-17 01:18:37	Today would have been my mom's 65th birthday
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-16 11:11:05	Suns are going to need to make a few moves in the next few weeks to help long term
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-16 11:00:39	Go Suns
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-16 10:46:53	@Moran_Brothers Did he ever show?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-16 08:39:00	Seems like every team I root for ends up losing
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-15 09:10:18	Come on Saints
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-15 08:25:38	@Moran_Brothers Half or full court?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-15 06:52:23	If you have a good QB you're never really out of a game
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-15 01:25:03	I'm at Phoenix Zoo Gnome House (Phoenix) http:// 4sq.com/yKa6TF

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 11:33:06	Come on Suns...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 07:52:06	Kinda odd that it's a game day and @jmcpeek isn't tweeting
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 06:45:49	@KCBrackley I think it will if we move Dudley to the bench and get a better backup center
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 06:43:55	@KCBrackley What's really bold is I say 6th seed
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 06:42:32	Weird that A few dentists start following me on twitter then I get this major toothache...coincidence or something more?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 06:37:13	I still say the Suns will make the playoffs this year
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 06:35:44	@PhoenixSuns last 30or so Suns games I've went to have all been Suns losses I probably should avoid them on Friday the 13th #SunsQuestion .
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 06:09:46	@purple_n_orange Congrats
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 05:24:12	Apparently the Atlanta Hawks are shopping Jeff Teague and Josh Smith. I'd love it if the Suns could land Smith
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 05:14:43	@KCBrackley Why do they call it " hot n ready pizza" if everyone always has to wait on them
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 02:41:34	@JohnBaxter13 if that's you then you better be careful and not fall like you always do when you climb a tree
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 02:21:11	This is definitely the Year of the Injury in the NBA. I've never seen it like this before....
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-14 02:15:43	All these channels and nothings on TV
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 10:00:49	@PHXSuns6thMan Me too
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 09:42:27	@purple_n_orange What you thought you'd have to watch hockey?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 09:41:52	@Moran_Brothers Fakers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 09:02:14	@purple_n_orange Thanks for the Suns PSA
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 05:24:56	@KCBrackley That's what I thought when I saw the trailer but the film itself just makes your head hurt
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 04:42:26	@PhoenixSuns I expect it to be raining 3's #SunsVsCavs
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 04:35:48	Had the opportunity to screen The Grey staring Liam Neeson. So glad I didn't have to pay money to see it or I'd have been mad
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 04:19:58	I'd love to see @SteveNash take as many shots as Kobe does just once
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 04:18:16	@Moran_Brothers I saw you guys created a ustream any word on the show?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 03:55:13	@purple_n_orange @JohnBaxter13 his TV show came out of hiatus so he's busy in Oregon. Which means Suns tickets for me (hopefully)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 03:51:35	@JohnBaxter13 Thanks for the tickets
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 03:51:15	My 5 year old son want's to play for the Suns when he grows up or be a UFC fighter. Yep he's a typical boy
66619679	fluffybipolar	2012-01-13 03:46:33	I usually vote for every Phoenix Suns player on the All Star Ballot but this year I'm only going with Nash
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-26 07:09:02	@Moran_Brothers I just have a feeling it's going to happen
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-26 05:03:45	I think Auburn gets the upset and beats Alabama.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-26 03:30:45	I can't believe how fast this years gone by.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-26 02:12:52	I feel like it might be time to #occupy the gym

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-24 11:29:19	@ErinLand20 You forgot to mention it's a foot long...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-24 10:19:17	@jmcpeek Gotta go with pumpkin
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-24 06:11:44	@JohnBaxter13 I do to but When someone sends you 10 Dm's it kinda messes you up
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-24 05:56:04	Hey @JohnBaxter13 stop it. I keep getting DM and Tweets mixed up...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-24 05:51:45	@JohnBaxter13 True but If the pilgrims had shot wildcats instead of turkeys we'd all be eating pussy on Thanksgiving.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-24 05:30:34	I gotta stop hating on the 49ers because when I do they win... I guess I'll say go 49ers?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-24 05:28:48	Josh McCown to Bears and Orton to KC? Didn't see that happening...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-23 23:50:30	Asked my child if they understand what Thanksgiving is. They said it's when we give thanks to Jesus's pet turkey...I'll take that as a no
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-23 23:44:29	You know a place is ghetto when it advertises free wi-fi but what they actually have is the signal from a nearby business

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-19 05:16:22	@MnaceIISobriety can't remember who it was but they got busted after somebody recognized their deceased nephews picture being used
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-19 05:14:54	@MnaceIISobriety I remember a while back somebody got like a 100k with give forward and it was all a hoax. They don't verify anything...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-19 03:47:44	@MnaceIISobriety I'll give them til the next bill before I get mad...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-19 03:46:26	Kinda sucks that I had to pay my cable bill today. I wonder when my free year I won will start because I haven't heard back...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-19 03:14:18	@MnaceIISobriety @NewMario2010 Ok. Always looking to follow more Cards fans...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-19 03:01:13	@draidayeveryday Oh, you think the Cardinals will win by more? I was just being conservative with my prediction. :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-19 02:57:20	My prediction is Cardinals 24 49ers 17.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-19 02:55:19	@JohnBaxter13 That's cool. If you can get my wife Keisa his autograph she likes him
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-19 01:24:55	At the store today everyone working had on Christmas themed costumes. What happened to Thanksgiving? Did I miss it?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-19 01:16:30	@Moran_Brothers why is that?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-18 13:16:50	@Moran_Brothers Thanks for the s/o

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-18 08:44:19	I love all the Thanksgiving sales at the grocery stores. I'm probably going to end up sick of turkey this year...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-18 08:37:03	Wish the Suns could find another player like @DanMajerle after the lockout. My favorite Sun of all time...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-16 06:07:36	Then again it would be nice if I could afford Suns season tickets again...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-16 06:04:29	30% Off Select Suns Season Tickets...I'd think they'd be more worried about making sure they were having a season first.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-16 05:59:18	@davis8207 LOL no Don't know what the heck is going on. My twitters been doing that to like 4 people

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-16 05:07:47	@maxmcc11 If that senerio occured it would be a nightmare with 5 or 6 "superteams" and 20 somethings that suck
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-16 05:06:13	@maxmcc11 I think he's bluffing too but the language in every NBA contract actually allows it if there is no union
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-16 05:03:35	@maxmcc11 Stern said that if union disbands NBA will void all contracts. My question is does that mean they would be FA when union reformed
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-16 03:44:02	If decertification of the Union occurs all NBA players would be free agents since the contracts would be voided?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-16 03:31:32	@BunnyBridget All I can help with is the alcohol

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-15 07:18:04	what's with twitter trying "Killing OFF" random celebrities each day? Bunch of dumb sickos
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-15 07:13:08	Cards fans if Matt Leinart plays like he's the second coming of Tom Brady will you start to doubt coach Whiz?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-15 06:34:27	I bet we'd be watching games tonight if an ex-player like say Magic Johnson was the NBA commissioner instead of David Stern
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-15 05:01:59	As the NBA lockout drags on I wonder who will be the first NBA player arrested for not paying child support.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-15 04:11:19	Both sides are just to greedy! Is this really the time to fight about how many millions you will make when many fans are out of work?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-15 04:02:38	Fans need to be sure to avoid anything that benefits NBA owners or players financially during the lockout
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-15 03:46:10	Looks like the lockout might end Nash and Hills careers. If that's the case can it please take Kobe too
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-15 03:43:02	At this point I'm willing to pay to watch replacement players in the NBA. I just want to see basketball without all the money drama

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-11 09:55:37	@iNorthVayne @davis8207 If you reach that point expect a lot of unfollows
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-11 07:42:21	Congratulations you win our contest. Unfortunately we have no idea when you get your prize. It will be between now and next November.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-11 03:59:57	Over the past week I've gotten over 30 emails from psychics who want to help me reach my recently deceased mom. #ihatethesepeople
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-11 02:33:53	@draidayeveryday That's really funny the niners going to the Superbowl. Funnest thing ever :P
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-11 02:07:24	Many NFL players play games with broken bones & torn muscles but our "Franchise QB" will miss his 2nd game because of turf toe
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-11 00:52:04	He left the 10 year old with the guy who was assaulting him and didn't even tell anyone til the next day and he doesn't get fired WTF

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-10 09:35:42	Dear @nba just put David Stern and Billy Hunter in the UFC octagon and have them fight it out to decide who gets what
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-10 09:18:42	@JohnBaxter13 I saw a current pic of you on Facebook so I'm thinking half
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-10 09:00:12	@JohnBaxter13 No Problem? I thought you were done with twitter forever after they banned you

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-09 09:07:43	@LarryFitzgerald thank you for all you do to fight cancer. Just lost my mom to cancer & know 1 day it'll be cured because of people like you
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-09 07:05:41	So the reason reporters claimed the Bulls had no rep is Boozer and Noah both skipped it but sent John Lucas III in place
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-09 06:45:50	20 kids WTF? Are the Duggar's trying to get on Hoarders?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-09 06:44:37	I wonder if they just look for a pic online and play the who is missing game...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-09 06:43:39	So weird that depending on what news outlet you trust it was either Chicago or Boston who didn't have a rep today. Don't they check facts?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-09 06:34:08	@PHXSuns6thMan @MnaceIISobriety Actually it was the Bulls
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-09 06:15:58	I just want to watch basketball. Maybe the owners will bring in replacement players.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-09 06:05:52	@PHXSuns6thMan I kinda expected that for awhile. I also think this will be how Nash and Hill's careers end...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-09 05:49:18	BTW thanks to everyone who helped me win the contest
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-09 05:34:07	Just found out I won a year of free cable, internet, and home phone service. That made me cheerup a bit
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-09 03:30:44	Albert Haynesworth still has a lot of game left just needs to find a team that runs the 4-3 defense
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-08 13:29:50	That story on teens getting drunk on vodka-soaked tampons is just insane
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-07 13:18:45	@Moran_Brothers That sucks. I'll pass it along to people who may replace it for a video shoutout
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-07 11:13:45	Was shocked to learn they sell Oregon trail for the Nintendo DS. Gotta get it for my kids and see if it's like the one I played as a kid
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-07 08:29:49	It's like neither team knows how to win
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-07 06:59:46	Larry Fitzgerald looking like just an average player this year now that the Cardinals don't have other options to keep defenses honest
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-07 06:44:53	This game is putting me to sleep. Come on Cardinals
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-07 03:23:56	Gotta make some $$ ASAP.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-06 13:52:14	@davis8207 Not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing but worst case scenario all we get is another loss
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-06 13:47:32	Been out of it last few days... Did the Cardinals ever announced who's starting at QB tomorrow?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-04 14:01:50	had no idea how expensive funerals are

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-04 04:05:22	Time to pull myself back together
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-03 09:44:03	@davis8207 Thanks I'm still in shock even though I knew it was coming. Just don't realize what it's like til it happens
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-03 09:41:02	After a long battle with cancer my Mom passed away today. So many emotions but mostly I just miss my Mom...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-03 05:46:02	Got my free Breaking Bad DVD set in the mail. Thinking of seeing what I can get if I trade it in at Bookmans...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-03 04:54:56	Maybe fans need to start picketing outside arenas with signs saying "Let them play" I want the NBA back...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-03 04:48:46	Maybe have owners play out the season via video games...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-03 04:47:00	Or if they use the same position as last years draft Cleveland's going to be really good...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-03 04:45:58	If every NBA team gets an equal shot via ping pong balls some of those trades made the last 4 years may look really awful for some teams
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-03 04:43:03	If the entire NBA season is cancelled how will they determine who gets what pick in the NBA draft?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-03 03:23:40	Oliver Miller might get up to nine years in jail. That's why you don't act like a fool especially when you have a gun on you.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-03 02:09:32	@MnaceIISobriety I don't know either but I can't help but wonder how much that person's day must suck if a twitter RT is the highlight
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-02 14:05:42	@PHXSuns6thMan It's alright but a little overpriced IMO... BTW if you watch Netflix Instant it doesn't work on it...

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-02 10:30:07	@MnaceIISobriety Especially someone who went undrafted in the NFL despite talent because they were considered self destructive...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-02 10:05:44	So a 19 year old in California has filed a lawsuit against Justin Bieber paternity. If it's true wouldn't that be statutory rape?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-11-02 07:16:46	What's with all these people wanting Skelton to start? Do they really think he's better than Kolb?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 09:13:10	@davis8207 Nah man, I knew how it was meant and respect your opinions even if they're not the same as my own...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 08:40:09	@davis8207 Is that his fault or the Gm's? Can't hate on a guy giving it his all but just doesn't have the talent to be a real starter
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 08:36:04	@davis8207 so basically you're saying you expect an undrafted 2nd year player to play like he belongs in the Pro Bowl? UMM ok...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 08:32:11	Cards will turn it around next week against the Rams. Hopefully it's an opportunity to right the ship and the start of a winning streak
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 08:27:51	My fantasy football team has went from worst to second place after my major roster overhaul
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 08:24:36	@davis8207 He played well for what he is a bench player at best who was put into a major role on the team.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 08:20:33	Really? @davis8207 what you expecting out of a 2nd year undrafted player? It's not his fault we're that weak at his position...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 05:40:39	On the bright side Cardinals fans at least we're not the Miami Dolphins...Also Carolina fans can talk crap about us...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 05:17:23	Anybody else glad we held in there and at least didn't give up this year's first-round pick for Kolb? That really would have been bad
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 05:01:01	@MnaceIISobriety that's why if you do get the pick you trade it for a boatload of players
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 05:00:10	The Cards are making improvements and it was a tough loss.Win or Lose I'm still proud to be a fan of this team #BIRDGANG
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 04:20:55	This is a good team that just can't find a way to actually win games
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 03:58:49	Come on Cardinals defense we need a big play
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 03:56:54	@davis8207 it looks like we're going to be seeing a lot of one word tweets in your future
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 02:50:40	Please don't choke Cards. We need this win
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-31 02:15:56	It's great the Cardinals are winning but it's a little early to be saying the game is over because we do have a history of collapsing

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-27 05:44:22	@davis8207 I'm not a fan either but face it this team needs more talent if Kolb is going to work at QB.Best QB available this off-season
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-27 05:32:31	@davis8207 not really I mean at least this year most of our losses are winnable games.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-04 05:04:02	@draidayeveryday I don't see the 49ers taking it because I'm betting the finish 7-9. Cards won't either however if we lose this weekend
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-10-04 04:52:30	I still think the cards have a chance to win the NFC West. Still say .500 wins it. But next game is a MUST win

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-31 12:32:56	Trying to decide if the Diamondbacks are for real or just pretenders. Love the team but thinking Dbacks are overachieving
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-31 06:51:47	@Nashoholic Who do you think wins it all? Dallas or Miami? I'm picking Dallas just because I don't want super teams to catch on
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-31 06:49:10	@MyTrainerBob Sometimes I hate you. Your workout kills me man. Thanks :)
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-31 06:48:04	@Nashoholic Agreed. They should have started Sunday IMO
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-31 05:49:28	Both the KKK and Westboro Baptist Church are protesting at Arlington Cemetery. Is it wrong to hope they have a battle to the death?

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-30 12:52:50	@purple_n_orange Remember when Gabrielle Gifford was shot. All of twitter said she was dead. If it's here it's 50/50 true
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-30 12:50:20	@purple_n_orange if he was wouldn't it be on Miami Heral's site or tmz?
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-30 12:19:35	Sean Kingston in critical condition after a jet ski accident. Those things are dangerous if you don't know how to use them

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-23 02:50:58	So has anyone heard from Harold Camping? I bet he's hiding in some bunker pretending he was ruptured. No doubt he's embarrassed.
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-23 02:43:05	@purple_n_orange I do that all the time if I don't have anyone else in the car because I'm too cheap to use the A/C.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-21 14:03:26	I wonder if the nuts who gave Family Radio/Harold Camping millions to talk about the end of the world can sue for fraud come May 22nd
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-21 13:22:59	I'm willing to bet tonight at least a 1000 people who haven't said a prayer in years say on just to be safe...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-21 13:03:51	LOL my friend in Hawaii messaged me and asked if Jesus came because they just had an earthquake. I'm tempted to ignore it and freak them out

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-21 10:24:32	@purple_n_orange Should have put it on craigslist. LOL or gave it to charity. I seem to get a call once a week asking for donations
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-21 10:17:35	@purple_n_orange Or they don't want to bother with it because of the Rapture tomorrow they figure not worth the effort. LOL

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-21 07:41:54	@purple_n_orange Dammit you should have started your tweet with a spoiler warning. I guess I should go ahead and pay my cell phone bill now
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-21 06:19:39	Was reading about Harold Camping and the May 21st rapture and I gotta say he makes @charliesheen look sane.

66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-21 05:29:34	@jmcpeek His passing was a shock. I only met him once. Kinda wish I would have bumped into him on set when I worked on Ready to Rumble
66619679	fluffybipolar	2011-05-21 05:02:18	@BodyMedia I did but they said I need the package and I already tossed it. I think I'll just try to glue it back on

66619679	fluffybipolar	2010-04-11 08:12:54	I need to up my energy levels during my workouts this is just so pathetic
66619679	fluffybipolar	2010-04-11 06:04:22	@weightlossPMA I just started Insanity & I feel like I died but in a good way...I'm going 2 get the power90 because they say its 4 beginers
66619679	fluffybipolar	2010-04-11 04:41:25	Almost time to get some new clothes because mine are getting to big...
66619679	fluffybipolar	2010-04-11 04:33:43	@edoeding I know it is but when I get power 90 I probably will put Insanity up til I can handle it better. But 4 now I'll give it a go
66619679	fluffybipolar	2010-04-11 04:17:46	@edoeding I plan on it because 4 different people have told me it's the one I should start on. I need something to do on non gym days
66619679	fluffybipolar	2010-04-11 04:10:57	@edoeding i plan ordering the power 90 this week

66619679	fluffybipolar	2010-04-11 04:04:44	@edoeding I know but survived my 1st workout...II got insanity for free from a friend who got it and never used it cause it looked 2 hard
