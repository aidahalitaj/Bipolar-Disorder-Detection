394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-09-03 06:13:59	@leah_michal I'm leaning more towards thinking it disables me, especially when depressed, anxious, panicky, also my memory is shot
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-09-03 06:10:07	@SparklyErinS do u take diazipam when needed??

394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-31 04:12:19	@SparklyErinS what side effects r u havin
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-31 04:00:17	@SparklyErinS docs never told me this when they prescribed the meds
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-31 03:59:51	@SparklyErinS what's struck me recently is how bipolar shortens your life expectancy & taking antipsychotic is partly to blame
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-31 03:29:31	@SparklyErinS always questioning, should I be taking my meds? I think I can survive without them, doc thinks otherwise
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-31 03:20:49	@SparklyErinS I've really been messing with my illness the past 6wks, been missing my meds & boozing.
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-31 02:34:16	@SparklyErinS I know that feeling. I'm constantly fighting against my diagnosis
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-30 22:58:57	@borderlion no problem. I am fine today, 1st day back @work after being off for 2wks, the day is never ending

394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 05:15:16	@pup_ear_nibbles off 2 bed. Nice talking 2 u
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 05:01:35	@pup_ear_nibbles I find chatting to people on twitter helps. It's good to talk 2 someone who's experiencing the same things as me
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 04:59:35	@pup_ear_nibbles not good at meeting new people
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 04:58:57	@pup_ear_nibbles definitely have a problem. I drink to oblivion, have no recollection of my nights out. Not good
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 04:57:48	@pup_ear_nibbles lost my driving licence because of the demon drink
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 04:57:09	@pup_ear_nibbles problem I have is everyone I associate with is a drinker
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 04:56:08	@pup_ear_nibbles I have been 2 some alcohol councilor
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 04:55:38	@pup_ear_nibbles that's the answer. I haven't got money 2 burn so stop spending it on booze
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 04:53:33	@pup_ear_nibbles not got many pennies, so could do without pissing it up the wall
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 04:48:29	@pup_ear_nibbles it's a waste of money as well
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 04:47:50	@pup_ear_nibbles for good??
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-08-29 04:46:52	@pup_ear_nibbles I know I keep saying it, but after tonight that's it for a few weeks

394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-06-13 06:04:59	Was feeling a little depressed in the morning this weekend & that's without a drink. Best 2 stay off the booze for the time being
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-06-13 06:01:54	@BipolarTweets that was meant to say give up
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-06-13 06:01:17	15 days off the #alcohol & going strong. Think I may actually give drinking on my own in the house
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-06-06 19:45:19	I didn't touch a drop 2/2
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-06-06 19:45:03	Well I did it, I managed to survive a weekend without #alcohol even though it was perfect weather for sitting outside with a drink 1/2

394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-27 18:17:47	Woke up this morning and was filled with dread at the thought of going in work, then I realised I was off
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-27 18:16:44	Off work, so just chilling with a brew & some foo fighters. Woke up #depressed but have been playing air guitar to the foos

394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-18 05:01:53	Realised today that my problems stem from how I'm thinking about myself
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-10 05:56:32	Thought just drove my mood down and down and down til I was rock bottom 2/2
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-10 05:55:58	It surprised me how fast I went into meltdown culminating in putting a noose over my head. I remember feeling down, then thought after 1/2

394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-09 19:50:28	Although I'll talk on twitter, I've decided to keep shut about my illness to friends
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-09 19:48:12	Kicked the drink into touch for the foreseeable future
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-09 19:47:18	Been very negative of late time to start thinking positive
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-09 00:32:59	Son is out and all I want to do is go to bed #depressed
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-09 00:32:20	I've driven my mood down by putting myself down and have sent myself into a #depression
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-08 23:59:09	@Meh_Mind do u want to talk about it??

394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-07 04:21:48	I can see myself killing myself
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-07 00:51:55	Feeling isolated. Even a loner needs company
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-06 19:53:36	Got a very low opinion of myself @present, don't want to socialise with anyone #bipolar #depression
394115606	BipolarTweets	2016-05-06 19:52:30	Been putting myself down & this has driven my mood down #bipolar #depression

394115606	BipolarTweets	2015-07-29 05:05:05	The pathetic response I've had when mentioning sex/porn addiction in #bipolar would suggest I'm in the minority
394115606	BipolarTweets	2015-07-29 01:05:05	I hate myself for looking at porn #bipolar
394115606	BipolarTweets	2015-07-29 01:03:40	@BipolarBlogger do people talk about this aspect of the illness? I'm only talking about it on here because my account is anonymous
394115606	BipolarTweets	2015-07-29 00:59:59	Does anyone become obsessed with sex/porn, when #hypomanic ?? Still feel this is a taboo area when discussing #bipolar

394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-11-21 06:43:22	In church I held a bible in my hands & I could swear it was giving off some energy. While holdin the bible over my head I was singing..
394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-11-21 06:40:58	Also when I was #manic I took the whole family to church this was a rare visit for me, I only go to church for weddings, baptisms & funerals
394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-11-21 06:37:20	Also when I was in the throes of #mania I thought every song on the radio was speaking to me direct, the lyrics seemed so personal

394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-11-21 06:20:02	As you are probably guessing I was obsessed with religion when I was manic
394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-11-21 06:18:39	Another thought I had when I was manic, was we were all gods, if god made us in his image, then we all must be gods

394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-11-21 06:12:06	When I was sectioned due 2 mania, 5yrs ago, I had a thing for numbers. The numbers 2, 3 & 8 had special significance. Read somewhere that..
394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-11-21 06:09:50	When I was sectioned at my most manic, I visualised my family dying in a car crash & I could smell the plane burning #psychotic

394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-10-21 05:31:25	@ritalongtweets would like 2 do Blackpool one day but I think I'm a little bit off that distance @the moment

394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-10-10 06:40:01	@kfrankieskid was a good thing, that my drinking habits were highlighted. I don't drink 2 oblivion anymore
394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-10-10 06:37:00	@kfrankieskid I lost my driving licence for a year, I'm now on a 12 month licence. The experience has given me a wake up call & I drink less
394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-10-10 06:35:49	@kfrankieskid when speaking with my psych doc, I was stupidly open & confessed I drank to oblivion, she referred me 2 an alcohol clinic and
394115606	BipolarTweets	2013-10-10 06:25:35	@kfrankieskid has being diagnosed with bipolar changed your drinking habits?

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-22 06:21:48	On a downer at the moment all I wanna do is sleep
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-22 06:11:55	Whereas with diabetes I'm guessing you treat the illness and you don't have any symptoms
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-22 06:11:08	Treating #Bipolar is often compared with treatin diabetes, which I think is bullshit. I take my meds regular & I still have ups and downs..
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-20 20:53:27	Do I try for a new job or do I stick with my current job? Current job has no pressure & bosses r aware of my condition & make allowances
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-20 20:51:38	Still thinking about trying 2 get a new job in the new year. I know the process will effect my moods, but I can't survive on my current wage

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-18 21:56:43	Why won't people leave me the f#$k alone when I'm depressed. Ggggrrrr
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-18 19:58:04	On a bit of a downer this morning. Today & yesterday got up late, it was an effort to get out of bed
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-18 05:29:17	If I'm gonna do something with my life, it's gotta be now.
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-18 04:34:42	@LEEDSLOINER7 washed the pots earlier & had a knife in my hand & had the dark thoughts again

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-13 05:33:14	@SecretSchizo I constantly doubt my feelings. I sometimes wonder if my feelings are true or a symptom of my mood swings
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-13 03:41:22	@AidanMouellic just taking my meds upstairs
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-13 03:41:00	@AidanMouellic Olanzapine
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-13 03:16:21	“ @SecretSchizo : Hate having to question everything without feeling like I've got a sound answer” I know that feeling all too well
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-13 03:15:47	@AidanMouellic I had a drink of #alcohol & then went 2 bed, only remembered once I was in bed I decided I wasn't goin downstairs 4 them

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-13 03:03:08	Had a knife in my hand the other day and the thought of stabbing someone entered my head. Scary thought
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-07 15:56:21	@garbosmc that's not unusual?? You're kidding right?
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-06 22:18:12	Some days I feel I can take on the world, other days I want to curl up in a corner & hide #Bipolar
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-06 15:58:20	As I've said b4 another thought that troubles me is when I see a hammer, I have the urge 2 smash people's heads in with it
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-11-06 15:53:51	Also I have alot of intrusive thoughts, which haunt me, is this not symptoms of schizophrenia?

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-06 05:03:56	@DrTerryLynch totally agree with the mental shutdown. When depressed I go into my shell & become very quiet
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-06 05:01:01	I chose to be very open @work about illness & have found this is the best policy, bred down a few weeks & people have been sympathetic

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-06 00:06:18	Started the day in low mood. People at work have been asking after me as Im quite open about my illness found that sharing my problem helped

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-05 07:19:21	Went to gym earlier this evening, so not truly at my lowest ebb
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-05 07:03:28	Stigma will always be around with mental illness, personally I can't be truly open with people about my condition
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-05 06:53:18	Not sure if it's good to talk when depressed, today I would much rather be left alone to wallow
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-05 06:52:22	Im beginning to think it was better when nobody knew about my bipolar at work, b4 I was seen as a freak and was left to my own devices
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-05 06:37:21	On a real low today, fleeting thoughts of suicide
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-05 06:31:33	@amynluv I can certainly empathise with you after the shitty day I have had, hopefully tomorrow will be better
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-05 06:26:13	Been down in the doldrums today at work, dong think i said 2 words to anyone, got home & fell asleep, classic depression symptoms
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-04 18:42:22	On a real low today, this is the come down from my boozy weekend. Not touching a drop for the next 3 weeks
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-04 16:21:44	Sometimes wish I had a physical problem instead of mental,life would be so much simpler, I would be more open&honest with a physical problem
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-04 16:19:16	Had the classic line again at work, 'snap out of it'. If it was that easy I wouldn't have had to take 5 months of work sick
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-04 06:40:48	@JulieBipolar personally I don't know where bipolar ends and I begin, struggling to separate the 2

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-04 03:11:57	@helenlp thanks for that. I just feel like I'll be judged by people who don't know the full extent of what it means to live with Bipolar

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-04 01:00:14	https:// twitter.com/bipolartweets/ status/220199815307468801 … is this a valid reason to claim DLA
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-04 00:58:21	Should I apply for DLA? I'm in a dead end job & my condition prevents me from doing something else, that pays more money
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-04 00:55:22	Today I've started my diet yet again. Managed to go for a half hour walk, it's a start. #freshstart #positive
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-04 00:53:13	If I moved jobs my moods would go haywire
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-04 00:52:45	Today I feel like I could do another job, on another day I'd just be happy that I'm employed at all. What do I do? Stay or move?
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-03 06:10:07	@x_Polly_x just remember the low mood will pass
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-03 03:58:55	@PainIntoPeace ive also piled on the pounds, was doin really well goin 2 the gym 3 times a week but have slipped back into over eating
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-03 03:08:32	@PainIntoPeace dont be so hard on yourself, it's not your fault the drugs are making u put on weight
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-02 22:24:50	@brokenmind_ I had a lengthy spell of being well, mainly coz I was goin 2 the gym alot, once that stopped I plummeted into a deep depression
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-02 22:22:02	@MentallyGB same here, don't wanna do anything today except lie on the couch, listenin 2 music
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-07-02 21:56:15	@MaiaLime how do you cope with your anxiety??

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-27 19:51:41	When is the best time to seek help when you're feelin down? I've been #depressed for 2 wks now
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-27 19:50:48	Feelin extremely low at the moment, best way 2 describe it would b a feelin of emptiness
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-27 07:16:22	Not told anyone this but when I see a black person the most horrible names flood my mind #intrusivethoughts how do I stop this?
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-27 06:14:40	Gonna restrict the time I spend using my mobile & browsing the net, I really think I have got a problem
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-27 05:15:16	Think I have OCD issues with my mobile phone & the Internet. Constantly checking email, Facebook, twitter, forums, etc
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-27 05:06:38	Pay day tomorrow. The urge to splurge is unbearable. Need to reign myself in. Fed up with blowing my monthly wage within the first week
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-26 06:05:44	Gonna try and get to the gym tomorrow, kick start a health kick
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-26 05:33:43	A question I really struggle with is where does my personality end and # bipolar start?
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-26 03:35:51	I've managed to finally get my finances straight, but like an idiot I'm already lookin at what I can spend my overdraft on #Bipolar
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-26 03:14:34	@PainIntoPeace When u say Bipolar took 10yrs of your life, what exactly do u mean

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-26 02:25:30	@LEEDSLOINER7 others can't help me, I can only help myself
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-26 02:21:13	@LEEDSLOINER7 nope psychiatrist is a waste of space. I don't truly open up to her
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-26 02:18:11	Feel like I've failed at everything - parenthood, education, career LIFE
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-26 02:14:24	Told friend I couldn't play golf with him this evening, didn't say that it was as a symptom of my #bipolar #stigma

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-26 00:10:14	Don't know whether to contact my #psychiatrist for some help, never found them helpful in the past
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-26 00:08:05	My partner is puttin part of my #depression down to listenin 2 #depechemode can't say I agree

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-26 00:02:19	Feelings of hopelessness, drifting to thoughts of suicide, just want to hide from the world
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-25 23:59:48	Wish I could escape from my brain, not in a good place. Struggled to concentrate @work, nothing going in, kept swapping jobs
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-25 19:56:43	@LEEDSLOINER7 just think people at work r fed up with me bangin on about my #Bipolar

394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-25 06:42:30	Another thing that gets my goat is when people have a go at me for sleeping to much, I can't help it I'm #depressed
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-25 06:16:25	When people ask me tomorrow. "how's your weekend been?", I cant answer "shit, because of my bipolar", u can't be honest with mental illness
394115606	BipolarTweets	2012-06-25 05:37:31	@PainIntoPeace Can I ask you about the 10 years you say you lost to bipolar? You don't have to answer if u don't want

394115606	BipolarTweets	2011-11-27 00:26:16	With CBT you have 2 challenge your initial thoughts, when put in a certain situation #mentalhealth
