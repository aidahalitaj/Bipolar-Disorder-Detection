3153766157	sevenseasaway	2016-03-07 06:39:37	@LixHewett hmmm i am too tired atm to think more. But i think differentiating any group is not a good way to be included so to say.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2016-03-07 06:19:13	@Nicolcev @MrsAnahata might be true. The thing is.. Happiness is what's within you. How can one be truly happy with all that comes with meat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2016-03-07 06:17:59	Im always open to talks and discussions and believe #vegan is the way to go but i aint doing anything bout brainless ppl let me tell u that

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2016-02-21 01:52:52	Had to rant in german, because, just because... Today someone told me yet again how egoistic a suicide is and that just makes me mad!!!!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2016-02-21 01:50:28	Man bringt sich nicht um, weil man egoist sein will. Man tut es, weil nichts mehr geht und zwar GAR NICHTS. Suizid erscheint als Rettung..
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2016-02-21 01:49:52	Die Unwissenden sind ganz schnell dabei,suizid als egoistisch anzustempel, nur genau das ist für mich viel egoistischer! #notjustsad #suizid

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-12-22 03:56:21	@Blogsdoitbetter @amynmore Merry Christmas to you too! #bdib
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-12-22 03:54:47	@UnderToWonder @Blogsdoitbetter True... The following is not the best when you blog about serious things. #bdib
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-12-22 03:50:11	@Blogsdoitbetter A5 i think everything will become even faster and more colourful, more widgets, more apps. #bdib
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-12-22 03:48:55	@char_x0 @Blogsdoitbetter I'm also interested in collabs!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-12-22 03:48:20	@kellyannerist @Blonde_Vision @Blogsdoitbetter how can you lose readers?? Your URL is still the same, no matter where you are. #bdib
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-12-22 03:47:44	@Blonde_Vision @Blogsdoitbetter I wasn't on Blogger but i do think that WP is the way to go! #bdib

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-12-22 03:18:23	@Blogsdoitbetter A2 I don't think it's changed much yet... I think it's a little to many beauty bloggers out there to be honest. #bdib

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-11-14 08:05:05	@cbeelman @jkaccinni @proteinwisdom how can u say bullshit like that?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-11-14 08:02:49	A friend just made back home. "it's like war" he said... We're praying for you, Paris! Stay strong! #PrayForParis
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-11-14 08:01:14	@offlinemoon stay strong. Stay positive. Keeping it together is a way of telling them they're not winning.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-11-14 07:59:39	@clrchronicles i guess i wanna be sure i get it on film and can show ppl what was going on.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-11-14 07:58:45	@clrchronicles i reported on minor events, demonstrations and fights but stopped because i liked it. And i was good at it.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-11-14 07:53:41	@TWestfield thanks.... Me too.,,

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-09-05 05:14:20	@TheVeganTaff omg... I know it's not a funny thing but i had to laugh at "scared of everything". Sorryyy!! So would she stay & not move if

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-09-05 05:05:52	@SuggestDigest ooh yeah. She once didnt go outside the whole day cause she HATES rain.then peed right in front of the door & went back in
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-09-05 05:04:40	@SarahK1rby true... I live with my bf and even he doesn't get it way too often.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-09-05 05:04:17	@B3kaahrose i would guess that too EXCEPT she never had a problem... Can it become a problem just like that.?

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-09-05 04:55:27	@B3kaahrose hmm.. It's still OK in germany. Sooo weird. Now she ran to the apartment the moment i opened the main door.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 19:52:14	@Jinthelife Hmmm...... I'd go for a pink tone rather :) Or a washed out pastel violet. This (in my personal opinion) looks to dark..

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 04:59:06	@IHEARTVEGAN @spiceduk true :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 04:58:43	@spiceduk aaand what about: dates, apples, oranges, cucumber, sprouts? :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 04:58:06	@spiceduk and i like this one too: spinach, strawberries, bananas, figs.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 04:57:45	@spiceduk it tastes heavenly! my daily smoothie is: spinach, bananas, orange, apple and oats!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 04:53:54	@spiceduk I had massive problems with my blood.. Iron & B12. But it's just the usual :) nothing else! and now it's all a-ok! #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 04:53:00	@SarahK1rby @spiceduk well.. depends on the smoothie i guess :) i do mostly green smoothies tho, so healthy as it gets!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 04:51:37	@spiceduk well... it's theoretically not, BUT you tend to eat way more of dried fruit, cause it APPEARS less. cause it shrinks when drying.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 04:49:22	@spiceduk dried fruit is SO rich in everything,dat it's simply too much if you go overboard.but it's soo easy to do that:D cause it's delic!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 04:48:46	@spiceduk it is NOT unhealthy :)))) but you shouldn't eat more than 2 handfulls a day (at max!) or else you'll be overwhelming ur body...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 04:48:10	@spiceduk A1 when exercising i'd eat green smoothies with hemp protein.. oats. dried fruits n berries. tofu or tempeh. #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-20 04:46:40	@spiceduk A4 I think you shouldn't overdo with soy products... Also nuts or dried fruits. #veganbloggers

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-18 19:15:38	Also, Blood & Oil has immediately become a show to hate, because that's probably the reason Leo had to die in @ChasingLifeABCF !!!!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-18 19:15:14	Ok... So to be honest, @ChasingLifeABCF has become less interesting to me, as much as i love April, Leo + April was such a big part of it!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-18 19:09:19	I actually am crying over this........ @ChasingLifeABCF I hope it's just a twist and April was having a nightmare?!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 05:08:12	@MaiaMoxie @CarlDunnJr @BPDPattiPNW @allyc375 @gacossey I have to change my meds cause it wasn't a good fit... :(
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 05:07:31	No one should judge. If you don't accept smth - ask, explore, learn, but never ever judge. #mentalhealth https:// twitter.com/MaiaMoxie/stat us/633021226965819392 …
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 05:06:43	@MaiaMoxie @gacossey @allyc375 @BPDPattiPNW I know... he says it too.. But I've truly lost so much... it's hard.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 05:06:12	@MaiaMoxie @CarlDunnJr @BPDPattiPNW @allyc375 @gacossey but i couldn't do much at all before, because my depression episodes r severe..
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 05:05:52	@MaiaMoxie @CarlDunnJr @BPDPattiPNW @allyc375 @gacossey yeah.. i'm for the first time in almost 2 years in #bipolar mania which feels good!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 05:04:53	@CarlDunnJr That's why i learned to do my bed EVERY DAY" :P that's my success story :) hahaha! #bpdchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 05:04:27	@CarlDunnJr Thanks for being here tonight! :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 05:03:23	@CarlDunnJr @BPDPattiPNW @MaiaMoxie @allyc375 @gacossey it's sometimes difficult to see it like that, cause...... "others" can do it easily.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 05:02:10	@gacossey @allyc375 @MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW I know what u mean.... I wish i wasn't sick.. I actually just talked about it w him. And cried..
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 05:01:18	@allyc375 @MaiaMoxie @gacossey @BPDPattiPNW it's exhausting!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:59:38	YES! https:// twitter.com/MaiaMoxie/stat us/633019277994389505 …
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:59:08	@BPDPattiPNW @allyc375 @gacossey @MaiaMoxie I hope so!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:58:53	@allyc375 @gacossey @MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW Terrifying!.. I do actually feel sorry sometimes I am sick... sorry for my partner for example.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:57:50	@CarlDunnJr that app really helps. Because it also sends you notifications like: Remeber that moment ..... when it made you #happy ?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:57:09	@l_jordan11 @CarlDunnJr this is a brilliant idea!!!!! Doing that from now on :)!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:56:52	@CarlDunnJr YES! I actually downloaded the free app called @happier and it's awesome! Such a great community too #bpdchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:55:29	@littlepumacub @MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW good call!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:54:56	@MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW exactly! Besides... It's rather good to get distracted when with other people..!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:53:48	@BPDPattiPNW yeah...... I broke off the contact to that one immediately. Not even wasting my time if a person is THIS oblivious.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:52:55	@MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW It's actually sad how blind some people can be... It really is...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:52:15	@littlepumacub @MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW omg... How can you even carry on with that conversation? I think i would just leave...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:51:23	@MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW to just cry or be sad, and what else can we do if I'm coming.. WHAT?!?!?!? 2/2
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:51:00	@MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW i know for sure that one "friend" didn't wanna meet me for a coffee, because according to her: she doesn't want 1/2
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:50:17	@BPDPattiPNW @MaiaMoxie ooh right right. that one's completely oblivious. Some friends just told me: oh cmon, don't make it such a big deal.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:48:47	@MaiaMoxie @Purrpatrol but you know what? As harsh as it might sound... we don't need those people in our lives who won't accept us #bpdchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:47:43	@Robert58585858 @MarandaDearest @CarlDunnJr hihihi i'm not a big friend of cold, but the chilly autumn evenings - count me in!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:47:15	@MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW OR the other opposite-when ppl just tell me to have a relaxing bath in the evening & all is gonna be ok.BS! #bpdchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:46:33	@MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW it shouldn't... yet the reality's different. I hate being seen as "damaged goods" or "insane"... #bpdchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:45:49	@MaiaMoxie @Purrpatrol yes! Not feeling alone made a huge impact on my progress. It gives some strength, hope and motivation too.. #bpdchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:44:39	@BPDFFS @CarlDunnJr while that is true, sometimes - especially when depressed - (I'm #bipolar too) u simply do not have the energy. #bpdchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:44:00	@MaiaMoxie @CarlDunnJr it is massively important to have support. when i was diagnosed i thought that's the end...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:42:32	@MaiaMoxie @Purrpatrol fighting stigmas is difficult. I struggled for a long long time.... #mentalhealth #bpdchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:42:09	@Purrpatrol @MaiaMoxie it's OK! the time will come for them... I wasn't ready way too long too. Couple of ER visits changed my mind tho...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:40:56	@MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW Yes! Such a wicked world we live in actually, right? :) And... sometimes #mentalillness is not as bad as it feels..!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:39:26	@MarandaDearest @CarlDunnJr Sun and being outside is magic! It does so many good things to our body and mind #bpdchat

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:37:06	@MaiaMoxie @CarlDunnJr yes! actually.... My dog saved my life once when I tried to end it... THANKFUL FOR EVER! #bpdchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:36:06	@MaiaMoxie @BPDPattiPNW that can be the case. We know what it is, we can relate to each other, and we're definitely OPEN about it. #bpdchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:35:38	@MaiaMoxie true... had that experience too! #mentalillness can be "TOO" real for friends irl sometimes... Shame tho! #bpdchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-08-17 04:35:03	@MaiaMoxie She's VERY squishable :D this little piggy is called Ayita and is Podenco - a greyhound :P here u go http:// sevenseasaway.com/ayita/ :3

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 06:53:31	@drjennmann @RTretailtherapy u have gorgeous eyes! ;)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 06:52:25	@discoveringcl exactly but the moment it's "serious" medication we're reluctant. How is it going with u? How long r u taking ur meds?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 06:47:15	@discoveringcl it's difficult though... I do take a pain killer when i have a headache which is basically the same! Oh the stigmas....
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 05:49:15	Do you have to take any meds too? I tricked myself into doing so http:// buff.ly/1HwLoNV #mentalhealth #health

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:49:30	@Mica_D @Nadia_Henderson put a good book into the bag and that's it :) the best gift ever! :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:44:21	@Nadia_Henderson @Mica_D possibilities, they open up a little bit! 2/2
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:44:12	@Nadia_Henderson @Mica_D i think most of non-vegans think that there's nothing out there they could use, so when you show them the 1/2
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:43:51	@Nadia_Henderson @Mica_D yeah :) especially if it's small things.. like chocolate or a soap :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:42:27	@Mica_D i don't oversell it but i mention that it's vegan... maybe they'll join our community too :P
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:40:04	@Mica_D A4 quite strict, yes... I always give vegan gifts and wouldn't wash my hands with soap with honey or milk...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:31:42	@Mica_D i participate in @vegan_chat sometimes :) and i actually liked YOUR tip which would be @mulondon :) will be trying it out soon!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:30:59	@LauraTFP looks lovely!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:28:51	@LauraTFP hahahaha :DDDDD feels definitely like it when the summer comes :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:25:18	@SarahK1rby yup. and unfortunately, we cannot change the world......
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:24:38	@LauraTFP seems about right :D what about the bikini zone? :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:24:04	@SarahK1rby @Mica_D i know that some products of the brands I'm using r not vegan, but as long as i buy my vegan ones, all is good.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:23:35	@SarahK1rby @Mica_D I actually even think there's not so many only vegan companies out there... and we have to eat smth too! #cfbloggers

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:15:03	@Mica_D A2 normally i try to pick V companies, but that's not always the case. it has to be ALL cf though even if they have non-v products
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:11:56	@Mica_D Yes, i would. If it's vegan it doesn't have to have the stamp as long as the ingredients are clear. #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:09:30	@CharmofLoveBlog @Mica_D that's the best you can do :) learning is a part of our lives!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:08:34	@SarahK1rby @Mica_D yes!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-17 04:08:21	@Mica_D A1 since I am a vegan, vegan is a must. i DO NOT understand how cf can NOT be vegan. #cfbloggers

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:49:05	@AmandaBootes talking about feeling blue on my blog as a guest blogger http:// buff.ly/1gq7BEs #blogging #mentalhealth @FemaleBloggerRT
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:30:35	@vegangirll4 hahahaha really? Don't know any other fans of them!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:27:08	@vegangirll4 i just use a toothpaste with B12
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:26:50	@vegangirll4 u have not a lot of sun in Ontario? Didnt know that... I'm over in Leipzig, Germany!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:21:17	@vegangirll4 Ok.. where do u live about in Canada?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:18:29	@vegangirll4 damn... any damage?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:17:53	@vegangirll4 @AmandaBootes might be... B12 is the most important one though. And for a vegan, it's important you keep a tap on it!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:17:09	@wtvrtommii OMG i am now soo jealous! Wanna see him live one day!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:16:16	@vegangirll4 you can do a lot of awesome stuff with make up actually :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:14:47	@curtistilbo Priceless!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:14:09	@vegangirll4 @AmandaBootes it's a question for you i guess? :) But actually vitamin B12 is what gets you depressed and feeling blue...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:13:16	@vegangirll4 haha... oh well.. i don't :D but still! i love having it free and not burdened :D sorry! i do think tasteful make up is great!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:11:43	@vegangirll4 @CFbloggerschat @HourglassMakeup I don't use make up that much actually :) love to look natural!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:08:45	Have you read already what @AmandaBootes had to say about feeling blue? http:// sevenseasaway.com/guest-post-ama nda-talks-feeling-blue/ … @FemaleBloggerRT #mentalhealth #depression
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:07:18	@vegangirll4 @CFbloggerschat @HourglassMakeup hahah you seem like it :D cute!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:04:14	@Mica_D thanks :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:04:00	@vegangirll4 @EMANItweets ooh sephora might have it, true.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:03:13	@vegangirll4 @CFbloggerschat @HourglassMakeup i have to check it out :) is it just pure make up or also skincare?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:02:52	@Lucadonta Thank you for being with me :) It was really lovely! Let's stay connected :) Always nice to have similar minded ppl around!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:02:28	@Lucadonta @julyjournal @WhiteRabbitSC I love those kind of brands.. and to be honest - i pay the extra dime just for the comfort..... hmm
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:02:02	@vegangirll4 Never heard of it! O_O maybe we don't have it in Europe?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:00:57	@itsmeshenan @julyjournal @xleptodactylous @LeapingBunny it's true... it's misleading. That's why i always google/use peta's list if unsure
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 05:00:24	@Lucadonta @julyjournal @WhiteRabbitSC Will have to check it out....!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:59:12	Thank you so so much for having me as a host and participating in this chat :) Let’s all stay in touch! #cfbloggers http:// sevenseasaway.com
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:58:43	@julyjournal thank you for being hre :) I'm at http:// sevenseasaway.com !
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:56:15	@julyjournal @itsmeshenan @xleptodactylous i think according to law you r still able to have the logo cause it's KINDA a different company.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:55:40	@itsmeshenan @xleptodactylous Avon is not cf... :/ used to sell their products when i was younger :D lol
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:54:06	@julyjournal @Lucadonta @WhiteRabbitSC oooh I've checked out white rabbit too. is it really good?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:53:50	@Mica_D @mulondon I really wanna try them soon!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:53:42	Q6/A6 I knew Lush will be mentioned :))))))
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:51:31	Q6 What’s your favourite cruelty free brand at the moment? #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:51:22	@MuglerCircle That would be just beyond awesome! I'm in Leipzig, Germany. Think it might work? Have already worked with UK/swiss brands..!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:48:47	@MuglerCircle @julyjournal @SuggestDigest @itsmeshenan You can of course add me too :) Would love to do a review about you!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:48:23	@MuglerCircle Have you ever thought of sending me couple of scents (and an eco bottle) for a review? I'm starting vegan/cf posts soon...!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:47:48	@Mica_D YES YES YES! Also Daim....
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:46:38	WOW! This is a brilliant idea! https:// twitter.com/MuglerCircle/s tatus/618896915090927616 …
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:45:52	@damzlinthisdres interesting point!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:44:41	@moadore Hallelujah! However I've heard Unilever often has terrible work ethics too... Don't nkow if it's true tho.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:43:45	@MuglerCircle @SuggestDigest @julyjournal @itsmeshenan Thank's for chiming in!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:42:55	@Caring_Cosmetic @CFbloggerschat Offering alternatives is always a good way to start it up.Maybe 1day he/she'll finally change his/her mind!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:40:36	Q5 What’s that one thing you wish was cruelty free but is not? #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:40:22	@julyjournal Hmmm well if you really like him, you kinda have to go for it :) u know. u want smth, u take it!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:39:13	@SuggestDigest @moadore hahaha had to giggle at that one too :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:38:47	@Caring_Cosmetic @CFbloggerschat You really are! I have to deal with that quite often.... I wonder now, how come? Hmmm...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:38:13	@Mica_D Also true!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:38:00	@Caring_Cosmetic @CFbloggerschat Nice! Respect :) that's the way we do it :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:37:25	@itsmeshenan I see. I'm too radical when it comes to that :(
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:36:35	@julyjournal you just wait for it! OR cook smth nice and invite him over. The fastest way to a man's heart is through his stomach :P
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:35:28	@Caring_Cosmetic @CFbloggerschat Nice! And? How is it going? :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:35:00	@Mica_D hmmm doesn't it turn you off? I mean... the sight of some1 eating meat every evening next to me. Not for me...!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:34:18	@SuggestDigest that's awesome! We were both vegans and cf before we even met :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:33:26	@julyjournal hahaha :D terrible! HOWEVER cf is not just skincare, u know :) #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:32:29	@SuggestDigest @julyjournal @itsmeshenan Well now you'd have a couch to crash on and a guide :D hihihi!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:32:03	@itsmeshenan @julyjournal @SuggestDigest hahahaha never heard that! ;D I actually feel confident and sexy when i wear it *blushes*
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:31:25	Q4 Would you be able to have a relationship with someone who’s not cruelty free? Why yes/no? #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:31:14	@SuggestDigest @julyjournal @itsmeshenan Niiiice! You should visit me one day :P Leipzig is awesome for vegans and just.. well... AWESOME :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:29:46	@SuggestDigest @julyjournal @itsmeshenan never heard of it? Have to google! OMG. However, Hermes perfume is a different branch i think.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:29:02	@julyjournal @SuggestDigest @itsmeshenan I'm not sure.. they're from Paris, France and we have them in one shop here in Leipzig, Germany.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:28:30	@SuggestDigest @julyjournal @itsmeshenan Hermes is also quite pricey... I think i pay around 80 for 50 ml! but they're the best!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:27:25	@julyjournal tell me about it! the moment some1 hears i'M a vegan, they HAVE TO PROVE how awesome meat is. ANNOYING MUCH.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:27:04	@Mica_D I see.. I also often don't get into it, but sometimes i do snap......
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:26:35	@itsmeshenan is persil cf?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:26:20	@Lucadonta that's good... I'm often short on facts as i read too many of them and forget quickly :(
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:25:37	@xleptodactylous Wow! Remind me not to mess with you pretty lady :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:25:09	@julyjournal @SuggestDigest @itsmeshenan I use Hermes perfume. They have lovely scents and have been cleared out as their musk is synthethic
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:23:47	@SuggestDigest @itsmeshenan @julyjournal True!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:23:17	@julyjournal you're a lucky girl! I have had those remarks quite a lot!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:22:56	@itsmeshenan hahahah good one! I have lovely friends, but some of them r somewhat... well...... idiots? :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:22:00	@SuggestDigest @julyjournal I think you're right.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:21:05	@itsmeshenan @julyjournal @SuggestDigest I do miss how their products smell :) But I actually love Lush just as much!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:20:39	Q3 What’s your response when someone says: “get over this, it’s just this one product/it's just this once. it’s not important!” #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:20:05	@julyjournal @SuggestDigest MAC is actually brilliant brand when it comes to quality... unfortunately they're too dumb to ditch the testing?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:19:13	@Lucadonta No one's 100% perfect, that's why we're human. One day - maybe - everything will be cf... A girl's gotta dream! :D #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:18:28	@julyjournal @SuggestDigest THUS goodbye Body Shop :( I miss it so much.....
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:18:05	@Mica_D yes! loving the attitude :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:17:49	@SuggestDigest it's ok as long as we are TRYING to do our best all the time :)!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:17:30	@damzlinthisdres @moadore @lushcosmetics 9 to 5 is the BEST ever make up remover also. it's the only one that removes my mascara COMPLETELY
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:17:02	@xleptodactylous @moadore hahaha we don't want you to go nuts! NOOOO!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:16:42	@julyjournal Oooooh donating is a brilliant way of getting rid of those! Do that! #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:16:19	@moadore @xleptodactylous Me neither :) You would have to be born that way..!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:16:06	@itsmeshenan I agree with you completely. In the end, it IS a habit of living like that, so we have to take it slowly at the beginning.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:15:31	@damzlinthisdres @moadore @lushcosmetics YES! Loving it so much <3 also I use aqua marina, vanishing cream, lavender water and 9 to 5 :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:14:49	@moadore @julyjournal I see. That's perfectly fine (i think) as wasting is not something we should be doing. #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:14:17	@SuggestDigest @xleptodactylous @CFbloggerschat Exaactly and you might fall back, so better take it slow but for good :) #cfblgogers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:13:55	@xleptodactylous Fine might not be the word I'd be using, but it's def OK at the beginning while transitioning :) u go girl! #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:13:09	@julyjournal don't you agree? There are so many things out there!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:12:45	@julyjournal Good. Throwing away is wasting the resources which is also not OK. I think we do buy not cf products without knowing...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:12:04	@Lucadonta Yes please! :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:11:42	@xleptodactylous Try Lush, benecos, logona, superdrug, @mulondon for cosmetics! Q2 is just perfect for you, btw! :) #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:10:37	Q2 Are you completely cruelty free? If not, what’s your excuses? Where do you compromise? #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-10 04:10:22	@Lucadonta oh my god that's so cute! Can we please see a picture? :D

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 17:37:22	@MsVanillaRose i'm so sorry though for your loss!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 17:37:09	@MsVanillaRose i know.. I underarstand that. We lost someone too! But i learned to be tolerant enough and not be bitter towards it...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 15:48:30	@MsVanillaRose i see... I do think "like Hitler" has become solely a saying with time... I'm actually german and i don't mind it!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 15:47:28	@chloekoffman @vegan_chat think so too! We shouldn't waste things... However i despise leather! I gave my shoes to goodwill!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 05:14:07	@spiceduk @julyjournal you should! it's awesome here for vegans :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 05:13:34	@MsVanillaRose hehe... that's the thing. and even if you scrape it off - that's already kind of impolite.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 05:10:52	@myhealthyvegan So summer it is :) we'll see when it'll happen!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 05:00:54	@CharmofLoveBlog @julyjournal @vegan_chat omg :) thank you! it was so much fun :P
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:59:56	@Dolapo_B that's good! I actually REALLY genuinely love veggies!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:59:32	@vegan_chat @TheCurlyVegan Thank your for letting me host!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:59:13	Thank you so much for being here and talking to me! It was awesome with you! Let's get connected and talk soon :) #veganbloggers #vegan
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:58:44	@Dolapo_B @myhealthyvegan I think so too... I mean, i'm not saying I'm way better, but then again - i kind of am :D i mean... u know.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:58:07	@julyjournal @SarahK1rby @myhealthyvegan hand, mouth etc for that matter is getting closer or/and chew them. 2/2
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:57:52	@julyjournal @SarahK1rby @myhealthyvegan well there's been this study which proved that animals FEEL the vibrations when a bug or a 1/2
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:57:13	@myhealthyvegan I always ask myself then: does it tastes similar enough? :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:56:41	@SarahK1rby @julyjournal @myhealthyvegan oh noooooo! that really annoys me...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:55:42	@julyjournal @SarahK1rby @myhealthyvegan I nag quite a bit actually :D and do faces when other ppl eat or order meat or smth...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:55:13	@spiceduk As a optimistic vegan, i would say hell yeah, as a chef - i'm afraid i cannot agree.... :(
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:54:42	@SarahK1rby @julyjournal @myhealthyvegan Now that you say that, it is actually often true. The other people often start the conversation.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:54:13	@CharmofLoveBlog Oh yes! I traveled in Asia - TERRIBLE experience :D because you never know and they don't really understand english often.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:53:52	@SarahK1rby on one hand - i got it right earlier so to say, on the other - i did leave out a lot of things in my life already so early!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:53:13	@julyjournal @SarahK1rby @myhealthyvegan (and know what's best for us and the planet. And are way better in general :D lol)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:52:40	@Dolapo_B @myhealthyvegan it's true... well it does kind of define us, don't u think? but not in a bad way! #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:51:59	@Mica_D that's great to hear! is it your last step into transitioning fully?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:51:37	@spiceduk Yes :) very good point! I seems i know way too many "bad" vegans :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:51:06	@SarahK1rby I turned vegetarian when i was 13 and vegan when i was 22 i think? or 23.. So... Yeah lot's of exploring has been left out.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:50:34	@myhealthyvegan @SarahK1rby yes of course! :D i was just really into this hosting thing, so i was taking everything seriously :D sorry!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:50:02	@julyjournal I used to be a chef, so sometimes it really interests me what it tastes like. never ate anything that's not vegan tho....
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:48:39	Q6 Would you try a foreign cuisine just to know what the taste is even if it's not vegan? #veganbloggers #vegan
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:48:24	@SarahK1rby @myhealthyvegan oh i see :D oh lord, thanks for clarifying that :D i was waaay too serious about it! oh boy.. awkward!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:46:25	@myhealthyvegan Wow! Will have to read all of it after the chat :) looks interesting tho. Do you really think though #1 is so important?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:45:41	@CharmofLoveBlog Me too. Have done that couple of times already :D but mostly there's like bread or a cucumber lying somewhere :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:45:08	@Dolapo_B @julyjournal that's what i think too!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:44:54	@SarahK1rby i think it's way easier when you REALLY done with your transition.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:44:09	@julyjournal hahahahah I'm laughing out loud now!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:43:50	@spiceduk Think so too. A friend once told me "I'm a vegan now too, i just eat meat at my parents like once or twice a month". WHAT??! :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:42:17	@julyjournal my boyfriend didn't eat something once and his mom ran upstairs and cried!...... Oh boy.... #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:41:55	@julyjournal that's a good attitude! my family was giving me a rough time at the beginning... but that's my choice and that's that.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:40:19	Q5 Would you eat something not entirely vegan just this once to be "well behaved" (family dinner, friends birhtday party)? #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:40:12	@Dolapo_B that's really good! wasting food is not OK at all.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:39:49	@_MissRoulette we have way too many ingredients nowadays!! it's crazy!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:39:19	@SarahK1rby yes it does! the poor thing suffered and now we're throwing it away? ouch! #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:38:44	@julyjournal @spiceduk well that's ok then :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:38:27	@_MissRoulette oh noes!.. Such a shame, especially if that was your lunch! Damn.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:37:12	@_MissRoulette I couldn't bring myself to eat it too.. Although i almost did! because no one wanted to take it...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:36:51	@spiceduk @julyjournal that's what i mean. I didn't really want it at the first place, now some1's giving me stuff but wanting money? Nope.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:36:17	@myhealthyvegan fortunately, we mostly have vegan vegetarian friends now :) yes! I'm blessed! #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:35:57	@myhealthyvegan I hate throwing away foods too.. We have a dog, so she has to be our garbage bin so to say :D #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:35:23	@CharmofLoveBlog i hope he doesn't read this :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:35:11	@CharmofLoveBlog I did that once in our supermarket where they already know me. wasn't a problem :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:34:48	@spiceduk i hate throwing away food too... :( but sometimes there's no takers! fortunately, we have a dog :D #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:34:24	@julyjournal I'll just ask if they can take me out some day or something :) wouldn't ask for money i think... i mean, they are my BIN :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:33:37	@SarahK1rby yeah, meat/gelatine is really disgusting! once we bought chips with some kind of milk powder! i didn't eat but my friends did.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:33:06	@CharmofLoveBlog when it comes to this aspect, it's quite handy to have a non-vegan husband after all :D #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:32:31	@julyjournal that's so practical :D i just give that stuff FOR FREE to someone who's not vegan. #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:32:03	@Dolapo_B I refused to eat couple of times and just ate the salad :D then tossed couple of potatoes directly into the still hot ashes!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:31:11	@SarahK1rby @CharmofLoveBlog @spiceduk oh yeah.. having a bbq party and ending up fighting with each other is not nice!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:30:20	@lee_the_vegan @_MissRoulette exactly my point! wasting food doesn't happen in our home. Nope :)!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:29:45	Q4 Imagine buying something and realising at home it's not entirely vegan, just because of one ingredient? Eat it or toss it? #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:29:38	@SarahK1rby @spiceduk hahah :D fortunately for you then :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:29:06	@myhealthyvegan hey you :) come over, i'm hosting! it'll be lovely to have you on board.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:28:19	@CharmofLoveBlog that's also a good idea! we have those, but all our friends know that they need two bbq if we're coming :D #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:27:26	@spiceduk definitely!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:27:12	@lee_the_vegan @_MissRoulette haha it was a fresh tomato salad with fresh basil from our own garden and i was hungryyyyyy
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:26:48	@julyjournal that's just human! 2/2
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:26:40	@julyjournal this is just pure bullocks! I thought that do, but u know what? screw it... yes, i have a pimple and stuff going on, but 1/2
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:25:51	@spiceduk I'm always afraid though, that meat juice will splash all over my veggies :(((( #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:25:21	@SarahK1rby would you still eat it then? I just eat salad if i cannot have it "my way" which is the only safe way too :D #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:24:41	@spiceduk good point! for some people it's difficult to make such a FINAL decision, you know. #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:24:06	@julyjournal and FYI you're just perfect! you're beautiful, you really don't NEED make up. :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:23:36	@CharmofLoveBlog :D that's what i tell people when they say i should just "go for it" #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:23:16	@julyjournal that's good! I cannot even stand the smell of meat on a bbq....! #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:22:42	@lee_the_vegan @_MissRoulette hahaha scrubbing is good! I once ate off a floor because I dropped my salad and was REALLY hungry, so.... :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:22:11	@sevenseasaway @lee_the_vegan
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:21:28	@julyjournal @CharmofLoveBlog Good idea!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:21:13	Q3 What about BBQ? Would you grill your vegan food just next to meat/cheese? #veganbloggers #vegan
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:21:05	@spiceduk yeah.. but i think you either eat meat or you don't. doesn't really matter.. EXCEPT you're a flexotariar and eat once a month.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:20:25	@_MissRoulette that's true :) we cannot do better than washing really thoroughly - we're just humans after all :) #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:19:36	@CharmofLoveBlog @julyjournal hahaha! terrible :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:18:57	@lee_the_vegan don't worry :) just check out what I'm asking, and answer and have a lot of fun! will be great :P
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:18:34	@Dolapo_B Maybe you can join our chat tonight? And we'll talk about more next time, when it's not such a heated discussion? :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:18:07	@spiceduk We all know what "barely eats meat" mean :D it's a little bit silly to say something like that... Maybe she will one day tho?!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:17:39	@SarahK1rby true! I always always ask and am actually way too picky...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:17:15	@CatLoverXVX @CharmofLoveBlog @julyjournal true... unfortunately way too many products contain it :(
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:17:04	@CharmofLoveBlog I see! Maybe you should have your own like @julyjournal :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:16:35	@SarahK1rby Me too! We're both vegans. That's just amazing!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:15:58	@_MissRoulette Hey, we're great! Come over, I'm hosting and talking daily details!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:15:36	@lee_the_vegan Join our chat, Lee!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:15:10	@spiceduk WOW! That's impressive! Loving her attitude. Would love if my folks were like that... Kudos to you and your mom! #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:14:25	@julyjournal hihihi this is sweet! I also NEVER ever use the same pots n pans. I know they're washed, but still.... yucky!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:13:54	@julyjournal @CharmofLoveBlog @SarahK1rby nooo don't feel bad about urself! you'll get there :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:13:33	@CharmofLoveBlog @julyjournal @SarahK1rby Nope! Not at all, i don't buy anything from body shop anymore too!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:13:11	@spiceduk @CharmofLoveBlog @SarahK1rby you think so? For example what?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:13:00	@julyjournal @SarahK1rby try going without :D i ditched my make up ages ago and haven't felt better :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:12:11	@SarahK1rby @spiceduk yes and a rewarding one too! #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:11:50	Q2 Would you use the same pots & pans if someone prepared meat in them? #veganbloggers #vegan
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:11:41	Ok let's move to what we put INSIDE of us now :) #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:11:03	@SarahK1rby @julyjournal body shop doesn't do animal testing BUT it does belong to l'oreal, so i don't shop at body shop anymore!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:10:46	@SarahK1rby @julyjournal body shop has been bought by l'oreal years ago and l'oreal unfortunately does animal testing.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:10:03	@SarahK1rby @julyjournal that's exactly what I meant :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:09:44	@spiceduk I was vegetarian long before that and have been vegan for almost 6 months before I realised :) so it was easier for me!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:09:19	@julyjournal no, u meant makeup must be cf (but not always vegan). i don't think even cf must be vegan too!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:08:45	@spiceduk that's good! That's what my boyfriend did - he used everything up but never bought anything not vegan anymore. #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:07:58	@julyjournal but also vice versa, don't u think? All cf products should be vegan too... That's what I actually meant! #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:06:32	@SarahK1rby @CharmofLoveBlog true :D i know quite a few of them UNFORTUNATELY.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:06:05	@julyjournal I see. I didn't really differentiate that, because if they use animals, they're not entirely cf for me. Am i too radical?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:05:23	@julyjournal @SarahK1rby True... What I've done over the years - I simply didn't buy something and I'm still living :D #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:04:49	@SarahK1rby Really true! Also, some products I find quite expensive just because they have the logo VEGAN #veganbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:04:15	@CharmofLoveBlog that's ok! As long as you're learning with every mistake :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:03:53	@julyjournal Can you explain the difference in your opinion between vegan and not vegan but cf?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:02:15	Q1 Despite the food, do all the products you use have to be vegan? Skin care, beauty products, shoes, clothes? #veganbloggers #vegan
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:02:05	Sorry it was meant to be Q1!!!!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-09 04:01:48	A1 Despite the food, do all the products you use have to be vegan? Skin care, beauty products, shoes, clothes? #veganbloggers #vegan

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-04 03:49:33	@SarahK1rby sucks, huh? Especially, when you're completely unprepared. When everything goes well. When you think you found the right person.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-04 03:49:08	@moadore thank you so much! I am right now trying to kind of... ignore it. Not think about it. The pain will come anyways...

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-07-04 00:58:01	@MichaelFame23 not rly... the reason for this break up is the worst! and it's a mistake... but he doesn't see it yet. I'm devastated.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-30 02:57:55	@Rtwenty1A getting eaten. But I'm more of a a environmental #vegan as I'm against what mass production does to the planet.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-30 02:57:01	@Rtwenty1A Could be. They even feel the vibrations of when something or someone gets really close to them... So they kind of feel when 1/2
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-30 02:54:03	that's how u do it :D https:// twitter.com/letmegoxo/stat us/615587569745707012 …
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-30 02:53:38	@Rtwenty1A @mdvegevents1 btw @peta should have a free starter kit too!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-30 02:53:04	@Rtwenty1A @mdvegevents1 because of the gelatine. Also, lots of products UNFORTUNATELY have milk powder n stuff like that, thus not #vegan
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-30 02:52:42	@Rtwenty1A yes. it's not difficult for me anymore, but at the beginning it could be quite tricky. For example, gummy bears r a no.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-30 02:51:55	@Rtwenty1A u'll find my email address in my bio :) looking forward to connect with ya!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-30 01:58:51	@Rtwenty1A @mdvegevents1 all plants are a-ok! #vegan means no animals, so no meat, fish, dairy products and so on :)

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-28 05:41:15	@xhc__ that would be a challenge of the year for u :) to make it look good and fitting my style. :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-28 05:29:28	@xhc__ for me it's also quite difficult to even use make up so it fits my style. I have dreadlocks and am somewhat a hippy..
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-28 05:22:09	@xhc__ (no offense!)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-28 05:21:57	@xhc__ u're so pretty without tho!!! i would try to ask u out if i saw u in a bar without make up. Wouldn't do that if u wear some.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-28 05:18:19	@xhc__ exactly my point!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-28 05:16:39	@xhc__ being creative with it is nice but having to put a face all the time ALL THE TIME is dreadful. Girls should love themselves more!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-28 05:15:55	@xhc__ use it on me. If i do i feel like it's weighing on me and it doesn't even feel nice.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-28 05:15:27	@xhc__ nice! I love staying natural and not using anything... I'm quite good with make up as i used to style ppl but i normally never
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-28 04:57:59	@xhc__ better without though!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-28 04:55:38	@paper_mermaid happens. Once i lost 37 followers within 4 hours!!!! No idea what happened... But it's the way Twitter is I guess?

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-24 19:52:32	@juliecookies I thought to use that too, but is the free version enough?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-24 19:52:11	@b3kaahrose @eliza_armand yeah, we both r living in Germany :) but on different sides :D i'm in the east, she's rather in the west/middle
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-24 19:51:37	@eliza_armand @b3kaahrose well I have all the equipment.. :) And people who can film. A friend of mine can help (he already promised!)

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-24 19:48:07	@b3kaahrose @eliza_armand really? :D ok... i thought of just doing it with my laptop at first.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-24 19:47:27	@juliecookies Let me figure out how to do all this :) And I'll be hosting!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-24 19:46:59	@eliza_armand @b3kaahrose We should meet up and do it together :D like one video! Do you ever visit Leipzig? :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-24 19:46:19	@eliza_armand @b3kaahrose Hmmm ok... Should I just record on my laptop/computer or should i try doing it with a professional camera?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-24 19:45:40	@b3kaahrose @eliza_armand Hmmm I might try it out :) I'm not sure i'm suited for vlogging tho... But I am thinking about it!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-24 19:43:49	@b3kaahrose @eliza_armand u both think so? How come..? I have never done that like professionally.... No idea how to do youtube videos!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-24 19:41:14	Have been really thinking about vlogging after @eliza_armand mentioned it!.. Should i?

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-22 02:55:07	@ellenextdoor you're right! Readers r so different, just like bloggers :) #lbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-22 02:54:30	@ablokeseyeview @_twistedbeauty1 noo no no! Not at all :) I also don't follow back immediately (or not at all) if i'm not into their content

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-22 02:50:19	@ellenextdoor true... Although a pure fashion blog bore me rather quickly
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-22 02:48:11	@ablokeseyeview @_twistedbeauty1 i barely find male bloggers out there! :(
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-22 02:45:21	@_twistedbeauty1 i personally have different topics kinda united my one big theme. I guess that's a good compromise! #lbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-22 02:44:40	@_twistedbeauty1 i don't rly know OR care. If the content is good i'll thrust the blogger to amuse me no matter what :))) #lbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-22 02:39:14	@LaurenShipleeey that's how u do it!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-22 02:37:45	@thelovecatsinc well u can still do plenty of lifestyle blogging: how u commute,what u wear,how to decorate ur room for good sleep blah blah
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-22 02:36:14	@_twistedbeauty1 nope! I'll write about what i care for and review brands i myself use. There's enough to write about #lbloggers

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-11 02:42:31	@TheMonochromes_ @dorkfaceblog I find limits perfectly fine. I'm an open book, but many ppl don't want to talk about their personal lives.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-11 02:40:47	@dorkfaceblog hmm.. I've never deleted a post. If i write, I prepare a lot in advance, so there's no mix up.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-11 02:34:35	@meganevekilv @Little_Fickle maybe you should vlog instead? Or do something about your writing routine?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-11 02:33:55	@dorkfaceblog but not because I wouldn't do it, but because my partner would FLIP OUT #lbloggers so no, there r no limits for me.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-11 02:33:21	@bloggerslvehub Hey, millysevenseasaway@gmail.com What could be the problem you think?

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-11 02:22:55	@fineanddandy @dorkfaceblog yes. I love personal posts. BUT often times they do not "offer" enough viral material. Sadly. #lbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-11 02:21:20	@meganevekilv @Little_Fickle Have you tried to analyse where your problems coming from?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-11 02:20:23	@fineanddandy @dorkfaceblog too many personal posts could be dangerous tho, if you need to get more followers #lbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-11 02:19:55	@fineanddandy @dorkfaceblog personal posts are always easier to write :) because they come completely from your heart so to say.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-10 21:26:01	@LeanneWoodfull i am not putting her down at all.. boy are we stingy today or what?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-10 21:25:44	@LeanneWoodfull 30-40 people i know who switched their diets to vegan, just 1 lost weight.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-10 21:25:26	@LeanneWoodfull i think so too :) she's loving herself and that's rly awesome! I didn't lose any weight when i switched. i think of around
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-10 21:23:30	@LeanneWoodfull for example, i don't like my body atm too, but that doesn't mean I'm a worse person. (i hope)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-10 21:23:00	@LeanneWoodfull I'm a vegan.. u're preaching to the wrong choir :) and i am not judging. just sharing an opinion :) i loved her body more b4
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-10 21:19:53	@LeanneWoodfull she wasn't this skinny a year ago tho... I think it's not rly her choice. it's the pressure stars are having.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-10 18:49:33	@carpediememmie Especially if it's a bar and you have to be a bit quirky and witty and fast with your words.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-10 18:49:14	@carpediememmie Why not go there once more and tell him he's probably forgotten to contact his new employee - that attitude might be good.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-06-10 18:47:47	Hmmm... I am really unhappy that my almost every #blog post is SO long (never under 1000 words). What if no one reads it? #everyblogger

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 20:42:12	@CharlotteHobbsx @TheBodyShopUK @Loreal YES that is what I mean. Bodyshop made a public comment that they still do not test, BUT.... u know.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 20:39:30	@CharlotteHobbsx @FemaleBloggerRT @TheBodyShopUK @UKBlog_RT @Loreal I know. BodyShop itself doesn't support it, BUT it was bought by Loreal.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 20:38:38	Have you met @ievuuk already? Do it! :P #ff
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 20:37:55	@CharlotteHobbsx @FemaleBloggerRT @TheBodyShopUK @UKBlog_RT I wish Body Shop wasn't a part of @Loreal .... They support animal testing.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 05:18:08	@ReelCarina I have one too, but i think it's too lose. I need a stricter one!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 05:14:34	Also, I need a more strict schedule to anything connected to #blogging . I am spending a lot of time and forgetting to clean, cook, sleep...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 05:13:58	I def need a #socialmedia schedule as I tend to lurk on Twitter without any reason and it's eating up my time! NOT GOOD. #lifegoals
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 05:12:05	@Bipolarbingo @SarahK1rby @CFbloggerschat u can find the questions on @SarahK1rby profile :) or search #cfbloggers for all we said :D

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:54:47	@SarahK1rby It's also here in Germany :)

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:47:59	@SarahK1rby @LushLtd well honey is an awesome product after all... but it's not #vegan ! they have honey or goat's milk in their products.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:45:14	@KerryMortonn Hallelujah!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:44:52	@KerryMortonn hahaha that's too good! :D

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:25:56	I think meat eating ppl now hate me because of my latest #cfbloggers chat :D #vegan is the true way tho. I stand by it!!!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:24:52	@SarahK1rby I have never made a distinction between these two. so it's hard for me to see it now! Sorry! #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:24:33	@SarahK1rby Well.. again. I don't see how this can be a discussion :D But i think I'm just too much into my vegan life.. #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:23:13	@VickiMaitland @SarahK1rby I see :) it's easy for me, i cannot stand meat. just thinking of it makes me shiver #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:22:41	@SarahK1rby @VickiMaitland I don't think a special occasion should be so cruel...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:21:44	@SarahK1rby totally agree!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:21:03	@VickiMaitland @SarahK1rby why should animals' suffer be your special occasion? Have you thought about it from this perspective? #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:20:38	@VickiMaitland @SarahK1rby Don't like that... It's like having a stand but not having a stand :) sorry for being mean to u! #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:18:29	@VickiMaitland @SarahK1rby u don't buy or u don't eat? That's different i know ppl who don't BUY but eat meat at friends or smth #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:17:00	@moadore @SarahK1rby oh noes! soy allergy is the worst! Is is doable tho? #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:16:12	@VickiMaitland @SarahK1rby it's less expensive actually... Good meat is way expensive! #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:15:45	@SarahK1rby NO NEVER EVER. NO! A meat eater CANNOT be #crueltyfree . It's not possible! #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:15:09	@VickiMaitland @SarahK1rby i might be a mean #vegan but for me MOSTLY veggie doesn't mean ANYTHING.either u eat meat or u don't. #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:14:09	@SarahK1rby @VickiMaitland in Germany the bill says, there simply has to be a POSSIBILITY to go outside. Still small cakes tho. #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:13:26	@VickiMaitland @SarahK1rby they don't suffer the way they do during animal testing. it's TERRIBLE! #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:12:59	@VickiMaitland @SarahK1rby i actually find food even less cruel than make up. I mean.. they kill an animal, yes, BUT TBC #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:12:27	@VickiMaitland @SarahK1rby free range doesn't mean anything actually... I read the bill myself. #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:11:07	@moadore @SarahK1rby well done! :) that's the way to go! How long r u #vegan ? #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:10:11	@BunnyBlane @SarahK1rby that's true.. Even if another person is not #vegan , i always give them smth GOOD hence #crueltyfree #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:08:20	@SarahK1rby Not at all, because I was a #vegatarian and then #vegan before I even learned the term #crueltyfree :) #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:05:31	@BunnyBlane do it!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:04:52	@SarahK1rby i rly cannot understand how can one be cf and not vegan. #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 04:02:34	@SarahK1rby of c it means more than this! It's ur whole #lifestyle that has to be #crueltyfree . #vegan is a must for a cf life! #cfbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 03:40:03	@SarahK1rby @Bipolarbingo @CFbloggerschat it's 10 pm in Germany :P I hope I can!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 00:15:10	If u're truly #crueltyfree think bout all the cosmetic companies too! I love the colors of @MACcosmetics but they test on animals... NOT OK!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-29 00:14:20	@livingdisrobed @MACcosmetics these r lovely! Unfortunately, MAC does animal testing, which is a no go for me.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 05:06:51	Having #bipolar ain't easy.But not knowing about it is worse.Getting diagnosed was 1 of the best things in my life! #MentalHeath #depression
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 05:06:03	@Bipolarbingo it does,huh? That's also what I took from all of this mess: now it all makes sense...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 05:05:21	@Bipolarbingo i on the contrary LOVE attention and seek it out by all means. I'M a bit destructive...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 05:04:20	@Bipolarbingo I also FEEL and SEE colours and energy flow sometimes........ This might sound stupid :) But it's the way it is..
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 05:03:54	@Bipolarbingo YES!! I sometimes cannot remember what happened last day. And sometimes I feel like I'm sitting next to me.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 05:02:46	@Bipolarbingo But I have suicidal thoughts just in my worst phases... ALSO when i have a melt down. these occur once in a month or two.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 05:02:07	@Bipolarbingo with me too!!! Today I cycled three times. Sometimes it's 10-14 weeks. Rarely, it's months.. Suicidal thoughts r crushing!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 05:01:15	@Bipolarbingo ruled it simply as a depression. It's been getting worse and worse. The last 3-4 years were TERRIBLE. I got diagnosed 2014.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 05:00:44	@Bipolarbingo they don't know for sure yet, but probably almost my whole life, since my first depression was when i was 17, but they TBC
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 04:59:53	@Bipolarbingo my first medication rly calmed me down but i quit. I am starting a new one soon tho.. we'll see! don't want any actually!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 04:59:30	@Bipolarbingo I've heard that rapid cyclers are the smallest group of us. I have tendencies to borderline too, which makes it worse...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 04:51:27	@RuneLuk Exactly! I'm a rapid cycler which is hard to deal on a daily basis, but i'm trying to do my best! It's an interesting challenge!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 04:48:51	@TheAngrySaxon I'm sorry to hear u have to deal with that too, but it's ok! No one's perfect. ppl like us, we just have a different path!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-27 00:23:15	@TheAngrySaxon yeah WoW is not on the top of my list anymore... I did enjoy Florensia a lot even thought it's one of the "cute" ones.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:28:44	@wdhubbs Sure :) let's stay connected!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:27:41	@wdhubbs I am off to bed, William :) But I'll check it out! Have a good one, be happy and be kind :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:25:57	Remember: When you wake up, a new start has come and the sun is already filling up our day with energy for us to take. Gnight!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:24:44	I will try to #sleep without #nightmares today, bcause i WANT to! Maybe it'll work. Be #happy and be kind! Try spreading #positivity !
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:22:55	@wdhubbs not use it on their free will i think.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:22:38	@wdhubbs the latter one indeed. yet humans can also feel empathy, which robots won't possess to its fullest. they can learn WHAT it is, but
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:21:03	Dream,smile,exercise,cook,eat,travel,enjoy-those r things I'm yet to REdiscover & it's going to be a beautiful journey! #Bipolar #depression
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:19:01	@wdhubbs the ending makes you really gasp! She's so cruel all of sudden...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:18:26	@wdhubbs what was the last film you watched?
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:18:09	@wdhubbs Really? Wow... Weird since the ending was really calling for a sequel! I like movies a lot, so I watch all kinds :) #movies
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:17:20	Those little glimpses of future feel pretty unreal,but I might just try fighting for them! #depression is not the end, t's a different path.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:15:58	For me it's difficult to perceive future at all because of my #Bipolar but sometimes I get a glimpse of that and I think: what if i make it!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:15:12	It's very possible, I would be dead right now, but I'm not & I'm thankful for that. I am strong, because I haven't given up yet. #depression
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:14:32	Today I've reached another personal milestone.. Talking to a friend I said: I am happy I'm still living. It's hard, but I'll get through it.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:11:12	@wdhubbs i kind of liked it! It left me a bit confused but it's well done!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 06:08:26	@wdhubbs it's my #personal opinion. That's why the "i guess" at the end. But what do you think? The ending of #ExMachina is an open one!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-23 05:39:16	A great #friday night out! #movies r always a good idea! pic.twitter.com/dOkqrYMsMx

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 05:28:52	@ReelCarina probably the latter then :)))
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 05:25:04	@ReelCarina ooooh right right! That should be funny :))) for a german it's almost the same... Maybe 10-20 cents difference.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 05:23:37	@ReelCarina true.. Most ppl r nice and friendly! But way too many drink and party like there's no tomorrow. Never used to fit in.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 05:20:41	@ReelCarina rly? U like #Lithuania ? I don't even like it that much! but i guess it's quite ok! The nature is awesome there!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 05:17:23	@ReelCarina #LTU made it tho :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 05:16:30	Being depressed means many things.. It triggered an #addiction to #TVshows which I'm struggling with. Read about it http:// buff.ly/1Lhn2rS
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 05:15:14	@ReelCarina she didn't make it to the finals!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:58:03	@lifelikedisney unusual is the best :)!!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:57:40	@lifelikedisney i think it's imprtant that both r vegan in a partnership cause it's a way of loving...... #CFbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:56:07	@lifelikedisney green beans :)) already a veggie! #CFbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:53:33	@SarahK1rby @lifelikedisney the same here! Also fruit :)) our dog's spoilt rotten!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:49:35	@SarahK1rby @lifelikedisney we tried it but then we read what the ingredients are. Our dog is not gonna eat that!!!But she eats veggies too
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:47:16	@SarahK1rby @lifelikedisney dogs r a different topic tho....
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:46:08	@lifelikedisney normally a rule would be no buying meat and no cooking with meat at home! #CFbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:45:22	@lifelikedisney my bf is vegan!! Yaaay!! BUT i always tried to turn my previous ones and even broke up if it didn't work.. #CFbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:38:29	@SarahK1rby @ReelCarina @lifelikedisney silly blind people i would say....
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:37:21	@SarahK1rby @lifelikedisney i didn't know u might make a distinction like that! Not buying it personally but i guess it's OK. #CFbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:36:30	@SarahK1rby @lifelikedisney if they EAT meat that's already bound to be cruel no matter how u look at it... #CFbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:33:56	@SarahK1rby @lifelikedisney how would that even work..? I'm lost!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:30:14	@lifelikedisney i explain them why i think it's the right way and they talk about how they love meat. Useless! #CFbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:29:29	@lifelikedisney every1 everyday. I think carnivores get frustrated with themselves when they meet some1 better :))) #CFbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:24:03	The cherry animation's too cheesy for me #POL .. No from me. #ESC2015
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:20:39	@ReelCarina @lifelikedisney i think u have to be all of it sooner or later. But my main cause was to save the planet! :) #CFbloggers

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:15:34	Too similar to Mister Big! Not voting for #CYP ... #ESC2015
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:14:49	@lifelikedisney i think #vegan is the way to go nowadays cause we can survive w/out meat & the industry's terrible to animals!! #CFbloggers
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-22 04:12:52	@lifelikedisney never had that... Then again i turned vegetarian when i was 13 :) and would never eat meat a lot... #CFbloggers

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 05:00:28	@depmummy u can do it! Think about the feeling afterwards - that helps me sometimes :)!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:59:46	#depression isn't logical or easy. It doesn't go away after a round of antibiotics. It's tiresome and crushing. Don't judge ppl who r ill..
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:57:36	@depmummy i'm thinkin bou getting a social worker tho... It's possible here in Germany!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:57:15	@depmummy oh yes.. Phone calls r the worst! I have a panic attack every time it's not my partner, mom or my best friends.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:54:15	@depmummy just don't quit! It's not worth it!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:52:57	@Louise_Trigg @OfficialBPDChat i know. I try to keep that in mind. The whole fluctuation of EVERYTHING is a pain in the ass!!! #BPDChat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:50:49	@OfficialBPDChat when i wanted to kill myself outside i thought: but what will my doggy do..? I hesitate. Just enough to call my partner!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:50:02	@Louise_Trigg @OfficialBPDChat ... cut myself. That's not OK! I'm a grown woman and want to have my own head.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:49:34	@Louise_Trigg @OfficialBPDChat yeah... But i feel so dependent on this one person! Right now our relationship's shaky and i wanna....
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:46:58	@OfficialBPDChat it's stupid.. but... Atm it's my dog and my boyfriend. They saved my ass from suicide twice already. #BPDChat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:45:49	@BPDFFS @OfficialBPDChat it was! Hyperventilating, panic, crying, hesitating used to be normal before leaving. Now i just hesitate a bit..
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:44:53	@depmummy oh yes.. That sometimes breaks ur spirit! I also needed tons of paperwork which overwhelmed me. I quit so many times!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-18 04:08:44	@OfficialBPDChat yet another hurdle u're overcoming.For example,i can now leave my house easier n that progress is motivating me! #BPDChat

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:58:23	I'm gooey inside now. https:// twitter.com/pampeekemd/sta tus/598999869508947968 …
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:57:57	@PamPeekeMD @EmpowHER thank you... It makes me feel good but i'm blushing now too. Actually i've never been praised for that. #herchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:56:03	@DivaDocSpeaks true! It's complicated and requires lots of strength but therapy's worth it! I've been avoiding it for too long-didn't help.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:53:24	@EmpowHER u know what! I am actually really proud of myself for making these choices. Can i say it out loud? #herchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:52:43	@EmpowHER now i feel like an #overachiever ! Or like that 8 year old girl with an apple for her teacher *silly me* #herchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:51:26	@EmpowHER i'm #straightedge so no alcohol, smoking or drugs! I try sitting comfy, driving without texting and am taking stairs! #herchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:49:52	Need this bag. Badly!!! #yoga https:// twitter.com/dailycupofyoga /status/595909017911832577 …
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:48:09	How much active is not too active on #twitter ? I wouldn't wanna annoy any of my followers too much.. #TwitterTips
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:41:35	@IAmTakingCharge so i'm doing quite ok then? I go to specialist often but for an all round checkup just once a year.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:36:34	@EmpowHER for all round check ups - not often enough. Once a year. I go to doctors weekly cause of mental state tho! #herchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:35:15	@NickiDurlester @EmpowHER true.. I would avoid fatty dinner if i had a rich lunch already! #herchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:33:26	@EmpowHER yes!I always have celery,carrots & cucumber for some veggie sticks if i need a snack!Apples, pineapple & kiwis work too! #herchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:31:09	@EmpowHER i'm #vegan and stand by it so i actually eat well. Still... I cheat sometimes with chocolate and cake! #herchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:30:03	@EmpowHER for me it's about playing mind tricks giving myself a treat afterwards tho! A good #smoothie always works #herchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:27:40	@EmpowHER it's not easy at first. I used to have a to-do list for at least 20 hours... No one can manage that! It made me ill... #herchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:26:23	@EmpowHER A1 since i'm depressed atm and a #bipolar too my mental state is a big problem atm. #herchat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:25:24	@EmpowHER A2 easy - taking one step at a time and setting reasonable priorities. Green tea helps too! #herchat #healthy #stress
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-15 07:24:13	@EmpowHER a3 i love doing #trx - i can do a 30 min workout outdoors while my doggy's doing her business :) #herchat

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 23:12:02	@LizaTaitBailey sure! I even have actual experience with that cause i used to proofread and edit.. And i love doing so :) but i'm no pro!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 23:05:23	@wordsonpointe it has to be a tough journey. but if u're learning something during it, this just makes u an interesting person! keep it up!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 23:02:41	@LizaTaitBailey if the original idea doesn't work, well there's a reason. just because that's not good enough, don't worry!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 22:56:30	Even grocery shopping can be tricky while on #depression .Cause I have to leave home, face people & carry heavy... $$$ is also a part of it!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:58:57	I for example post positive quotes or just tweet "SMILE NOW" to people to show them I can be happy despite my #depression #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:58:30	@pearlmijn every day is a good way to go! #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:57:20	@IAmTakingCharge I am well aware of this... Had to close my business because of my #mentalillness . A truly damaging experience!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:56:03	it's not that we would bombard you with our life stories everyday, but while talking to people you can address some issues always #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:53:39	when it comes to any illness, every day should be an awareness day, because we have a certain illness every day. We need to open up! #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:52:50	Oh.... I though there was one more q to come :) sorry! #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:52:34	one more question! #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:50:51	@Simonlovesfood yeah... it hurts when they try avoiding your elbows or something. not cool, guys... #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:50:10	@foundsomepaper kamile.zaleskyte@googlemail.com (i hope that's the one for pinterest i cannot remember)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:47:48	@Simonlovesfood oh wow! nice. but in my case it's also grown ups. Also, ppl asked me if it's contagious - that didn't feel good. #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:46:31	@wegohealth yes.. But as an advocate I want to stay polite even if I'm annoyed. They just don't know better YET #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:45:14	@asouthernceliac it's rly scary! wanted to start in the morning and have been procrastinating ever since #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:44:31	@wegohealth @Simonlovesfood i have psoriasis too. Ppl ask me if i fell down? It's a little bit annoying, but i explain patiently.... #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:42:22	it seemed the connected better when I used daily examples rather than giving them a spiritual rant about the energy flow in me #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:41:56	I explained what little details kept me away from going downstairs or opening a letter and described the panic inside of me. #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:40:47	I'm posting soon about a meltdown.I've never done that,I'm looking forward to the pool of feelings I'll have after hitting "publish" #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:39:01	A4 making some1 else aware of ur condition is such a deliberation! my family and my partner were the most important to me #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:36:29	@IAmTakingCharge do that! :) I'm willing to travel too!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:32:51	RT @asouthernceliac RT @tbear71 : A3 Just because I may not LOOK sick doesn't mean I'm not sick! MG is serious and can be fatal. #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:31:53	@asoulthernceliac that's also a good point. i personally love smiling anytime I feel strong enough to, that doesn't mean i'M healed. #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:29:05	I know it sounds silly but that's a problem I was facing a lot #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:28:52	A3 that not being able to get up or do the dishes is NOT laziness while on #depression or #bipolar #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:28:17	I found that SOMETIMES it's OK to kinda shock people.I wasn't taken seriously by some1 until I described in detail my suicideattempt #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:26:52	I think i would do good in schools and forums talking about my problems @IAmTakingCharge would love that to happen one day! #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:24:08	Such beautiful homes! #Bohemian is def a way to go for a cozy #home . Check it out: http:// buff.ly/1KZayFV
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:23:54	@asouthernceliac @wegohealth yes! call to action is quite good! #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:23:33	@tbear71 you've got that right! a balance is what we need #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:23:01	But just imagine a Vine of a hyperventilation? Not fun... #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:22:17	@wegohealth yes! just a number of suicides won't do any good, also just a tearful story will be quickly forgotten. so facts+emotions #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:20:15	@tbear71 making it simple might be good, BUT I'm afraid if u simplify too much ppl won't take the problem seriously #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:19:11	strangers do not affect us the way our families does #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:18:07	@asouthernceliac @wegohealth because strangers do not affect your life as ur family does!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:17:01	A2 when we talk we tend to get emotional, cause it's a hard topic for us. I think it's also important to reveal the blunt facts #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:16:16	I'd love to talk publicly but i don't know how to find anyone who'd want me as a speaker #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:15:47	@asouthernceliac Talking to friends&fam was a big step for me! But a needed one. @wegohealth #hachat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:14:11	A1 Talking is the best way to go at the moment. many people choose to close their eyes and cover their ears. That has to change! #hachat

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 03:04:08	@asouthernceliac I sleep so well, I normally don't need anything even on 12 hour flights! But a #book is always a good thing to have!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 02:38:15	@EricaRosaBlog there r many tips online, on pinterest.. but it takes a lot of time and work until a blog can yearn enough income!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 02:35:08	@roisiproven @katieemay1 @pintsizedtweets hmyeah,but brands like canon or tripadvisor won't be bother by anything non-related. #AskABlogger
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 02:33:01	@katieemay1 @pintsizedtweets and how you you approach them so they actually NOTICE you? #AskABlogger
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 02:32:24	@mariel_linskey sure but use message for these kind of things instead :) it's better!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 02:31:06	@iliketweet oh well that's more of a coincidence I guess? I mean I'm promoting, so if some1 wants to come and get me-I'm here. #AskABlogger
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-13 02:30:04	@mariel_linskey words you want to link, and somewhere on ur edit page there has to be this chain symbol, when you click it, you can add URL!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 16:15:29	Good morning! It was a difficult night yesterday... But i'm OK! I have the best warrior right beside me - my partner. #depression #bipolar
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 05:45:10	If i had the energy right now i would write a book, or a song, or a movie. One day i will! #depression #positivity #positivethoughts
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 05:21:19	Off to bed! I am way too weak to do.... well anything basically! Gnight and bless u all! #depression #bipolarmoments #bipolardisorder
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 05:13:34	Everything's so surreal when ur meds kick in after a meltdown. Weird feeling. Weird but calm. And that's what counts! #deprem #bipolar
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 05:10:58	@ReelCarina good comeback!!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 05:09:21	@ReelCarina well i ate cake for breakfast & lunch (just cake). Salad was our dinner followed by cake as a dessert, so about that balance..
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 05:06:23	@ReelCarina even without knowing that i've been eating cake i needed some #raw #salad to balance it out in the end tho... #whatveganseat
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 05:03:25	Having to deal with meltdowns is difficult... #depression gets the best of u sometimes. Meds r working now. I'm quiet... #bipolarmoments
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 04:55:09	@ReelCarina what?!?! I had to bring straight 1.0 (the best possible grade) for the application alone!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 04:53:53	Having such a support from my partner means the world to me! He did everything right, i could somehow manage... #bipolarmoments #depression
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 04:51:53	Had a meltdown after a long time. My bf managed to calm me enough to take my meds and talked me through it. He's a warrior! #depression
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 04:48:51	@ReelCarina but it's terrible! I would have been kicked out of the semester of it was in leipzig! Rly weird system u swiss ppl have :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-12 04:43:31	@ReelCarina r u sure? 5.5 is one of the worst grades possible! 1 is the best, 6 is the worst. At a uni 5 is not acceptable anymore

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-10 16:31:39	@BipolarBlogger @mayanorthen it's tough... I talked about that with my therapist. You telling me it's been 4 years rly made me gasp for air.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-07 08:22:59	@Markstorey65 @depressionarmy unfortunately it is STILL brave. We're being stigmatized and looked at differently. This has to change!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 16:03:09	@TheyLovetheAfro that's really good. I know so many who nearly went nuts cause they felt overwhelmed.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 16:00:18	That's why you should go #vegan ! https:// twitter.com/kyle1morell1/s tatus/594751369082499072 …

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 07:24:46	Can't #sleep . Too many ideas and thoughts in my head. It's driving me #crazy !! Lots of new drafts for my #blog tho... #InsomniaTweets
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 06:49:32	I'm really sorry for those penguins but it's a #cute story! http:// imgur.com/gallery/wLsWh via @imgur

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 06:11:51	@BipolarBlogger A wise woman just told me we shouldn't compare :D so everyone's different... Except for the diagnose. G'night Charlotte!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 06:10:27	@BipolarBlogger night night! I'm going too...!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 06:10:15	I'd love to create and distribute these! :D https:// twitter.com/RealDaniBre/st atus/594623842514898944 …
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 06:09:04	@BipolarBlogger Thank you! I've decided to stop taking meds and my doctor's agreeing with me (still) so we'll see where this will lead me!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 06:00:52	@xomisse @shaycochrane I see! I saw those just couple of days ago on @Pinterest and fell in love immediately!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:32:50	@TheyLovetheAfro oh i see! i understand ur point :) i guess it's similar to painting in a way :D sorry for a blunt comparison!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:29:52	@ReelCarina Na da..... wir müssen wohl auf englisch reden :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:29:26	@BipolarBlogger Ok. I am still starting my therapy. Now i see i have so much to learn about my state! I'm afraid of so many things...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:25:01	@ReelCarina Du bist ja eine Nuss :) Schauen wir mal :) Zürich wäre schon schön! So. Erstmal schlafen, dann planen :D Nachti!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:24:06	@BipolarBlogger 4 years..?? This just made me cry... omg i'm such no ready for this... dammit...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:19:27	@ReelCarina na vielleicht nächstes mal :) oder ich verreise... versteh ich da euch unten überhaupt? :D
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:18:41	@ReelCarina stuttgart ist super weit. wieso bist du da immer mal? Aber hey, Leipzig-Besuch lohnt sich immer :)
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:17:37	@ReelCarina schwedisch ist genial. hab auch angefangen gehabt aber es war mir iwie zu viel. meine freundin wohnt in Lund - super schön!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:16:23	@ReelCarina was heisst denn in d nähe? @StadtLeipzig rockt! Berlin ist allerdings wirklich nah... und Dresden! und Meißen!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:14:54	@ReelCarina definitiv :) auch niederländisch und russisch hab ich mal gelernt. aber ich verlerne iwie schnell :( mein jap ist grad schlimm!

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:11:04	@ReelCarina amen! :D das ist schlimm. und etwas verwirrend, wenn jemand auch noch gleichzeitig wo schreibt :D mein handy ist ganz heiss!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:10:21	@ReelCarina achso ja was vergessen! ich bin in litauen aufgewachsen :D hahaha! deutsche sind tatsächlich super schlecht.!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:09:31	@BipolarBlogger ... is it ever gonna be easier? I'm just 25...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:09:19	@BipolarBlogger can I ask u smth? since i'm borderliner too, not just my manic phases but also daily mood swings r difficult to handle...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:07:47	@ReelCarina schon mit 5/6 konnte ich dadurch eng reden und verstehen und bald auch lesen und schreiben auf eng. voll witzig!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:07:22	@ReelCarina erstmal - danke! ich bin quasi bilingual. meine eltern waren selten da u ich hab immer tv geschaut nämlich auf englisch...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:05:48	@BipolarBlogger Oh ok! I sometimes just do things that i care about but no one else does. not just work, but also hobbies in my case.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:04:41	@BipolarBlogger that's what I want to achieve and show to the others. I feel damaged a lot... And worth less... It's hard to talk about it.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:03:33	@BipolarBlogger :D i know what u mean (sadly). I'm def the "weird one".
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 05:01:41	@BipolarBlogger It's rly hard to get it as a young adult. i though i was roughly done with who i am/my personality and then it went south..
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 04:57:29	@ReelCarina bzw weiss ich noch nicht wie ich das miteinander verbinde.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 04:57:15	@ReelCarina Nee kein problem :) Ich poste auch mal was auf dt, aber eben selten :) ich will eig dt u en mischen aber weiss noch nicht wie...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 04:56:19	Do you really have those awesome Paris scissors @xomisse (ur cover photo). Those are so awesome!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 04:54:12	@ReelCarina ohboy... can a hastag really connect people? interesting.. will try to keep this in mind!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 04:53:09	@ReelCarina haha tatsache! naja, twitter ist eh sehr englischlastig und meine zielgruppe eben nordamerika ist :) wahrscheinlich deswegen.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 04:44:15	I'm such a #newbie still when it comes to #blogging ! @ReelCarina is hooked up really well and i don't know any good social events.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 04:38:46	@swetavikram @VeganGoodness @SpicyFoods @FoodPorn indian food is awesome! love it!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 04:37:58	@BipolarBlogger being well is still No.1 thing! But i feel u... When I'm in my good phase I meet people and do different things.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 04:35:52	@TheyLovetheAfro really? I'm completely different. I'm not a model, but i do enjoy having my natural looks!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 04:33:45	@BipolarBlogger I see... It was triggered in me so I kinda had a "before". However doctors said bipolar is something i carried all the time.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 04:07:39	@BipolarBlogger i'm a little bit jealous now.... I had to hide it for a while :/ it's not a good thing to do!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 00:45:36	@ReelCarina gotta read this!!!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 00:43:10	Being #bipolar and/or having a #depression doesn't mean we can't smile and it surely doesn't mean people should exclude us. #BePositive
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 00:41:53	I'm proud of myself for opening up. It's hard tho... @BipolarBlogger how was ur first step..? http:// sevenseasaway.com/my-big-secret/
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-05-03 00:40:04	I opened up bout being #bipolar and depressed and much more... Well sometimes life gives u lemons! #mydirtysecret http:// sevenseasaway.com/my-big-secret/

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 16:21:38	#2brokegirls became too safe... also that hot irish guy acts terribly and it's getting boring. Shame... I used to love it! @2BrokeGirls
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 15:46:44	@BipolarBlogger I wish you all the strength! I have a therapist finally, but it was a long journey. Doctors must be more sensible!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 15:35:04	@BipolarBlogger @Rethink_ I know.. If i hadn't my partner to help me I would have stopped the fight long ago... #mental illness r tough.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 15:33:46	It's raining in #Germany . So writing about activities on a rainy day is the best task for such a day! New #blog post coming this afternoon!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 15:31:15	@BipolarBlogger @Rethink_ I quit my therapy before even starting for so many times, 'cause i was bombarded with formalities! it was too much
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 14:57:27	A doctor asked me if i'm REALLY sure i want to continue being #vegan with such a judgement in his voice. Well, not going back to him.

3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 14:31:13	@Omgitstamz am I allowed to be girly for a second and just say: you're absolutely adorable! I fell in love i think
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 14:26:22	@Omgitstamz i think so too!
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 14:25:55	@Omgitstamz i love all people unless they're criminals. Then it's different..
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 14:24:35	@ProgenyofHope @Omgitstamz @amaraconda view being further away from all of that.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 14:24:22	@ProgenyofHope @Omgitstamz @amaraconda i am not blind and i'm actually not defending the shootings. It's horrific! But i have a different
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 14:23:38	@ProgenyofHope @Omgitstamz @amaraconda i'm pretty sure amaraconda meant slavery... So that (at least) changed quite a bit.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 13:41:38	It's raining still. And i'm too sleepy to think of a better tweet...
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 13:37:32	@amaraconda i will never be able to really understand how blind the gov wants to be there? For an european it's almost impossible to believe
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 13:35:50	@amaraconda oh wow... She has some "serious" problems.
3153766157	sevenseasaway	2015-04-28 13:32:22	@amaraconda but it really isn't... It wasn't back then (that's why it had to stop) and it isn't now...
