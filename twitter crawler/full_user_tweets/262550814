262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-08-21 17:48:50	Is Julia really that fucking vacuous? #9TheBlock
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-08-21 17:02:19	Taking predictions for who'll be the first to cry this season #9TheBlock
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-08-10 10:41:11	My gorgeous boy. Looks like an angel but he's a little ratbag #cutie #kittencuddles pic.twitter.com/6nHqk1sLbu
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-08-06 00:24:13	Just watched The Haunting Of...and I reckon I could be a psychic medium too. I see a small child/old woman/the letter D... #craptv #foxtel
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-08-05 18:42:55	Today I spent a squillion $ on pest control for non-existent beasties lest we fall into a situation like the movie Joe's Apartment!... #bugs
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-08-05 11:57:15	Coffee machine just crapped itself. Need a new one stat! How do I survive 'til then? Small things like my coffee make me happy. #ohnoes
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-08-03 13:57:36	Tried on some new specs today and I swear to God this is how I looked... pic.twitter.com/QhSwwWV7je
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-29 23:13:37	@GidgitVonLaRue I'm watching too. New depths reached!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-29 18:48:53	Watching #LifeInPieces and waiting for it to be funny. I so wanted it to be but nope...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-29 17:59:40	Sitting here listening to the soothing sounds of my kitten eating a pappadum. As you do... #hungry #crunchy
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-29 15:30:30	The kitten smells delightful...I suppose I should go and see what he's been up to! #naughtykitty
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-28 18:30:33	Day 4 of quitting smoking. Feeling slightly less murderous tonight #justabit
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-28 18:24:56	So the "big secret" was apparently revealed last night...please tell me she has a penis? I bet you it's just a kid though. #TheBachelorau
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-28 17:55:21	I just accidentally saw 5 minutes of #TheBachelorau ...I may never recover! I'm well known for watching crap on TV but that's a step too far
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-27 16:28:10	quitting is tough...not replacing smokes with food is tougher
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-27 15:44:58	@Nicola116 Yes...well. I've stopped now though!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-27 15:30:29	3 days since I quit smoking...feeling particularly stabby right about now! #stayouttamyway
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-26 19:47:27	Oh, come oooon, get on with it! More ads...really? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-26 19:38:48	@elena_jo_duggan deserves to win for being a good sport and helping Matt in the dying seconds. Plus hers looks great #MasterchefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-26 19:09:50	Elena talks in sound bites to hide her fuckup... #MasterchefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-26 18:55:26	Goddamn it...Heston's included a fucking parfait. #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-26 18:17:59	Matt: I'm going to back myself! ...After all, what would the judges know...they only score the food #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-26 18:07:18	Sigh...crispy skin Barra. Matt's playing it too safe, he's always crispy skinning something! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-26 18:00:48	Oh...is that a dig? Matt did confit yesterday too... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-26 17:48:45	We could probably do without the eliminated contestants stating the bleeding obvious throughout... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-25 19:15:52	Congrats Matt & Elena! Sorry to see you go Harry. Bring on the Grand Finale #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-25 18:15:53	That duck looks really oily...how can that be nice to eat? #MasterchefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-25 18:14:58	Don't say you're doing well Matt...you are asking for trouble! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-25 17:45:54	I like Shannon. He genuinely seems to care... Yes, I know it's his job! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-24 19:33:16	@Nicola116 sure was
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-24 19:16:18	Wow. Did not see that coming! #MasterchefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-24 19:01:33	How can a one trick pony get to the finals? #MasterchefAU #Elise
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-24 19:00:28	I feel sorry for Harry. Forced to make a dessert so Elise has to opportunity to make another parfait. #MasterchefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-24 18:40:22	The only smoking that's going to fix that parfait situation is a packet of Winnie blues! #MasterchefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-24 18:32:31	Even Gary's bored with a parfait #MasterchefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-24 18:30:18	Fucking Parfait!!! Just walk out now. Go on, make it a dome too... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-24 18:27:47	I don't even recognise some of the people on the gantry! #MasterchefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-24 17:53:45	Elise is now on my shit list for cooking ANOTHER fucking panna cotta! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-24 17:46:11	So Elise's fiancé has never met her? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-24 17:38:47	Cue many tears. Salty dishes ahead! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-23 12:25:47	So hot and windy here the washing keeps blowing off the line! Still, forecast says winter's back tomorrow... #blowy #summery
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-23 11:04:33	...another mass shooting? Fucking STOP IT people!!! My thoughts are with those affected #MunichShooting
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-22 20:25:56	Love them or hate them, you've got to admit the royal family make beautiful babies
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-22 20:23:08	The kitten keeps stealing a piece of capsicum out of the bin and carrying it around like a prize! #littleweirdo #naughtycat
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-22 20:01:14	Getting on the whole #StrangerThings bandwagon tonight...should I be scared?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-21 18:36:26	Bone in the quail! Unacceptable #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-21 18:26:31	I don't think the judges are using enough mandarin...disaster #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-21 18:18:10	Bloody domes! At least I should be grateful there's no parfait I suppose #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-21 18:14:13	Who the hell's that tall bloke? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-21 18:11:09	They've even got the insincere hugs down pat #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-21 17:59:04	My kitten is such an arsehole. He's become very bitey... #badkitty #drawsblood
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-21 17:55:01	...at least the judges seem to be enjoying themselves because this is just uncomfortable #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-21 17:43:04	I'd be a bit careful how I treated the judges...after all, they still have all the power and long memories... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-21 14:54:27	@GidgitVonLaRue Eighties slapper I would say!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 19:23:26	@Nicola116 yes
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 18:41:09	Holy shit...I thought Mimi was going to win the whole thing! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 18:36:02	So Gary makes his mind up before tasting the dishes? Doesn't really seem fair #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 18:18:59	You know that dance you do when you walk through a spiders web in the dark? Yeah... that! #Ewwww #canstillfeelitonme
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 18:10:21	Hmmm...you want to go into the 1/4 final but you can't manage a brownie? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 18:08:30	Harry's dumplings look good. I hope they are delicious enough to overcome his bland broth #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 18:01:15	Oh no! Crappy old ricotta instead of goat's cheese. Should have checked Mimi! Goat's cheese curd sounded like shit anyway... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 17:49:32	This has to be the loooongest ad ever! #telstra #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 17:46:38	Harry's dish is "week 3". Harsh but true! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 17:45:19	Why does George say everything three times? Does he think he's Marco? Stop it! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 17:42:14	Is a brownie really the best Elise can come up with to show her progress? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-20 15:36:41	My girl cat snores so loudly I've had to turn the TV up! She's very quiet when she's awake. #sweet #distracting
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-19 18:37:28	I could never work in a commercial kitchen. I don't take direction well. I'd be storming off in a barrage of fuck you's #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-19 18:33:06	Well done Matt. I have to admit I doubted you. #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-19 18:29:17	"1in 5 or half works for me..." Good thing Elena can cook! #MasterchefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-19 18:23:52	Oh no...bitter purée. Elise is in all sorts... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-19 18:06:11	Oh no. Mimi's forgotten her stock. Drama!!! Now she's going by instinct...disaster? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-19 17:54:37	Matt looks like he's seen a ghost! He's shitting himself... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-19 17:47:11	Harry thought he knew best...now he's in the shit! Follow the recipe people #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-19 17:40:42	Yay...savoury dishes, no domes or parfait for dessert! Happy girl #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-19 17:36:54	@MattsCravat #MasterChefAU Matt's looking so smart tonight!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-18 20:50:24	After 25 years you'd think I'd be used to the farting...but no, I'm not. It's relentless!!! #drivesmecrazy #marriage
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-18 18:23:18	Trent's brownie literally looks like shit! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-18 18:14:58	@GidgitVonLaRue too late!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-18 18:12:29	Too thick. The brownie, not Trent #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-18 18:09:40	Trent was too busy patting himself on the back to get his brownie right. #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-18 18:01:29	Oh Matt. STOP. Take a breath. Read the recipe. You can do it #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-18 17:41:06	But on the bright side...no parfait! Thank fuck for that. #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-18 17:39:36	...plus domes, sigh #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-18 17:38:29	Surely there are complicated savoury dishes that could be used... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-18 17:37:14	Ooooh...token hand wash! Well done #Swisse #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-17 18:46:56	Harry's grey mess looks awful. Nope, not pleasant #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-17 18:44:47	Don't cut it in half!!! Disaster #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-17 18:32:52	...and more domes. C'mon #gettingboring #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-17 18:27:54	Sigh...a filled dome. Isn't this an invention test? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-17 18:25:13	Fennel sorbet...I'll pass thanks #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-17 17:55:54	I have to say camel milk doesn't appeal #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-17 17:52:34	Oh...it gets worse. Parfait domes!!! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-17 17:45:36	...and Elise is making a fucking parfait! Grumble grumble... Surely not a finals week dish? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-17 17:44:06	So almost EVERYONE is curing their fish? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-17 09:38:26	Unspeakably naughty kitten. Got in the pantry and knocked the jars off a high shelf! The fish sauce bounced...unluckily the teriyaki didn't
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-15 22:19:15	MrQ is asleep, kitten's playing soccer with jingĺy ball on the tiles. Honestly, it's like having a toddler #noisy #verycute
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-15 19:44:22	MrQ just got home from a work function. He's smashed!!! #funny
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-15 18:30:59	I thought when the kids grew up I'd get to enjoy some personal space #nope pic.twitter.com/5nuDcjx61V
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-15 18:01:06	Not happy with the visitors... pic.twitter.com/wKWNmVfgYj
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-15 17:56:14	Next door's chooks came for a visit. Wonder if they'd miss one! #roast #mmmm pic.twitter.com/R5xG5kJTyo
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-15 14:44:12	MrQ is out for dinner tonight so I can have WHATEVER I please. What pleases me most is not having to cook! Now, what to eat? #baconithink
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 19:24:07	Gary's mushrooms on toast looks delicious #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 19:06:15	Oyster ice cream! I don't think so! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 18:46:17	Masterclass...yesss #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 18:42:11	Bye bye Brett #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 18:32:34	Mimi's dessert looks good #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 18:21:23	This is me... pic.twitter.com/PaSfEqzwEq
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 18:18:49	So instead of faffing around in the fridge Brett could have used pork belly in his jus... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 18:13:53	Harry's been quiet... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 18:12:37	Brett's fucked up his pork! I'm shocked #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 18:10:41	Brett should've used butter. Chicken stock's not going to do the job #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 18:08:27	Who has a freezer that's not cold in a commercial kitchen? Poor Mimi. She spoke too soon... #Masterchefau
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 18:05:29	Careful of famous last words Mimi! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 17:57:26	Wouldn't you check the pantry BEFORE you decide on your dish? Or is that just me? #MasterchefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 17:33:49	@binnightbot Can I change to Thursday please?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 15:37:28	Is it just me or is this the longest week EVER? #exhausted #fuckit
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 14:16:35	I love my slow cooker. I think it's great how I can spend 5 minutes chopping shit up, bung it all in there and in a bit there's a meal #lazy
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 10:45:36	Exactly pic.twitter.com/K6dGlBVRa4
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 10:28:45	Bad luck Red team. It's a shame a poop chute could be sending you home! #MasterchefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 10:19:19	Poo veins in the prawns! Onya Brett! That could come back to bite them in the arse. #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 10:07:11	No tacos Red team! #disaster #MasterchefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 09:57:19	Authorities report that they are investigating complaints Brett keeps touching his nose then handling food #nasty #MasterchefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 09:48:47	Why so negative Brett? Just get on with it! #MasterchefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 09:40:39	Prawns cleaned but still in shell? Be careful guys, doesn't sound likely #MasterchefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 09:37:38	Funny how both teams came up with the same soft shell crab and fennel slaw idea. I smell a conspiracy #MasterchefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-14 09:22:01	Matt "Has to be something we can eat off the bonnet of our cars..." I'd rather have a plate, but that's just me #MasterchefAU #catchingup

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-13 11:41:57	MrQ went to visit clients this morning, wife baked him scones. He was thrilled but wants to know why I don't bake for him every day? Pfft
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-13 10:43:24	Gah...even the professionals try to palm the judges off with a parfait. Luckily it was crap and he was sent home!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-13 09:59:10	Watching MasterChef-The Professionals (UK). I think our final 7 amateurs are better cooks! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-13 08:05:40	So, so true... pic.twitter.com/MSOiGbZJKG
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-12 18:58:34	Quite disappointed that #MasterChefAU gave me nothing to work with tonight. Everyone did such a good job, even the blue cheese was a hit!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-12 18:09:46	....aaaand the sorbet isn't set. She was warned! Ignore the judges at your peril. #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-12 18:01:12	Looks like a beautiful part of the world #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-12 17:56:00	Looks like they got the kitchen equipment from a scratch & dent sale! WTF? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-12 17:43:24	Blue cheese in a dessert? Just NO Mimi, have you learnt nothing? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-12 17:33:06	Bangers & mash here. Perfect for those of us who can't be fucked going all #MasterChefAU tonight!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-12 16:46:27	I've said #PokemonNo . Whose with me?

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-11 18:48:56	Watching The Kettering Incident. Matthew le Nevez makes an excellent bad guy. #bastard #ketteringincident
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-11 18:39:09	@GidgitVonLaRue I know. MrQ found 3 on our patio #holdme
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-11 18:28:38	I think part of every challenge should be doing dishes...like normal people. That would stuff them up! #shitheap #disgusting #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-11 18:20:25	Oh my God. Could that chick fit any more in her mouth? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-11 17:57:33	I'd have the shits with Harry if I was Elise! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-11 17:51:47	Famous last words...It should be alright #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-11 17:46:33	Ooooh...blood! I guess it counters the beetroot... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-11 17:42:57	Beetroot sorbet?...sounds hideous #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-11 17:40:12	I don't fancy either dish... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-11 17:39:21	Hmmm...more farking beetroot #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-11 17:33:50	Team challenge! Wonder if Brett goes rogue again? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 22:41:08	In a spooky country moment I can hear a cow mooing in the darkness #ilovelivinghere
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 19:11:54	Luckily he caught it so I don't have to burn the house down!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 19:10:20	Husband screams for help from the other room. Apparently there's a huge spider in there. Like I'm gonna go in there! He's on his own #yuck
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 18:53:20	Jus is not pronounced "jew" STOP IT! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 18:43:13	My kitten is cold. He is currently trying to wriggle up the sleeve of my jumper! #cutebutabitdumb
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 18:31:00	Good god. That sauce is puce! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 18:24:20	"The farmers walk in still wearing their farming clothes". Thank fuck for that! Did he expect them to be naked? #onyatrent #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 18:08:49	Stop saying "on the plate". Where else is it going to go...the floor? FFS #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 18:06:21	A sponge in two minutes? A nice light, fluffy one then. #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 18:04:05	Elise has baked some lovely chocolate turds for the judges #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 17:48:08	If anyone makes a fucking parfait it should be a ticket straight to elimination. #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 17:43:12	You'd think they've never been to the shops before! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 17:41:18	Is calling it "San Fran" a thing? #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-10 17:38:59	We don't see everyone else flying cattle class? More entertaining watching them suffer. Meanwhile the judges went 1st class? #MasterChefAU

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-08 14:50:20	Cats are on strike. I made the mistake of buying different biscuits. #don 'tdochange What does a cat strike look like? I hear you ask...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-07 18:36:45	Chloe must be devo. All that time... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-07 18:34:54	I hope George washed his paws! #MasterChefAU

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-07 18:22:12	Whenever I hear them say "plate up" I think of Nate Myles. I can't help it. #MasterChefAU

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-07 18:09:21	Meanwhile, Chloe makes scrambled eggs... #MasterChefAU

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-07 15:23:00	...and what's with Earl Grey tea. Nasty stuff. When my brother was little he used to call it "early grave"...and he was right! #shudder

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 19:05:43	Woohoo. MrQ's watching the Footy show so I can watch the CI channel in peace. He thinks that I watch it for ideas! #foxtel
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:42:56	Cue the insincere hugs #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:35:45	I'm just grateful noone made another fucking parfait #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:27:44	@jonslacksmith yes, but there were 3 panna cottas per plate
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:26:01	Elise, what were you thinking? You only needed to count to 60! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:20:54	Oh George, the yapping. STOP IT #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:17:52	@GidgitVonLaRue me too!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:17:10	That whatever it is under the fish looks like baby shit #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:15:02	@GidgitVonLaRue @NateMcGee86 I totally agree...I want proof
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:12:38	@NateMcGee86 Fair enough...but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of handwashing going on @GidgitVonLaRue
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:10:55	That pork looks overcooked... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:07:57	What's with all the bare hands in the food? Just no! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 18:02:13	Goat cheese and honey mousse...so wrong #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 17:33:46	Oh. Team challenge. Bags not Brett's team! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 16:37:03	6 years for murder? REALLY!!!! Unfuckingbelieveable #OscarPistorius
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 15:56:32	After my failure to remember to buy it yesterday, MrQ brought wine home with him tonight #lovehim #readyformasterchef
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-06 14:51:11	Cold and windy here in the valley. Great day for solar power though #sunny #westerlies #trackies #uggies #kittencuddles
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 18:49:24	Yay Shannon. Seems to be a nice guy too #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 18:48:03	Let's face it. Brett really needs that pin #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 18:37:32	Battle of the lambs #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 18:30:28	I thought Shannon had this, but maybe not #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 18:24:26	Yeah...fuck it. Some weeds from the garden will do! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 18:15:13	Brett is a walking disaster #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 18:14:03	I like Shannon despite his silly ponytail #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 18:12:32	Ewww blood... #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 18:11:33	@GidgitVonLaRue I would...if I'd bought any! #d 'oh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 18:09:15	But bearing in mind it's Brett, maybe not that much! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 18:08:15	Pressure's on Shannon! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 17:58:44	Jusges sound genuinly surprised that Brett didn't fuck it up #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 17:56:30	Yesss #MasterChefAU

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 15:41:13	There's a turd on the floor not 5cm from the freshly cleaned kitty litter. The kitten showed it to me. He's pretending it wasn't him. #sigh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-05 14:06:59	School holidays always make me grateful my kids are grown ups! #nowhingingcryingscreamingsnotnappies

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 19:05:44	MrQ got an #uber the other day. Nice car, pleasant driver, water and mints. Half the price of a cab! Very impressed
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 18:39:00	Teresa's gone again. Shame. I'll miss her lovely voice #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 18:31:08	Oh no...too sweet! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 18:29:52	Teresa's looks the best #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 18:21:35	Too stingy with the shavings there Mimi #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 18:14:02	Trent seems to have this #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 18:12:34	I take it back. Teresa's jam looks too thick and she's put too much in.When it's too late she decides it's too sweet? #stress #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 18:08:00	Not seeing much of Teresa tonight #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 18:06:32	Careful with that mandolin! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 18:05:22	Cutting corners is never a good idea on #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 17:57:18	Poor Mimi's having a hard time of it! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 17:55:16	Gah...parfait in a pressure test? I'm so disappointed #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 17:48:11	Oh no! Disaster already? Fancy not pressing start on your timer, you'd be kicking yourself #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 17:40:29	Oooh Lambo! Should be straightforward #famouslastwords #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-04 17:35:12	Seems wrong watching Masterchef on #WIN #MasterChefAU

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-03 18:42:50	Very disappointed with the lack of crying. Obviously not enough pressure on the contestants #HouseRules
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-03 18:41:25	So wrapped up in the show I forgot to tweet. #HouseRules
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-03 16:32:38	Looking forward to the #HouseRules Grand Final...and the crying! Go #LukeCody and Queensland
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-03 15:14:41	@Woogsworld @smh Most of us are as horrified as you!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-02 14:02:57	So...MrQ dropped his iphone in the spa. Busted out the rice. Any other tried and true tricks to bring it back to life #doofus #expensive
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-02 13:56:57	@DenyseWhelan1 6 at the top too. That took long enough to negotiate!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-02 13:55:00	Interesting. I'm used to being in a safe LNP seat. New electorate and no LNP how to vote cards. I didn't want one of course but... #voted
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-02 13:41:37	No sausage sizzle, no cake stall but no queue either. Did my bit for democracy #voted
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 20:13:47	Squab....oh yuck. Flying rats. #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 20:03:21	I would have punished my son if he are like George does! Horrible. #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 19:40:21	I'm up to date...and there's a Masterclass. Happy girl. #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 19:38:35	Chloe survives by the skin of her teeth. Yay #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 19:37:44	Hardly seems fair that the guys who got stupid colours are penalized #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 19:34:03	But then Heather serves up that shit! #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 19:31:31	I think Chloe may be stuffed. Which is sad. #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 19:19:17	Nice and elegant! Looks like a pile of shit #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 19:18:21	Oh. No indigo plate, shock horror! #FFS #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 19:06:19	...but is there an indigo plate? Did she check first? Ooooh the tension #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 19:03:35	Elimination round and there's, you guessed it...a bloody parfait #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 19:01:55	I keep finding the kitten's soggy mouse toys in my boots #shudder #evilsurprise
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 18:01:12	I think it's time for another Masterclass! #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 17:00:18	The waitors look like a bunch of stereotypical movie vampires! #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 16:51:21	Um ah. Those looked like bought biscuits. Please tell me I'm wrong? #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 16:49:06	No George today? Did he have something better to do, you know, rather than his job? Oh well, no yapping. #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 16:42:03	Teresa has such a soothing voice. #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 16:40:31	Oh...I forgot. Fucking tempered chocolate! Sigh #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 16:33:58	Chocolate challenge. I sense domes, spheres and possibly parfaits in the very near future. Hope I'm wrong. #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 16:01:19	Vegemite icecream...I can't even...nope #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 15:57:36	Methinks Brett and Chloe are in trouble... #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 15:52:20	MrQ's out for EOFY drinks so I have a rare evening home alone. What to have for dinner? #dontwanttocook #lazynightin

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 14:26:14	Gary says that the contestants are thinking outside the box! I think they're serving up the same old shit again! #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 14:24:20	That chicken looks suspiciously crispy skinned... #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 14:18:42	I think the contestants really should be wearing hairnets. #strayhairsinyourdinner #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-07-01 14:15:49	While I'm going I think the time for tempered chocolate has gone. #MasterChefAU #catchingup

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-30 19:43:17	Was George raised by wolves? Why does he eat that way? Yuck #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-30 19:33:05	"They" should take away the molds! https:// twitter.com/tartanthermos/ status/748478596243566597 …

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-30 17:03:14	Kicking ourselves we didn't call our new kitten Dyson when we had the chance! He'll suck up any food going...ANYTHING! #missedopportunity
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-30 15:23:17	Beautiful day here in the Lockyer Valley. Nice and warm, clear skies and lots of birdies tweeting. #luckytolivehere #lovewinter
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-30 15:04:09	Bernard Tomic should be thoroughly ashamed of his recent comments. Shame we let specimens like him represent our country on the world stage.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-30 14:51:23	Oooh...Brett's gone rogue. Classic #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-30 13:31:41	Blue cheese icecream...vomit! #MasterChefAU #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-30 13:30:40	#MasterChefAU Another fucking parfait! Grrr #catchingup
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-30 11:15:46	@QueenslandGrl she's hilarious! #funnyjoke
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-30 09:43:30	My Mum was saying they picked a strange name for the new model of car advertised on TV...the 'EOFY'! #bless
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-29 19:35:43	@rahest Not the only one!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-29 18:45:20	What's with all the bloody parfaits? Ban them I say. Would make better TV if they didn't make the same thing all the time! #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-29 18:30:08	What is with all the hugging? They've known each other a month! I've got dear friends of over 30 years I don't hug that much #MasterChefAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-29 17:43:32	Catching up on my #MasterChefAU . I've managed to avoid all news of eliminations thus far! #shhhh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-28 18:16:03	#TheForceBehindTheLine certainly isn't doing Perth any favours. Makes it look like they're all crims or scumbags #imsureitsnotthatbad
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-28 16:50:57	Will be glad when the tax year is over and MrQ can start coming home at a more reasonable hour #whinge
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-28 16:44:47	Love how excited the kitten gets when MrQ gets home from work. He adores his Daddy! #catz
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-27 19:35:24	Just started watching Wynonna Earp. Not sure how I feel about it yet. #maybe #maybenot
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-27 19:18:17	Husband is bleating on about how long tonight's show has gone on and on and on... #HouseRules
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-27 19:15:55	Bring on the Grand final. #LukeCody vs #ClaireHagan . Worthy opponents #HouseRules
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-27 19:09:03	YAHOO yay #lukeandcody #HouseRules
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-27 18:53:21	I think #filandjoe are in trouble #HouseRules
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-27 18:42:22	I wonder how nice that sandpit will be once the neighbourhood cats find it #litterbox #HouseRules
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-27 18:40:06	I don't care WHAT the judges say, that wallpaper is horrendous! #HouseRules
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-27 18:32:20	What a cutie! #HouseRules
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-27 18:29:51	OK, I'll admit it. I'm a bit misty eyed. #HouseRules
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-27 18:26:01	Go #lukeandcody ! #HouseRules
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-26 17:29:41	Hagan wins! #crying #HouseRules

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-26 15:25:05	Put together new patio heater. It's at least 7.5' tall...patio roof 7'! #notgunnafit #damnit
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-25 17:55:25	Comfort food followed by kitty cuddles on the lounge. The perfect winter's night. #niceandwarm
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-24 09:33:24	Three years later, he hears a knock and opens his door. He finds the same snail on his mat. The snail asks, “What the hell was that about?”
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-24 09:32:42	#dadjoke A man hears a knock and opens his door. He finds a snail on his mat. He takes the snail and throws it as far as he can...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-23 20:48:45	So the #AEC want is to practice voting now. Do they truly think we're that stupid?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-23 19:04:48	Watched #cops earlier and was feeling all superior as an Aussie...then I watched #RBT . Now not quite so smug!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-23 18:13:13	...so the little bastard casually walked up, bit me and ran away. #evilkitty Did I do anything? No
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-23 18:11:24	Told baby boy cat that if he bit me there would be consequences... #hethinksheshuman
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-23 17:03:19	The warmest place in the house #catz pic.twitter.com/D2d6vE8QE5
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-23 16:59:22	Just removed 30cm piece of curling ribbon from girl cat's throat! Could have been nasty. She doesn't normally chew things. #scary
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-22 20:16:17	Queenslanderrrr!!! Love those boys #Origin

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-21 18:48:58	#HouseRules Sounds like Joe's getting lucky tonight!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-21 18:30:48	#HouseRules That water feature looks like something I'd clean out of the cat litter! #poop #LukeandCody
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-21 18:06:39	#HouseRules Was enjoying show without Brooke blubbing all over the place. Now Joe's at it!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-21 17:44:15	#HouseRules Good on you Hagan! Dial before you dig. #stinky #expensive
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2016-06-19 18:07:27	@binnightbot Stop
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-05-09 10:33:32	Stuck in the carpark at #GrandCentralToowoomba have moved 10m in 20 mins. Unacceptable!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-05-08 18:13:42	It always gives me the heebie jeebies when they use a mandolin on #MasterChefAU and Marcus has just proven me right!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 19:54:32	There's something seriously wrong with Tim. Why so aggressive? #RamseyNightmares
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 19:25:13	Seems to me a new chef who can cook would be a good start #KitchenNightmare
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 19:23:35	Let's face it. Tim is a deadset wanker #RamseyNightmares
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 19:08:30	Frequent course language warning on #gordonramsey show, everyday stuff around here!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 19:02:59	Goooone, piss off, you're out! Time to go Ash & Camilla #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 18:51:35	I think all this "deconstructing" of classic & popular recipes should stop at once, seems like laziness to me #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 18:44:12	"Italian meringue, pretty easy to make". Sounds like famous last words to me! #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 18:21:27	It would take ages to cook whole spuds, why not cut them up first. Now they're going to soak up all the water and be soggy #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 18:07:55	Karen's kept the girls undercover for once! #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 18:07:28	Ash is looking 1 part teary, 4 parts crazy #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 17:52:36	I fear that Will is a bit of a liability to Steve. And by a bit I mean a fuck load #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 10:19:16	I have a confession to make. I don't like macarons. I know, right? I feel so alone in this #yuck
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-28 09:44:36	Gorgeous here at the beach! pic.twitter.com/ctoWiPYafa
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-27 19:10:30	Drasko & Bianca. Don't let the door hit you in the arse on the way out! #gooone #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-27 18:53:01	Drasko : wawa the cake is SO sweet wawa, it's dessert fucknuckle, it's supposed to be sweet! #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-27 18:37:46	Did Bianca honestly just say "everythink" ? Sigh #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-27 18:31:01	Thought so...arseholes! "Ohhh, it's not clear" & "hang in there" #DraskoandBianca #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-27 18:13:56	Cop that Drasko! #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-27 18:04:22	I fear that Drasko and Bianca are going to be arseholes tonight. You know, for a change. #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-27 18:01:07	Ash has lost the plot! "Sounds like toilet" ...yummy #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-27 17:58:35	Nice of Pete to dress up, not! #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-27 17:52:13	I love being on holiday, especially the last minute, surprise kind! #sunshinecoast

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-27 15:08:47	@SawHole I'm a sweet cider or wine kind of girl. Not much of it these days though!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-26 17:39:09	Normally don't watch #TheBlock live. What's with all the ads? #soannoying
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-26 17:33:55	So you're going to donate the prize money IF you win Anastasia? 1 you"ve got buckleys 2 I call bullshit #TheBlock
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-26 17:31:25	Did Anastasia just drop an f-bomb? #TheBlock
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-26 17:12:11	You are not Bipolar about something Dee, it is an illness! Get it right #TheBlock
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-24 16:29:39	Husband suggests that if I start knitting baby booties, Grandchildren are sure to follow. #impatientlywaiting
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-24 10:07:02	In the market for a new smart phone. Have loved my iPhone but may be ready to move on. What are your picks?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-23 20:01:32	@DanieTreg All the angels and demons are getting a bit old aren't they?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-23 13:17:48	What I want to know is, who's the poor bastard that's got to clean up the shit heap Tim & Anastasia left in their apartment? #TheBlock
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-22 21:04:40	I don't think Tim knew they had no money! Allocated the money my arse!!! #TheBlock
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-22 20:54:56	I really don't like Tim & Anastasia anyway, tonight just confirms my opinion. What a waste of time and effort. #theblock
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-22 18:42:01	I hope Drasko and Bianca aren't going to be dicks about everything! #mkr
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-22 13:44:26	@SawHole Makes me feel very squeamish! My SIL loves them.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-21 19:40:11	Just watched #TheCentralParkFive on #CI . Shocking and sobering.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-21 17:08:03	Must be about time to bust out the slow cooker and the electric blanket! #gettingcold
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-21 16:45:19	Missing my Maxi boy cat and his cuddles even more on this, the first cold day of the year.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-21 09:16:43	Apparent temp 2.3°, I think soup might be in order for lunch! #chilly
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-17 14:09:27	Watching RHOMelbourne and the restaurant cat fight! Where's the class ladies?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-16 09:22:26	Watching the Snickers ad, I always think Alf Stewart is going to rip his teeth out when he takes that bite! #ewww
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-15 07:42:44	@toecutter789 @DanieTreg Yes, I heard that things got quite hairy!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-14 16:49:53	@Nicola116 Maybe. Dunno what's wrong today. Don't like playing around with dosages though. Sigh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-14 15:18:30	@DanieTreg @toecutter789 The beard wanted it's own trailer on set and to renegotiate terms?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-14 15:11:39	...that or the break-up with the beard aged her dramatically!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-14 15:08:27	Why have Trivago dumped the young couple? Now it's some older chick having way to much fun on her own. Bangkok looks nice though...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-14 14:54:12	Heartburn is really kicking my arse today. Well, not my arse, obviously, but.... Well anyway, it hurts!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-14 14:41:11	If roles were reversed and a mid 50's bloke slobbered all over 28 y/o woman there would be a riot, not just humour and mild revulsion. #yuck
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-13 18:26:25	@Nicola116 Cleaner joins in on fashion show like a boss. Amusing
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-13 18:17:21	I'm liking the new Mars bar catwalk ad
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-13 09:31:16	Kitty's new collar is driving her crazy, she can no longer creep up on us silently as the bell is really loud. Cute watching her try. #noisy
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-12 16:49:49	@Nicola116 Guess what he's eating for lunch tomorrow! MrQ get the pick of the meat tonight.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-12 16:40:48	Sigh. Go to all the trouble of cooking a roast with all the trimmings and son informs me he and GF are going out for dinner. #whybother
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-10 09:50:45	Fuckity Fuck. Just stubbed the toe I'm fairly sure I broke the other day...don't mind me as I hop around a bit being sweary! #blackandblue
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-09 17:30:17	@Nicola116 remember this? ROFLMAO
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-09 17:26:16	@Nicola116 It's tough. My willpower on her behalf is much stronger than on my own.

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-08 19:43:01	Why is Kat YELLING! It's not like she's going home. #psycho #MKR
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-04-08 16:52:27	@DanieTreg ...and why was he wasting resources making them march up and down hills, presumably for his own amusement?

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-02-22 13:22:23	Scones are a success...husband impressed with himself #imsurprised
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-02-22 12:03:21	Husband has decided to bake pumpkin scones as I refuse...cue many questions, sighs and much whinging! #annoying
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-02-21 08:55:42	Fridge not working after last night's power cut...husband now attempting to fix it #whatcouldpossiblygowrong
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-02-20 17:54:36	Husband and son are horrified I said knob on Twitter #meh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2015-02-20 17:07:44	If your avatar is a picture of your knob you can safely assume I'm not going to follow you back! #JustSaying
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-11-16 18:15:04	@traceyb65 thanks, salty water it is! Not too bad at the moment.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-11-16 17:21:15	@traceyb65 thanks x. I don't have either 'til a chemist opens tomorrow...going to be a long night. Perils of living in a country town!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-11-16 17:08:41	Saturday night and I've broken a tooth. No emergency dentists in town=a painful couple of days til I can get it fixed. Painkillers anyone?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-11-15 13:00:38	@DanieTreg fun times x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-11-15 12:44:47	@DanieTreg I know your pain...it used to happen to us if we were silly enough to use the kettle & toaster at the same time!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-11-07 11:38:08	@MagicalBrunette cool. Am here if you need a chat.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-11-07 11:26:28	@MagicalBrunette Hope you're OK. You can do this! xxx

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-17 10:04:31	WTF? Have we, as a society, stooped to having to flavour raisins to get kids to eat them? pic.twitter.com/wr67sluOJq
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-16 16:06:44	Riots in the streets L.A? Is that really the best way to get your point across?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-08 06:20:30	Even though he had to drive past our bin, he even stopped, it wasn't emptied-luckily no seafood or "mystery bin juice" involved @Woogsworld
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-08 05:56:26	@binnightbot Hiya. Bin night for us is a Sunday! Thanks.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-08 05:46:40	@Woogsworld @binnightbot Thanks. The council used to collect on a Tuesday arvo, the bastards just changed it to early Monday morning.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-08 05:41:01	New bin day = panic bin run in short nightie & ugg boots! Annoying...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-04 21:24:54	@DenyseWhelan I had to defer, just not well enough at the moment.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-04 20:59:56	Another day, another medication. 7 separate ones now. You would think I might feel better!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-03 08:34:44	@lybliss Disgusting but better than him not cleaning it at all!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-03 08:33:34	Husband and boy cat "fighting" for possession of sock...husband won, cat now scratching furniture in a fit of rage.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-02 12:43:31	@QPSmedia : Serious traffic crash on the down section of the Toowoomba Range. Emergency crews en route, avoid the area please. Again!!!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-01 13:32:36	Oh, brings back childhood memories! http:// pinterest.com/pin/2488943168 79522693/ …
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-07-01 09:29:22	@Magnetoboldtoo Oh yuck...I would go on strike, or wait 'til someone goes on lunch and switch with them!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-29 19:18:35	@Woogsworld @StMurphy Icy cold Coke and cold pizza.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-29 19:16:02	@downlittlelane Yep, I prefer to see it as a pest free, peaceful evening. ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-29 19:14:21	FFS...son has been faffing around with a chip packet for the last 5 minutes, so annoying!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-27 19:06:39	@MagicalBrunette Makes it real though. He has always disappeared on you when things are difficult.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-27 19:02:40	@MagicalBrunette Nothing will until he knows what he's dealing with...hopefully it's not as bad as he imagines.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-27 19:00:56	@MagicalBrunette @DanieTreg Ozsale often has Opi polishes cheap.

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-25 18:50:18	@DanieTreg Ewwww
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-25 18:01:50	@VeronicaFoale You could include The Block, where they have to build the kitchen first...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-25 15:06:41	@MagicalBrunette I had a deep burn on my finger, was OK then became infected, PawPaw ointment fixed it right up...just in case!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-25 15:05:13	@MagicalBrunette @DanieTreg Dolased are great if you are happy to go to sleep...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-25 14:50:56	I find it hard to believe that a giraffe chase could be terrifying! @9NewsBrisbane
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-25 14:10:39	@DanieTreg Call them "vegan leather", can't go wrong!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-25 13:12:37	@catebolt Sounds like you are having fun!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-25 10:58:12	@tinagraydotme That's how I prefer to think of it ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-25 10:47:55	@tinagraydotme I do that too...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-23 11:40:03	@mattiethereader Absolutely!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-23 09:27:23	@BreatheInHope I know, right? I had to defer couldn't get my head around it with my current medications/state of mind.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-23 09:23:32	@MagicalBrunette If you need to talk DM me. x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-21 15:05:29	RACQ Toowoomba. Fantastic, quick service! Thanks

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-20 11:18:48	Mr lost his f*cking glasses AGAIN! He is always losing them, but now even I can't find them. I am going to WELD other pair to his face!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-20 10:16:44	New carpet installed, only took the real estate 5 months to get it done. Hope the roof doesn't leak again!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-20 10:13:01	@Woogsworld Too bloody cold to think!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-20 09:47:22	@MagicalBrunette Do you see a pain specialist? Helped someone I know a lot.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-19 11:33:31	@MagicalBrunette Yes, huge. You have to watch all the trades & builders like a hawk and turn up unannounced to see what's going on...often!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-17 20:52:36	@catebolt My cat opens the sliding doors too...or bangs on them, whinging to be let in. Sometimes you see a paw underneath...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-17 20:44:33	@GidgitVonLaRue I wondered if he barricaded the door to stop him getting out!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-17 13:47:51	@Lindat44 combination of steam inhalation with menthol, Fess spray, Horseradish & garlic tablets & Sudofed...and sleep. Good luck!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-14 15:34:31	@surelysarah might not be a bad idea :)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-14 15:30:42	@surelysarah Must fancy you...or maybe you just look nice!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-14 08:32:13	@crazycuddles I've also given up additives, salt, fat & caffeine since April. Making a big difference. :)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-13 18:11:48	Gary's mash looks like glue! #Masterchef
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-13 18:07:18	Hate the awkward laughter whenever George makes a lame joke. Clearly they are sucking up! STOP IT AT ONCE!!! #Masterchef
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-13 17:37:14	I can't trust Maggie Beer after Burnt Fig ice-cream. You just don't know what other f*cked up shit she's going to come up with! #Masterchef
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-13 17:32:44	Wouldn't it be great if the contestants were not allowed to speak on tonight's show? #bliss #Masterchef
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-13 17:29:31	@crazycuddles Sure does, but if you eat them all the time you just don't realise how horrible processed foods actually are.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-13 16:24:28	@Woogsworld @JuliaGillard I certainly wouldn't do it!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-13 10:51:01	@crazycuddles I had some tinned soup yesterday for the first time in months. The taste of salt and chemicals was so strong it was awful.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 19:42:25	Looks like some snuggling weather is on the way... #lovewinter

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 19:09:21	Love her or hate her, Julia Gillard holds the position of Prime Minister of our great nation. As such, her position demands respect. The End
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 18:24:27	I just cannot believe that these people ate that shit...they must have been paid a fortune! #Masterchef
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 18:16:22	In the words of Texas Car Wars...If Clarissa doesn't stop singing and "I had a glass eye, I would put it in a sock and beat her ass with it"
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 18:13:28	"Too many cooks spoil the broth". In this case, none of the cooks can freakin' cook! Sorry, can't rhyme, too shocked #Masterchef
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 18:07:02	How did they get so many bad cooks in one place? It's not like most of them have personalities that will get them through... #Masterchef
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 17:49:19	@crazycuddles Might try the ice-cream...purely for medicinal purposes of course!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 17:43:17	Oh, Noelene's face...classic!!! #Masterchef
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 17:38:17	@crazycuddles Thanks anyway but I just can't do bubbles, and if I burp I will spew. Will have to take a tablet. x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 17:31:50	Heartburn is really kicking my arse tonight. Well, not my actual ARSE of course!!! You know what I mean...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 17:24:10	@crazycuddles Life without parole, after chemical castration, with all the other sex offenders...never to be heard of again. Death too easy.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 16:48:18	@mimbles Hooray! I felt so alone... ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-12 16:43:34	I feel like an outcast. I cannot bear the taste of Maggie Beer's Burnt Fig Ice-cream! Tell me I'm not the only one... #nasty

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-05 14:35:12	@Magnetoboldtoo Call the hospital, they should be able to tell you. x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-05 11:56:01	I cringe when the bin men get to our place and the silence of the afternoon is shattered by the sheer number of booze bottles in the bin!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-02 14:19:29	@MagicalBrunette Classy!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-02 07:06:38	...and then listening to him throw up for the next hour and a half. Some things never change! Brings back some "blurry" memories!!!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-06-02 07:04:29	There's nothing quite like waking at 3.30am to the sounds of your drunken teenaged son taking 10 minutes to open the front door...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-05-23 15:51:25	@realzoeymartin good luck...might be time to break out the buckets and towels just in case!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-05-21 10:05:00	@MagicalBrunette We used to have a postie who rode around armed with secateurs to keep things tidy...a loooong time ago!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-05-18 16:19:16	It's so cold, time to break out my Mother's Day heated throw I think! Give it 2 minutes and I will have cats all over me!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-05-02 20:02:42	I was on the phone today when I was asked if the noise in the background was my grandchild? Alas no, it was the cat whinging for bikkies!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-05-02 18:33:39	@natpeck I think it's kind of expected that kids will eat junk at parties and you don't use much, certainly less than lollies contain.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-30 17:53:17	Commando doing squats...I am speechless! Oh lordy, they zoomed in on his "pants"
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-30 17:31:49	@KCoTweets I wasn't at first, was grouchy and tired, then my skin broke out...joy! Have lost 6 kgs and migraines have stopped. So worth it!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-30 17:25:22	@KCoTweets It is a diet plan by dietitian. I'm already a vegetarian on the verge of vegan and thought it was time to ditch the junk
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-30 17:20:53	@KCoTweets Thanks...easier than I thought!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-30 17:17:07	I haven't eaten sugar, wheat, yeast, fat or consumed caffeine for 3 weeks...and I haven't killed anyone! I actually feel pretty damn good.

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-23 18:33:11	@jessovenden @magicalbrunette I have to agree. Comes a time when maybe it's just not worth it. IMHO he sounds like bad news, sorry.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-23 11:23:39	Still waiting for dental anaesthetic to wear off, even my scalp is numb!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-23 11:22:22	Hooray, security doors being fitted right now! Feel safer already, and will be able to let in more air & light without losing the cats. Yay
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-23 10:39:32	Survived my root canal. It's amazing the difference a good dentist makes!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-22 19:19:34	It occurs to me that if Reese Witherspoon can't get away with the line "...but don't you know who I am?", then I have no chance. How sad!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-21 15:17:15	For those with stinky younger teenaged sons take heart, one day he will blossom into a lovely smelling boy, if a little on the strong side!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-19 14:46:20	My husband speaks so loudly on the phone I cannot hear myself think!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-18 17:57:39	@MagicalBrunette check under chairs, beds and between dining chairs and table, under blankets & cushions...that's where our guys go
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-17 17:59:53	@LovelyWife hopefully that will take his mind off it then. Does he normally have allergies?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-17 17:57:50	@LovelyWife maybe lay him in a coolish bath to try to take the heat out of it?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-17 17:55:44	@LovelyWife he must be going out of his mind! I've never seen anything like it.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-17 17:53:18	@LovelyWife oh, poor thing! That's terrible.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-17 17:26:05	@MagicalBrunette yep, they will!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-17 17:23:36	@MagicalBrunette somewhere as safe as possible, you will need it in the future!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-17 16:31:23	Gorgeous! http:// instagram.com/p/YMwBYUGKtj/

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-15 18:13:41	Katie is scary when she's not crying...I think maybe anyone who took temptation should sleep with one eye open for the rest of the week! TBL
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-15 09:07:49	@MagicalBrunette Not all of them, just the wrong ones.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-14 19:06:57	Last night I dreamt that I ran a marathon then went out dancing for the night with friends. That is patently ridiculous, I have no friends.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-14 18:28:43	@Sar_Wah I personally don't think she has what it takes to even get in! Far to sensitive
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-14 18:19:40	OMFG...that was an ugly cry #biggestloserau
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-14 18:18:57	I don't think someone contemplating joining the Army should publicly cry as much as Katie does. #BiggestLoserAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-14 18:00:04	I am so, so very tired of reality/competition shows where competitors do nothing but cry! Harden the f*ck up people!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-13 20:53:27	@NikitaBombita Amazon free kindle books, some of the cover pics look decidedly dodgy!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-13 19:44:24	@Sar_Wah good luck!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-13 19:43:17	@Sar_Wah one day I will, have started the process, loooong way to go!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-13 19:39:41	@Sar_Wah it does, doesn't it?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-13 19:36:59	I would LOVE to do a triathlon. Love it! Problem is I'm too fat to run, I am too clumsy to ride a bike, and this girl doesn't do swimsuits!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-10 18:16:03	@MagicalBrunette ...or it's because you caught him out! You are too forgiving.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-10 09:24:32	@MagicalBrunette There is a reason why ex's are ex's! What an arsehole!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-09 17:46:25	@JustBAustralia @theprojecttv Just doing what he does, not worth the effort to get worked up about it!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-08 12:05:25	@mimbles I was never "allowed" to do it. My son was always under the impression I was going to do something heinously embarrassing
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-08 12:03:20	Fluffy sheets on the bed last night, fantastic nights sleep! I love it when it's finally cold enough to sleep under a Doona too.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-08 11:25:04	A few months ago I was losing hair by the handful, now I have so many baby hairs that I have a fringe. Wish my existing hair grew as fast!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-03 19:03:09	Thunder, lightning, the way you love me is frightening... Well, this storm is! Hope our power stays on tonight.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-02 19:10:47	Shhh, don't want to jinx anything but the power is back on!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-04-02 18:39:03	Stupid storm, power out. Too early to go to bed. Grrr

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-30 14:53:19	Had BBQ lunch, things are now very quiet. Guests gone, boys in a meat & beer coma. The best thing, leftovers for dinner = no work for me!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-28 13:39:55	@MamaBakers when he was a toddler, my son used to stand on a chair and "wash" up his dishes. Kept him quiet, helped me keep the floor clean!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-28 12:44:43	Cat has slipped her collar somewhere in the house. Now she's walking around naked, shameless little hussy!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-28 10:40:40	@misguidedmuser They transferred it to our other account. But our rent and pays etc will fail. Don't know what happens if no other acc!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-28 10:15:28	Shame ANZ Shame! Mass closing of bank accounts,without warning,1 day before Easter. No regard for deposits and transfers. Not good enough.

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-27 12:06:11	Yay, council next door cutting crap out of Jacaranda tree.Always thought I loved them (the tree, not the council),until I lived next to one!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-27 09:45:57	Watching maniacs tightrope walking at ridiculous heights. Didn't they watch Cliffhanger? Made me feel ill from the safety of my lounge...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-14 19:29:29	Oh, and apparently Psychologists only last 4 years before they become as crazy as their clients. WTF!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-14 19:27:46	...because apparently everyone who sees a psychologist just needs to buck up and get on with things, or given a kick up the bum.

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-10 09:40:52	@EssentiallyJess Looks like a "face hugger" from the movie Alien attached itself to the back of your head ! Roflmao
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-09 12:14:20	@miss_elisa_lee More Doomsday Preppers, ragin Cajuns & intervention, but that and the various bridal, weightloss and weapons shows too!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-09 11:10:34	Many of the shows I see on Foxtel make me fear for the future of western civilisation...luckily not much Aussie content! #scarypeople
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-09 04:58:50	Woohoo, well done! “ @HesperasGarden : Hurrah! I farted! Means I get breakfast!! #aftercaesarean #ihadababy #hungry ”
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-09 04:51:59	@HesperasGarden Fart away, there is no dignity in childbirth! ;p
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-09 04:50:52	@HesperasGarden Congratulations! xx
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 19:21:30	@EvanChapple Woohoo...see you there!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 18:21:36	@Mr_Emmasbrain Yes. He thinks he is hilarious. We shall see how hilarious it is when I remind him at bedtime - for the next month!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 18:19:00	When the debate is over, slander becomes the tool of the loser - Socrates. How true.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 18:06:43	Arm is swollen due to today's flu shot. Showed husband and he said "Are you sure it's swollen and not just a little fat arm?" Hmm thanks hon
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 17:43:04	@toushkalee True.What is it about our little boys, they do things that should horrify us but we can't help that twinge of pride or amusement
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 17:26:19	@Toushkalee Ha, but a chequebook is so old school...it will be your credit card online!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 17:16:56	@Toushkalee Are you sure? He seems to think he will get away with it. Hilarious
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 17:14:03	@ReadySet2School Trying to. Hopefully it will be Ok. x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 16:30:48	Proof that people really can be unpleasant hiding behind the relative anonymity of social media. Disgusting. http:// ow.ly/iyj93
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 16:19:28	@traceyb65 Bugger. I do have to force myself to stay awake sometimes.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 16:05:03	@traceyb65 I know exactly what you mean. Feeling extremely foggy and my memory is completely shot...I am having trouble even recalling words
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 16:02:51	@readyset2school Hi. It's a bit overwhelming if I'm being completely honest. Have a feeling it's coinciding with the start of a mood dip. x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 16:00:31	@traceyb65 Tell me about it...and I'm not sure it's right yet! Just keep coming up with new things to deal with. xxx @miss_elisa_lee
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 15:55:12	@miss_elisa_lee Thanks. Hopefully I will be able to drop these ones in a few months.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 15:54:10	@frogpondsrock Excellent, I shall have my people arrange petit fours.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 14:48:00	@frogpondsrock haha, I am a Princess, my blog & office door say so ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 14:36:59	@frogpondsrock didn't bother with 3G either, enough places have WIFI up here, might not be as many where you are though x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 14:28:01	@frogpondsrock I went the full sized IPad, the mini was just too small to be useful IMHO :)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 14:24:37	@frogpondsrock
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 14:13:08	...another Doctor appt, another drug to take. I swear I must rattle when I walk!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 07:12:01	@veronicafoale @dreshubby Exactly. Mature people are able to manage differing opinions without resorting to name-calling and hatred.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 07:02:30	Revolting...Kochie presenting with a mouthful of food...and he keeps talking over other people. Now I remember why I don't often watch!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 06:57:16	@dreshubby @VeronicaFoale Ridiculous. Surely not accepting someone else's right to a differing opinion is intolerant?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 06:52:51	Chris Brown won't stump up $10 for valet parking at a charity event...FFS. Why does anyone bother with this dickhead?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 06:45:45	Quitting smoking...just get the f*ck on with it! If I could do it anyone can...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 06:20:18	Interviewing kids on TV, cute but excruciating.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-08 05:01:18	Hmmm...trying to update photos etc on IPad is a challenge. There are times when a touch screen is a pain in the butt!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 18:14:07	@kann_david Haha
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 18:04:52	Stop saying babe FFS! #mkr

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 17:17:55	Watching COPS and feeling superior... #trash
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 17:08:20	@hesperasgarden That's the spirit! Lol
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 17:07:52	@hesperasgarden ...as if you aren't stressed enough. If it is any consolation there are an awful lot of us sending good thoughts your way x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 17:04:41	@hesperasgarden It both amazes and disgusts me the things people say on social media.I can guarantee she wouldn't have said it to your face!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 16:59:13	@hesperasgarden You are joking! What a terrible thing to say to someone, reprehensible. I myself wish you all the best. x @edenland
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 16:55:17	Takes a special kind of scum to not pay for their own wedding! Asking respectfully to be left alone...no way! Lock 'em up! #TT
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 10:37:36	That would definately dampen the mood! Poor woman. http:// ow.ly/itOct
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 10:32:28	My back is so very sore,but also itchy and prickly. Last time by day 3 it felt OK. I also wonder whether I have a temp... #waah
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 07:56:06	@edenland Possibly worse though, a commenter on @Woogsworld said you live in Queensland! Oh the horror ;) Good luck with the test results x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-07 07:08:37	@chickensbees Exactly, it's distressing isn't it?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-06 17:44:49	What is with all the "babe's"...someone smack them! Maybe it's a reference to the pork! Bloody annoying anyway #mkr
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-06 17:32:07	@Magnetoboldtoo @goodgoogs @fivefrogsblog me too, but it was 4 yrs. Having root canals and they were fine...it's the skin cancers that hurt!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-06 10:41:34	@danietreg hahaha...so only the "beauty challenged" should use crutches?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-06 10:39:18	@danietreg It's because we are sexier and more confident when in love & happy!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-06 10:32:10	@beloverly Boo to grumpy old people!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-06 06:45:00	@Ms_MotorbikeNut There is, I'm signed up with them. Just doing it a bit hard ATM. It will work out. x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-06 05:03:38	@Ms_MotorbikeNut Hi. Tricky this week, health issues have dominated making it a bit hard to keep up...I'll get there though! x You?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-06 04:57:12	Another day, more rain, fog & wind...and it's getting colder. Roof leaking...still waiting for plumber. Oh and my back hurts...a lot #whinge
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-05 19:12:51	My back now hurts more than it did before I took my pain meds! Hope I can sleep tonight :(
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-05 17:43:17	@annaspargoryan Oh Promite, used to love it. It's been forever since I had it. Might have to add some to this weeks shopping list. :)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-05 17:27:23	@rahest ...'cause he's Scottish! Cute isn't it?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-05 17:24:36	As per previous tweet! Heat pack hogs. pic.twitter.com/TQI99TebFP
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-05 17:18:04	@Mumdeep @glowless I don't have one either. Bipolar + credit card = TROUBLE
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-05 16:47:31	My back hurts, still this time I know the skin cancer is all gone. Worth the pain. #ikeeptellingmyself #owie
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-05 16:41:26	Before I can apply a heat pack to myself I have to heat up one for my cats too...or they will sit on mine, while I'm using it! #spoilt
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-05 09:15:10	@TroppoMum worse, when you have a sip and realise it went stone cold an hour ago!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-05 09:14:09	Off to the surgeon for my re-excision. Don't wanna go!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-05 08:26:36	Drizzle, pfft. I don't think so...it's pouring!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-04 18:33:36	@RedlandCityGirl Thanks. Ibuprofen can't go with my other meds. Not hot, had hysterectomy, could be stress. Possibly chocolate - tragic. :/
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-04 18:26:06	Owwwww, my head hurts. Why have these migraines started now? Any tips/tricks to help with the pain?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-04 10:57:14	Dr Phil "...somewhere a village is missing it's idiot!" Haha, classic!!!!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-04 09:57:22	Knew it was too good to be true, had a bit of blue sky, few minutes of sun. Put washing on line. 5 minutes later, blowing a gale & raining!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-04 08:39:35	Yesterday I ignored flashes in my vision. Today I have a terrible headache, and I think I'm going to throw up. Supposed to be off to Uni :(
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-04 08:35:28	@MagicalBrunette Holy Crap. Our Real Estate renewed ours two months early!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-04 08:30:29	Ahhh, Biggest Loser ads on TV. Not long before Commando Steve is back on our TV screens. Lovely!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-03 14:55:38	@kann_david @news_watcher1 ...at least we will get new lounge room carpet. If it EVER stops raining of course!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-03 14:41:06	@news_watcher1 @kann_david Plumber has been out 4 times, fixed 4 different things, still flowing through...glad it's a rental!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-03 13:59:11	@news_watcher1 @kann_david ...not good when our place is leaking like a sieve, plumber can't find cause. Wet carpet stink is the pits!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-03 13:38:04	@news_watcher1 @kann_david Windy, rainy, foggy & 17deg here. Who called Queensland the "Sunshine State"?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-03 13:09:11	@kann_david @news_watcher1 Ta.

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-03-02 09:30:01	Busy here this morning...new aircon being fitted, new leaks through walls and ripped up wet, mouldy carpet with landlord. Plumber coming...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-25 16:03:25	“ @misguidedmuser : @QueenslandGrl if it was an adult maybe they could pull it off. But not a 9yo.” Too right! Just plain wrong.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-25 15:53:20	@misguidedmuser That's just not right...and to cover it up by calling it humour or satire? I'm sorry, I think we all know who the c**** are!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-25 06:03:46	@ms_motorbikenut Good luck!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-22 14:54:18	Two root canals this morning, anaesthetic has worn off and it hurts...can't help but think that ripping the suckers out would hurt less! #ow

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-20 15:35:47	My little mate came back. Was waiting for me when I got home from Uni! Despatched further away this time, again by deployment of Tupperware.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-20 10:29:49	I need a t-shirt that says "I would love a red frog sweetheart, the second they don't have rendered animal bits in them!" #vegetarian #uni

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-19 13:45:02	@RedlandCityGirl Bit far unfortunately. Nasty little thing is giving me the heebie jeebies...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-11 17:10:39	@theshakeau Thanks, I'm sure I will! Let's face it, has to be an improvement on the pain I was in before. x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-11 17:08:26	Survived the root canal...just. Currently doing a fairly good impression of a chipmunk. It didn't hurt earlier, sure does now!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-10 15:44:31	Just watched The Impossible. OMG...no words. Well, maybe a couple, Naomi Watts = brilliant, Kids = excellent, Ewan McGregor = not so much!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-07 18:35:21	@GidgitVonLaRue #MKR Another suggested question could be... Do you actually like food? Instead of this I don't like this, I don't eat that
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2013-02-07 18:31:28	Do you think that ditz understands the difference between cake and Creme Caramel? If they turn out the same you're not doing it right! #MKR

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-11 07:21:33	Woke up this morning to find a text advising that my phone has won $1,000,000 in a lottery I never entered...woot, just in time for Xmas! ;P

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 12:36:47	@magicalbrunette 3+ months, which is probably about where I am at now, but it can take a lot longer. Just glad I had already given up work!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 12:33:33	@traceyb65 @MagicalBrunette Yep, unfortunately. Still have exhaustion and joint pain though not so many flu type symptoms now.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 12:30:26	@magicalbrunette @traceyb65 If I could just be up all the time life would be magnificent ;P Problem is what goes up...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 12:26:46	@traceyb65 @MagicalBrunette I am OK,up and down, trying to manage reduced meds due to health complications plus Ross River is kicking my ass
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 12:22:24	@magicalbrunette @traceyb65 Have forgotton entire months of this year-medication will do that.Probably not a bad thing on reflection though!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 12:20:49	@traceyb65 @MagicalBrunette can look back and see the periods of mania, didn't recognise it at the time. Just have to deal with it now.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 12:10:09	@MagicalBrunette ... but I have never been psychotic, just chaotic and destructive!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 12:09:13	@magicalbrunette Me too, the things I put my family through! For me, mania feels so good it never occured to me there was a problem...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 12:06:20	@MagicalBrunette @traceyb65 Problem for me is I only got depression treated which is why it took so long to diagnose...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 12:05:03	@magicalbrunette @traceyb65 It certainly explains a lot about the times in my life when things went haywire!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 11:49:43	@magicalbrunette @traceyb65 I have had it for 30 odd years looking back, it just didn't almost kill me until this year!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 11:29:18	@MagicalBrunette @traceyb65 Whatever works for you, I use psychotherapy and CBT, but then I've only been diagnosed for 6 months...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-12-07 08:55:13	@traceyb65 @MagicalBrunette While it doesn't make it all better,for me it does help a bit,both to have an explanation and also a way forward

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-11-15 07:37:45	...then you gag on the "pleasant fruity taste" and throw up the juice you did manage to choke down...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-11-15 07:36:27	...so you mix it with orange juice, which makes the juice taste like shit...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-11-15 07:35:45	You know when anything medicinal says it has a "pleasant fruity taste" that it is going to taste like shit...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-15 17:13:34	@magicalbrunette Ewww true, but not usually called "tits"...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-15 17:10:51	Someone found my blog by searching "tits girl".Hmm,bet they were disappointed!The question remains though,what other type of tits are there?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 16:58:47	@sar_wah @traceyb65 good luck. Thanks x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 16:50:14	@sar_wah @traceyb65 .Doc considered it but it is quite closely related to some I reacted badly to. If Cymbalta fails it's next...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 16:48:07	@magicalbrunette Hasn't really classified it. But I have mega depression and have had multiple mania periods, and some mixed to spice it up
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 16:31:21	@traceyb65 TY.It is just a battle to find meds that don't make me either sick or manic,or both.Wanted to admit me again,talked him out of it
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 16:03:11	@traceyb65 Hope it works for you, made me sick.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 15:55:05	@traceyb65 @PuppyOnTheRadio @crazycuddles @MagicalBrunette Not well. Depressed & bad medication reaction, hope this new one works!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 15:02:51	@magicalbrunette @crazycuddles I have had the "fog" for a year, combo of drugs and depression/mania... you name it. Kind of get used to it
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 14:55:13	@magicalbrunette trying not to lose track of everything I've been on. Brain fog doesn't help!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 14:48:23	@magicalbrunette That was his other choice but it's pretty close to others I haven't tolerated...whole thing is crap.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 14:42:50	@magicalbrunette running out of stuff to give me :(
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 14:39:22	@magicalbrunette Epilem, Seroquel Xr, Diazepam/Lorazepam, coming off Avanza atm, start Cymbalta in three days time
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 14:36:24	@puppyontheradio @crazycuddles @MagicalBrunette @traceyb65 Originally thought depressed until I ended up in hospital, dx Bipolar
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 14:34:13	@magicalbrunette I am really sensitive to the meds and keep having bad reactions. I am sick atm, they don't know what it is, blaming meds
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 14:29:41	@crazycuddles : @MagicalBrunette @QueenslandGrl @PuppyOnTheRadio @traceyb65 I'm Bipolar too,working on the 8th change since diagnosis in May.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-14 13:57:59	MT @crazycuddles @PuppyOnTheRadio @MagicalBrunette @traceyb65 I live in hope that my Doc eventually gets it right. Hope all OK xxx
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-13 08:59:38	@magicalbrunette MWAH...finally someone who understands! It is quite isolating when everyone thinks you should "just get on with it!"
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-13 08:56:16	Much nicer day today...contemplating walking over to the farmer's markets, not sure I can gather the strength though. #pathetic
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-12 16:17:17	Ridiculous, hot enough for aircon on weekend, today so cold had to switch to heating! #coldsnap
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-12 09:10:51	Wow it's a cold, windy one today.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 19:08:14	Watching AFP...the Bali bombings...still an absolute tragedy for all the victims, whether they be the dead, the injured, the Balinese people
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 18:52:16	@misguidedmuser She looks and sounds like Wallace's girlfriend from "Curse of the Were Rabbit"...yes, I am a dork
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 18:48:01	Funny to see the contrast between Michael, a genius and Layla, who...isn't #BBAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 18:42:09	@lybliss well, maybe "they" are normal and I'm not...that is scary.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 18:39:29	@lybliss Disappointed that Channel 9 said it would be better, with "normal people" but it's the same old crap...but I still can't look away
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 18:34:27	It's hilarious that house-mates are on camera ALL the time but if a camera is mentioned all the girls go and trowel on the make-up #BBAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 18:29:55	I just love Ben, he is fantastic #BBAU
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 18:27:33	Bipolar is hard work. Between managing diet, exercise and enough sleep, there's yoga, mindfulness & relaxation exercise & learning about it
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 18:21:43	@sar_wah I do to, I think everyone is just in it for themselves, she seems sweet. Really dumb, but sweet.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 18:07:14	...hmm not once when discussing their fight and possible break-up did she say she loved him! #Brynne
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 18:05:03	I know when I fight with my husband and the cops get called the first person I call for help is my make-up artist...WTF #Brynne
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 17:58:41	#Brynne complaining about how messy babies are, does she not see that this is where her marriage is heading?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 17:50:47	Oh I have to get some of those GOLD workout shorts...magic #Brynne
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 17:46:03	I think Tobias wanted those heels! #Brynne
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 17:40:59	Is that baby wearing a Jeff style wig? #Brynne
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 17:39:56	@sar_wah You would think...otherwise the dress was actually not bad!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 17:38:02	I can feel that poor dog's shame #Brynne
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 17:36:13	They are laughing AT you #Brynne
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 17:35:34	Oh nice bra strap #Brynne
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 12:06:26	It's so cold I had to break out the throw rugs again. Great day to snuggle up on the lounge and do nothing.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 08:32:44	@magicalbrunette Tell me about it. I still may end up there yet but hopefully I will handle the change better than expected.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 08:07:26	So another medication change to go through. Managed to avoid hospital to do it though...just! #enough
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-11 07:59:50	Horrible weather...good day for doing nothing at home :)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-10-10 19:14:20	@mumofanaspie I just find it a bit hard to reconcile their strict morals with the way the girls & women dress and behave. All that make-up!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-09-10 19:00:24	@traceyb65 Well good luck with it all, it is a battle to get meds right. I just wish I didn't keep landing in hospital to do it!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-09-10 17:45:47	@traceyb65 I'm sure you will be fine. Many people tolerate Zoloft well,hopefully you will too! I am just overly sensitive to medications. x

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-09-07 06:57:20	@sparklepanda Especially when they don't work! I will talk to him...if it works we can find the $$$
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-09-07 06:45:05	@sparklepanda Don't think so. Will mention it if and when Avanza fails.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-09-07 06:42:42	@sparklepanda Zoloft made me physically ill and my depression much worse. With mix of seroquel & epilem I might be able to handle Avanza
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-09-07 06:39:12	@sparklepanda No that's OK, it was the Zoloft,so I'm back on Avanza hoping not to have the previous side effects. Mania better than suicidal
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-09-07 06:33:58	@sparklepanda Epic med fail. So over this crap! Just have trouble seeing the point of everything if this is all there is left.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-09-07 06:28:52	@sparklepanda Sure am.

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-30 18:38:17	@magicalbrunette Happy to, since last year I get so anxious when there is a thunderstorm!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-30 17:34:23	Thunderstorm, rain & howling wind...lights flickering. Hate storms.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-29 17:20:50	@MsCharlotteD Good on you for standing up to bullies, should be more of it! #aca
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-28 08:07:15	@MagicalBrunette that's why we are taking it so slowly with mine, everything else has done that so far!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-28 08:04:11	@MagicalBrunette Zoloft...it's making me feel like crap too! Reduced my seroquel xr at the same time... Oh the joy!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-28 07:05:34	@MagicalBrunette That sucks, hope all goes OK. I am now up to a half dose of my new lot, fun isn't it?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-28 06:11:44	Outraged to see protesters attacking Police horses in Melbourne. However strongly they feel about things that is not OK! #Groconpicketline
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-25 07:43:21	Medication change = bad sleep = cranky Jo. Off so a walk in the sun to try and make myself feel better.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-24 17:36:44	@edenland Brotherly love, there's nothing like it...unfortunately!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-24 17:32:32	@edenland ...at least he's sharing I guess?

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-24 17:30:29	@MumofanAspie ...and the joy of waiting weeks for them to start working while you get sicker #frustrating
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-08-24 17:27:21	So, if I didn't feel crappy enough now my new tablets are making me nauseous, dizzy and giving me dry mouth...cheers. #cantwin

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-25 09:08:31	I feel so ill even my hair hurts, if I had a temp I would think it was flu, but I dont , i think this is a drug reaction. Back to square 1?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-25 08:54:17	Dr now 22 minutes late FFS, I could be sitting on my arse at home doing sweet f/a right now! Except for the mania that is...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-25 08:38:08	“ @sparklepanda : @QueenslandGrl You made me snort! I hope you get some help today. xx” Me too, thanks. xxx
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-25 08:31:31	Dr's office again, so over this crap. When do we get to the point when GP's & Specialists start 'doing' instead of just 'practising'? #grrr
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-24 12:00:41	Ok, so I think I am actually sick rather than just a drug reaction, dunno tho, this is what it felt like last time...I've had enough!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-23 19:15:20	@mylittledrummer Thanks xxx

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 20:06:27	Nurse came in and drugged me...I would love for it to work, have my doubts. Said she will "talk to" my Dr in the morning... OooOoh, scary!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 19:35:21	“ @sparklepanda : @QueenslandGrl there's no one left he fancies. Poor lad.” It's OK, he still has himself!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 19:32:17	“ @sparklepanda : @Woogsworld And if they say "my truth" I will stabby my own eardrums.” ... Seal's insincerity is the worst part!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 19:28:32	For once in my life...I wish I didn't have to listen to this song!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 19:26:15	@sparklepanda it's a first, dunno. Supposed I should talk to a nurse... better than the usual crappy feeling, hope I don't crash & burn!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 19:24:18	“ @sparklepanda : @i'm still nuts, just heavily medicated nuts. Might be a bit slower in a fight!” it's ok, no need to fight, you have Keith

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 19:15:27	Disappointing...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 19:13:11	Stop talking about your 'journey' FFS, it's just singing...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 19:10:38	“ @sparklepanda : @QueenslandGrl Who is singing what?? I have no tv dammit!” I'm to hyped up for details, everyone except Karise is crap!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 18:51:13	Now I get it. It isn't about the singing or the songs,it's trying to outdo each other with my life was fucked look how far I've come stories
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 18:46:11	@Glowless In this life there are fuckwits, sometimes you just have to roll with it!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 18:44:16	“ @goodgoogs : @bigwordsblog it is not good. Also, why is she singing angry?” the stupid song choice I'm guessing...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 18:34:42	Kinda glad the voice ending, getting sick of all the "I've gotta say's" and calling each other 'brother', not sincere IMHO, Karise to win!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 18:02:32	“ @KerriSackville : Beautiful, beautiful song. Truly. THAT is what makes a true artist. Go Karise. #TheVoiceAu ” WooHoo, she's a winner!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 17:53:33	@Denwise1 thanks for asking, sorry but I have to say not that great, feel like I'm jumping out of my skin, heaps of things on the go at once
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 17:48:19	I want my own wind machine...oh wait, I'm married, I have one ;p
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 17:46:44	Hmmm, must sound better live!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 16:04:32	I have my cranky pants on tonight!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 10:05:08	@sparklepanda thanks, just so over it all.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 10:04:21	@sparklepanda other income but strict budget doesn't allow hundreds of extra medical $$$ every month
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 10:02:36	@sparklepanda nope, and you also have to be on a bipolar med to qualify...not sure these newest meds are much use anyway though...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 09:41:53	Gorgeous day here on the range, sunlight, fresh breeze. Perfect day for a walk in the park!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 09:29:11	@sparklepanda ...and the bastards sent a bill for ultrasound, taken as an inpatient when there was no discussion or agreement it was extra!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 09:27:39	@sparklepanda ...no centre link, can't work...so annoyed. Doc has 2 days to change that med, I can't afford it...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-17 09:25:50	@sparklepanda it isn't on the PBS unless you have certain conditions so I am looking at a couple of hundred $$$ a month in meds, plus docs
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-16 06:54:18	Going out with my lovely hubby today & tomorrow. Freedom...I can almost smell it! After over a month here I want out #stillnervous
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-16 06:50:28	@sparklepanda It is isn't it?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-16 06:42:46	When patients have a particular medication time, maybe you should be ready FFS, you're quick enough to make us stick to schedules! #justatip
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-15 19:53:28	@sparklepanda cool
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-15 19:47:36	@sparklepanda he might have been talking about the slow release maybe? I am on both types
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-15 19:15:40	“ @sparklepanda : @QueenslandGrl lamotrigine?” seroquel
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-15 19:10:11	@sparklepanda pissed off one of my drugs isn't on the PBS though! Hopefully won't need that one for too long! #bloodygovernment
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-15 19:08:23	@sparklepanda if it doesn't work I can come back in after a week(something to do with health fund as its been over 33 days) but I WILL be ok
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-15 18:38:10	Looks like I might be going home on Wednesday... pleased and shit scared in turns!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-14 06:31:20	A serious lack of understanding... http:// queenslandgrl.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/selfis h.html …

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-13 11:08:43	“ @sparklepanda : @QueenslandGrl Any word on freedom?” nope, only just started new meds again and have some medical issues they are looking at
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-13 10:29:01	Ho hum...nothing's changed, still in hospital one month on...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-12 06:55:00	Waiting for breakfast. Fasting scans suck! Now I have an anxious wait for results, no sleep and my meds had to be taken late :'( #poorme

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-11 07:33:07	I had to resort to green tea this morning due to the no milk fiasco... a step too far methinks...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-11 06:49:27	Might go all out and get dressed this morning, I might even brush my hair "gasp"...no need, but I have always been a rebel like that! #bored
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-11 06:45:08	@Skip91 hmm, yes. It must have seemed like a good idea at the time. Lucky for single rooms, unluckily there are shared bathrooms...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-08 19:31:02	@sparklepanda Hysterical girls on the piss type laughter...good for all of us!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-08 19:20:24	@sparklepanda I think they need to market it, would make millions. Wouldn't have thought it was a psych ward...or maybe you would? LOL
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-08 19:18:47	@sparklepanda Sorry to hear that. Yes, horrible.I can start the new one while reducing the old though so ok,it makes you sleepy too - WOOHOO
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-08 19:15:09	Much hilarity and silliness on the ward tonight, must have been "something" extra in the tea! Made a nice change to the usual...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-06 04:49:32	Horrendous night, despite sleepers kept waking up, then had killer nightmare and woke up in full panic attack #fuckitall
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-06 04:46:45	Raindrops... http:// fb.me/1jRpMqY7P

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-05 19:04:02	@sparklepanda @Skip91 @katielou2050 Thanks ladies!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-05 18:29:48	Goodbye... http:// queenslandgrl.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/goodby e.html …
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-05 16:07:22	Exhausted, nothing left in the emotional tank. Knew it would be hard, funerals always are. Back at the hospital, let the healing resume!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-05 10:11:12	@Nicola116 yeah, a funeral! Fanfuckintastic!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-04 13:31:52	Why do visitors to hospital wards stand around in hallways talking at the top of their lungs #selfishfuckers
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-03 17:05:49	“ @Glowless : @QueenslandGrl Do you end with "whateveryourbloodynameis" ?” Yes, I do! Hilarious!!!!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-03 14:48:53	@Glowless definitely not, I call out my husbands, sons, daughters and cats names when I get flustered...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-03 14:46:19	@Nicola116 should be but people insist on being with me so I never have a moments peace...Very stressful! I appreciate visits but...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-02 17:59:48	I hurt, aching all over! Waiting for medication...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-02 16:24:50	Two more weeks in here at least... #bummer
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-02 05:28:34	@sparklepanda They are, last night they gave in and gave me sleepers,i had forgotten what sleep feels like.Still feel like crap ;) #quietday
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-01 18:15:27	Medication changes are truly awful, I can only imagine what an addict's detox is actually like, because this is horrendous!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-01 11:06:12	@traceyb65 @sparklepanda Ta, and not a proper Dr to be seen, only psychiatrists! ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-01 07:14:57	Today's post is a bit of a cop out, I just didn't have the emotional strength to do the one I promised! http:// queenslandgrl.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/friday -cop-out.html …

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-01 02:19:34	Life is hard enough without giving others the power to hurt us emotionally. We fret, they don't even notice or care... pic.twitter.com/jqTcLskn
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-01 01:34:43	now, as If my life couldn't be any more shit, the nurse thinks I have the flu. Really...FFS! And the sleep/anxiety meds aren't working...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-06-01 00:40:10	@sparklepanda got some really bad news, in the right place but feel I'm being selfish not being there to help out . Stupid but that's me!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-30 03:37:54	If Justin Bieber attacked me the only danger I would be in is if I hurt myself collapsing with laughter...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-30 03:23:42	“ @PeskyPippi : @QueenslandGrl You couldn't help but stare.” I just laughed so loud the nurses will probably be along to check on me! ;(
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-30 02:57:51	“ @PeskyPippi : My daughter’s hamster had the most gigantic balls. Hamster : balls ratio = wow! #justsaying ” omfg hilarious.

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-29 17:52:20	@Nicola116 haha...like her foster auntie
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-29 17:51:19	@Skip91 just hard to hold it together when you have barely slept for a fortnight!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-29 17:43:54	@Nicola116 hehehe
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-29 17:40:28	“ @Nicola116 : @QueenslandGrl still have 3 games of netball to get through this week though :)” meh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-29 17:37:13	“ @Nicola116 : I've got a rotten cold :(” that sucks!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-29 17:28:42	“ @Skip91 : how are you today Hun? xx” Kind of blah, feeling a bit hopeless tbh, but they promise I should sleep tonight, baby steps! Thanks x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-29 17:24:52	Well today has been full of ups and downs, no sleep, more medication, not as traumatic as yesterday but still shithouse...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-29 17:21:56	“ @Nicola116 : @QueenslandGrl Oh i missed this tweet, will get right on it, great idea ;)” excellent!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-29 04:48:29	Oh, still here... Meh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-29 04:13:00	“ @Nicola116 : @QueenslandGrl Did you get what you wanted from the scary nurse?” No! Hence much of my trauma...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 15:19:46	“ @Nicola116 : @QueenslandGrl Hey, you hanging in there?” Yes, very traumatic morning, lots of tears, bit better now :s. x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 05:08:22	“ @Skip91 : @QueenslandGrl not going anywhere xxx” Thanks Hon! x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 04:44:29	If you stay, you rock and I love you. It won't be pretty but it is real, raw & painful for me. Still the same cranky bitch tho,so watch out!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 04:39:07	...so I understand if you need to stop listening. But I ask that you leave quietly, without judgement. I will miss you. To the rest...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 04:35:30	...I am choosing to put my pain out there hoping to relieve it, and am not apologetic for that. I understand that it's too much for some...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 04:32:49	... so if you can't cope or don't agree with me sharing I no longer care, listen, don't listen, comment or don't...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 04:29:55	I am not looking for random sympathy or attention, I spent my life holding back and not being honest about my feelings.i am changing that...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 04:24:19	Another dawn I wasn't sure I would see...not sure how I feel about it either. I fear I'm losing this battle #honesty pic.twitter.com/o7h0uKyW

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 02:47:08	Sorry my lovelies, will be one of "those" days, surprising I hear you say, best to tune out now so I don't bring you down too, wish I could!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 02:41:54	When the nurses are nice I cry,when they aren't I get mad then cry, cry in therapy, always crying,drink a lot of water to keep up with tears
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 02:25:33	Have woken to a new, albeit early day, already feel awful, clearly it will be a beauty...just wish I never had to wake up again...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 02:19:31	@traceyb65 do try, have recordings to work with. Seem to be clenching my jaw/grinding teeth in my sleep!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 02:16:01	@Nicola116 :D
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 02:15:09	@Nicola116 ...no, the unit manager, she's scary and I want something she doesn't want to give me, but it would help me so much...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 02:12:07	“ @Nicola116 : @QueenslandGrl who? therapist?” Ha, should have been nice weekend ,not mice, but whatever floats her boat I guess...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 02:10:05	@GlasSydney Thanks, purple & butterflies, especially purple butterflies are a "thing" of mine atm, just trying to feel less "hospitally" x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 02:04:44	@sparklepanda ...so distressing. Taking everything I have to hold it together, nothing left to help with the reason I actually came here...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 02:02:09	@sparklepanda ...think it will help. Just beginning to think I am never going to get better, I feel worse every day! OCD is new and is...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 01:57:43	@sparklepanda Yes, but the Valium doesn't cut it as prn dose too small & other one freaks me out, just want a night or two of deep sleep....
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-28 01:50:15	@sparklepanda Strangely enough my 18 y/I won't do me any drawings, maybe my little nephew could...hint @Nicola116 !
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 20:44:15	Have a potential confrontation tomorrow morning.,,hope she had a mice weekend
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 20:42:05	Some of my pretties, trying to make this place s little like a hospital as I can! pic.twitter.com/whUmHSw5
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 20:40:14	@Nicola116 I won't be allowed out to go :'( .., have acres of wool now, just need craft & quilting stuff (& cheap cushion covers lol
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 19:20:57	@traceyb65 Too exhausted to swear! Lots of restless energy as OCD means everything has to be perfect and nothing is, just cant sleep! xxx
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 16:29:50	@traceyb65 They are..coming off one lot really fast and starting newies fast is hellish. So exhausted physically & mentally but can't sleep
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 16:24:05	Truly enjoyed my trip to shops this morning an hour after meds, I kept wandering off or staring into space...very groovy man ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 16:18:58	No Dr today so can't get anything to help me sleep, bucket of drugs they give me knock me out quickly but I wake up 3 hours later...sigh!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 16:16:38	I take it back...dinner was crap. They peaked early today with a great lunch...sad face.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 15:21:33	There are two chefs here, one goes out of his way to make tasty, interesting vegetarian meals, the other gives me boiled veg & salad...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 15:18:28	@Nicola116 Took me 3/4 of an hour to make bed this morning coz I couldn't get the sheets even or the blankets flat...I have lost my mind
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 15:16:15	@Nicola116 OCD, feel ill, 3 hours sleep, not coping, am worse than when I came in! Room looking quite princessy, except it smells of glen20
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 12:05:00	@Nicola116 Not really, new shit to deal with every day. Suffering today, crafting and suffering! 3 hours sleep despite drugs, meltdown #meh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 02:59:18	@MumofanAspie Yep, sure can. xxx
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 02:56:03	@MumofanAspie Thanks, I think it is medication change rather than sick...sigh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 02:49:30	I just knew yesterday was too good to be true!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-27 02:29:43	Feel hot, every part of me aching, blinding headache, teary...trying to divert myself rather than getting anxious... #thisissofucked #enough
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 17:08:20	“ @SawHole : Woe is moi. Missed my friend's birthday party due to lurgy.” You feel better soon too, keep warm! x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 17:06:54	@SawHole : How are you today? Very average, better than yesterday but only as I have more meds I think! A couple of cries. Thanks for asking
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 14:53:43	Spoilt...a very nice surprise! pic.twitter.com/AMyiSEU5
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 14:52:24	Feeling very cared for this arvo, spoke to two old friends, one may make the trip to see me & received gorgeous flowers from another! Lucky
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 14:48:34	@Nicola116 no, it's because I refuse to shower here so am going home to do it...true OCD has taken me over, side effect of med change :(
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 14:42:10	@MeeshOnTheCoast Am a light sleeper, even with the meds they give me, today is ok now, might be rocking in a corner in 5 minutes! xxxx
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 14:39:12	@Nicola116 ok, went out for a bit this morning, not a total success but baby steps yet. Bought lots of lovely fabric & wool so I can craft
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 02:04:57	@chickensbees Me too! Nite x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 02:02:06	“ @chickensbees Yep. Even going home for an hour for a real shower and an unauthorised wool buying mission-will be too medicated to remember!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 01:52:28	@chickensbees No idea, a while I suspect!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 01:49:45	“ @chickensbees : Home. Bed. Happy.” Must be lovely! X
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 01:47:51	Hmmm, how did this pic of me get on the interwebs, time for some medication methinks... pic.twitter.com/KrXfxkST
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-26 01:01:26	“@MeeshOnTheCoast: It's so quiet here...not used to this at all!” Not here!, Nurses, snoring and the soothing tones of CPAP machines! #pfft
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-25 18:54:08	@nonoodle I know but there are ways of handling things and diffusing situations and they should know better. But tonight's meds are great;)

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-25 03:06:34	Feel like I've been hit by a truck whilst asleep. Which is a worry as I didn't seem to notice at the time and missed his damn rego number...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 17:45:38	“ @Skip91 : @QueenslandGrl @claudia_aitch neither can I, hospital can be so boring....” can be pretty entertaining around here!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 17:36:11	@sugercoatit @theberniebrand Thanks, I know. If I can't take a joke in here I'm in real trouble! #seriousshitbutistillhavesenseofhumour
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 17:30:13	@claudia_aitch @skip91 ha, good one.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 17:29:25	@sugercoatit @theberniebrand Thanks, I am trying but it's tough... x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 17:27:40	@Skip91 @claudia_aitch I have to keep it down a bit, for some reason they aren't keen on yelling around here, can't imagine why? ;P
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 17:25:40	@TheBernieBrand @sugercoatit No, I am literally in a psych ward!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 17:24:02	@Skip91 Haha, maybe not but it's almost medication time, so I will be mellow for #thevoicaeau
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 17:21:57	@claudia_aitch So annoying!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 17:21:06	@sugercoatit @theberniebrand Yes, but I'm on a psych ward!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 17:19:40	Over these people on master chef and their trite sayings and George saying "alements" so I'm going to the block so they can piss me off too!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 17:14:39	@TheBernieBrand @sugercoatit Hey, sounds like things around here! ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 16:41:46	I am shocked, I thought that brands would be lining up to be reviewed on my blog with my rapier like whit and insight! SHOCKED I tell you!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 16:32:21	@Skip91 Thanks love, barely holding on. If I let go I am scared of the consequences. Mind you, it can't get much worse! x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 16:27:10	Very hard not to post poor me tweets...sorry. Not going to improve anytime soon so bail if you must, others have!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 16:25:29	Want to have shower before it gets colder but Dr on the ward and I have to wait for him. Anxiety is high & I am so over it all #justsotired
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 12:27:07	You know how there's always one in every group? Fell asleep in an exercise, woke myself with a snore, at least I didn't fart I guess... #doh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 11:16:38	Excellent lunch, sometimes being a vegetarian pays off around here, sometimes not so much! Other patients are jealous, bit scary sometimes!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 11:10:19	Dining room clanger of the day (not me) patient wished another good luck with her pregnancy...but she's not preggers. Nearly wet myself!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 06:01:31	@carlygracelloyd Yep, that's shit. Anyone have anything else?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 05:11:42	Hey guys, misery loves company, make me feel better, what's shit about your morning? #spill
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 05:05:42	Oh Hi blinding headache, no sleep, aching body, head spins. and upset stomach, I've been expecting you! #medicationchangeyay
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-21 04:58:41	Let's see who I can upset this morning, not deliberately of course...it's just my particular superpower #meh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 19:14:52	@Woogsworld @edenland @SawHole @Lori_RRSAHM Hey girls, any chance of a RT of my sponsor requests? Stuck in hospital & need your influence ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 18:47:34	Love is...your husband smuggling chocky in when he brings your clean laundry and strawberry scented potpourri to hide hospital smell #sweet
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 17:29:36	@xmintycupcakesx Hope to be, working on it anyway! Thanks x
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 17:25:32	@xmintycupcakesx Yep, will be here for a couple of weeks. Sucks big time but these things happen!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 17:02:26	Feeling sorry for myself, had a shower, didn't help. Woman had a meltdown & nurses got scary. I will hide in my room with my anxiety tonight
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 13:21:55	@Woogsworld Woohoo! Not much to do here on a weekend but they drug us and feed us regularly...got to keep the inmates happy!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 11:41:05	Ah, yummy lunch, lovely meds now some sleepy time...yay.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 11:18:35	@Nicola116 OMG that made my afternoon!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 08:49:18	Anyone have any jokes, stories or posts to cheer me up?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 07:58:32	Looking for sponsors on my blog today for distractions whilst here in hospital... xxx
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 07:56:36	Have some spare fancy wool,thread or ribbon for crochet or flowerloom? Will swap for blog post! Would love pink,purple,cream @LincraftOnline

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 07:21:23	@LindtAustralia @CadburyAU @BenefitAus Anyone feel generous enough to send care packages to a fan in hospital? I will blog nice things ...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 06:09:05	I managed to enrage an entire dining room of psych patients...my work here is done, I'm going back to bed! #meh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 04:35:04	...will stop now before I bring you all down too, I did warn you, change of meds = miserable Jo!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 04:32:38	Do they think I don't notice them checking on me, some subtlety lessons wouldn't go astray!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 04:30:17	... and I'm cold... Wawawa
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-20 04:28:27	Still here! Not enough sleep, feel like crap, noisy people around,wish everyone would eff off and leave me alone to wallow in peace! #poorme
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-19 06:58:32	@EvanChapple Thanks, just upset me WAY more than it should have. Strangely I seem to have lost all perspective! xxx

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-19 06:43:06	...most angry with myself though for giving one insignificant person thepower to make me feel that badly about myself! #clearly
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-19 06:41:00	Amazing how one person can destroy your day, just had a run in with Satan's older, uglier, more evil sister...thought all the nurses were ok
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-19 05:29:35	Did they miss my morning obs or did ninjas come in and do it while I was asleep? Or do I just not remember....
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-19 05:18:07	WARNING: Change of meds occurring here, best to ignore much of what I say...unless it makes me witty and amusing of course! #andpigsmayfly

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-17 18:09:41	Bah, have to get hair dryer tested & tagged and have to go to nurses station for them to cut my embroidery thread! #sigh
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-17 17:06:49	On the bright side they have free wifi so I can blog from my bed...what a thrill for you all! Pfft

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-17 16:58:37	Feel like such a bitch, just sent my lovely husband to go and get the things he forgot to bring earlier...poor guy is beside himself already
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-17 07:58:21	@Woogsworld I'm putting him thru the wringer, he has his moments normally!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-17 07:56:25	@Woogsworld my hubby must be a saint to put up with me right now!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-17 06:14:22	Wow, sucks to be Lara B this morning.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-17 05:16:53	@KerriSackville Huge! Mind you, he is 18 & a shift-worker so life would be easier...but a bit quiet! Trying to be positive...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-17 05:08:42	@KerriSackville my "baby" applied for his first rental property yesterday! #horrifyingasimstillyoung

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-16 23:26:26	I am going to need a LOT of chocolate in the next couple of weeks, anyone want to sponsor me?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-16 23:24:25	Cant sleep, It's noisy and cold and the beds hard. Not used to sleeping alone and having a torch shone in my face every 1/2 hour... #sucks
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-16 19:37:00	@ZoutLiquorice @katielou2050 it isn't good but can't really go into it here, lot of work to do, sorry to be cryptic

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-16 19:18:02	@katielou2050 it wasn't a good turn, in hospital now :(
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-16 19:14:43	Well, today certainly took a turn for the unexpected!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-16 09:20:26	Ah diazepam, my tiny yellow friend. Where would I be without you?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-15 17:34:53	Had the misfortune to actually catch the end of Home & Away...pre-schoolers appear to be discussing their marriages...CRAP

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-15 10:52:13	Cat just cuddled up against me...awww. Then ruined the moment by giving himself a VERY enthusiastic BJ! #couldhavedonewithoutthat

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-15 06:59:52	I can feel winter coming, my damaged shoulder is aching...that, and the fact that it's bloody freezing! #missmyfireplacealready
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-15 06:30:12	FFS...breast feed, don't breast feed, whatever. Everyone else mind you own business and shut up about it. It's only a boob...sick of it all!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-15 06:26:40	Today my "baby" is going to look at a house with his mates, some of them are GIRLS...ummahh. Is it wrong to be sad but secretly excited?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-15 06:10:52	Why can't professional cyclists stay on their bikes? Any why do we have to watch them crash all the time? Stomach turning vision ... #sun7

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-14 19:29:39	Finally! #theVoiceau BUT, I am a bit concerned as to just what Seal is up to behind that chair! Joel is so cute, and clearly pissed!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-14 19:25:06	@katielou2050 For sure!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-14 19:19:52	@JoelMadden #thevoicaeau Save us, do something, you are our only hope!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-14 18:28:03	Sad that "I love this box" has closed down, was a bright spot in my month. Everything I get involved with turns to shit. Sigh #poormetweet

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-14 07:17:42	@MummaInHeels Trust me, when you are the only girl, separate loos make life nicer, worth the extra cleaning! My boys are well trained anyway
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-14 07:11:23	@MummaInHeels no way! Had one bathroom in last house, now have ensuite and two other toilets, one each = not sharing loo with boys #ftw

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-11 16:57:59	Honestly, does the bad news ever stop? Every week there is some new shit to deal with. Don't know what we are supposed to do with this news.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-11 11:48:55	A word to the wise, if you come to my home and give me a glade air freshener as a housewarming gift, you are out on your arse #fyi

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-09 12:39:13	@AlissaKate6 it's on the inside of my right wrist, got it done by a guy here in Toowoomba who came highly recommended. Pain not too bad!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-09 12:33:04	@AlissaKate6 @miss_andie88 Really well, hurts a bit while they do it, but so worth it! Will post pics later. ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-09 12:28:14	@AlissaKate6 @miss_andie88 Happy birthday! Good luck with the tattoos, I got my first this afternoon.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-05-09 12:19:15	The most painful part of this afternoon's tattoo? The music they were playing. NO idea what it was but it made me feel VERY old!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-03-01 03:31:06	Hey, anyone awake? I need distracting....

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-02-27 17:20:57	So....I've just woken up from a busy afternoon of sleeping, am exhausted, early bed-time called for I think! #illnesssucks
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-02-26 08:40:38	Gorgeous morning here in Perth, much nicer than rainy old Toowoomba!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-02-25 07:25:26	@Nicola116 good, leaving in a couple of hours as weather is crap!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-02-23 17:26:50	@Nicola116 Ok, just woke up, Mum fine, just cooked me dinner ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-02-22 07:19:15	Trying to be all "Zen" this morning, green tea with a diazepam chaser...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-02-20 18:23:46	@Nicola116 :)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-02-20 18:01:54	@xmintycupcakesx I prefer the red one, white is OK though. Coles does a good organic one in the health food aisle. xx
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-02-20 17:53:39	@xmintycupcakesx I usually add a bit of low salt soy or vegan Worcester sauce after cooking. It's a good substitute for rice or in salads.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-02-20 17:48:29	@Nicola116 yep, her too! ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-02-20 17:46:38	@LizzyEllis82 My almost 18 year old son also eats it, maybe doesn't love it, but doesn't complain either. #newvegetarians

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2012-01-02 17:59:06	Watching "One born every minute" and feeling very glad I had a hysterectomy! #horrifying

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-25 11:51:36	Oh God, the drunks have fired up the Xbox and are howling along to lips! Oh the humanity...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-24 16:55:19	...still, this time last year I was ill with the mumps, so this year's simple exhaustion is an improvement!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-24 16:53:44	I have been cooking ALL day, now I have to make dinner...I have realised that while I LOVE Xmas, I love being a guest more than the host...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-24 08:59:39	Been shopping, chicken, turkey and veggie roast cooking, making pasta & potato salads, truffles & shortbread, wrapping presents, I LOVE Xmas
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-23 21:09:04	@Hearmumroar that sucks, we had a fire in our street this week. Hope you are all ok. Xxx

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-23 07:47:25	Gah, I finished all the shopping, now MrQ is making me go out with him!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-22 13:22:12	Shopping finished, presents wrapped, rumballs, truffles and fudge made. Now have to shine the house for another viewing... #busy
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-21 18:06:48	...I suggested that I would go and offer the guy stationed outside the unit tonight a cuppa, my husband called me a nanna...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-21 18:05:49	One thing my neighbours and I noticed last night was that all the cops and firies looked like children...I think we might be getting old...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-21 18:01:29	@maidinaustralia I will do it tomorrow, just didn't have the heart to write today after last night's events.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-21 11:12:46	@truthaboutmummy Our local Woolies open at 7am on Saturday morning...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-21 11:10:33	Phew, most of the cops seem to be gone and the media have taken off, time for peace to return to our little street I hope...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-21 06:01:18	@lizzyellis82 Unsure yet, the firies sirens pulling up outside woke us up! Police still there investigating...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-21 05:58:00	There is already far more traffic than normal...sticky beaks have started already!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-21 05:57:03	Awful night for our little street...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-21 00:20:32	So very sad, we just lost a neighbour in a terrible unit fire. Emergency services look as if they are here for the night. RIP.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-20 19:39:13	@maidinaustralia How is your new place? Settled in OK?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-20 19:28:36	@maidinaustralia Really well thanks. There are some lovely shots of the house, will blog tomorrow.
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-20 19:05:18	Watching the cricket with MrQ, every time Warnie does ANYTHING they show Liz's reaction. WTF?
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-20 18:49:21	@maidinaustralia Hmmm, we have an Xmas light display so are already attracting attention...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-20 18:47:35	You gotta love it when your cat opens the bedroom curtains while you are undressing! #extraxmasdisplay
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-20 15:52:47	Extremely disappointed with my online shopping experience with Woolies today, 7 hours & 3 calls to fix and I am really not satisfied! #fail
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-20 10:05:45	Trying to get the washing and cooking done in between house viewings...at least the house is beautifully clean & tidy for Xmas I guess!...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-18 09:56:51	I don't want to speak too soon but I may have FINALLY found my Christmas spirit! House decorated, outdoor lights up #betterlatethannever

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-13 15:11:24	My cat is under the mistaken impression that the boxes for moving have been installed as an indoor playground for him...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-13 14:53:37	@maidinaustralia No, nothing so glam...house is going on the market and they are doing a twilight shoot to capitalise on the romance...

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-13 14:41:35	After a long day on the road, MrQ is out mowing the garden in the heat ready for the photographer to come tomorrow...gotta love him!
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-12-13 14:17:27	What do you mean Xmas is less than two weeks away? Not possible, I haven't even put my tree up!!! #meh

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-09-09 10:53:08	@holly_homemaker definitely,don't not a lot of views or comments, while I do it for me, it would be nice to know if I am wasting my time
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-09-09 10:14:07	@ms_motorbikenut Normally I can too, but the rain came in at a different angle to normal and would have soaked it all! Not pleasant...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-09-09 10:09:38	@ms_motorbikenut A lot more is on the way! Trust me, we are sending it down...getting very windy here now...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-09-09 08:53:39	My cat is not happy with the weather..sitting on my desk looking up at the ceiling and howling as the rain pounds on the iron roof #pathetic

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-09-09 07:56:56	@melissa4444 Toowoomba...and it's pissing down ;)
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-09-09 07:50:20	Oh, just started raining...have washing and gardening to do though, so stop it! Still, at least the builders will piss off #noisy #sigh

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-08-22 07:43:24	@laurenacarlton Difficult...we had the BEST day care Mum but she finished at 5.30pm! Tricky...
262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-08-22 07:37:27	@laurenacarlton Better to find the right one in the long run...leaving her with one your not happy with could do more damage!

262550814	QueenslandGrl	2011-08-17 08:22:50	@tiggyjohnson It's OK, I am substituting chooks with a compost heap, nothing in the rules about that! #servesthemright
