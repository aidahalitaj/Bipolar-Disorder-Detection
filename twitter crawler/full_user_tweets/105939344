105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-17 13:10:23	@ZolaRabbitsoup it's kind of off the wall. May not end up sitting through it haha x
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-17 13:08:03	@ZolaRabbitsoup it's a delicate situation so I'm not sure how much to reach out actually...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-17 13:06:42	@ZolaRabbitsoup I'm watching a movie called "The Lobster". Have you seen it?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-17 13:04:16	@ZolaRabbitsoup sorry to say I have no updates on that front. I need to reach out more... Thank you for asking x

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-15 13:37:09	@Ihatethisugh1 it's caused by life circumstances which I can't articulate here. Hoping it will resolve with meds.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-15 13:34:41	@Ihatethisugh1 fortunately bipolar is ruled out in this case but thank you so much for mentioning that
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-15 13:33:29	@ZolaRabbitsoup thank you :-) I will do my best x
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-15 13:29:52	@Ihatethisugh1 antidepressant meds to be more specific
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-15 13:29:33	@ZolaRabbitsoup a couple of people close to me are sick and in pain. Doing what I can yet I feel it wearing on me. I will practice self care
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-15 13:25:15	@ZolaRabbitsoup that means a great deal to me
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-15 13:24:07	@ZolaRabbitsoup x
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-12-15 13:23:36	@ZolaRabbitsoup I'm hopeful that they will

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-16 04:21:37	@MendingGrey UGH.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-16 03:23:22	@700flights oh no. Lots of side-effects with that med, I hear.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-16 03:09:52	@700flights oh ya that must really suck. Even with sleeping meds?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-16 02:50:10	@Nic_Scientist awww, this is just too sweet.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-16 01:47:01	@LilHurricaneo it's a common thing with the mentally ill it seems
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-16 01:40:51	Slept a long time but woke up tired. This seems to happen often for me. Does this happen to any of you? I hope you're all doing well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-16 01:20:42	@SparklyErinS ooh, ya. I hope he'll continue tucking in

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-14 16:37:13	In heavy traffic today on the highway a motorcyclist fell. Luckily this was at very low speed. So I put my car in park and helped lift it.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-14 10:40:54	Just seen "Captain Fantastic" with Viggo Mortensen. Really enjoyed it. It's about a father who rears his children out in the wild
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-14 10:33:34	@Ihatethisugh1 excellent!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-14 10:32:20	@tlscadden1 tapping into the benzos I hope

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-14 07:54:29	@SparklyErinS I question my diagnosis, too :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-14 07:50:51	@SparklyErinS well you likely can't determine the severity on your own
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-14 07:39:45	@SparklyErinS mania is definitely bad though...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-14 07:31:05	@SparklyErinS it does. It's common to question your diagnosis
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-14 07:28:12	@SparklyErinS you're also on a mood stabiliser though, right?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-14 07:23:01	@pup_ear_nibbles thank you so much!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-09 06:07:07	@BiggieSmalley the election tweeting has been refreshingly moderate -- at least on my feed

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-09 05:37:00	@projectmonark no worries, man. Thanks for telling me

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-09 05:07:34	@ddr_seattle I think it's so optimistic to say that she will win Florida. I hope she does I just think it's still very much up in the air

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 13:00:14	@BiggieSmalley thanks man. Much appreciated
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:57:25	I've missed you, Twitter.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:56:31	@grendeldave ooh wow. Ya I don't think I could do that
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:56:01	@lavaflowswave thank you so much :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:55:35	@Ihatethisugh1 please let it be fulfilling too I would say
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:54:37	@grendeldave how so?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:52:42	She suggested it. She bought the tickets
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:46:37	@BiggieSmalley sorry to hear. Hoping next week is better for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:45:43	@IQinspector must've needed it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:43:12	@Jinthelife excellent! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:41:19	@Jinthelife which are you having?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:40:20	@Jinthelife factoid: it's "whisky" if it's Scottish or Japanese and "whiskey" if it's Irish or American
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:03:53	@SimbaTalks sending you love and hugs, Simba
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 12:00:35	@Jinthelife any benzos in the house?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 11:14:16	Have a date tomorrow night. Going to see some live music
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 08:37:36	@chris_mahan oh nooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 07:41:59	Had a week off of therapy last week. Excited to be going back!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 07:07:58	@sertralove sending love and hugs to you, Izzy
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 07:01:51	@SugarGretel Backstreet Coys #Animal90sBands

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 06:46:40	@RichardPulsford nice one
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 06:45:01	@psychotic_18 doing alright. Somewhat busy at work.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 06:43:10	@BiggieSmalley dang!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 06:42:55	@psychotic_18 sorry that happened
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 06:41:54	@psychotic_18 gahhh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 06:39:55	@BiggieSmalley dude! Sweetness
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 06:27:17	@perp_perplexed ya I usually will occupy myself with something else whilst trying to remain attentive to the film/show but that never works.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:52:17	@perp_perplexed I also have problems focusing on shows/movies
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:50:26	@LITTLE_K0ALA glad you had a nice birthday week!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:35:10	@DoodleChronicle haha. I've just been told to be cautious with long-term benzo usage. Supposedly it can cause dementia. You may ask about it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:32:14	@DoodleChronicle I've only had it once or twice but I believe it's more potent than either of those
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:30:06	@DoodleChronicle yay for clonazepam
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:28:19	@MendingGrey great to hear. I was just told to be cautious with long-term benzo usage.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:24:43	@MendingGrey I have lorazepam too but I don't take it much. I guess I'm thankful that my anxiety isn't too bad
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:19:31	@MendingGrey how weird. Glad you're off of it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:19:17	@MendingGrey yes yes you are
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:17:27	@Mike_Douglas_ so so glad to hear this
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:17:18	@MendingGrey weird. Thought that was generally a well-tolerated med. Goes to show how these meds affect people very differently
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:16:46	@MendingGrey ok I'm glad that's not a side-effect for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:13:20	@Mike_Douglas_ how are you doing, bud?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:10:37	@MendingGrey I had mental fogginess and weight gain from it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 05:08:42	@MendingGrey ew I don't like that med
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 04:46:24	@Time2VentKV very very sorry to hear this. We love you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 04:40:53	@Lipstick_br ouch sorry
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 04:09:02	So who's still hungover from yesterday's massive @LITTLE_K0ALA birthday celebration?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-04 04:03:02	@joypaulinesmith you're very welcome, Joy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 23:45:16	@knuf1985 oh my goodness

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 15:23:01	@roiben ok I hope you will speak to your GP
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 09:52:56	@chris_mahan @joypaulinesmith @RudyCaseres ok I am here at the bar
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 08:36:36	@LadyAerin ugh. Glad you made it home
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 08:35:22	@LITTLE_K0ALA it must know
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 06:57:08	@Rivkah_g I'm doing pretty well thank you for asking. Haven't been really depressed in a while thanks to the buproprion
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 06:53:13	@Rivkah_g I'm very sorry Rivkah
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 06:53:02	@PinkPalaceAngel yay! Happy for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 06:20:19	@roiben I'm very very sorry to hear this, man. When was the last time you've spoken to your pdoc?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 06:19:14	@LITTLE_K0ALA cool!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 06:11:49	@roiben we love you, roiben
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 05:58:36	@LITTLE_K0ALA I hope you'll get to do something you really enjoy
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 05:12:52	@ZolaRabbitsoup yum!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 05:05:16	@ShakiraSalvador I'm hoping the pain will subside
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 05:02:47	@ZolaRabbitsoup go Bunny! What was the takeout if you don't mind me asking?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 04:32:21	@ItsTheWeeThings aw sorry you're experiencing that. Get well soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 03:58:35	@weswroten I think it would take something huge to change the trajectory of this thing and at this late stage I think it'd be unlikely
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 03:42:02	@Lyingsoothsayer oh I'm sorry
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 02:51:53	@Lyingsoothsayer you can do it, Lou x
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 02:50:46	@leah_michal ooh congratulations! I missed the announcement. I hope that things will settle down at some point
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-03 02:43:20	@roiben sending lots of love to you, roiben. You're a quality human being and a very valuable member of the MH community here on Twitter.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 08:26:22	@IQinspector I just read that you have 3,000 some snake bites per year out there
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 08:21:58	@IQinspector geez. Nature is cruel down unda
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 08:17:53	@IQinspector ah ok. I was under the impression that there are a lot of deadly spiders in Oz.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 08:14:16	@IQinspector not to mention dangerous
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 08:11:56	@IQinspector I feel really fortunate to not see many spiders
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 08:09:51	@IQinspector good on you for relocating them
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 07:56:06	@loonydepartment we love you, LD
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 07:40:17	@projectmonark thanks, man. I really appreciate it. Btw, I might be going to NAMI Glendale next Tuesday. Hope to see you there.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 07:29:33	@SongWarriors well, I really do just try to channel the nervous energy into energy for the presentation. I may take lorazepam if too nervous
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 07:14:18	@bullfrogr thank you. I think I will eventually :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 07:08:36	@bullfrogr I meant it was good that you were able to distance yourself from it. I was bullied too. It was long ago but it still affects me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 07:00:57	@bullfrogr how good is that!?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 06:41:19	@ItsTheWeeThings thank you so much, Catrina!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 06:15:03	@chris_mahan @joypaulinesmith @RudyCaseres yeah that would work well
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 06:09:41	@pup_ear_nibbles thank you so much! So nice to hear from you

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 05:53:11	@karendrawsstuff good on you for trying though
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 05:49:28	@kezm33 sleep well!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-11-02 05:29:39	@SongWarriors use that nervousness to your advantage! :-)

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-10-14 06:01:35	To be honest: I was stagnating at work. I just need a little mental break. I feel fortunate that I was able to get quite a bit done today.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-10-14 05:59:41	@chris_mahan @lauracloughley Laura, Chris is an amazing poet and author in general. He also draws from time to time
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-10-14 05:57:20	@BiggieSmalley @lauracloughley Laura, Lonnie's one of my best friends on here. He's a great guy.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-10-14 05:48:21	@DayneSvendsen ya it took a bit of experimentation.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-10-14 05:45:24	@DayneSvendsen I feel so fortunate that I have an antidepressant that works (Wellbutrin). Without it I'd be mired in depression

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-17 01:14:05	@SageSilk I know you're brave enough: you've faced a serious persistent mental illness and won. It's just if you're brave enough that moment
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-17 01:11:30	@jeshizaemon um that's not gonna work is it?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-17 01:09:54	@SageSilk can't hurt to suggest it, IMO

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-10 03:59:35	@ZolaRabbitsoup Yay! So glad for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-10 03:57:37	@chris_mahan that's terrible man

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 11:46:37	@SageSilk aw Sagey I'm so glad you're in a safe place
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 11:45:01	@chris_mahan Oh crap

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 07:53:10	@SageSilk nothing could be further from the truth, Sagey. Sending lots of love and hugs
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 06:27:49	@SageSilk @crymeariver89 oh please don't. We would miss you terribly.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 05:50:33	@SageSilk ok will you keep us updated?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 05:35:32	@MendingGrey would you ever be with a guy or strictly women?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 05:35:01	@SageSilk I'm thinking of you. Is there anyone you can reach out to immediately?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 05:15:14	@SageSilk I would say it's time for another inpatient stay
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 05:10:39	@SageSilk oh nooo Sagey. We love you and want the best for you. Sending hugs.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 05:10:13	@BiggieSmalley oh booo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 04:55:28	@MendingGrey it's a spectrum, right? :-) How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 04:20:32	@PsychoticDancer oh dear that's a huge issue
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 04:18:33	@PsychoticDancer what problem is it?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 04:16:31	@AboveStigma good on you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 04:16:13	@ZolaRabbitsoup glad to hear that! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 04:05:11	@ZolaRabbitsoup I'm very sorry, Bunny. Sending love and hugs.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:36:37	@lauracloughley oh ok. I hope they're doing ok and that they'll get out soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:34:53	@pup_ear_nibbles cool, good luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:34:20	@pup_ear_nibbles oh wow. That is worse than my situation. I'm very sorry to hear that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:33:44	@pup_ear_nibbles I think as long as you go slow you'll be ok. But that's for your doctor and you to work out what do I know :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:32:38	@pup_ear_nibbles it's ok I'm just trying to be as fit as I can with the extra weight.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:32:03	@pup_ear_nibbles oh ya I wouldn't dream of being on it without a mood stabilizer and an AAP.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:31:20	@pup_ear_nibbles oh I hope so. Abilify makes me pretty hungry. I've gained 10 to 15
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:30:25	@pup_ear_nibbles ok then you gotta tell her to try you on another one. Wellbutrin does the trick for me
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:29:01	@pup_ear_nibbles oh ya, and they can't coordinate you going on another antidepressant at the same time I guess?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:26:59	@pup_ear_nibbles Are you still on the Cymbalta?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:21:54	@lauracloughley Aw, Laura. Thinking of you. Why are you in the hospital, btw?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 03:05:18	@pup_ear_nibbles ooh, hang on sister. I'm doing ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 01:13:33	@SocietyBasement See ya!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 00:16:05	@chercolvin Oh ok. Well I hope you begin to get more comfortable with them!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 00:04:36	@chercolvin So are you getting better in those areas?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-08 00:04:08	@duplicitron Very sorry to hear this, man.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-07 03:54:17	@xtokahontas oh nooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-07 03:51:52	@xtokahontas ugh. Hope you can score some soon

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-07 02:10:03	@Lyingsoothsayer I don't smoke any longer but there is something about lighting and burning tobacco that is alluring
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-07 02:09:07	@zendao42 uf I'm sorry you're without a washer. Hoping that gets sorted soon

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 10:19:22	@DEPRESSI0NISTA ugh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 10:19:02	@cookiebetch420 oh nooo that's not a good feeling
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 10:18:08	@DEPRESSI0NISTA heee
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 10:17:40	Visually stunning. Unbelievable use of stop-motion animation.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 08:23:28	Going to watch "Kubo and the Two Strings". Will let you know how it is.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 08:19:14	@ZolaRabbitsoup September can be one of our warmest months, too. Sorry that is happening :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 08:15:35	@ItsTheWeeThings I agree it's not easy. I go to bipolar support group which helps.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 08:06:18	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Have you had a chance to try the product yet? If so what's the verdict?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 08:05:29	@SparklyErinS lol!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 05:49:56	@DrEm_79 wth!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 05:15:59	@chris_mahan it's a good day!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 05:05:15	@BipolarTweets I say you can have one or two here and there
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 04:44:05	@BipolarTweets I think that would be a good idea. Take it slow, though. Alcohol withdrawal can be rough
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 04:42:29	@pup_ear_nibbles I hope so too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 04:41:46	@xxhatred Yay! Nice photo!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 04:41:17	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh I hope there's no crash this time. I've been doing alright thank you for asking :-)

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 04:14:32	@BipolarSanity I feel the same way. We have to make sure we're ok with ourselves before seeking a girlfriend, I think.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 04:08:55	@leah_michal w00t!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 04:05:50	@eb462 I felt this exact way before they found an anti-depressant that worked.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 04:03:13	@eb462 I'm very sorry your GP is not more understanding. Mine acted in a very similar way, FWIW.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 03:59:07	@HorzaEdeo Sorry you're feeling down, Horza. Hoping things turn around for you soon

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 02:47:56	@SimbaTalks In the states we have a textbook rental service called Chegg. Do you have that there?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 02:46:58	@BipolarHotMess I'm very sorry for your predicament.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-06 02:42:41	@thecupcakegirl8 sleep well!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-05 01:32:07	@Ihatethisugh1 Sorry, man. Hope you get them resolved soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-04 14:02:36	She said it's irrelevant whether or not she works
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-04 12:41:57	@_AngelKate_ Thanks for asking. She said she wasn't working
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-04 09:50:09	@xxhatred Glad to hear it, man!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-04 08:41:38	Issued an ultimatum to my ex-wife. Want to know if she's working or not. If she's working then my alimony payment should decrease.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-02 04:40:56	. @chris_mahan is not a flounderer
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-02 04:40:27	@chris_mahan I think of you as doing the opposite of floundering, though
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-02 04:30:37	@ZolaRabbitsoup That's ok, Bunny. Enjoy your food

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-09-02 04:29:44	Some people just seem to be floundering about in this world. I feel fortunate that I do not feel like one of them.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-02 09:35:23	@Mike_Douglas_ Hey Mike, Joy says her internet went down. She wanted me to tell you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-02 08:18:27	@cookiebetch420 Aw. Sorry that's the case.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-02 03:36:30	@leah_michal So far so good. I've been hypomanic I think. But I'm weathering it decently.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-02 03:35:47	@HorzaEdeo I love you, Horza!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-02 03:27:41	@BiPolar_Witch I love Abilify. I take it at night and it does nothing to make me restless.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 23:11:17	@serpentgrr I agree. Thank you for your thoughts
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 23:10:57	@serpentgrr Yeah exactly
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 23:02:48	@serpentgrr Half the length of the marriage. In my case that's roughly four and a half years.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 22:55:31	@C4mD3v Haha. Cents would be best. Thank you for the capital idea :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 22:55:13	@serpentgrr We had no children. This is simply for her...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 22:42:35	@700flights Hahaha. Excellent point! I've asked her to send me an email each month stating that she still needs the money
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 22:30:09	Ugh I loathe sending my ex-wife so much money every month.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 22:25:16	@pup_ear_nibbles Nah you'll be fine! You've dealt with bipolar!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 21:57:30	@HendersGraham I'm very sorry to hear this. What anti-psychotics are you on?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 21:53:10	@HendersGraham It's a terrible illness isn't it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 20:39:42	Up early to start the week. Be well, friends

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 08:42:41	Feeling out of sorts for the first time in a while. Might be slightly hypomanic. I hope you're well, friends
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-08-01 08:37:58	@nyanlasers Sleep well, Ham Separatist!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-28 13:47:20	@ZolaRabbitsoup Good for you. Have a pleasant day, Z.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-28 12:50:40	@chris_mahan Makes sense that it wouldn't be so immediate. Gonna get one?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-28 12:28:38	@chris_mahan Any creations to share?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-27 13:26:31	@DEPRESSI0NISTA That has "win" all over it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-27 12:11:00	@BiggieSmalley Thank you, sir, that means a lot
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-27 12:10:34	@projectmonark I don't completely understand it myself
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-27 12:10:14	@chris_mahan Haha thanks :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-27 11:48:51	Tonight sweet, sweet victory involved a cross join, an unnamed subquery, and 15 charts with 365-day window rolling means. Now I can go home.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-27 07:18:50	@cookiebetch420 Haha

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-26 22:47:13	@Pinkishlypink66 I'm very sorry to hear this. I hope the day improves for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-26 21:41:50	@IQinspector I'm doing alright. It's been warm here so I'm not sleeping well. Other than that things are good.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-26 21:40:06	@IQinspector Oh nooo. I'm so sorry
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-26 21:39:28	@Lyingsoothsayer Wow! You have to post some when you've got them finished!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-23 06:54:15	@SimbaTalks The day has been good despite not getting enough rest last night x Are you still awake?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-22 15:15:19	Was trying to do things the hard way all day. Took a quick break and the easy solution came to me

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-22 13:12:42	I did what I wanted to do today. I found a superior solution to a programming problem I was having. Time to pack up. Be well, dear friends.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-19 00:07:26	@Lyingsoothsayer I'm glad you pushed the limits but I'm upset that it has come with such consequences
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-19 00:05:43	@Lyingsoothsayer Sorry that is unfortunate.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-18 07:35:25	@FreshKnowsFresh Hahaha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-18 07:26:54	@ecrjones Ugh I know
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-18 07:26:43	@leah_michal Glad to hear it. Mine was also good. I spent a lot of time with family
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-18 07:19:12	@leah_michal Oh nooo. Very sorry to hear this. How was your weekend otherwise?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-18 07:16:49	@ecrjones I couldn't get through half of Spectre.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 11:05:08	@tlscadden1 It started out as a normal Saturday night I swear...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 11:03:49	@FreshKnowsFresh Sweet, dude! You've got some talent!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 10:59:15	@tlscadden1 Aww
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 10:57:39	@zendao42 Nice! Good job :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 10:56:36	@tlscadden1 Aww, no you need to get out
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 10:56:12	@tlscadden1 I'm glad it ended ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 10:55:39	@tlscadden1 Weird
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 08:50:45	@psychotic_18 Really interested to know how you tolerate it. Please write back when you've been taking for a while.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 06:22:04	@IQinspector Oh, I'm glad you slept. Hahah. Better do something fun since you're up :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 06:12:59	@IQinspector Oh nooo. You need a sedating medication.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 06:03:21	@xxhatred_com Lucky!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 05:48:48	@xxhatred_com @psychotic_18 Hahaha. I think it has some good effects on my brain as well. I read that somewhere anyway :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 03:45:05	@xxhatred_com @psychotic_18 Welcome! :-) It makes it so I don't go manic
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 03:44:21	@psychotic_18 Max dose, yeah. No sedation. A little bit of an increased appetite
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 00:28:36	@psychotic_18 30mg! Can't get enough of the stuff!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-16 00:20:11	@cookiebetch420 Interesting! I wonder if quality of sleep is affected?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 21:11:34	@psychotic_18 I love aripiprazole
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 21:10:56	@cookiebetch420 Yay!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 12:10:23	@sexually Love the new avi
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 12:09:59	@ArtPunkBeardGuy I like it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 10:24:32	@CM5700 Oh no I'm very sorry to hear this, Cole. I hope tomorrow goes well for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 10:23:32	@cookiebetch420 Awww. Very sorry to hear. Hope things improve
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 07:24:48	Oh no. My heart breaks for Nice.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 07:08:14	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Keep on kicking butt and taking names!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 03:53:06	@xtokahontas Ooh best of luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 02:04:20	@wickedfedora Nice one!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 00:21:11	@SparklyErinS Hang in there, E. Here for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-15 00:20:31	@tweety123pie Interesting!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 23:07:26	@IQinspector I miss the good times, too. Since being put on Wellbutrin things are pretty good, though. Have you tried it?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 23:02:17	@IQinspector That's my dx, too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 22:56:44	@IQinspector Ooh, Shameless is a good one
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 22:39:13	@pup_ear_nibbles So so glad to hear that. I'm doing well, thank you for asking. We have a couple of new employees who are helping me out.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 22:26:08	@pup_ear_nibbles Howdy! How goes it today?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 22:05:48	@IQinspector Ugh. Sorry. Are you doing anything fun while you're not able to sleep?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 12:32:40	@tlscadden1 Aw you are so sweet
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 10:40:17	@DallaDxBPD Thank you so much. Yes it is!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 10:38:59	@IQinspector Why only 4?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 10:38:35	@IQinspector Shit
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 10:38:11	@loarnagreen Wow! Why?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 09:13:44	@FreshKnowsFresh Impressive!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 08:59:14	@tweety123pie I'm very sorry to hear that. I hope things turn around for you soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 08:52:35	@tweety123pie Thank you so much, tweety pie. How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 08:50:41	I feel good. Not manic good. Just content. Is this what neuro-normal people feel? Sending love to all of you this Wednesday afternoon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 08:38:31	@DEPRESSI0NISTA That's so wonderful to hear
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 08:34:45	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Sounds so awesome!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 08:02:15	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Heh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 07:35:02	@tlscadden1 Thank you so much :-) It completed in 20 minutes. The report itself will take a bit longer to produce but I'm going to get help.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 07:03:12	@loarnagreen Woohoo! You're going to do great!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 06:19:20	@nyanlasers Hedging!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 06:08:59	@HorzaEdeo Hey look a new kind of camera! https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=4qXE4s A-hLQ …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 06:03:41	@Anxiwarrior Nice!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 06:00:12	Long-running query alert! This one returns 9+ million records and is done on a quarterly basis.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 05:49:18	@chris_mahan Well written! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 02:49:19	@AFP Nooooooooooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 02:26:05	@joypaulinesmith Haha. Thank you so much :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-14 00:29:51	@joypaulinesmith Have a great time!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 14:19:19	@FreshKnowsFresh No way! That's impressive
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 14:18:58	@FreshKnowsFresh Gorgeous!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 14:05:47	@alicia_tk26 I'm very sorry to hear that, Alicia. Wishing you strength and peace on this difficult day
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 14:02:36	@Ihatethisugh1 Yay for that!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 12:26:13	@DallaDxBPD Sleep well!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 11:47:20	@ArtPunkBeardGuy Sleep well, APBG
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 11:46:51	@chris_mahan Noooooooooooooooooooooo!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 11:07:03	@projectmonark Can't wait to see it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 11:05:32	@projectmonark Sweet, dude. Photos of it when it's done?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 11:03:48	A few hours later and it was a 32- versus 64-bit issue. Darn these newfangled PCs
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 11:03:11	@chris_mahan @jathanism Bowing to pressure I have fixed the indentation
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 10:26:23	@chris_mahan Hahaha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 10:21:59	@chris_mahan @jathanism LOL
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 10:21:39	@chris_mahan It's fou... fou == file out. Learned that one from Alex Martelli himself.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 10:20:21	@chris_mahan The Horror...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 10:19:31	@chris_mahan pic.twitter.com/RCUFvfg5ZS
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 10:04:41	I've succumbed to The Dark Side: I've written Python code with indentation of two spaces instead of four.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 10:02:02	@xtokahontas That would make WAY too much sense :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 09:54:13	I think I've found the problem!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 09:38:41	@Ihatethisugh1 Nice, dude
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 08:42:04	@xxhatred_com Thanks, man! I appreciate the vote of confidence :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 08:30:21	@xxhatred_com These quarterly reports. It's very odd. The components work separately, but not the whole program.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 08:24:43	Debugginggggghhhh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 08:19:19	@FreshKnowsFresh Awesome work, dude!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 07:51:29	@Pinkishlypink66 Welcome home!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 07:51:11	@xxhatred_com Sweet, dude
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 05:58:21	@DEPRESSI0NISTA That's awesome. Keep progressing!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 05:57:58	Re-wrote the program and it now uses a steady 3.5GB RAM instead of 5
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 05:40:25	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Hahaha. You're going to have such a great time!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 05:39:32	@DEPRESSI0NISTA So glad you've mastered your agoraphobia
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 05:36:58	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Yay!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 05:00:06	@xxhatred_com Oh, man. That sounds like a thorny one. Best of luck to you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 04:56:08	@xxhatred_com How annoying. I hope the problem resolves itself soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 04:37:41	@BiggieSmalley People are irregular. Computers are regular. So I deal with the latter whenever possible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 04:20:27	Running into RAM limitations. Need to wait to run some other programs. I hope you're doing well, dear pals
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 03:47:26	@SimbaTalks What programme? I recently watched "The Fundamentals of Caring" and loved it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 01:28:26	@jenac83 Sorry, that sucks.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 00:57:42	@Lyingsoothsayer Well, I'm glad for that. Still worried about the living situation, though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 00:47:28	@Lyingsoothsayer I'm very sorry to read this. When might you get to go home?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 00:44:45	@DnyLdn I'm doing well. Work is going smoothly.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 00:24:19	@DnyLdn Good to have you back, man
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 00:22:10	@pup_ear_nibbles Thank you, sister
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 00:19:55	@pup_ear_nibbles Ah, I'm sorry. I hope time heals all wounds in this case.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-13 00:12:52	@pup_ear_nibbles Good morning! How goes the struggle today?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 23:43:52	@kentsbike Ugh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 23:41:36	@HorzaEdeo Very very sorry, Horza. I hope things will improve for you soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 23:00:14	Good morning, all. I worked a bit from home last night so I'm all caught up today. Let's make it a great day
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 22:38:21	@xxhatred_com Oh nooo. Very sorry to hear this, man. I'm hoping you can get some propranolol soonish.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 13:38:06	@donholley0 hahaha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 13:09:56	@donholley0 lol
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 09:00:24	@IQinspector Hoping it ends soon!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 08:56:20	@IQinspector I'm good! No hail here so I'm happy.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 08:23:20	@IQinspector Wow! So glad to hear that!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 07:58:12	@IQinspector Ugh. How are you doing otherwise?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 06:59:35	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Cool! Can't wait!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 06:25:20	@DEPRESSI0NISTA It's so amazing! You HAVE to show photos of you in it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 05:31:56	@DEPRESSI0NISTA YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! Excellent job!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 01:51:12	@FreshKnowsFresh What platform do you use for your stock purchasing, etc.? I'm using an app called "Robin Hood".
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 01:19:32	@BipolarTweets Aw, man. I'm sorry that happened. Please don't beat yourself up about it too much.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 00:39:20	So the program running time went from about 9.5 hours to about 9.5 minutes.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 00:38:05	@xxhatred_com So so glad to hear this, man
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 00:37:43	@koalaalltheway Ugh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 00:37:36	@SparklyErinS Congratulations on being home!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 00:18:48	@alicia_tk26 Best of luck
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 00:17:37	@joypaulinesmith Ugh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-12 00:17:23	@IQinspector Hope you can sleep, sister
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-11 13:11:07	Watching "The Fundamentals of Caring". So far it's really good.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-11 13:03:14	@Ihatethisugh1 Great outlook!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-11 12:55:37	@Ihatethisugh1 Oh man that really bites
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-11 12:32:59	Was heading home from work; stopped for a burger on the way. Hope you're doing well, dear friends
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-11 11:44:53	@pet_unicorn I see. I hope you'll be able to sleep sometime soon!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-11 11:33:40	@jane_benians Oh nooo, Jane. I'm very very sorry to hear this. Wishing you peace
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-07-11 11:31:02	@pet_unicorn Oh nooo. Do you have a hypnotic to take?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-20 11:39:26	@leah_michal Ok. Glad it's not a knee-jerk reaction to something.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-20 11:38:22	@leah_michal Everyone matters. I think you'd be surprised at how much you matter.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-20 11:34:18	@leah_michal Ask for vacation time. Make that decision when you're not depressed. See your pdoc ASAP.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-19 03:26:26	Came in to work to check on some automated tasks. All but one worked. Trying something different for the one that failed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-19 03:02:37	Going to go see "Finding Dory". Excited about that! I hope you're enjoying your weekend, fine people

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-18 10:46:55	@nyanlasers Quick, go retweet one of your best!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-18 10:21:10	@nyanlasers Your shameless self-promotion has landed you in Twitter purgatory. Nah, I'm just kidding
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-18 10:18:55	@nyanlasers Jeebus.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-18 10:02:39	@chris_mahan I have Win 7, too. Have fought for admin rights
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-18 09:48:11	@chris_mahan Oh, man! No way! That's horrible
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-18 09:43:27	@chris_mahan Sorry, man. It sucks when you have to fight unnecessary battles.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-18 06:35:28	APScheduler was failing too often. I've now switched to the "schedule" module and all is well again! Hope you're doing good, friends!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-17 08:34:19	Windows Task Scheduler was not working for me so I've converted five daily reports to use Python's APScheduler instead! Happy about that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-17 04:45:42	Implemented a fix to one of my reports. It is a partial fix though so the client is still asking for the rest to be fixed. Gotta get moving.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-17 03:55:23	Archiving email so my computer is going to be very busy for the next several minutes!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-17 02:15:59	@koalaalltheway Phew!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 23:45:53	@jane_benians Glad you're enjoying it. If you can, ask about Wellbutrin (buproprion). That has helped my concentration immensely.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 06:46:43	@tlscadden1 Thank you so much. You're very right. I have a workaround now so I'm good.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 06:28:28	@loarnagreen Highly uncouth
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 05:53:09	@SparklyErinS Awww. I'm glad you're getting to go home though.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 02:19:59	@DnyLdn Good practice, though!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 02:13:29	@C4mD3v I have Linux at home. Fortunately I have access to a 32-bit machine here at work.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 01:33:42	@FI3ND_ Excellent!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 01:33:03	For the last two days the main database I use has been bogged down by too many requests. Makes work difficult.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 01:26:32	@KosmishArtist_ Enjoy your time away...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 01:26:16	@KosmishArtist_ Aw, nothing could be further from the truth!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 01:07:49	@chris_mahan Well put!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 01:02:14	@chris_mahan I know the feeling! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 00:56:49	I have another 32-bit vs 64-bit issue. Ugh.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 00:56:19	@chris_mahan Morning, Chris. I hope it's a great day for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 00:47:56	@pup_ear_nibbles Thank you so much :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-15 00:43:18	@pup_ear_nibbles Aw, I hope you're able to muster some energy before it's too late. Thinking of you. Sending love and hugs.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 11:21:48	@NedKellysArmour Ugh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 09:16:17	@Inventing_grey Oh nooo. On behalf of males I apologise. That's terrible
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 05:53:44	@BiggieSmalley That's so terrible, man. Sending love
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 04:49:39	@chercolvin Awww, hugs back!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 04:33:22	@BiggieSmalley New PC is working alright so far so I'm happy :-) Thank you for asking!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 03:05:18	@chris_mahan I think I got lucky this time. I haven't fully tested the new machine though so we'll see!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 03:04:13	@cookiebetch420 Excellent!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 02:21:16	This problem was resolved by me getting another new PC! Be well, friends!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 01:17:19	Arghhh. Main database I use is slow as molasses.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 01:13:51	@chercolvin Miss you, too, sister!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 00:56:17	@Lyingsoothsayer Enjoy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 00:24:18	@DnyLdn Doing ok, man. Feeling pretty fresh to start the new week despite coming in to work on Saturday.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 00:18:34	@DnyLdn I'm sorry, man. Yes that does suck
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-14 00:17:21	@DnyLdn I get that feeling when I skip meds for approximately three days.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-06-13 23:40:36	@_HeyMisfit_ Same

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-19 08:58:04	@pup_ear_nibbles It was!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-19 05:17:38	@jenac83 Doing alright!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-19 05:17:23	@tlscadden1 Haha!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 23:04:17	@KosmishArtist_ I'm so very sorry
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 21:27:44	@DnyLdn Thank you, Sir!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 20:57:02	A nice breakfast of rye toast, two scrambled eggs, and some fried potatoes. Ready for the day!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 09:55:41	@Ihatethisugh1 It's ok to feel a little shame but please don't get hung up on it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 09:54:34	@jathanism I've seen some Google code with two-space indentation
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 07:16:14	@BiggieSmalley Sounds great!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 06:53:50	@BiggieSmalley Nice, dude. If I recall correctly you were due for one of those.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 06:52:59	@20andBipolar I'm glad you made it to 30!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 06:49:35	@nyanlasers Valuable Pelt!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 06:38:39	@chris_mahan A capital idea!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 06:10:25	@chris_mahan I've spent all day trying to figure it out and am running into walls everywhere I turn. I've conferred with colleagues, etc.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 06:04:13	@chris_mahan I like your enthusiasm!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 05:58:52	There's this weird edge-case at work. One of the areas is doing things differently than the others and it's messing with my data. Grr
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 05:18:43	@chercolvin *hugs back*
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 05:01:33	@parkbaedrive Haha. Enjoy your food :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 03:54:59	Thanks to @DEPRESSI0NISTA for making me a custom dreamcatcher!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 02:23:06	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh ok. I wish you luck in your search. I'm doing ok. Thank you for asking.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 02:15:47	@pup_ear_nibbles How are you handling it now?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-18 00:37:40	@joypaulinesmith Sorry about the loss of your marriage
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-17 14:07:05	@Ihatethisugh1 Nice one!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-17 13:21:44	Had a full day of driving. Now winding down
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-17 13:15:12	@ecrjones Absolutely not
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-17 13:13:48	@SparklyErinS So so so glad to hear this. You are definitely not a fraud
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-17 13:12:48	@nyanlasers The last two are pure genius

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-16 05:06:50	@projectmonark Glad to hear it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-16 05:06:12	@DEPRESSI0NISTA @grendeldave LOL

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-15 05:07:44	@SparklyErinS No, that is wrong. You deserve and need help. I'm thinking of you during this unpredictable time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-15 05:03:18	@SparklyErinS Sorry, Erin. I hope they check on you soon. In the meantime have a hug. *hug*

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-14 17:21:31	@m666hornet It was a great night, thank you! And yes I have my car back :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-14 17:18:39	@m666hornet Late. Winding down for the night :-)

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-14 17:15:08	@m666hornet Good for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-14 05:19:45	@leah_michal I'm glad you got Monday off. Is she letting you leave early today as well?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-14 05:19:09	@tlscadden1 Not sure. Lack of antenna coverage I suppose.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-14 04:53:20	@leah_michal I haven't felt so hot so I've been taking a lot of time off.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-14 04:45:46	@leah_michal Can you ask to leave early?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-14 04:44:40	@leah_michal I'm very sorry to hear this, Lisa. How soon can you see your professional(s)?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-14 04:43:16	Driving in Altadena I often have no reception. Has made for some interesting drives.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-14 02:58:50	@joypaulinesmith Hey! So nice to hear from you! Enjoy the mountain! :-)

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-12 03:53:16	@700flights It's ok. It'll be back in action in no time!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-12 03:35:52	@m666hornet Thanks, mate!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-12 03:10:11	@m666hornet Oh wow! Nice new account. Not sure how long it'll be.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-12 02:10:13	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Ugh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-12 02:09:20	@grendeldave I can't stand Facebook

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-11 02:48:04	@C4mD3v Aren't we all, aren't we all...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-11 02:21:33	@emily_the_gray Funny thing about that is that if he really loves Latinos he would know that he's eating a tostada not a taco bowl.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-11 01:28:24	@DnyLdn Thanks for asking, man. I'm doing pretty well. Glad you're doing ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-11 01:26:41	Back at work after a three-day weekend. Not too much piled up so I'm lucky. How is everyone doing?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-08 08:43:04	@xtokahontas What kind of weed do you smoke? Can you get one that energizes you?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-06 00:19:40	@chris_mahan We just got approved for one telecommuting day per week. I want to take mine today... I'll see if I get up the gumption to ask.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-06 00:10:07	@chris_mahan Btw, are permitted to telecommute? If so, how often?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-06 00:09:40	@chris_mahan Alrighty! Let's make it a great one!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 19:10:16	@zendao42 @Majesty_o_Weird @HillaryMonahan Followed! Thanks for the recommendation!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 15:55:28	@NedKellysArmour I'll be thinking of you two
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 15:52:42	@Ihatethisugh1 Sorry to hear that, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 15:52:22	@Ihatethisugh1 That's a nice dream
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 15:03:14	@chris_mahan It does in a sense. I found better luck in the Hollywood area
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 13:04:32	@karenbevan58 Morning!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 13:04:08	@projectmonark You're absolutely right. I signed up for Uber. My application is in the process of being approved
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 12:59:58	@Ihatethisugh1 Thanks, man
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 12:58:58	@Ihatethisugh1 Haha. Oh I'm sorry to make you jealous

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 07:24:39	@tlscadden1 Thank you for the solidarity!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 07:08:10	@SparklyErinS Thanks for asking. I'm doing well. Still feeling really happy about yesterday's good news!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 07:07:34	@joypaulinesmith Haha I would too
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 07:06:08	@joypaulinesmith Good on you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 07:05:11	@SparklyErinS Ah, maybe just a bad day. How's Fangh? (Hope I got the spelling right!)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 06:59:35	@SparklyErinS Yeah that seems to border on the unprofessional
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 06:56:19	@SparklyErinS Sorry that happened, Erin. I hope next visit will be better.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 06:55:23	@BiggieSmalley Sidewalk grilling weather

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 06:51:34	@BiggieSmalley Ouch. What is it today where you are?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 06:06:35	I just requested two weeks off of work. I'm so happy.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 05:26:23	@BlueBiochemist Aww
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 05:23:54	@BlueBiochemist Ooh, sorry. Can you get a massage?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 05:04:46	@BlueBiochemist Good for you! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 04:49:49	@pup_ear_nibbles Thanks very much for asking. I'm doing pretty well! I got some great news yesterday so I'm still flying high
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 04:49:22	@pup_ear_nibbles No, I like your views just wanted to see how you were doing otherwise. Sorry to hear about your mom.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 04:16:57	@pup_ear_nibbles Hey how's life? Politics aside for the time being...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 04:11:42	@joypaulinesmith Oh geez

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 01:36:11	@mahannay U ok?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 00:57:34	@star_curl Cool :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 00:35:02	@XERO_360 Oh geez. Thanks. #MayThe4thBeWithYou too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-05 00:25:30	@XERO_360 Heh. Sorry that happened. Can you call customer service?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 23:23:36	@witchified Thanks so much! :-) Are you bipolar by chance?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 23:22:49	@menhealuk So glad you're feeling a bit better!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 23:20:33	@witchified Thanks :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 23:15:13	@witchified I can only speak for myself here: I'm so glad for antidepressants. I would never consider not taking them.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 23:01:38	@_AngelKate_ So glad to hear this, Katy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 22:00:50	@alwaysunstable Good for you for doing that!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 22:00:14	Good morning from the West Coast of the United States of America. We sincerely hope that Donald Trump will not be our next President.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 15:50:19	@ErinLand20 Best of luck with it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 15:08:28	@ItsTheWeeThings Thank you, Cat. How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 14:59:08	@ErinLand20 Good for you! If you don't mind sharing, what is your idea?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 14:54:36	@grendeldave @Majesty_o_Weird Oh my. No I didn't see that. That's terrible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 14:53:18	@Majesty_o_Weird You're following the right people! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 14:51:04	@NedKellysArmour Seriously.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 14:49:24	@BiggieSmalley It certainly looks that way, though
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 14:48:45	@grendeldave To be fair I think your former self would never imagine a Trump would come along. All the same, I'm glad you're no longer red.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 14:46:15	I love my country, don't get me wrong. I happen to also feel shame now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 14:44:57	The world is a crazy place. I can't believe Trump will be the Republican nominee. I'm ashamed to live in a country where that can happen.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 14:34:22	@psychotic_18 Happy birthday, Beth!!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 14:33:34	@chris_mahan Hasta manana, amigo!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 13:45:23	@CM5700 Thank you so much
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 06:57:08	@NedKellysArmour Understandably
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 06:52:55	@NedKellysArmour Geez. I'm sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 06:49:31	@NedKellysArmour Geez. I told you how much my ex-wife gets, right?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 06:45:13	@NedKellysArmour Wow! How is that happening? Does this mean that the payments will be reinstated? *crosses fingers*
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 06:40:38	@SimbaTalks Sorry to hear. That sounds very stressful.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 06:29:49	@NedKellysArmour Glad it didn't break in other places!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 06:27:28	@NedKellysArmour Ah, I see. How did the fence hold up?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 06:14:11	@chercolvin Aw, how sweet
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 06:05:30	@chercolvin Thank you so much :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 05:50:28	@chercolvin I got some really good news earlier today so I'm on cloud nine right now
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 05:50:01	@ang_fran I know the feeling. I think I'm a terrible, selfish person.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 05:49:30	@chercolvin Happy Birthday!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 05:48:35	I got some good news earlier today. I'm really happy about it. I hope you're doing well, friends.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-04 05:47:53	@ang_fran I'm sorry, Ang. I hope you'll feel better soon.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 23:05:40	@SparklyErinS I'm very sorry to hear this, Erin. I'm thinking of you and hoping your mood turns around soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 23:03:49	@chris_mahan Way to go, @loarnagreen !
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 22:51:20	@NedKellysArmour I say it doesn't. You're up mighty early, btw.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 22:50:34	Tried listening to some Coldplay. Couldn't stand the cloying nature of the songs. Have a great day, friends!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 09:45:13	@grendeldave Haha. Nice little anecdote for a Monday evening
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 09:43:48	@nyanlasers Nothing to be concerned about
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 09:34:44	@grendeldave Whoa blast from the past
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 09:23:52	@_AngelKate_ Sending love and hugs to you, Katy
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 09:23:02	Resuming my viewing. Edward Norton's character has just asked for a beating and got one.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 09:21:37	@DallaDxBPD Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 09:16:34	@xtokahontas Haha. Weird. Sorry that's happening. Are they muted by chance?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 07:44:09	@NedKellysArmour Is that a normal thing or is this out of the blue?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 07:43:41	@nyanlasers Liked for "cryptic/cryptid". Your vocabulary is formidable.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 07:27:44	@pup_ear_nibbles How goes the struggle?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 07:20:34	@NedKellysArmour Crap
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 07:19:01	@NedKellysArmour Perfect for that party you're supposed to be having ;-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 07:07:03	@cookiebetch420 What a guy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 06:57:13	@bpd_deathwish I'm so very sorry you're feeling this way. I care about you and want you around.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 06:45:32	@NedKellysArmour When's the party taking place?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 06:29:00	@NedKellysArmour Good luck. I hope it's a good day for him

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 01:32:50	@leah_michal Glad to hear your mood is up. Sorry about the tremors. Do you have propranolol?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 01:19:29	@rabbitsoup_zola Ultimately I think it was boredom
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 01:18:32	@rabbitsoup_zola Several months
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 01:12:53	@rabbitsoup_zola Right.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 01:11:32	@rabbitsoup_zola I know the feeling. Don't hate yourself for it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 01:08:02	@koalaalltheway Sorry, Anna. Thinking of you and hoping for the best.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 00:13:08	@BlueBiochemist Good luck to you. I hope you're able to push past the malaise
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-03 00:06:34	@BlueBiochemist That makes two of us.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-02 23:54:24	@xxhatred_com Sorry, man. That sucks. I hope you'll be able to get it replaced.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-02 22:32:16	@chris_mahan Buenos dias, Chris! Let's make it a good day!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-02 20:58:06	@Ihatethisugh1 Maybe they didn't see it?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-02 11:54:48	Watching "The 25th Hour". Can't believe I missed it when it came out.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-02 11:32:13	@joypaulinesmith You lie down and ambient music is played. It was very relaxing
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-02 10:27:10	@leah_michal Good for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-02 10:24:27	@projectmonark It was very relaxing. I went in with a lot of tension and came out completely loose.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-02 08:08:45	Lazy Sunday watching movies. I hope you're well, friends

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-01 15:14:35	@Ihatethisugh1 Hahaha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-05-01 14:47:23	@Ihatethisugh1 Doing alright. Went to a sound bath earlier. Very relaxing

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-29 12:59:02	I'll start by saying a joke about an Ikea interview: "Make a chair and have a seat"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-29 12:57:37	I have tomorrow off so I'll likely be up late tonight. Let's entertain each other, friends!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-29 09:31:04	In a bit of a quandary as to where to eat. I didn't eat lunch so something substantial would be advisable, I think.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-29 09:30:08	@rabbitsoup_zola *hugs* You're not. I know you don't want to hear that but you're really not.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-29 06:58:24	@SparklyErinS Oh I see. Not an easy time. Sending love and hugs. You can do this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-29 06:54:52	@SparklyErinS Everything's ok. You have people who love you. You have a roof over your head. What's eating you right now?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-29 06:54:01	@NedKellysArmour Holding out hope that you get something good without too much of a hassle.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-29 06:36:10	@eb462 I'm doing fine atm. Thank you so much for asking. Wellbutrin is doing good things for me.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-29 05:58:31	@Jinthelife Sucks. You have my sympathy
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-29 05:40:37	@crymeariver89 We all have those days. I hope it passes soon.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-29 01:34:16	@sexually I like to take Ativan with my coffee. You stay alert without the jitters.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 04:16:19	@BipolarLife21 lulz
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 04:01:54	@alicia_tk26 So glad
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 03:49:24	Had a nice lunch with two co-workers; chose chicken enchiladas.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 02:35:53	@Lyingsoothsayer Aw, I'm sorry. Get them to give you some Wellbutrin. That seems to be doing wonders for decreasing my appetite.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 02:16:42	@eb462 Emily, please take care of yourself.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 02:11:10	@unsuicide Have a good break!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 02:10:53	@_CongoRilla_ Yuck. Sorry that's happened.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 02:06:19	@_griffithsh Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 01:54:58	@NedKellysArmour So happy for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 01:29:30	@menhealuk Enjoy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 01:12:52	@thetaintedclock Yuck, sorry Zoe. Sending love and hugs.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 00:39:24	@loarnagreen Your annoyance is very justified in this case
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 00:28:26	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Thanks to you for alerting me to this side-effect!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 00:23:24	@DEPRESSI0NISTA That should be a good thing in the short term as I've picked up some unwanted pounds.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 00:19:57	@jenac83 Good for you for moving on
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 00:17:31	@jenac83 It's definitely a bittersweet thing
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 00:15:46	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Thanks! I noticed this a bit yesterday. After breakfast I didn't eat until midnight.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 00:09:53	@cookiebetch420 @witchified That's terrible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 00:06:45	They're out of the mocha energy drink I usually get. I shall resort to vanilla instead.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-15 00:04:33	Breezing through my work this morning despite not sleeping well nor enough. Coffee and the new dose of 450mg Wellbutrin seem to be helping.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 23:58:56	@SparklyErinS Sorry to hear. Glad you're home now, though
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 23:58:38	@jathanism It's the video games that're causing this! (sarcasm)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 23:03:29	Driving for Lyft has at least the following benefits for me: I'm around people. I'm not alone and drinking. I'm making money.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 22:55:36	I'm currently taking one lorazepam every day before work. Eventually my pdoc wants me off of it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 22:53:56	@SparklyErinS Good for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 22:49:55	@SparklyErinS Ooh, cafe!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 22:40:12	Good morning West Coast. Let's make it a good day
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 22:39:44	@SageSilk One step at a time!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 22:36:18	@SageSilk I'm impressed with you. Being on your own and taking care of yourself.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 22:35:56	@BipolarSanity Something like what they have in Oregon or the Netherlands I'm imagining.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 22:32:38	@BipolarSanity As the Queen song admonishes: "don't try suicide"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 22:31:52	@SparklyErinS Take the time you need for yourself, Erin. For those who love you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 22:29:10	@SageSilk You most definitely deserve it, sister!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 15:30:17	@chris_mahan Nice!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 11:31:43	@MsBPD_London I hope you're able to do so soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 11:17:14	@cookiebetch420 Nice! Please do show when finished!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 11:08:23	@Ihatethisugh1 Best wishes for a smooth surgery and swift recovery!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 04:14:01	Had a really good visit with my pdoc. Going up on Wellbutrin to 450mg, and down on Paxil to 10mg.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 01:38:12	@CM5700 I have no children.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 01:38:03	@CM5700 I'm doing ok. Thank you for asking.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 01:21:20	@CM5700 I know the feeling of not wanting children. Best wishes communicating that effectively to your partner.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 01:20:33	@leah_michal Sorry, that sucks.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-14 01:20:08	@leah_michal Sorry you had to see that.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-13 08:29:00	@Anxiwarrior Sleep well
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-04-13 08:28:46	At home charging the phone because the car charger's not fast enough. Then it's back to work.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 12:52:23	@700flights Thank you, BC. I eventually went home at about 9:30pm.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 08:53:19	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Thank you so much, lk. I appreciate your kind thoughts :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 08:20:41	Sat in a car by a park because I don't want to go home.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 08:06:46	@Rivkah_g Yay!!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 07:17:42	@Rivkah_g Offering internet-based solace. Is your train/bus coming soon?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 06:46:17	@_AngelKate_ Sleep as well as possible, Katy
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 06:28:45	@_AngelKate_ Ugh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 05:34:31	@chris_mahan FWIW I linked Google Play to PayPal and that seems to work ok.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 05:01:59	@NedKellysArmour Good morning!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 04:40:46	@_AngelKate_ Oh no, Katy. Keep yourself safe. For those who love you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 04:38:32	@SparklyErinS Oh, no. Sorry, Erin. Wish there was something I could do to help. Sending love and hugs.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 04:33:35	@koalaalltheway No need to apologise :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 04:33:19	@koalaalltheway No I don't think it decreases my energy though that's a possibility.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 04:30:03	@koalaalltheway I think I've gained a little bit of weight on it. But that might just be my lack of activity :-O
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 04:24:50	@koalaalltheway At a low dose (5mg) it gave me akathasia (restlessness). At my normal dose (30mg) I don't have akathasia.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 04:23:41	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Do you have a lightbox? If not it might be a worthwhile investment. They can be had on teh webz for $30 to $40.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-25 00:16:51	@cookiebetch420 Thank you so much. I can barely make out the better moments from here, but they're there!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 23:52:53	@crymeariver89 I feel ok. Maybe somewhat relieved. A little distraught.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 23:50:10	Relationship with my gf is over. I've taken 3 lorazepam. Difficult to be at work today.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 23:16:21	@HeadStable That's terrible, Finch. Anything you can do to correct that?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 23:14:15	@PinkPalaceAngel Aw, sorry PA. I hope they come soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 22:39:06	@crymeariver89 Thank you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 16:46:56	Now gf wants to break up with me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 14:49:31	Can't sleep. Took a Lunesta. We'll see if it kicks in
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 12:55:46	@alwaysunstable Oh good. Glad you have something to do
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 12:49:09	@BipolarLife21 Does in my book!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 12:47:59	@leah_michal I know you're telling yourself this anyway: You're not messing anything up; it's all in your head
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 12:46:14	@sexually Aw, sorry. Sleep well, sister

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 06:04:26	@pup_ear_nibbles Wait, what happened?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 05:37:48	Supposed to have a meeting with my assistant director but she's not there. Annoyed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-18 05:17:56	@thetaintedclock Good on you

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 23:16:19	@cookiebetch420 I think you should write it up. I would read it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 10:37:27	@CM5700 Yeah we're still hanging on. Thank you for asking.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 07:05:16	@cookiebetch420 Ooh, sorry you're feeling weird
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 05:57:35	@NedKellysArmour Yeah, nah, too old for that. Was nice of him to offer.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 05:49:28	Met a yogi on the street who proceeded to tell me about my life. He says a voodoo was put on me and that he'll pray to lift it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 05:48:33	@abdulkareem_sau Thank you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 04:04:18	In my therapist's office waiting to be seen. So much to discuss

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 03:28:47	@joypaulinesmith 1mg. I just took another because that first one wasn't doing it for me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 02:24:00	@pup_ear_nibbles Hey! Nice to hear from you. I hope you have a good trip!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 02:06:16	@leah_michal A little better. I guess I really do need the lorazepam. I had been trying to deal with life without it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 02:05:42	@SparklyErinS Thank you so much, Erin.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 01:53:05	Feeling a lot of anxiety so I took lorazepam for the first time in about a week.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-17 01:34:59	@SparklyErinS Sorry, E. I hope you're able to afford it soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-16 23:22:54	Good morning, all. I hope it's a great day for you. Gf is a little more reasonable recently so I'm feeling better.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-16 07:19:32	@PjLaube I feel ok. A little stressed. Thank you for asking
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-16 07:10:00	@PjLaube Cold turkey
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-16 07:04:40	@PjLaube Was on a few months at 1mg per day

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-16 01:58:55	@leah_michal It is. Thank you for talking about it with me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-16 01:56:23	@leah_michal Yeah I agree. I'm going to try to find a place so I can move out. This is getting to be too much.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-16 01:51:37	@leah_michal That I need to work on myself.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-16 01:40:00	Gf is majorly on my case. She seems deeply discontent.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-16 00:45:12	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Have a great day, LK!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-12 07:49:03	@NedKellysArmour Sorry if I sound bitter
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-12 07:48:33	@NedKellysArmour She has no kids and no mortgage

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 03:40:27	@BiggieSmalley Thanks, man. So far it's not going so well, hehe
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 03:40:02	Listening to some old Living Colour.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 03:33:56	I'm trying not to take lorazepam.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 03:33:09	@NedKellysArmour You're most welcome. I love the art :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 03:25:32	@DrEm_79 I'm so sorry, E. I hope things turn out ok
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 03:19:03	@Jinthelife @RubyProductions Followed!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 02:24:29	@BipolarLife21 I'm struggling with this, too. I have little to no libido.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 02:21:19	@700flights That's great to hear. I'm feeling a bit better, thanks
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 02:07:46	@chelaetc 's show is sold out :'(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 02:04:22	@eb462 Aww, how sweet of you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 01:25:58	@SparklyErinS Oh I see.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 01:23:38	@SparklyErinS I get a month at a time of lorazepam and I thought that was annoying. It must be tough to get just two weeks' worth
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 01:19:14	@700flights Haha. No I'm not. How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 01:09:38	@karenbevan58 She's getting better every day. Thank you so much for asking
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-09 00:58:17	Feeling annoyed today. I hope this improves. I also hope you're doing well, dear friends.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-08 05:01:59	@pup_ear_nibbles Glad you turned it off
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-08 04:57:04	@pup_ear_nibbles Yeah that's really creepy
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-08 04:54:03	@pup_ear_nibbles It could've been from a website.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-08 04:51:41	@pup_ear_nibbles Not as far as I know
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-08 04:47:31	@pup_ear_nibbles If it's turned off, no.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-08 04:47:18	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh nooo. Can you reformat it?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-08 02:33:31	@lizs_heart Hey! How are you today, sister?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-03-08 02:23:41	Did several flights of stairs so far today. It's helping me think more clearly.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-22 09:29:09	@projectmonark I see. I'm sorry, man. Do you use CBT?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-22 09:18:46	@projectmonark Oh, man. That is no fun. Can you get it prescribed?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-22 09:18:04	Helped my sister buy a computer today. Was nice to see her.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-22 07:27:52	@projectmonark Hey, man! How's it going?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-22 00:47:33	@rabbitsoup_zola Looks great!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-22 00:06:36	Good morning, all!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 12:58:37	@Ihatethisugh1 Looking forward to it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 12:34:04	@chris_mahan Glad to hear it on both counts!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 12:29:47	Enjoying a quiet night at home. I hope you're well, dear friends.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 12:27:22	@grendeldave I hope someone responds soon!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 11:59:50	@chercolvin That's such great news!! I'm so happy for you! I'm doing fine, thank you for asking.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 11:57:02	@chercolvin Hey Cher Bear, how's life?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 11:40:46	@NedKellysArmour Sorry, that sucks. I hope you get someone soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 10:10:30	@ArtPunkBeardGuy You tried pretzel's with peanut butter inside? They have some at Trader Joe's.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 10:05:09	Going to get a couple of Xbox games. Say goodbye to productivity.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 09:56:59	@700flights Hahaha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 09:43:51	@700flights He looks excited about the photo ;-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 09:33:48	@BiggieSmalley Sorry, man. Hang in there. You'll be in my thoughts.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 09:25:48	@BiggieSmalley I hope you can get a break soon, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 09:23:11	@leah_michal Thanks, yeah, she sleeps well with it and Klonopin.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 09:19:55	@leah_michal I'm ok. Thank you for asking. Gf has been hypomanic. Fortunately she's taking Latuda which is helping.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 09:01:28	@leah_michal So glad to hear this, Lisa!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 08:05:44	@NedKellysArmour Doing ok. Thank you for asking. Haven't had lorazepam so far today :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 08:03:50	@drivelhe4d Congratulations!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 08:02:35	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Lovely! Really great colors
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 08:02:11	@NedKellysArmour Good morning!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 07:40:58	@ecrjones Good to know. I wish you the best
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 07:31:33	@ecrjones I see.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 06:56:51	@ecrjones Is lurasidone an option for you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 06:43:56	@ecrjones So what will you try next?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 06:09:21	@ecrjones It did the same for me at a low dose. Once I got up to 30mg that went away.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 06:02:02	@debecca Wow!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 06:01:09	@ecrjones Wasn't for me either. I take aripiprazole instead.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 05:39:23	@Inventing_grey Flirting by bagel
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 05:33:53	@NikitaElizabeth Ooh, nice! Photos when you get a chance, please :-)

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 05:21:16	@neesasuncheuri Hi. I'm ok. I've joined your group :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 05:03:15	@NikitaElizabeth I'm doing alright, thank you. What kind of car did you get?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 04:43:03	Feeling restless. Should go for a jog.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 04:41:19	@SparklyErinS Nice work!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-21 02:32:36	@eb462 I'm doing ok. Thank you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 14:03:47	@BipolarSanity I'm sorry, Gus.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 13:09:47	@NedKellysArmour Ah, I see. Well I hope you find ways to manage your stress
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 13:05:34	@NedKellysArmour Oh so you do have it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 13:03:30	@cookiebetch420 Please go easy on yourself
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 11:26:56	@king_weird Ouch.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 11:10:12	@king_weird Sorry, man. Hoping for a speedy recovery
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 11:08:57	@cookiebetch420 You must have needed it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 09:58:17	@pet_unicorn Sorry you can't sleep. Sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 08:37:02	Looking forward to picking up new eyeglasses today.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 08:05:10	Gf got back on the Latuda. Thank goodness she's sleeping well on it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 07:33:37	Another case of someone conflating Unicode and UTF-8. Le sigh.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 07:17:05	@BubbasL0V3 Ugh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 07:14:42	@BubbasL0V3 I hope so too. Finding a new one is a chore.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 07:13:34	@ArtPunkBeardGuy Very glad to hear this, Sir
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 07:09:26	@BubbasL0V3 Sorry, that sucks. Sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 03:55:44	@imillnotcrazy That's terrible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 03:46:57	@imillnotcrazy Oh nooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 03:42:39	@DnyLdn Good for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 03:22:35	@PieterJJonker Sending love, Pieter.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 03:10:30	@DnyLdn I see. I think it's healthy to distance yourself from her.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 03:08:38	@DnyLdn Sorry, man. Sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 01:22:33	@abdulkareem_sau Good stuff, man. I'm glad you're getting out soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 01:16:46	@abdulkareem_sau Good for you. When do you get out?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 01:08:55	@abdulkareem_sau I used to play hockey. No more though. How about you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 00:53:23	@rabbitsoup_zola Gooo Bunny!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-20 00:29:14	Good morning, Good People. Let's make it a great day.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 11:55:09	@NedKellysArmour Hang in there!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 09:56:34	@DEPRESSI0NISTA You probably needed it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 09:47:33	@leah_michal So glad to hear this!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 07:48:58	@pup_ear_nibbles Yes that's true!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 06:58:01	@PinkPalaceAngel That's so great for you!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 05:00:14	@SageSilk Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 03:52:50	Going for 30 minutes of meditation. Hoping for a quieted mind.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 02:27:13	@SparklyErinS Hehe!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 02:21:15	@SparklyErinS That's so terrible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 02:20:43	@SparklyErinS FWIW I haven't been to a barber since 1999.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 02:10:49	@SparklyErinS I hope it goes well. Maybe take a benzo beforehand.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 02:01:22	A little restless this morning. Lorazepam deployed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 02:01:03	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm doing ok. A little restless this morning. Lorazepam deployed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 01:54:22	@rabbitsoup_zola Sorry you're feeling that way, Bunny. Sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-19 01:48:54	Good morning, friends. I hope you're all doing well today.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 14:39:41	@lizs_heart Sleep well!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 14:34:57	@TweetLilLatina Hey! I'm still awake... barely.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 08:13:36	@BiggieSmalley Nice, dude. Bet that feels good
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 08:08:48	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm very glad to hear that! I'm doing ok. I just found out I have high-functioning autism.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 06:48:29	@loarnagreen Welcome back! I am your normal Twitter follower bernie.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 06:45:30	@glittahcat What!? Why?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 06:43:43	@pup_ear_nibbles I miss you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 04:32:20	A sad day at the office. A phenomenal co-worker is moving onward and upward. I'll miss her but wish her well in her new role.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 03:57:33	@eb462 Sorry Emily. Sending hugs and love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 02:53:59	@SageSilk I hope it happens soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 02:40:49	@SageSilk Well even just that acknowledgement is good to hear from you. I hope you're doing as well as is possible given the circumstances.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 02:37:53	@SageSilk Not at all the case. I miss reading your tweets.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-18 02:20:41	Happy to be at work doing something rewarding and worthwhile.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 22:58:10	@DEPRESSI0NISTA I'm sorry you feel so sad. I'd say use it as creative fuel but it looks like you're already doing so
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 22:55:30	@dmwise Thank you, Dave. I appreciate your thoughts.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 22:34:39	@ItsTheWeeThings Aww, thank you so much.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 13:47:03	Feeling a little down. Probably related to my diagnosis yesterday. I know I shouldn't think this way... I wish I had known sooner
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 13:44:36	@projectmonark Sleep well, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 13:44:15	@NikitaElizabeth How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 12:32:42	@zendao42 Glad Hulu is working well for you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 10:32:11	@projectmonark Freeciv. It's on linux.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 10:27:59	Playing a computer game to relax.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 10:25:16	@chris_mahan I know that feeling.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 10:25:01	@_AngelKate_ I hope so, too. Sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 10:16:50	@chris_mahan I know how you feel. I feel fortunate to have found some good people at my workplace and at home.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 10:09:55	@chris_mahan True. You have to find good people here.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 09:58:56	@chris_mahan I'm glad you feel ok here. It's my birthplace and I'll probably never live anywhere else.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 09:58:31	@_AngelKate_ I'm doing ok. How are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 09:36:15	@chris_mahan That is sad my friend.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 09:31:54	@chris_mahan Have you felt at home with people?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 08:23:16	Nearly time to leave work for the day. Happy about that. I hope you're doing well, dear friends.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 08:22:44	@miss_phoenix_ Just a tad
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 08:19:55	@miss_phoenix_ Good on you

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 06:24:37	@cookiebetch420 Who needs them :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 06:24:22	@SparklyErinS Try to be good. I know it's tough.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 06:21:04	@700flights Haha. Thanks for the heart :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 06:14:59	Working on some object-oriented programming. Trying to find reasons to prefer it over procedural programming.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 06:09:58	@MHponderland So glad to know you're safe.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 04:54:59	@RSenteza That's so great :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 04:50:43	@RSenteza Woohoo! Congratulations! Very happy for you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 03:48:50	@chris_mahan I like it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 03:32:16	@Psychoticka How can we help?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 02:50:04	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Well done!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-17 00:10:01	@chris_mahan Good morning, Chris!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 11:03:18	@cookiebetch420 A delicate balancing act if there ever was one.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 10:49:50	@king_weird Oh I'm sorry to hear that. I hope for a swift resolution to that issue.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 10:38:12	@king_weird If it's strongly suspected you might want to get it confirmed so you and those around you can adjust and learn.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 10:37:30	@king_weird The doc said that if Asperger's were still in the DSM I'd have that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 10:33:01	@king_weird Just got formally diagnosed with high-functioning autism.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 10:28:51	Thanks for being a great friend, @Ihatethisugh1
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 10:25:20	@Ihatethisugh1 Good point. I definitely won't be telling anyone at work.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 10:17:32	@Ihatethisugh1 Thanks, man. That's precisely what I'm afraid of. For now I won't list it in my bio.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 10:09:11	@miss_phoenix_ Woohoo!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 10:07:28	@Ihatethisugh1 Thanks, man. I really appreciate your comments.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 10:07:10	@Ihatethisugh1 Yeah I do feel a bit sad. It's ok though. It's not so bad.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 09:51:39	@Ihatethisugh1 Yeah I probably should. I don't know how to feel. Mostly it should be a good thing, right? Now I can understand myself better
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 07:57:31	@miss_phoenix_ Thanks! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 07:52:04	@HeadStable I guess I do. Thank you for asking.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 07:51:27	@chris_mahan Thanks, man. I really appreciate it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-16 07:50:59	@_AngelKate_ Thank you for asking. I feel ok about it

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-13 04:23:08	Wrangled some VBA code into something usable by Python. Feeling rather accomplished.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-13 04:22:13	@nyanlasers Anything planned for the rest of the weekend?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-12 07:20:09	@BiggieSmalley Easy mistake to make.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-12 07:15:21	@chercolvin Nevermind I do.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:57:35	@rabbitsoup_zola Hey bunny. How's life?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:50:54	@projectmonark Haha. It was good food but I didn't touch it because work was so busy :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:43:31	@BiggieSmalley Thanks, it's cool.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:36:46	@NikitaElizabeth Thanks! I thought so, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:36:07	@TweetLilLatina Yeah I'll bring it back home. I didn't touch it at work anyway because today was so busy.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:33:29	Well I feel terrible. It turns out I took my roommate's food to work as I thought it was my lunch.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:30:18	The company at which I work has a Data Consultant opening. If you know of anyone in the Pasadena area with SQL knowledge send them my way!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:22:00	@miss_phoenix_ Good luck w/ the bookcase!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:21:19	@TweetLilLatina Nice to feel stuffed every now and again...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:20:57	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Ugh, sorry sister. Sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:17:23	@BiggieSmalley Good luck, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:16:58	@chris_mahan It sounds like you have a lot of autonomy.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:15:57	@chris_mahan Yes, it does. I try to provide my users with good products.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:08:49	@chris_mahan Oh wow. So no more coding? Or coding of CNC machines?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 12:02:13	@chris_mahan We have an opening for a Data Consultant. I'm afraid it'd be under your pay grade, though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 11:27:38	@miss_phoenix_ I see.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 11:17:42	@miss_phoenix_ Wow, that's GREAT news. So happy for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-11 11:14:32	@miss_phoenix_ Great news!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 08:08:27	Traditionally these presentations are within our department only. For this one people from other departments have requested to attend.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 08:07:35	On February 24th I'm giving a presentation about how I use #python in my job.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 08:03:45	@Missives0fASub Sorry you're feeling down. Hoping technology brings your mood up some.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 07:28:54	I'm really excited about this. Python is a programming language I use at work.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 07:26:51	A guy came by my cubicle to ask me about #python !
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 06:52:53	@learningtofloat As long as you get there eventually!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 06:46:48	@SageSilk Ok good luck with the book

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 04:34:56	@witchified Difficult to let go sometimes. Good for you for doing it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 04:29:30	@rabbitsoup_zola I don't like your new avatar.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 04:23:55	@miss_phoenix_ Good morning! (It's now early afternoon in Los Angeles)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 04:23:20	@BlueBiochemist But you'll be supportive of him nonetheless.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 03:40:18	@BlueBiochemist With family like you I'm sure he'll do fine
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-04 03:37:20	@BipolarSanity Good to hear that your depression has lifted a bit.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 08:24:26	Getting ready to leave work on time for the first time in a while. Happy about that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 07:41:29	@Blueeyedfoxie Lulz

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 07:05:19	Green tea + lemon tea. So nice.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 06:37:18	@eb462 I'm so sorry, Emily.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 06:36:32	@SageSilk Yay for the lorazepam
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 05:38:35	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Oh cool!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 05:36:37	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Oh that bites. Can you return them?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 05:35:00	@annedraya Sorry you're feeling down. Sending love.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 05:13:29	@ecrjones Good for you for resigning. That takes guts. I'm sorry that options have been limited.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 05:11:31	@ecrjones I know that feeling. Bipolar has, at times, put me on thin ice at my job.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 05:07:58	@ecrjones Sorry you're in a financial bind.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 05:07:40	@ecrjones I see.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 05:05:36	@ecrjones Aww, I'm sorry to hear that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 04:59:41	@ecrjones You're a good landlord/manager
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 04:41:57	@ecrjones They'll live
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 04:39:26	@ecrjones That's ok. It's aggravating nonetheless
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 04:37:48	@ecrjones Oh nooooooooooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 04:23:47	@Lababup Sending love and hugs.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 04:16:50	@nyanlasers Very nice
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 04:15:53	@eb462 They are delicious aren't they
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 04:15:41	@zendao42 Ouch. Good luck getting it back!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 01:05:29	@NikitaElizabeth Anxiety sucks. Some days I need 3mg lorazepam to deal with it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 00:50:12	@perp_perplexed Good luck on the ward. I hope you're able to venture out soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 00:47:43	@NikitaElizabeth I'm doing alright, thank you so much for asking. Just took a lorazepam so I'm enjoying the after-effect.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 00:42:17	@NikitaElizabeth Sending love and hugs.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-03 00:22:22	Load of Darkness just followed me. Not sure how I feel about that
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 23:58:14	@schizoaffectiv5 Very sorry to hear that
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 23:56:42	@king_weird @Teh_Basement Followed!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 23:54:41	Good morning from Los Angeles

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 23:26:53	@Lyingsoothsayer I'm so sorry. I wish you the best during your tribunal. At the least they should be telling you what they're injecting.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 23:24:36	@NicsVoice I'm so sorry, Erin. Sending love and hugs.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 10:18:51	At work. Waiting on a report to finish running.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 09:49:37	@FacesOfDarkness Glad you're hanging in there. Keep venting here as needed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 09:44:19	@FacesOfDarkness Oh that's terrible :-(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 09:36:09	@FacesOfDarkness So sorry this is the case. Are there any PRN meds you can take to help alleviate some of that?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 09:00:19	@NicsVoice That's great that you respond so quickly!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 08:59:49	@NicsVoice That's terrible. I'm very sorry to hear that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 08:55:01	@NicsVoice Because I know someone on an anti-depressant with no AAP and they got pushed into hypomania.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 08:54:06	@NicsVoice Hehe. Not at ALL
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 08:53:33	@NicsVoice Ah, I see. Thanks.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 08:51:48	@ladyahippie Nice one!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 08:50:54	@NicsVoice Just curious: do you take any anti-depressants?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 08:43:54	@SimbaTalks I'm so sorry, Simba. We'll see you when you get back. Take good care of yourself, please.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 08:30:00	@projectmonark Good luck w/ the laptop approach
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 08:24:51	@projectmonark Ooh, take your time with that. Don't want to lose anything precious.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 08:20:20	@miss_phoenix_ Damn is right. Sheesh.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 08:07:53	Just took over a half hour to run a simple query. The database is swamped right now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-02-02 07:54:36	@JenVictrola Nice one!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-30 02:28:17	#ff @alwaysunstable for illuminating blog posts
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 14:08:07	@miss_phoenix_ Oh that's unfortunate

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 12:18:13	@alwaysunstable Oh geez. I'm sorry, sister. I'm thinking of you. Please take it easy
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 12:03:49	@alwaysunstable Hrmph. Do you take any PRN AAPs in such a case?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 09:31:45	@TweetLilLatina Ohhh

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 07:51:05	Won't stop me from attempting them, though :D
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 07:50:46	That's ok. It wasn't very good.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 07:50:23	Nobody liked my CPU joke.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 07:50:06	@miss_phoenix_ Oh nooo. What's going on? Please vent if that'll help.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 07:40:30	@TweetLilLatina Where to!?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 07:38:33	@BiggieSmalley I had a racing snail. I thought removing its shell would make it faster but it only made it more sluggish.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 07:35:42	@BiggieSmalley Have you heard the one about the racing snail?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 07:35:30	@BiggieSmalley Let us entertain you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-29 07:31:33	Let's just say that "while" loops are not something to be played with lightly

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-28 13:45:17	@Ihatethisugh1 I might be mildly depressed.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 08:56:08	@BiggieSmalley Yeah for sure. I did it in vegetarian-friendly West Los Angeles. Near my new home there are far fewer veg restaurant options.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 08:46:40	@BiggieSmalley Not sure if you can do this or already have done this but I found that being vegetarian reduced my weight.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 08:26:02	@ShakiraSalvador Just over a year. Thank you so much!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 08:19:07	@MBeblowski Ooh, that sounds pretty bad. Get well soon, sister.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 08:18:14	@chris_mahan My desk is really messy. Must come w/ the territory.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 07:54:13	@MBeblowski Uf, sorry. Coughing is no fun.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 07:53:44	@cookiebetch420 I hope you get some good news soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 07:53:30	@cookiebetch420 So glad to hear the pain stopped -- at least momentarily.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 07:52:03	@chris_mahan Just yesterday I forgot zip_longest() from itertools.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 07:35:52	@bipolarvoice I hope so, too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 07:28:30	@chris_mahan I know where you'd go.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 07:23:53	@miss_phoenix_ ;-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 07:23:33	@miss_phoenix_ Grand Central station
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 07:23:05	@leah_michal Yay! I likely won't be leaving on time today :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 07:00:21	@leah_michal I'm right there with you, Lisa. Work is really busy. On the bright side time is flying by.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 06:19:25	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Aw. Sometimes you've gotta throw away a day. Hope tomorrow's better for you, sister!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 06:17:18	@SageSilk I know that feeling
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 06:16:43	@SageSilk Ah, I see. I would love it if you could get out of there. Poor Sagey.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 06:16:14	@SageSilk @BATKAT88 @PsychSynic_Liv @ItsTheWeeThings Aha! I didn't realise either o_O
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 06:13:19	@SageSilk I sometimes wonder this. Trust the aggregated judgement of those around you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 06:11:16	@Lyingsoothsayer Saved my butt on many an occasion
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 06:10:29	@PsychSynic_Liv @BATKAT88 Any chance you'd give your new username to those of us who'd like to keep in touch?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 05:11:59	@SimbaTalks I'm very sorry to hear this. Sending hugs and love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 03:48:27	@rabbitsoup_zola Thanks, I'm doing alright :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 03:43:34	@rabbitsoup_zola Very very glad to hear this!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 03:34:39	@schizoaffected What great news! I'm so happy for you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 03:29:35	@Anxiwarrior I'm doing alright. Thank you for asking :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 03:28:30	@SimbaTalks Good morning, Simba!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 03:03:41	@miss_phoenix_ Best of luck getting some of those sold!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 02:39:18	@miss_phoenix_ Oh, I see. Sorry to hear :-(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 02:34:41	@miss_phoenix_ Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. One trick I've heard is to put credit cards in a cup of water then put that in the freezer.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 02:19:05	@karendrawsstuff Aw, sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 02:16:42	@miss_phoenix_ Ah, I see. Glad to hear it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 02:14:47	@miss_phoenix_ Any hypomania?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 02:14:35	@miss_phoenix_ Wow!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 02:02:17	@leah_michal Oh geez. Very sorry to hear that's happening.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 02:01:48	@miss_phoenix_ Good morning!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 01:11:56	@eb462 I'm so sorry, Emily. Sending hugs and love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 01:07:26	@DrEm_79 So glad to hear you've had a good experience with your GP.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 01:01:10	@abdulkareem_sau Thank you so much!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 01:00:54	@ajane622 I know that feeling. Sending hugs.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:55:58	@JenVictrola Thank you so much!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:47:27	@alwaysunstable Ok sounds good
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:41:13	@alwaysunstable Curious to hear your thoughts on it when you've seen it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:39:16	I'm moving out of my apartment this Friday. Moving in with my gf. It's a big step. Wish me luck, friends.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:35:51	@pup_ear_nibbles Ah, good. Glad you have some on hand.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:32:05	@Lyingsoothsayer I'm so so so sorry you feel this way. Sending hugs and love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:31:37	@pup_ear_nibbles I would take a benzo if you have one
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:28:58	@karendrawsstuff Awww
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:21:05	@pup_ear_nibbles Hehe
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:20:51	@ecrjones Oh nooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:17:46	@pup_ear_nibbles Good point
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:14:39	@ecrjones Oh, I sometimes get that too. I'm on 400mg lamotrigine as well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:13:57	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. I hope things improve for you after the 1st.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:05:42	@LePetiteNYC Oh, I'm so sorry you're feeling that way. Sending hugs.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:02:36	@BlueBiochemist Ah, I see. Ok, ya, then I would cancel tomorrow's.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:02:04	@ecrjones Good to know because gf is on 300mg lamotrigine & 900mg lithium. I hope she goes to 400mg lamotrigine & comes down on the lithium.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-27 00:00:51	@BlueBiochemist Oh I see. Maybe try to get the appointment for Thursday first before you cancel.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 23:59:13	@BlueBiochemist Please remind me why you would cancel?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 23:55:27	@pup_ear_nibbles Yay!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 23:52:37	@ecrjones May I ask what your lithium dose is?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 23:51:27	@eb462 Not at all. FWIW I care about you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 23:12:58	Good morning, everyone!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 22:30:56	@zendao42 Oh I see. That's no good indeed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 22:30:20	@zendao42 @king_weird Thanks!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 14:15:28	@BiggieSmalley Sorry, man. I hope it goes better than expected.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 14:10:28	@Ihatethisugh1 Haha. How true!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 14:09:45	@schizoaffected Best of luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 14:09:13	@zendao42 What do you mean by hell breaking loose?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 12:25:00	@TweetLilLatina Uff, sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 12:02:09	@ArtPunkBeardGuy I wish you a speedy recovery.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 11:58:57	@miss_phoenix_ Yay indeed!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 11:57:03	@miss_phoenix_ A year!? Ouch.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 11:51:18	@ArtPunkBeardGuy Be strong, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 11:51:02	@miss_phoenix_ Awww. He'll survive :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 11:46:24	@leah_michal Only 4 days left
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 11:19:13	@miss_phoenix_ Sorry to hear that it's sapping your energy.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 11:04:56	@miss_phoenix_ Oh geez. You dodged a bullet.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 11:02:23	@miss_phoenix_ So glad to hear it's gone!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 10:50:10	@grendeldave Amazing for it to have stayed so intact...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 10:49:06	@grendeldave Oh wow. What a great find!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 10:48:39	@lizs_heart Thank you :-) I feel a bit better now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 10:23:40	@grendeldave Nice, dude!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 08:23:05	@miss_phoenix_ Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 08:21:24	@cookiebetch420 So sorry to hear about this. I hope things work out for the best.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 08:10:45	@Rivkah_g Thank you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 07:52:58	@Rivkah_g So glad you had a good day, and that you only have 1 week left. I'm doing alright. It's a busy day at work so time is flying by :D
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 07:48:55	@Rivkah_g How are you doing, Rivkah?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 07:48:38	@FacesOfDarkness Haha. Nice one.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 07:27:56	@miss_phoenix_ Glad it's not too serious.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 07:25:47	@miss_phoenix_ Hehe. Poor guy.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 07:11:40	@miss_phoenix_ Enjoy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 07:11:30	@miss_phoenix_ Hehe.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 07:06:05	@perp_perplexed I hope so, too. Hang in there. Twitter away.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 07:02:14	@perp_perplexed It will help. You'll have regular meals and get regular sleep -- or at least regular sleep time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 07:01:23	@BipolarLife21 Woohoo!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 06:20:28	@bpd_deathwish I'm very sorry it came to that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 06:09:41	@cookiebetch420 So sorry to hear this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 05:45:18	@BlueBiochemist Oh I'm so very sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 05:44:53	@Lyingsoothsayer Don't feel awful. That is what they're there for. I hope you're getting the help you need.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 05:39:42	@BlueBiochemist Oh I'm very sorry to hear this :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 05:27:37	@BlueBiochemist Oh I'm really sorry to hear this. How are you feeling now?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 05:10:42	@NikitaElizabeth Awww. Well, be sure to respect his viewpoint is all I would say :-) x
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 05:10:08	@abdulkareem_sau I know the feeling man. I'm bipolar as well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 04:58:47	@NikitaElizabeth Happy for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 04:58:14	@abdulkareem_sau I'm very sorry to hear this. Feel free to vent if you need to.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 04:54:47	How's everyone else doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 04:54:28	Feeling really anxious today.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 03:47:42	@_CongoRilla_ Great! Thank you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 03:17:36	@miss_phoenix_ Yay!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 03:13:28	@miss_phoenix_ I'm ok. So far it's been a busy Monday at work. Time is flying by.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 03:06:55	@miss_phoenix_ Good morning!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 03:06:46	@miss_phoenix_ Happy Australia Day!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 02:59:32	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Ugh. Sorry you're experiencing that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 02:41:51	@koalaalltheway Aww. I'm so sorry, Anna.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 01:59:44	@_CongoRilla_ Please consider changing handle back to Space Coyote...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 00:52:23	@sexually Good luck to him!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 00:52:06	@SageSilk So very sorry to hear this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 00:44:32	@RSenteza I vote for genius.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 00:44:13	@downingcs1 Sorry, Chris. I know that feeling all too well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 00:43:49	@ArtPunkBeardGuy Glad for you, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 00:10:50	@NikitaElizabeth No worries. I struggle with libido, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-26 00:00:43	@NikitaElizabeth You're welcome. It's an anti-depressant. I figure it can't hurt to have two anti-depressants. xx
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-25 23:57:55	@NikitaElizabeth Ask him about bupropion. Supposedly that induces weight loss. I'm on bupropion as well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-25 23:49:32	@NikitaElizabeth I'm on lamotrigine and paroxetine, too. No lithium, though. I feel hungry a lot of the time. At mealtimes I eat ravenously.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-25 23:14:47	@chris_mahan Good morning, Chris! I hope today's a great one for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-25 23:13:55	@NikitaElizabeth I'm so sorry. Have you spoken to your pdoc about it?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-25 13:17:58	@miss_phoenix_ I'm ok. I'm tired. Gonna go to sleep now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-25 13:03:03	@TweetLilLatina Gla it's over!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-25 13:02:34	@miss_phoenix_ Sorry. I've had a busy weekend. Hiw are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-25 12:16:56	A weekend full of packing later and my stuff is ready to be moved. Big thanks to my gf for doing so much work.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-25 11:45:47	@cookiebetch420 Oh no, I'm so sorry you were crying so much. I hope you get to watch some I Love Lucy
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-25 11:44:27	@BiggieSmalley Really sorry to hear this, man.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-24 07:43:16	@SageSilk Be strong, Sagey.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-24 07:29:45	@Rivkah_g Love you too. Ttyl
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-24 06:37:29	@BATKAT88 Oh, I'm sorry things were getting unhealthy. Glad you've begun anew. I'm ok, thank you for asking :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-24 06:35:15	@BlueBiochemist Oh noo. That's terrible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-24 06:23:31	@miss_phoenix_ Very sorry to hear this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-24 06:23:07	@BlueBiochemist Ugh, I know the feeling.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-24 05:51:28	@BlueBiochemist Sorry, NJ. I wish you could be better too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-23 15:18:08	@Lyingsoothsayer Hang in there. We love you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-23 15:16:26	@miss_phoenix_ Oh that's unfortunate. Good luck finishing up!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-23 15:15:44	@SageSilk Sagey, we love you. Hang on. You can beat this!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-23 15:11:25	@Lyingsoothsayer I'm so sorry
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-23 15:08:19	@Lyingsoothsayer How are you doing otherwise?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-23 15:06:57	@SimbaTalks Have a good day at work, sister!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-23 14:26:10	@ShakiraSalvador Cutie!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-21 03:50:53	@SageSilk Once you get out of that place you'll feel better.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-21 03:35:27	@SageSilk Please take your aripiprazole. We love you and want you around.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-21 03:11:56	@cookiebetch420 Ooh, what's on your plate right now?... If you feel like going into it, that is.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-18 09:38:53	@miss_phoenix_ Thanks for asking. Yeah I'm ok. I have to move some stuff out of my old apartment so that's eating up some time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-18 09:32:16	@miss_phoenix_ Aw, sorry that happened.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-18 09:27:56	@_HeyMisfit_ Sorry you're feeling sick. I'll be thinking of you and hoping for a speedy recovery.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-18 07:39:17	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh no I'm so sorry. That's terrible.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-18 03:00:13	@pup_ear_nibbles I believe Wellbutrin decreases appetite...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-17 09:41:41	@nyanlasers That's alright. Just don't let it happen again.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-13 02:40:56	@annedraya Glad you got your thoughts out! No need to apologise!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-13 02:33:48	@pup_ear_nibbles Wow. Are you on Rozerem by chance?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-13 01:38:41	@pup_ear_nibbles Yeah, I can see how it'd be tough to tell.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-13 01:32:07	@pup_ear_nibbles Good to know! :-) I haven't tried it yet. Does it give you a fog / hangover the next day?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-13 01:28:14	@pup_ear_nibbles So glad to hear this. I'm ok. I had a pdoc appointment yesterday and got Wellbutrin and Lunesta.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-13 01:22:03	@pup_ear_nibbles Good afternoon! I hope you have a good rest of the day
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-13 01:13:42	@ArtPunkBeardGuy Hey, APBG!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-13 00:40:25	@bipolarkimmie So sorry, Kimmie. Enjoy the pizza :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 13:25:28	@chercolvin Wow!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 09:08:51	@NicsVoice Sleep well, Erin.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 08:41:42	@projectmonark Thanks, man. Means a lot.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 08:41:25	@madtreeone No need to apologise :-) Glad you're doing ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 08:16:25	@debecca Good luck getting it back!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 07:32:28	@serpentgrr Thanks. Indeed it is.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 07:23:48	Got buproprion (Wellbutrin) and eszopiclone (Lunesta) instead.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 07:09:11	@chercolvin Hiya!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 07:08:45	@chercolvin Things went ok. Didn't get a stimulant.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 04:01:19	About to go for 40 minutes meditation. Wish me well, dear friends!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 03:16:51	@alwaysunstable hehehe :D
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 03:13:57	@alwaysunstable Go Meghan!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 03:13:36	@HCApeggy Sorry you're back there. I'm ok. Thank you for asking :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:48:13	@TweetLilLatina Enjoy your lunch!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:41:11	@DEPRESSI0NISTA @ArtPunkBeardGuy Lulz
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:40:52	@DEPRESSI0NISTA A constant struggle. Our lot in life. It never gets easier. We just get better.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:39:43	Bye, if you tweet the same quotes ad nauseum.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:37:50	They said there were Riches beyond imagination They sent word Through trusted friends, colleagues. Let justice win. Let the downtrodden win.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:29:23	"I know that I'll be happier. Eventually." https:// play.spotify.com/track/7xE0gpMK PKukOUqIx78wen …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:18:59	@eb462 I'm so so so sorry, Emily. Sending hugs and love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:15:19	Heavy breathing Like seething A sandwich An apple
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:09:46	@blogpolar w00t!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:09:27	Hushed tones Creaking bones Getting on in years Getting longer ears
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:08:06	@blogpolar Happy birthday! What will you do to celebrate?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 02:07:22	@700flights Ufff, sorry. Wishing you warmth as soon as possible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:59:17	@700flights Good morning! How are you this Monday morning?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:57:16	Was sick towards the end of last week. Glad to be feeling better these past couple of days.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:53:49	@SageSilk I love lorazepam. Already taken 2mg today and I just got to work a couple of hours ago.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:40:07	@PinkPalaceAngel Hopefully they call back
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:36:37	@bipolarkimmie Sorry, Kimmie. Wishing you peace and sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:35:57	@Doesnt_matter84 I'd do my best to ignore the unwashed masses here. If you can't express your opinions here I don't know where you can.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:32:09	@BipolarMe_net Thank you so much :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:30:56	Good lord.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:30:10	@serpentgrr That's terrible. I recommend entertaining the thought of micturating on their vehicle.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:29:03	@DailyBipolar Aww, thank you so much Meredith :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:28:26	Was recently reminded of a wonderful band called "Salt and Samovar". I highly recommend them.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:27:30	@nyanlasers The cat was a bonus :D
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:24:49	@Doesnt_matter84 I'm sorry that's happening, Judith. Sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:21:26	Really looking forward to pdoc appt today. Plan to ask for Strattera, Provigil, or Vivanse to help with concentration.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:20:37	@NicsVoice Good on ya. Enjoy the game.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:16:24	Feeling agitated and restless. Already taken 2mg lorazepam.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:15:58	@NicsVoice Aww, Erin. *hugs*
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:03:36	@nyanlasers Liked solely on the merits of "unwarranted disgruntlement"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:02:13	@NicsVoice Glad it went well. Sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 01:01:55	@PinkPalaceAngel I'm so sorry to hear this. Sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 00:44:15	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm so sorry, Z. I hope you're able to shut out that noise and go on about your day.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 00:37:07	@_griffithsh Good for you! I hope you have a good workout
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 00:17:56	@MrDanielDLondon Doing ok, thanks for asking. Just got in to work and looking forward to a busy day.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-12 00:16:33	@MrDanielDLondon Sorry, man. Sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 16:20:50	@miss_phoenix_ Ohhh. Yeah can't treat now
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 16:19:42	@miss_phoenix_ There's a vaccine they can give within 72 hours I think. Ask your doc
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 15:36:13	@miss_phoenix_ Haha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 15:34:53	@miss_phoenix_ Ouuuuchh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 15:09:00	@miss_phoenix_ Oh nooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 14:24:35	@ArtPunkBeardGuy Sleep well, man
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 13:31:35	@miss_phoenix_ Oh booo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 13:31:13	@miss_phoenix_ Sooo glad to hear this
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 11:48:37	@NicsVoice Sleep well, good bipolar
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 11:43:25	@BATKAT88 Hahaha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 11:07:24	@NicsVoice @BATKAT88 I can't read either due to concentration issues.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:54:12	@NicsVoice FWIW I have aripiprazole as a daily AAP at a dose of 30mg. I don't see how I could deal with bipolar without that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:48:48	@BATKAT88 Oh, that's rather profound.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:43:12	@BATKAT88 Did you have a favourite character in BB?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:37:58	@BATKAT88 My favourite is a feisty young girl named Arya.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:36:53	@miss_phoenix_ Oh I see. Can't cancel at this late stage I imagine
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:35:50	@BATKAT88 So far I like BB. It's rather intense so I space out the viewings.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:34:04	@miss_phoenix_ I hope you're able to make it a good session
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:28:22	@BATKAT88 GoT is good if you like fantasy. It's complex & I've in the past struggled to keep track of the characters but am getting better.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:23:01	@BATKAT88 Heeee
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:22:33	@BATKAT88 Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:20:32	@BATKAT88 I've been relaxing and watching TV shows
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:17:58	@BATKAT88 Gooo BatKat!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:16:15	@leah_michal I feel for you. Sending love
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:12:45	@grendeldave Sorry, Dave. I hope you're able to focus soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:07:36	@chercolvin Best of luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 10:07:15	@Tamalehawk Oh, be very proud of this one
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 08:05:23	@TweetLilLatina Awesome!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 08:00:46	@NicsVoice It's an unavoidable consequence, it seems, of the AAPs upon which we depend
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 07:59:13	@serpentgrr Sleep well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 07:49:41	@serpentgrr Win!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 07:47:41	@projectmonark I say buy it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 07:46:37	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Love it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 07:45:21	@NicsVoice It's worrisome to loved ones.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 07:44:03	@ArtPunkBeardGuy Hey, man. I'm glad you can drink. It's such a fun release. I can't because of medications I take.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 07:34:10	@NicsVoice Me too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 07:32:41	@projectmonark If you use Linux there's a free Photoshop-like program called Gimp
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 07:30:41	@projectmonark Do you use Instagram?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 07:18:54	@NicsVoice Ah I see. What tends to happen?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:53:50	@ShakiraSalvador Thank you so much
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:52:48	@miss_phoenix_ So sorry you're in pain.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:28:51	@NicsVoice I wish I could get drunk, too. Alas, meds
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:28:15	@alwaysunstable Making me hungryyy
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:27:05	@NicsVoice I hate that feeling
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:25:21	According to my latest progress on @duolingo I'm 20% fluent in Spanish
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:17:57	@miss_phoenix_ I've had a nose correction done. It opened my left nostril
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:15:28	@miss_phoenix_ Have you been tested for sleep apnea?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:14:29	@leah_michal Oh, now I see what you meant by "important"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:10:37	@NikitaElizabeth Thank you for sharing your experience
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:09:57	@leah_michal I feel the same way.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 06:02:46	@leah_michal Thanks for sharing your experience.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 05:53:13	So I've turned to you, Twitter.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 05:52:30	I stopped posting to Facebook because my family told me I was sharing too much personal information.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 05:47:35	@miss_phoenix_ So glad to hear this!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 05:30:06	@grendeldave Ha. Geez, sorry that's happening.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 05:16:22	@BlueBiochemist So sorry, NJ.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 05:08:31	@DrEm_79 Either way: have a good run!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 04:50:56	Started watching "Breaking Bad". It's awfully gruesome
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 04:41:50	I see it as spending time with friends
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 04:41:12	Gf says she hates that I spend so much time on Twitter
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 04:38:48	@chris_mahan Morning, Chris!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 04:36:50	@PsychSynic_Liv I'm so so so sorry you can't
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 04:36:16	@BipolarSanity Me, too, man
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-11 02:45:00	@leah_michal Glad you went, too
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 23:09:17	@pup_ear_nibbles How's life treating you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 13:42:01	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Good to know, thanks :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 13:39:16	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Ya
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 13:22:15	I'm about to watch "Breaking Bad"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 13:21:25	@leah_michal Sorry, Lisa. We're here for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 13:11:41	@miss_phoenix_ So glad your brain is ok. But then your tweets showed that anyway :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 12:24:13	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Let the tears fall. We're here for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 12:22:10	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Haha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 12:21:23	@alwaysunstable Yikes
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 12:20:44	@Thee_noise Great job!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 12:18:45	Thinking about watching "Southpaw". Has anyone seen it?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 12:16:54	@BipolarSanity I love cider!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 12:02:01	@thetaintedclock Oops :D
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 11:58:45	@NicsVoice Sleep well, Erin
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 11:48:16	Gf is sleeping off a migraine so I'm here all night.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 11:46:40	@DEPRESSI0NISTA *hugs*
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 11:45:55	@ArtPunkBeardGuy Sleep well, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 11:42:30	@DEPRESSI0NISTA That's upsetting to hear
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 11:24:25	@miss_phoenix_ I'm sorry she's harassing
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 11:17:40	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Oh, I'm so sorry sister. Here to listen if you feel like venting.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 10:55:57	@NicsVoice Oh, sorry Erin. Will you take some q?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 10:53:47	@leah_michal You're stronger than most, Lisa
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 06:39:40	@chris_mahan Getting away from me, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 06:22:33	@NicsVoice I hate this, too
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 06:21:31	@ajane622 Good for you for speaking up
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 06:14:49	@HeadStable Way to go, Finchy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 06:14:02	@cookiebetch420 *hugs* I hope so, too
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 06:12:15	@jenmarley3 *hugs*
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-10 06:11:11	@chris_mahan Good point, man
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 19:06:39	@NicsVoice I get ignored a lot by one person. Feels shitty.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 19:04:48	@BATKAT88 I'm having a bit of an emotional evening. Tomorrow will be better. Thanks very much for asking
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:59:16	@BATKAT88 I was doing rather abysmally until you showed up. Thanks for lifting my spirits
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:55:29	@BATKAT88 Miss Batkat has an horrific and life-destroying mental illness
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:50:11	@BATKAT88 Well it can be horrific and life-destroying
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:48:26	@rabbitsoup_zola You got this, Bunny!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:45:22	@NicsVoice Best of luck, Erin
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:44:42	@BATKAT88 Oh it shocked me too. Here it's called SPMI: severe persistent mental illness.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:42:58	@BATKAT88 Is your electric bill overdue again? ;-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:41:30	@MrDanielDLondon Glad that worked out for you so nicely!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:39:54	Suggestions welcome.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:39:11	I need to follow more Europeans. My TL is thin.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:36:18	@NikitaElizabeth Hahaha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:27:01	@Ihatethisugh1 Oh I see... a night owl.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:25:59	Feeling so distant from my gf
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:24:46	@Ihatethisugh1 What's keeping you up my friend?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:22:04	When it's 2:22 in the morning and you're far from sleeping
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:13:40	@schizoaffected I agree
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:12:17	Gf is taking an IQ test
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:05:47	@miss_phoenix_ I wish you only the best
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 18:01:03	@NikitaElizabeth Oh wow. That is scary.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 17:57:07	@bipolarkimmie Hey Kimmie!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 16:17:19	@miss_phoenix_ Thanks. I feel ok. I'll feel better tomorrow.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 16:08:51	@miss_phoenix_ That's so terrible. Good luck with the restraining order
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:54:10	@miss_phoenix_ @DEPRESSI0NISTA Awww how cute
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:46:02	@miss_phoenix_ Sounds like paradise
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:42:31	@chris_mahan I wouldn't like it either
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:41:29	@miss_phoenix_ Sounds lovely
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:36:38	@chris_mahan With an @like that...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:35:01	@DEPRESSI0NISTA The sentiment is greatly appreciated
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:34:04	@miss_phoenix_ Alright that sounds fun
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:33:07	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Aw, thank you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:32:16	@chris_mahan Good riddance!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:30:12	@miss_phoenix_ Sure please do.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:27:53	Normally I should be happy on a Friday night.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 13:25:47	@chris_mahan Who in their right mind would've blocked you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 11:44:13	@chris_mahan Alas Teradata -- main db I use -- does not support the APPLY operator.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 11:36:24	@chris_mahan And I continue to tweak a query on which I've spent a couple of hours... :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 11:34:21	@leah_michal Thank you. It is.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 11:33:21	@chris_mahan We stride on in solidarity!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 11:32:56	@leah_michal I'm processing some feelings which is easier done alone.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 11:26:26	It's nearing 7:30pm. I should've left work 3 hours ago. I can't bring myself to do that, though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 09:36:36	Gf says I snored really loudly last night.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 09:13:45	@cookiebetch420 Thank you. Someone gave her a lozenge. Things have calmed down a bit since then.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 08:34:36	Feeling very annoyed. Co-worker is coughing so much. Nearly closing time. Want to get something finished, though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 08:31:43	@sexually Good for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 08:22:58	@chris_mahan As part of what you love about Twitter I encourage you to stay.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 08:21:55	@bipolarvoice So glad to hear this!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 08:00:18	@miss_phoenix_ I certainly hope so!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 07:36:21	#ff @wildcatrufus He's out there somewhere.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 07:31:30	@chercolvin Hiya! I'm ok. Taken 3mg lorazepam and had 2 pots of coffee. Life is good.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 07:29:26	@chercolvin Hey there Cher Bear!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 07:04:32	@schizoaffected I hope he listens, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 06:54:48	@BATKAT88 Sorry it feels weird. We love you BatKat!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 06:53:14	@BATKAT88 That makes no sense.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 06:52:39	@ArtPunkBeardGuy Enjoy the dinner, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 06:20:43	@projectmonark Thanks, man. I'll do my best to keep it under control.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 05:28:05	Brewed my second pot of coffee on the day. This should go nicely with the lorazepam.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 05:27:19	Co-worker is coughing once a minute or more frequently. Rather #disruptive
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 05:26:49	@livinginstigma Happy Friday to you, too
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 05:24:43	Happy to see good people of the Twitter getting to know each other this #ff
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 05:12:08	@miss_phoenix_ It's 1:11pm on Friday. I live in sunny Southern California.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 05:02:28	@NikitaElizabeth I'm so sorry, sister. I'm ok with all of the lorazepam.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 05:01:12	@NicsVoice Thanks :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 04:57:49	@miss_phoenix_ Works for me x
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 04:55:45	@NicsVoice I've taken one about every 2 hours since arriving at work. I'm hoping more will help.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 04:48:38	@Lyingsoothsayer We're rule-breakers
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 04:47:12	@Lyingsoothsayer An hour or two ago
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 04:42:24	@miss_phoenix_ Thank you! A third one it is then!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 04:41:46	@miss_phoenix_ I like my benzos. I like them with coffee. I wish I had clonazepam.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 04:40:38	@miss_phoenix_ Nice! Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 04:40:16	Do I go for a third milligram of lorazepam?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 04:39:43	Have taken 2mg lorazepam. Still feeling weird and under the weather.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 04:39:22	@eb462 I'm so sorry, Emily. We love you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-09 04:00:24	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh I'm so sorry pristiq has been so bad for you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-08 13:31:23	@SageSilk I feel good about it. It explains a lot. It's preferable to know why I am the way I am. How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-08 13:25:19	@SageSilk I'm ok. A little under the weather. Found out I don't have sleep apnea. Found out I have Asperger Syndrome.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-08 07:27:09	Since I couldn't sleep this morning I got into work before 6am. I think it's time to go home now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-08 06:53:23	@chris_mahan Yes, it's important to realize that the relationship is going fairly well overall.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-08 06:52:35	@chris_mahan Hahaha... Excellent!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-08 05:04:33	@DEPRESSI0NISTA That he is. Please don't waste one more second of your valuable time on his bs.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 14:52:29	@king_weird We gravitate to Twitter it seems :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 14:14:16	Excited about knowing I have Asperger Syndrome because now I know why I have such poor social skills
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 14:10:27	@projectmonark Same here :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 14:09:15	@miss_phoenix_ @EJ_Design I do now!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 14:04:46	@projectmonark What makes you say that?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 13:52:32	@projectmonark I feel you, man
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 13:50:28	@miss_phoenix_ Not spam to me. Happy to see your art.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 13:49:30	@LePetiteNYC Bye for now
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 13:25:02	@projectmonark I hope not
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 13:17:47	@miss_phoenix_ Great company to be in!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 13:13:54	@miss_phoenix_ Thank you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 10:33:00	@NicsVoice Yay!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 10:29:27	@grendeldave w00t!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 10:26:24	@NicsVoice Very kind of you to put his needs ahead of your own.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 10:20:01	@NicsVoice Good luck with him
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 10:19:10	@NicsVoice Oh I see. So you might be drifting off to sleep soon... If so, sleep well
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 10:14:51	@NicsVoice Thanks, I think so too xx
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 10:13:56	@NicsVoice Do you know why that is?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 10:12:57	@NicsVoice Not belittling at all. Thank you for your thoughts
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 10:12:17	@NicsVoice Ya, she is saying I have Asperger's/ASD. I will get tested to be sure.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 10:11:25	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Ya I think I wasn't able to articulate myself well and now knowing more she revised her opinion.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 10:08:26	@NicsVoice I think she was trying to put it nicely
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 09:52:35	Now my therapist says I "have a touch of Asperger's"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 08:14:42	@cookiebetch420 I hope you're able to push aside your anxiety and really relax this evening.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 08:01:32	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Oh nooo. So sorry you were crying so much. That's terrible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 07:30:40	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Aha! Gotcha.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 07:22:35	@alwaysunstable Were you put on lamotrigine instead? Or?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 07:21:59	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Please explain
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 07:21:45	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Oh no I didn't get the reference. I liked because you said "collar up" :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 06:58:22	@miss_phoenix_ Oh I'm so sorry. That sounds just terrible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 06:55:44	@miss_phoenix_ Oh, conversion disorder sounds like a bad one. I hope you don't have it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 06:51:53	@chris_mahan Sorry, man. I empathize with you. Get yourself some food.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 06:47:12	@bipolarvoice I'm so sorry to hear this. I hope you will be able to engage some of your healthy coping skills to gain back some confidence.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 06:45:15	@miss_phoenix_ I'm alright. Just had a good therapy session. I'm sorry your body is hurting...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 05:14:25	@miss_phoenix_ How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 05:08:40	@zendao42 Sleep well when you do...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 05:07:41	@pup_ear_nibbles Ah I see. I hope it works well for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 05:07:17	@pup_ear_nibbles Sorry you're nervous...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 05:06:21	@pup_ear_nibbles What are they giving you the pristiq for?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 05:03:40	@pup_ear_nibbles How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 04:08:29	@NikitaElizabeth That's a good attitude to have about it :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 04:01:45	@NikitaElizabeth I'm glad you're well apart from the usual issues. I'm doing alright. Have been productive so I'm really happy about that.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 03:39:09	Got a lot of shit done this morning. Really happy about that!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 03:04:56	Hope everyone's well this rainy Wednesday.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 01:23:03	@run4yourMind How fortunate you were to have her. I hope you're able to get another one with a similar attitude.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 01:03:52	@themanicmedic Heheh. I see.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-07 00:56:25	@themanicmedic Aw, Joe. I hope you go. I hope you make it a great session.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-06 01:45:04	@LePetiteNYC I agree with you on this. I wouldn't trust myself with a gun during an episode.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-06 01:24:34	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm so sorry, Bunny. We love you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-06 01:16:01	@cookiebetch420 Thanks, sis!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-06 00:36:53	@eb462 Do you like how it turned out?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-06 00:34:03	@schizoaffectiv5 So happy for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-06 00:11:57	@king_weird I'm glad you're around, too, my friend.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 23:52:26	@king_weird I missed it, sorry. Or I saw it and forgot. My memory sucks these days.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 23:45:15	@700flights Haha, of course not you. I love your posts.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 23:44:16	@king_weird Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 13:56:05	@700flights Haha.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 08:27:19	@BiggieSmalley You can do it. I have faith in you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:42:31	@Rivkah_g I wish you the best of luck overcoming this
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:41:39	@Rivkah_g Yeah that's so wrong
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:39:59	@Rivkah_g I'm so sorry that happened
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:39:36	@Rivkah_g That's terrible
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:39:24	@Rivkah_g Oh nooo

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:36:12	@NikitaElizabeth Thank you so much :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:35:53	@schizoaffected That's terrible. How long will you be keeping that up? Do you know?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:35:10	@leah_michal Thank you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:33:29	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Hahaha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:32:58	@leah_michal I'm going to go meditate in a bit. That should help things. Thanks for your concern.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:32:31	@leah_michal Yeah
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:31:12	@leah_michal Thank you for asking, Lisa. It's because of work.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:30:53	@schizoaffected Oh my.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:29:52	@NikitaElizabeth Because of work.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:23:19	Feeling annoyed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:22:57	@schizoaffected I'm feeling the same way.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:18:48	@NikitaElizabeth Ok let me know how it goes xx
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:18:36	@NikitaElizabeth Thanks xx
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:18:01	@NikitaElizabeth I plan to ask my pdoc about this the next time
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:17:40	@NikitaElizabeth I'm having the same issue with my legs. I'm also on aripiprazole. I think that this must be what we're feeling.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:15:26	@NikitaElizabeth Aripiprazole can cause akathasia
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 03:14:47	@schizoaffected Best of luck. I'll be thinking of you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 02:52:17	@Rivkah_g Where to?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 02:29:45	@drivelhe4d Haha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 02:29:07	After coffee, green tea with lemon tastes great
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 02:18:19	@SchizoInsight Anger can be a toxic emotion
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 02:17:12	@SchizoInsight I'm so sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-05 02:15:02	@glittahcat Glad you survived!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 04:43:30	@glittahcat A winning combination. I don't yet know what we're doing. Gf will likely have some ideas.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 04:42:59	@pup_ear_nibbles How is your day going?/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 04:41:17	What are YOU doing for NYE?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 04:39:12	@BlueBiochemist Good for you for taking care of your mental health and cutting her out of your life.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 04:36:58	@leah_michal Oh nooo. I hope it stays that way and doesn't progress to mania.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 04:36:19	@leah_michal Hey, wanted to let you know that Dilemma is now at @phoenixdilemma. She deleted her old account.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 04:35:32	@BlueBiochemist So sorry to hear this
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 04:34:05	@phoenixdilemma I sure will.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 04:28:59	@phoenixdilemma It's 12:30pm on 12/31. I'm looking forward to 2016 as well :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 04:13:19	@phoenixdilemma My ex-wife made it hard, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 03:59:55	@EJ_Design @phoenixdilemma Oh I see. I'm sorry the negotiations didn't go well :-(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 03:59:22	@TweetLilLatina I'll be thinking of you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 03:54:52	@EJ_Design @phoenixdilemma Btw, how are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 03:54:16	@EJ_Design @phoenixdilemma Oh! Followed...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 03:53:06	@BlueBiochemist Ok, I see. Well if you want to talk more about it here I'm willing to listen.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 03:41:22	@BlueBiochemist Best of luck if you do. I'll be thinking of you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 03:30:46	@martyn666arts Enjoy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 03:29:37	@martyn666arts Oh, so do I. I've been invited to a NYE gathering and likely won't go due to social anxiety.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 03:26:04	@martyn666arts Do you have something you can take for the nerves?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 03:22:55	@martyn666arts Sorry, I meant what are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 03:16:10	@martyn666arts What's on tap?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 02:58:15	@BlueBiochemist I hope 2016 is great for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 02:48:04	@leah_michal Me, too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 02:47:07	@leah_michal Maybe it's just the coffee? And/or the fact that it's NYE?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 02:28:47	Moar coffee.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 02:13:51	@BATKAT88 Thank you so much :-) What do you have planned?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 01:58:11	@BATKAT88 Not sure yet! Love the word Hogmanay, by the way :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 01:43:43	@BATKAT88 @annedraya Haha! Love the new avatar, BatKat.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 01:23:27	@leah_michal How's your day?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 01:22:50	@leah_michal I'm quite drowsy. On the plus side I saw a woman with really pretty eyes in the break room.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2016-01-01 01:18:44	Good morning, dear friends

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 07:31:56	@loarnagreen @chris_mahan Not in the least.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 07:31:21	@Ihatethisugh1 Hey, man. Thank you for asking. I'm doing alright. The mix of lorazepam and coffee seems to be doing me good.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 07:30:36	@chris_mahan Wow. I'm not quite there yet.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 07:29:59	@chris_mahan Thanks, man. I really appreciate your kind words.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 07:03:32	@_AngelKate_ Oh nooo. I'm so sorry.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 06:58:19	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Good on ya!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 06:30:46	Girlfriend says, "Then what's wrong with u"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 06:30:13	Therapist says I don't have HFA nor Asperger's.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 04:50:16	@serpentgrr Know how you feel. These days I'm "running" 10:00-minute miles.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 04:49:35	@learningtofloat I'm on cup #4 of coffee. Switching to tea would be a welcome change.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 04:47:30	@learningtofloat I'll take Earl Grey, please.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 04:40:25	@THCrinstam That works!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 04:37:25	@learningtofloat Aw. Should eat. It'll make getting up and going tomorrow easier.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 04:34:02	@learningtofloat Good luck making that step!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 04:24:58	@learningtofloat Still at work. Still drinking coffee. Lorazepam #2 on deck. How's your evening going?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 04:09:20	@leah_michal That's a lot already. I say you take the rest of the day off.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 04:08:16	@leah_michal Productive day!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 04:05:47	@learningtofloat Ty 4 asking. I'm ok just a bit restless from coffee and work. Taken 1mg lorazepam. Might take more. Christmas was alright.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 04:04:10	@NicsVoice Oh booo. Hoping you feel better soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 03:53:26	@annedraya Good on ya for doing that!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 03:48:01	@learningtofloat Ah I see. Thanks for the knowledge.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 03:47:09	@TheBernardBert Ooh, watch out for chocolate poisoning http://www. petmd.com/cat/conditions /digestive/c_ct_chocolate_toxicity …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 03:39:44	@learningtofloat Just curious: Have they ever recommended dietary changes for the eczema?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 03:39:00	@DEPRESSI0NISTA This is great news! And I'm glad she didn't release the pain on you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 03:31:25	@learningtofloat I hope those meds work well for you

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 01:50:20	@Ihatethisugh1 Hey, man. Thank you for asking. The usual work bs is making me antsy.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 01:34:03	Took 1mg lorazepam and still feel restless.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 01:32:49	@Lyingsoothsayer Nicely captured!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 01:27:57	@NicsVoice :-| indeed. Hehe.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 01:16:10	@NikitaElizabeth Well, hang in there. My thoughts are with you. I care about you and want the best for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 00:53:45	@cookiebetch420 My dad was in the army near there. They said, "If you can see Rainier pack a raincoat. If you can't, wear your raincoat."
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 00:48:25	@cookiebetch420 Lovely. Thank you for sharing the photo.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 00:45:14	@cookiebetch420 Is that Rainier?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 00:41:49	@NikitaElizabeth How long until your next pdoc appointment? Can you call them to see if a med change can be made?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 00:39:12	@NikitaElizabeth I'm so sorry. What can we do to help?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 00:30:06	@alwaysunstable I hope it works well for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 00:28:51	Thankfully it was caught.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 00:28:20	Blip. Bop. Beep. Made a minor mistake.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-31 00:27:54	@SociallyAwks05 So sorry, Simba. I hope things turn around for you soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 23:56:34	@leah_michal So sorry to hear this.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 07:20:39	@eb462 I'm so so so sorry, Emily.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 07:05:11	@DEPRESSI0NISTA I wonder how many people are exclusively mobile users. I'm definitely much more verbose on the web client.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:53:17	@DEPRESSI0NISTA I know, right!?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:49:48	@rabbitsoup_zola Oh nooo. I'm so sorry, Zola.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:42:13	@leah_michal Makes me want to have another episode to show her.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:41:44	Would you unfollow me if you learned I don't floss regularly? If you answered "yes" what is the likelihood that you work in dentistry?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:37:47	@deseraestage So sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:34:52	@LePetiteNYC Woohoo! Happy for u!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:24:44	@mechanical_meat My thanks to @drivelhe4d for the enrichment
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:24:21	First encounter for this Yank with the use of "moist" meaning "soft", "sentimental".
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:22:31	@drivelhe4d Sorry for your loss (of your mind)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:22:09	@drivelhe4d Paramount use of "moist"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:21:25	@mechanical_meat Thanks for voting in my poll! I really appreciate the feedback.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:09:45	The output of one of my programs was questioned. Yesterday it was found to be correct. I wanted to celebrate so much
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 06:00:06	I drink about 4 cups of coffee a day. Is that too much?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 05:43:24	@cookiebetch420 Yum!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 05:42:49	@leah_michal Roughly what percentage of your clients (internal or external) speak Navajo?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 05:41:33	My sister once said that everyone is #bipolar . I felt so minimized.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 05:40:41	@cookiebetch420 Enjoy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 05:21:15	@DynamicDilemma My thoughts are with you. I believe you can do it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 05:19:24	@DynamicDilemma So sorry to hear this. I hope things look up soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 05:16:58	@DynamicDilemma Great looking pup!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 05:06:39	@annedraya So so so sorry to hear this, Andrea. I hope things improve for you soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 04:58:53	@dmwise I'm so so so sorry, Dave. I wish you comfort and peace during your grieving process.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 04:22:08	@BlueBiochemist I'm so sorry. I hope you're able to push them out of your mind.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 03:45:40	@chercolvin Good for you! I'm ok so far. Thank you for asking :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 03:44:05	@chercolvin How is your day going?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 03:40:23	@leah_michal @pup_ear_nibbles Hehe @"I guess"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 03:26:51	@_AngelKate_ So happy for you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 02:58:32	@_AngelKate_ Such great news!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 02:54:58	@_AngelKate_ Yes!!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 02:41:42	A nice tune featuring the lyric: "Where have you gone sweet innocence": https:// play.spotify.com/track/7gN9wYl4 0ZhWVoAZHjAgcj …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 02:33:58	@PTjessD I know, right!? I left but she's the one who actually filed the paperwork.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 02:29:51	@PTjessD Haha. How odd! So glad you got him the help he needed though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 02:28:09	@PTjessD Thankfully no.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 02:17:33	@PTjessD They want to be friends.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 00:58:44	@JenVictrola I feel you. That's never a good feeling. I hope you will stick around though -- for those who care about you, including me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 00:38:34	@JenVictrola I'm so sorry you're feeling this way.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-30 00:14:40	@SchizoInsight Haha. Enjoy! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 23:57:33	Good morning everyone!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 23:56:11	@PTjessD Good point
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 23:08:57	@king_weird Doing well! It's been awhile... good to hear from you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 15:27:53	@imillnotcrazy Is there anything you can take? Or someone you can call?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 15:26:45	@imillnotcrazy I'm so sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 15:24:59	@imillnotcrazy Oh nooo. What's the matter?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 15:08:06	I hope everyone has a good night.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 15:05:07	@projectmonark I'm glad you unprotected your account!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 13:39:13	@chercolvin Thank you, sister!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 13:19:14	Jogged 4 miles and I feel heaps better than before jogging.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 13:18:10	@DynamicDilemma I'm so sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 13:03:06	@pup_ear_nibbles How's life treating you, sister?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 12:50:41	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Me too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 12:46:47	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Never.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 12:45:46	@DynamicDilemma I so hope this isn't the case. I so hope you get some respite.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 12:43:04	@DynamicDilemma Oh no. I'm very sorry to hear that
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 12:40:22	Was just reminded of @wildcatrufus. Hope he's doing ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 12:34:43	@eb462 I hope you're ok
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 12:28:43	@emily_the_gray Miss him too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 12:27:45	@emily_the_gray Oh good. I'm doing alright. Lying in bed watching "The Affair". Thank you for asking :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 12:24:38	@emily_the_gray Hope you get some rest soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 12:21:28	@chris_mahan Ouch!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 10:43:55	@leah_michal Yay! So happy to hear this
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 08:31:00	@projectmonark For sure
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 08:22:36	Yesterday gf said to me, "You're having an emotional weekend." #bipolar
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 08:16:27	@DynamicDilemma Sweet!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 08:04:34	@DynamicDilemma My day hasn't been too bad considering it's my first day back at work after several days off. Good to hear from you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 07:48:02	@projectmonark Onwards and upwards, my friend.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 07:22:39	@deseraestage Ow, sorry that happened. We, on the other hand, love you and very much acknowledge your existence.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 07:19:09	@RudyCaseres Wow! That's great news!! I hope your cocktail gets straightened out soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 07:13:36	@RudyCaseres How are you doing, my friend?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 07:06:50	@THCrinstam Uff, sorry man. I hope you're able to find a good one soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 07:03:53	@pup_ear_nibbles Lots of love to you, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 07:03:39	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh nooo.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 07:00:22	Brought a coffee-making machine in to work. Nice to have coffee whenever I want it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 06:48:27	@Lyingsoothsayer I wish I could help in that way. I hope you're able to hang on.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 06:39:24	@Lyingsoothsayer I'm so sorry. How can we help?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 05:54:59	@cookiebetch420 I'm self-unaware. My girlfriend & I are exploring if I'm high-functioning autistic which could explain why I lack insight.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 05:32:47	@SageSilk Oh nooo, Sagey. I'm so sorry. I think of you often and my heart is with you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 05:32:04	@schizoaffected I'm #thankful to have you here.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 05:28:16	Girlfriend wonders if I may have sleep apnea.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 05:26:16	@serpentgrr Glad you're doing the right thing even though it's difficult.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 05:22:29	Scheduled my sleep study.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 05:01:46	@_CongoRilla_ Very sorry to hear this. I hope that you can console your co-worker somehow.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 04:57:55	@SchizoInsight I wish I had clonazepam. I will try to get some the next time I see my pdoc.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 04:55:20	@SchizoInsight clonazepam :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 04:54:09	@SchizoInsight What do you take? (My chill pill is lorazepam.)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 04:53:45	Feeling better today. Thanks everyone for the support these past couple days.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 04:52:38	@SchizoInsight Good on you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 04:51:25	@SchizoInsight I'm sorry to hear this. I hope things get better for you soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 03:40:34	@DarklandPoetry A very good question. I'm interested to see the answer.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 03:37:11	@nyanlasers Here we see the feline caught mid-sidestroke in a sea of makeshift bedding.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 03:26:45	@TweetLilLatina Thank you so much, sister. I really appreciate your thoughts.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 03:24:00	@MrDanielDLondon Hi, and welcome back!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 03:21:21	@cookiebetch420 Oh I'm so sorry. And I'm sorry to have assumed incorrectly.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 02:55:42	@BekaLombardo I hope you'll feel better soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 02:48:27	@serpentgrr Good for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 02:40:21	@DEPRESSI0NISTA You've got this!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 02:38:46	@cookiebetch420 I'm glad you've done so, and I imagine you're happier and healthier for it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 02:30:45	@PsychSynic_Liv I hope it's a good one. As good as it can be on the ward.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 02:13:07	@schizoaffected Aw, how sweet. I'm glad to have met you, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 02:09:03	@SociallyAwks05 You're not horrid. You're one of the most real, honest, lovely people on my feed. I hope you feel better soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 02:05:56	@schizoaffected Good luck! You got this!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 01:17:06	@NicsVoice Oh nooo. I'm so sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 01:16:48	@serpentgrr That's great advice. Thank you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 01:13:55	@NicsVoice I agree. I just had a very emotional weekend. Would've rather not.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 00:58:51	@NicsVoice Hang in there, Erin. My thoughts are with you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 00:32:04	@cookiebetch420 I'm at work too. It's dead here.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-29 00:26:06	@serpentgrr Thank you so much for your thoughts on this. They are contacting me via email. I will send them email asking not to be contacted
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-28 22:43:18	@Lababup I'm sorry to hear that. I'm alright.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-28 15:59:31	Thanks again, dear Twitter family. I feel the love
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-28 15:42:13	@DynamicDilemma I do. I also took 1mg lorazepam.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-28 15:37:20	@DynamicDilemma For sure.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-28 15:36:21	@DynamicDilemma Ouch. So sorry

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-28 15:12:43	Wish they would leave me alone.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-28 15:11:07	Reduced to tears thinking of how ex-wife fucked me. She and her family still try to keep in touch.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-28 14:14:37	@ArtPunkBeardGuy I hope you feel better soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-28 13:49:21	@ArtPunkBeardGuy Sometimes Twitter has glitches. I wouldn't take it too personally.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-28 09:12:47	@leah_michal Doing alright. Had a good holiday. Thank you so much for asking.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-27 15:20:13	@tgspecial Oh, I thought you felt like you wanted someone to kill you...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-27 14:01:24	@tgspecial I'm sorry you're feeling this way :-( I hope things turn around for you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-12 03:48:00	@DynamicDilemma It's a terrible thing to have happened. Compensation seems only fair.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-12 03:41:33	@DynamicDilemma That sounds reasonable

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-11 05:55:35	@leah_michal I've been afraid of police for as long as I can recall
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-11 03:55:01	@DynamicDilemma Ugh.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-06 16:24:47	@DynamicDilemma Oh nooo. I'm so sorry to hear this
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-06 10:39:04	@leah_michal I'm sorry, Lisa.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-06 08:05:54	@lovelyoncethin Oh nooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-06 07:58:15	@DynamicDilemma Have a good, relaxing day!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-06 07:39:05	@deseraestage I'm so sorry, D.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 15:41:21	@BipolarSanity I'm so sorry, Gus. I hope things turn around for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 08:36:41	@unsuicide I'll go for walks, too. Maybe a jog or two.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 06:44:37	@PsychSynic_Liv I wish the best for you and my thoughts will be with you. I've been on a hold myself and know the feeling.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 05:45:29	@DynamicDilemma As would be the case with me :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 05:45:06	@schizoaffected And you're a big part of it being so supportive.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 05:42:41	@DynamicDilemma So happy for you!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 05:23:42	I've typed a hyphen where there should have been an underscore.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 05:21:25	Lorazepam number two taken.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 05:04:31	Now I'm on piece number three of nicotine gum and the feeling of calmness is getting mixed with a little bit of hyperactivity.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 05:02:38	@leah_michal Yay! So glad to hear it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 05:01:26	@leah_michal How are you today? Still a bit hypo?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 04:48:21	@BATKAT88 Maybe I'm searching for that again. Being on meds for bipolar takes some of the fun out of life.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 04:45:39	@BATKAT88 I wish I had some strong painkillers. For recreational purposes.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 04:40:46	@BATKAT88 Now I've added nicotine gum to the mix. My brain is awash in a glorious mix of chemicals.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 04:16:05	@DynamicDilemma Have you heard of their deleterious effects on memory?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 04:11:01	@Lababup Oh I'm so sorry. I'm doing ok. Will go on a search for more coffee in a minute.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 04:10:21	@BATKAT88 I definitely do enjoy the combination of lorazepam and coffee.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 04:09:43	@DynamicDilemma Aw. Sorry you don't have benzos
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 03:46:14	Have taken one (1) lorazepam. Enjoying the feeling of calmness.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 03:45:25	@NikitaElizabeth Oh no. If you care to elaborate on what happened I'm here to listen. I'm doing ok. Thank you for asking.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 03:39:22	@NikitaElizabeth I'm so sorry you feel this way, N.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 03:32:56	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh, I'm sorry your sleep has been disrupted. I'm ok. Thank you for asking.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 03:19:39	@drinksinthedark Thank you so much. Your words mean a lot.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 03:06:30	@BATKAT88 I'm sorry you're agitated. I've loaded up on coffee so I'm jittery. Might take a lorazepam.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 02:54:22	@BATKAT88 How are you today?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 02:50:42	@SociallyAwks05 I'm sorry, S.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 02:50:13	@PsychSynic_Liv I'm so sorry, O. How are you doing otherwise?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 02:19:50	@Lababup How are you doing today?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 01:40:36	@king_weird Sorry, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 01:36:48	@chris_mahan I'm still lamenting the loss of Google Code Search.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 01:28:39	@jane_benians Excellent!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-05 01:14:47	@NicsVoice You're a good mother.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-04 07:21:49	Went for a walk with a colleague. Feel better and more relaxed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-04 07:21:13	@HeadStable I'm so sorry

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-04 02:03:13	@rabbitsoup_zola So sorry, Z. How can we help? Sending hugs.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-04 01:11:42	@NicsVoice Wow. That's a long time to sleep
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-04 01:06:20	@cookiebetch420 Great job!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-04 01:06:06	@NicsVoice How do you feel about this?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 13:30:21	@Thee_noise I hope you get one soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 13:27:42	@Thee_noise I'm so sorry, sister
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 09:06:02	@leah_michal Sorry, Lisa
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 06:53:37	@NikitaElizabeth Thank you. Sleep well, sister.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 06:46:42	@DynamicDilemma Lovely
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 06:42:42	@pup_ear_nibbles So glad to hear it. I had a good therapy visit today, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 06:39:06	@pup_ear_nibbles How did your visit go?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 05:11:51	@DynamicDilemma Good luck with the reports
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 05:00:24	@DynamicDilemma Indeed. How are you by the way? How is the pain?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 04:55:01	@DynamicDilemma I'm so glad for that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 04:54:37	@BipolarSanity I'm sorry, Gus. I wish things were different.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 04:50:48	@DynamicDilemma Thanks for your sympathy
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 04:47:44	@DynamicDilemma This one was relatively close to home.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 04:19:15	My feeble yet whole-hearted attempt to get #guncontrol trending.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 04:04:45	My thoughts are with the killed, the injured, and the worried in San Bernardino. When will there be more #guncontrol ?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 03:54:55	@nyanlasers I wouldn't say I care so much as I had absolutely nothing else to do at that particular moment ;-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 03:53:14	@cookiebetch420 Excited for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 03:23:40	@NikitaElizabeth I'm sorry, sister. My thoughts are with you. You are stronger than the illness.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 03:20:44	@NikitaElizabeth Please eat. For me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 03:18:13	Dropped part of my sandwich on the floor. Not letting that bother me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 03:06:25	@schizoaffected My thoughts are with you. I'll be hoping for a good outcome.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 02:42:10	@JulieBipolar I get a "You do not have permission to read drafts" message
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 02:16:36	@_CongoRilla_ Oh nooo

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 01:50:18	@cookiebetch420 I hate when people tough it out and get everyone else sick.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 01:49:52	@nyanlasers Your mother was a hampster and your father smelt of elderberries.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 01:41:52	Spilled a little bit of coffee in the break room. In other news: I'm happy to be alive today. I hope you are as well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-03 01:24:52	@rabbitsoup_zola *hugs*

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 13:45:23	@FreshKnowsFresh Well played, Sir
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 11:11:51	@BipolarSanity Thank you. They definitely have. I'll do my best to enjoy every moment knowing how things can so easily change
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 11:08:01	@BipolarSanity Very sorry to hear that, brother
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 11:07:44	@ShakiraSalvador No I haven't :-(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 11:03:14	@BipolarSanity No problem. How are you by the way?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 10:59:23	@BipolarSanity Haha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 09:04:14	@DynamicDilemma I hope so
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 08:57:51	Looking forward to going for a run after work today.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 08:57:20	@cookiebetch420 I hope things improve for you soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 08:51:21	@chris_mahan Does that mean PERL is out of the picture?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 07:47:50	Days like today @wildcatrufus is missed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 07:47:06	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Keep up the good fight!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 07:45:37	@pup_ear_nibbles Good point. I hope you're able to weather this storm
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 07:43:33	@pup_ear_nibbles When do you see your pdoc next? Can you get in any earlier?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 07:43:05	@MozePray Any language courses in there? I love languages.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 07:42:31	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh no, I'm so sorry. What's eating you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 07:12:30	@DynamicDilemma Oh booo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 06:12:21	@BiggieSmalley Hang in there, bud!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 02:35:17	@joe_schizo Glad to hear you're doing ok
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 01:51:54	Have a query returning 2.3 million records. Had to ask a colleague with more RAM to run it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-02 01:25:03	@cookiebetch420 FWIW you're lovable to me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 08:28:24	I'm #grateful for lorazepam. Three milligrams seems to have done the trick.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 08:16:52	@chercolvin Awww, how sweet
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 08:15:07	@chercolvin I have faith in you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 08:12:33	@chercolvin Hoping the anxiety lifts...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 08:12:12	@chercolvin Aw, thank you Cher Bear.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 08:08:31	@SchizoInsight Ufff. Sorry you're in pain.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 08:08:09	@DynamicDilemma Oh nooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 07:53:07	@BATKAT88 For sure that helps. Thank you so much.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 07:40:05	@BATKAT88 Aww thank you BatKat. How sweet
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 07:28:46	@DailyBipolar Thanks, lovely.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 07:24:11	Still feeling on edge. Want to take a trip to Urgent Care for something stronger than Ativan.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 07:17:36	@MBeblowski Good job!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 06:42:11	@ShakiraSalvador Thank you, sister
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 06:41:32	@projectmonark Thanks, Tay. I will do my best.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 06:40:49	@700flights Oh nooo. I'm so sorry
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 05:32:08	Feeling very unsettled today. Have taken 2mg Ativan. Possibly reaching for a third in a bit. How's everyone else doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 03:19:26	@chercolvin Yes, let's! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 03:06:11	@schizoaffected Good luck. You can do it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 02:43:34	@Thee_noise It has been months for me, too :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 02:28:33	@MBeblowski I know the feeling. I hope things turn out ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 02:25:27	@Trotter_99 Haha. No worries.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 02:16:59	@Trotter_99 In the context of sugary drinks being considered as representative of a cost to the healthcare system I think a tax is merited.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 02:10:30	@MBeblowski You're doing the right thing, sister.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-12-01 02:01:01	@SageSilk I'm so sorry, Sagey.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-30 15:28:41	@chris_mahan Nice work!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-30 03:05:43	@emily_the_gray So glad to know you're feeling better!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-29 15:56:52	Sleeping on a new bed. It's firm yet comfortable
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-29 15:45:29	@emily_the_gray Ooh, sorry sister
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-29 15:37:33	@PTjessD Well stated!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-29 14:36:47	@cookiebetch420 Aww. Sorry that is happening
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-29 14:23:22	@nyanlasers Nice! Sleep well!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-29 07:46:11	@jane_benians I'm doing well thank you. Girlfriend and I are sort of nesting. It's fun

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-25 09:25:53	@NicsVoice Aww. Looking back on it it's funny right?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-25 09:00:50	@MozePray FWIW I was the same at your age
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-25 07:56:37	@schizoaffectiv5 Oh I see. I'm so sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-25 06:53:57	@schizoaffectiv5 I'm sorry that is the case. You deserve better.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-23 10:30:43	@chercolvin Hey Cher Bear
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-23 08:32:44	@DynamicDilemma I hope it works out well for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-23 08:31:07	@leah_michal Ouch, sorry Lisa
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 08:41:50	@700flights Aww, thank you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 08:41:32	@EOTierney @rabbitsoup_zola Haha!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 08:38:09	@NicsVoice Me too
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 08:35:48	@NicsVoice I think of my friends herre in the same way.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 08:29:13	@rabbitsoup_zola Right there with you! (It's mid-afternoon here)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 08:28:17	Feeling good. Going out tonight with my girlfriend and her cousins.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 08:14:13	@pup_ear_nibbles Yay! So glad to hear that! I'm feeling good because I'm off next week
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 08:00:10	@leah_michal Glad you don't have a cavity. What can be done about the grinding?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 07:58:38	@pup_ear_nibbles How are you today?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 05:25:46	@learningtofloat Glad to hear it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 05:03:22	@NicsVoice You were partly right! It's sodium valproate and valproic acid
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 04:53:36	@NicsVoice Possibly because divalproex sodium is so long-winded
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 04:49:44	@Ihatethisugh1 Great job!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 04:42:18	@bipolarkimmie Yay, Kimmie!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 04:27:11	@chris_mahan Very nice!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 04:25:17	@NicsVoice Since brand names can differ I think it's better to use the generic names anyway.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 04:23:41	@chris_mahan Sure!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 04:21:59	@chris_mahan Good morning, Chris! Congratulations on the poem
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 04:18:48	@NicsVoice I always try to use the generic names.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 04:16:06	@learningtofloat Yikes! I hope it warms up soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-22 04:13:19	@Lyingsoothsayer Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 11:14:55	@zendao42 Go you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 10:43:11	My thoughts are with all those struggling with mental illness tonight.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 09:44:05	@cookiebetch420 Have a great time!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 09:04:43	@DynamicDilemma Aw, I am sorry to hear that
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 08:22:32	@rabbitsoup_zola Ouch
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 08:18:17	@DynamicDilemma I hope you get some help
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 08:16:24	@zendao42 Best of luck w/ the laundry!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 06:53:24	@leah_michal I'll spend some time with my girlfriend. Other than that nothing concrete planned. In mid-December we're taking a trip to NCAL.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 06:52:02	@leah_michal I'm sorry you've been having a rough time. I'm feeling energetic because it's Friday and I have next week off.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 06:42:30	@zendao42 Yuck, sorry sister.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 06:22:43	@NicsVoice What's the plan if you don't mind saying?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 06:22:28	@NicsVoice It's good that you need so much less of it now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 06:20:31	@NicsVoice I hope it doesn't last long.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 06:19:59	@NicsVoice Oh ok. I'm glad you've got the Q then. For me it'd be risperidone.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 06:17:18	@NicsVoice Sorry you're cycling. Does the diazepam help at all?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 06:15:04	@SchizoInsight Really ready for some coffee though. Might have to go out and get some as it doesn't seem like the workplace has any today.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 06:13:45	@SchizoInsight Drinking some green tea as we speak!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 06:03:26	@BiggieSmalley I'm so sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 05:54:55	@SchizoInsight Aww.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 05:48:41	@DynamicDilemma Oh nooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 05:44:06	@rabbitsoup_zola Hey how are you, sister? Sending love.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 05:43:30	@SageSilk I'm glad you're ok. I hope things improve for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 05:36:45	@BiggieSmalley Ha. How so?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 05:36:30	@SageSilk Why not?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 05:36:03	@cookiebetch420 You're doing a good job keeping it bottled up but afterward you should go exercise or do something to let it out.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 05:33:56	@SageSilk Hey how are you, sister? Sending love.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 05:17:08	Still missing @wildcatrufus. Emailed him over two weeks ago.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 05:15:55	TL's a little quiet. How's everyone doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-21 05:15:22	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh nooo

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-20 11:34:53	@leah_michal Sorry, Lisa.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-20 11:11:49	@leah_michal What a sad thought
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-20 11:10:08	@leah_michal If you do, I hope it helps
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 15:02:25	@rabbitsoup_zola Took a lorazepam
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 14:57:37	@rabbitsoup_zola I should be asleep but I'm wide awake
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 14:52:26	@rabbitsoup_zola I saw a new therapist today. I daresay it went well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 14:51:12	@DynamicDilemma You're not a druggie!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 14:46:34	@DynamicDilemma That's so frustrating.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 14:42:36	@rabbitsoup_zola Can't complain.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 13:58:37	@rabbitsoup_zola Hi there, Z!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 10:15:44	Saw a new therapist today. She seems better-suited to me than my previous one. Thankful for that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 08:59:34	@pup_ear_nibbles Awww. I wish I could bring you soup.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 08:54:28	@pup_ear_nibbles Yuck. Sorry, sister.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 08:08:19	@eb462 Sorry, Emily.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 07:54:34	@chercolvin I saw a new therapist today. I think she's going to be much better than my previous therapist.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-19 07:36:25	@DynamicDilemma Sorry that's happening.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 08:48:06	Nobody here has the answer.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 06:49:43	@SchizoInsight Sorry they've brought you to this point. I hope things improve
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 06:44:42	@pup_ear_nibbles Why so much driving?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 06:23:05	Got an appointment for tomorrow!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 05:14:34	Trying to get a new psychologist. So far I've called one and left a message.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 04:43:06	@SociallyAwks05 Track your mood in a journal. Ask family and friends to monitor your mood. Contact your pdoc if you begin feeling too high.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 03:54:33	Lorazepam and coffee.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 03:31:23	Co-worker just upgraded monitors. Went from a 24" and 17" to a 27" and a 24". Boss joked that it's like IMAX.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 03:15:45	@leah_michal Difficult to tell where one ends and one begins.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 03:13:23	@leah_michal I have a friend who takes it for sleep maintenance.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 03:13:05	@leah_michal Mine definitely is, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-18 03:11:30	@SageSilk Sorry, Sagey.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-17 11:13:23	@NicsVoice I had akathisia at a low dose. At 30mg I don't have it thankfully.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-17 11:08:35	@NicsVoice To be fair I was experiencing a manic state with psychosis. I have BP1. I'm on aripiprazole now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-17 11:04:40	@lizs_heart Sleep well, sister!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-17 11:00:32	@NicsVoice I was prescribed Depakote and Risperidone to start. They were too strong.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-17 09:34:21	@DynamicDilemma Sorry you're feeling this way
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-17 08:38:03	@chercolvin You can use it as a stepping stone to something better!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-13 14:43:42	@projectmonark You're right, man. I should be more thankful for my physical health
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-13 08:39:42	@jane_benians Sleep well
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-13 08:22:38	@Ihatethisugh1 I enjoy reading your tweets and by no means do I think they're excessive.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-13 08:21:37	@NicsVoice Thank you for sharing your experience. Maybe it will help me some day.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-13 08:17:13	@NicsVoice I'm glad I haven't had it in a while. I have PRN risperidone to take if I get that feeling.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-06 08:18:53	@grendeldave Yeah, also @kingofweird is gone, too. At least he announced he was leaving.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-06 08:15:02	Thinking of @wildcatrufus this Thursday afternoon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-11-06 07:37:38	Finally fixed a program that went awry 6 days ago. Feels good to have it working again.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-10 05:11:13	@pup_ear_nibbles Thanks! I have to share these small victories otherwise they get lost like tears in rain (reference: Blade Runner).
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-10 05:06:20	@pup_ear_nibbles Ha! How are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-10 05:04:07	Today is turning out rather nicely: I obviated a manual step from one of my programs
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-10 03:56:36	@Lyingsoothsayer Ha! I'm glad you snapped a few before they got to you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-10 03:51:21	@Lyingsoothsayer I love the tilted fountain close-up!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-10 02:13:33	@bipolarkimmie Sorry you're feeling down :-(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-10 01:12:57	Made changes to a program which promptly failed. I'm grateful for tests which caught that.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-09 04:21:24	@rabbitsoup_zola Go bunny!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-09 04:20:42	Just led a meditation session at my workplace. Didn't have my Bluetooth speaker with me. Turned out that my phone's speaker was sufficient.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-09 01:54:56	@wildcatrufus Ha!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-08 22:21:17	@aurelgil Good morning!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-08 14:05:34	@Ihatethisugh1 I'm looking forward to reading it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-08 11:48:38	@pup_ear_nibbles Very sorry to hear this
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-08 06:52:13	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh that's a shitty situation. Glad the Xanax is doing the trick.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-08 06:42:07	@wildcatrufus Sorry you're not feeling well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-08 06:41:28	@pup_ear_nibbles Yuck, sorry. What's going on?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-08 00:28:28	@wildcatrufus You got this!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-07 04:37:28	@schizoaffected I'm sorry you're feeling poorly. I hope tomorrow's better.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-07 03:55:25	@wildcatrufus You too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-07 03:55:00	@wildcatrufus I'm sorry that's the case.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 22:18:21	@leah_michal Mine is poor, too
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 22:11:18	@Lyingsoothsayer Good luck with your date!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 22:06:19	@leah_michal These meds...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 22:02:30	@pup_ear_nibbles Good for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 07:02:03	@nyanlasers S/b whilst, and all joking aside that's a big step. Congrats!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 07:01:00	@nyanlasers I would've starred your tweet but I fell asleep while reading it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 06:10:43	@pup_ear_nibbles Thank you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 06:07:21	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm glad you slept deeply. That sounds good right now. I didn't sleep so well. I'm alright though. Thank you for asking!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 05:19:41	@wildcatrufus Catch ya later. Take care.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 04:29:14	@HeadStable Nice work!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 04:06:38	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Enjoy the nap if you take one
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 02:22:27	@PieterJJonker Sorry to hear you're not feeling well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 02:02:10	@BipolarMe_net Glad to hear it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 01:48:05	@DEPRESSI0NISTA To your credit!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 01:47:21	@joe_schizo So far so good. Work is ok. Thank you for asking!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 01:46:19	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Whew!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 01:45:17	@DEPRESSI0NISTA O_o hopefully this isn't about me
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 01:43:59	@joe_schizo I'm glad your work is done!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 01:41:32	@wildcatrufus Yum! Thanks, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 01:41:03	@Lyingsoothsayer I'm doing alright. Thank you for asking :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 01:40:45	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Haha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 01:33:53	@chris_mahan Sorry to hear. I hope the day improves.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 01:28:13	How's everyone doing today?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-06 01:23:10	@Lyingsoothsayer Enjoy!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-05 23:24:37	@cookiebetch420 Good for you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-05 22:38:26	@drivelhe4d Thinking of you in your time of need
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-05 06:59:59	@pup_ear_nibbles Doing alright
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-05 05:09:00	@pup_ear_nibbles Aww, sorry. That sucks. How are you doing otherwise?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 23:29:40	@pup_ear_nibbles Aww, thank you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 23:28:52	@700flights Happy Sunday to you too, sister!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 14:29:37	@KingOfWeird Sleep well, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 09:39:46	@projectmonark Oh nooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 06:28:13	Feeling pretty good. Happy Saturday everyone
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 06:27:36	@pup_ear_nibbles Nice!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 06:24:44	@pup_ear_nibbles What sleep med are you using now?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 06:23:55	@pup_ear_nibbles Thank you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 06:20:18	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm glad you slept well. I'm feeling pretty good for a change.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 06:18:15	@pup_ear_nibbles Nothing to be sorry for, sister.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 06:17:15	@pup_ear_nibbles How is your day going?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 04:31:06	@MagicalBlondess Best wishes for a productive visit
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-04 04:14:22	@rabbitsoup_zola It's ok to vent. I hope you feel better soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 23:40:45	@emily_the_gray Aww, thank you so much!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 08:26:19	@pup_ear_nibbles Hm, maybe...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 07:29:42	@pup_ear_nibbles Ha, sorry...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 07:28:53	@wildcatrufus Any PRN benzos lying around?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 07:18:58	@wildcatrufus I wish you could, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 07:15:51	@nyanlasers I'm mildly disappointed you're no longer going by "Ham Separatist".
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 07:14:22	And I finished that work today! (I thought I was going to finish it next week.)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 07:12:17	@chris_mahan Ha, no, it's very insightful.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 06:44:14	@chris_mahan Excellent article! I found "throught". And I think you may have meant "grey-faced-drone counterparts". You needn't paypal me $5
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 03:54:24	@zendao42 Ooh, sorry. Feel better soon!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 03:45:17	Yay! It sped back up.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 01:55:58	Which is no good because I have a lot of work to do :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 01:55:29	The main database I use is slow today.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 01:50:35	@Lyingsoothsayer Great photos!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 01:18:56	@pup_ear_nibbles Had no idea there was such a thing. Glad to hear it's helping your mood!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 01:18:10	@pup_ear_nibbles Nice!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-03 01:17:45	@wildcatrufus FWIW I've not noticed you being brash nor thoughtless.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-02 23:17:35	@BeautifulMined A little birdy told me you were sick. I hope you feel better soon!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-02 09:26:43	@pup_ear_nibbles Do you have any Ensure or similar?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-02 07:09:56	@wildcatrufus Meat knows meat as only meat can.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-02 06:58:52	@wildcatrufus Thanks again for the RTs and favs :-)

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-02 05:47:20	@rabbitsoup_zola Hey bunny! I'm doing alright. How are you? x
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-02 05:06:29	@SageSilk You're not a fuck up! You have a serious mental illness. You are fighting battles which would kill lesser mortals.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-02 04:50:23	@HeadStable I'm doing alright. Paxil seems to really be doing the trick as the final piece of the medication puzzle.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-02 04:49:38	@Lyingsoothsayer Glad to know you're enjoying yourself!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-02 04:24:29	@BekaLombardo I'm having the same issues.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-02 02:57:27	@MagicalBlondess If I may ask: What med(s) do you use for sleep?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-02 02:55:13	@MagicalBlondess I'm glad you slept well!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 10:26:56	@MagicalBlondess Sorry, sister. I hope things turn around for you soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 10:23:29	@BipolarSanity I'd say so.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 10:21:36	@pup_ear_nibbles Thanks for sharing this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 07:19:22	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm headed to my therapist's office now. Wish me luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 07:17:29	@pup_ear_nibbles What advice if any did the therapist offer for dealing with her?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 07:12:48	@Ihatethisugh1 Good on you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 06:57:46	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm doing alright. I'm feeling more functional since the addition of Paxil to my medication regimen. Thank you for asking.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 06:53:06	@pup_ear_nibbles How are you doing, sister?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 06:27:09	@pup_ear_nibbles Thanks for the RTs and favs!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 06:11:36	@wildcatrufus Thanks for the RTs and favs!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 02:08:27	@Ihatethisugh1 Couldn't agree more.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 01:54:00	@wildcatrufus Is that apple cider alcoholic?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 01:23:48	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm looking forward to reading those poems!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 01:18:53	@BipolarMe_net Best of luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-10-01 00:50:50	@wildcatrufus Thanks for the refreshing post.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-30 15:44:56	@wildcatrufus I don't know. I think I need to force myself.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-30 15:27:11	@wildcatrufus Work is fine. Lyft I haven't started. Art I haven't done for a while :-( Thank you for asking! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-30 15:11:38	@wildcatrufus Catching up on the old timeline.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-30 15:03:23	@SageSilk I certainly hope not.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-30 15:01:25	@wildcatrufus Can't sleep. How's life?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-30 14:59:40	@SageSilk It's going to be just fine.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-30 14:58:14	@lizs_heart Happy birthday!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-30 05:17:59	@bipolarkimmie Good on you for noticing
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-30 01:53:41	@pup_ear_nibbles You should still go to Krispy Kreme and get a donut.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-29 23:39:44	@wildcatrufus I hope it's a good day for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-29 07:19:16	@BiPolar_Witch That makes two of us.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-29 07:16:32	Not that I have an alternative for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-29 07:16:09	Fling thine sack lunches to the wind, dear friends.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-29 07:03:59	@Missives0fASub Nice work!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-29 05:45:35	@nyanlasers Starred for "prickery"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-29 05:31:43	@wildcatrufus Very sorry to hear your AS is getting worse.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-29 05:27:51	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm so sorry this happened.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-29 03:27:34	@rabbitsoup_zola Well alright. Revel away!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-29 03:23:51	@rabbitsoup_zola That's just the depression talking
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-29 03:18:42	@wildcatrufus Interesting. How did it feel?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-28 23:30:54	@wildcatrufus Thank you sir! I hope you have a good day as well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-28 21:11:23	@MrDanDLondon Thank you!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-28 05:46:02	@HeadStable Sleep well too
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-27 22:44:51	@Ihatethisugh1 You're very welcome! I'm doing alright. Thank you for inquiring :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-27 13:00:17	@MagicalBlondess Oh I see. I wish you well, sister!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-27 12:55:21	@MagicalBlondess Do you have any PRN AAPs you can take?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-27 06:44:19	@wildcatrufus I'm hoping so too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-27 06:02:13	Watching "How to Die in Oregon" about voluntary euthanasia. All states should support this
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-27 05:09:19	@Ihatethisugh1 Glad to know it's lifting!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-27 03:45:52	@_BipolarManiac I'm glad she's so helpful. I hope you can continue to let people's protestations not get to you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-23 22:50:51	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh sorry. That does sound exhausting
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-23 22:25:45	@pup_ear_nibbles Can you ask your pdoc if you can switch back?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-23 07:59:52	@TweetLilLatina ¡Buen provecho!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-21 04:24:50	Waiting for a bus and it's 104°F/40°C. Fortunately there's shade and a breeze.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-21 04:20:40	@pup_ear_nibbles It's ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-21 04:18:20	@pup_ear_nibbles I do.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-19 05:08:55	@MagicalBlondess Yuck, sorry. I'm hoping you'll get over it quickly.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-19 05:08:18	@pup_ear_nibbles Just curious, what is the new sleep med?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-19 03:56:38	@pup_ear_nibbles So glad to hear it!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-16 12:58:36	Feeling pretty good for the first time in a bit. Happy to be going to sleep. Took Ativan which should help me stay asleep through the night.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-16 08:11:52	@DEPRESSI0NISTA Nice work!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-16 07:00:14	@pup_ear_nibbles I've not turned on you. I hope you'll take care of yourself.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-16 02:18:44	@nyanlasers When I hover over it it says "person with folded hands".
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-15 12:18:42	@MagicalBlondess I recommend "The Cobbler" when you need another.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-15 12:14:30	@wildcatrufus No way! That brings back memories! Thanks for posting

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-05 05:55:00	@pup_ear_nibbles I like the choice!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-05 03:37:23	@DEPRESSI0NISTA You're sociable with the people who matter :-)

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 16:04:55	@Ihatethisugh1 How are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 16:04:07	@Ihatethisugh1 Doing well, thank you for asking :-) I have the next four days off!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 16:02:54	@Ihatethisugh1 Heyooooooooo!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 06:19:10	@TimeTravelnMan They were good efforts!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 06:12:54	@BiggieSmalley Thanks, man! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 05:06:27	@pup_ear_nibbles No need to apologize, sister :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 03:54:46	@pup_ear_nibbles Don't mention it :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 01:26:13	@pup_ear_nibbles My vote is for goldish brown because I think red/auburn could look too artificial. If it's a good one it could work though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 01:15:53	@pup_ear_nibbles I say dark brown... in part because I don't think light brown would do much.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 01:06:43	@pup_ear_nibbles Brown then?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 01:06:05	@burrohazard Thanks for the retweet!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-04 01:03:07	@pup_ear_nibbles I say you eventually try all of them. Which do you want to try first?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 23:29:57	@SageSilk Would love to see them!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 22:12:24	@chris_mahan Mornin' sir
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 11:08:05	@BiggieSmalley Were that to happen you'd be @mechanically_separated_meat! Which is what I wish my @name was!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 10:39:47	@KingOfWeird Good night good sir!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 10:35:46	@FreshKnowsFresh Well played, sir
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 10:32:34	@DailyBipolar Slightly inebriated so all is good with the world.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 10:30:58	@DailyBipolar I couldn't wait! How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 10:17:57	@emily_the_gray God love ya
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:56:05	@chercolvin That's what I wanted to be!: @mechanically_separated_meat. You know how life can be. Sometimes it feels like we're being deboned
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:53:45	@chercolvin Loving my new @. Thank you for asking
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:52:16	@chercolvin How are you doing, sister?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:47:55	@MagicalBlondess Ah, that's a long movie.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:39:55	@KingOfWeird Aww, thank you sir :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:39:21	@MagicalBlondess Live tweet it! I'm gonna go watch something myself
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:34:20	@MagicalBlondess That's a great one
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:32:45	@MagicalBlondess Which one?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:28:15	@KingOfWeird More like a person not having or showing thought or spontaneity.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:25:00	@KingOfWeird Thanks for the retweet!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:15:23	@pup_ear_nibbles Thanks for the favorite and retweet :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 09:08:49	I'm now known as @mechanical_meat
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 08:47:40	@DEPRESSI0NISTA @burrohazard What had you two decided on? I think everyone's favorite toxic donkey might be due for an @change
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 08:46:01	@DEPRESSI0NISTA @burrohazard I wanted @mechanically_separated_meat. Alas that's too long.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 08:42:29	Thank you @DEPRESSI0NISTA and @MagicalBlondess! I love my new @
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 08:23:31	I want to change my @. For those of you who've done so do you regret it?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 08:08:36	@pup_ear_nibbles What great service!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 05:50:23	@nyanlasers Thus underscoring the demand for low-cost housing
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 04:17:30	@150pride Scary. Glad you're ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 03:41:40	@pup_ear_nibbles It sounds like when a swing goes too high too fast and ends up wrapping around
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-03 03:39:07	@burrohazard It's good to know you have hope
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 07:29:35	@MagicalBlondess I recommend "The Skeleton Twins"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 07:02:43	@wingstotweet Great job!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 06:31:30	A co-worker just gave me a bottle of wine as thanks for helping him.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 06:27:51	@chris_mahan That's great writing, Chris!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 06:18:06	@pup_ear_nibbles Heh. I know that feeling
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 06:14:42	@chris_mahan No need to apologize, man. I hope things turn around for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 06:02:28	@pup_ear_nibbles Sorry it has been a rough day.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 05:36:20	@Blueeyedfoxie Sorry it has been a rough day
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 04:27:09	@MagicalBlondess Watched anything good?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 01:15:43	@pup_ear_nibbles My next visit is in a couple of months :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 01:13:59	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh I don't know. Something I can ask my pdoc about!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 01:09:34	@pup_ear_nibbles Yikes. What is your sleep med?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 00:59:36	@pup_ear_nibbles Hahaha :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 00:54:50	@burrohazard IIRC you have an appointment today. I hope it goes well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 00:42:22	@burrohazard So far so good, man. Thank you for asking :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-02 00:39:21	@pup_ear_nibbles That sucks.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-01 23:45:57	@_CongoRilla_ Not to mention racist.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-01 23:29:43	@Lyingsoothsayer Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-01 12:10:01	@burrohazard Sorry you're feeling low. I hope the book is good.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-01 07:28:24	@XERO_360 Oh, man. That looks so delicious.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-01 07:08:27	@leah_michal Oh, boo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-01 07:08:03	@projectmonark Yay!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-01 06:34:40	@pup_ear_nibbles Better than nothing! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-01 05:35:34	@BiggieSmalley I agree w/ you on this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-09-01 04:49:04	@burrohazard Good luck tomorrow.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-30 05:13:25	For those looking for Netflix recommendations: Saw "Motel Life". Enjoyed it. Would recommend

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-30 05:07:38	@martyn666arts Can't complain! Thank you

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-30 04:30:41	@pup_ear_nibbles Sorry she's being a bitch.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-30 03:33:07	@pup_ear_nibbles No, they didn't. Are you still on that?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-30 03:30:26	@pup_ear_nibbles Good on you. I'm ok. Waiting for Paxil to take effect. Another week or two I'm afraid.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-30 03:25:33	@pup_ear_nibbles @burrohazard Hey there :-) How are things?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-29 01:30:54	@pup_ear_nibbles About what?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-28 09:40:41	@Honest_Soul37 Wow. It's amazing what we can take for granted.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-28 09:35:44	@Honest_Soul37 Um... YES
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-28 07:00:34	@schizorama_ It takes a big person to admit their faults.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-28 06:40:20	@pup_ear_nibbles I know it feels bad. Still, it's not your fault
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-28 05:07:58	@XERO_360 Haha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-28 04:40:55	@SageSilk I wish that for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-28 04:36:17	@nyanlasers So ferret-bedding-like you can almost see the ferret
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-28 03:25:28	@burrohazard Thanks for asking. I woke up at about 2am and put the mattress back on :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-28 02:22:55	@Ihatethisugh1 Sorry you had a rough night. Glad you're taking time out for yourself.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-28 01:34:49	@burrohazard I'm sorry you're feeling that way. Do you feel like elaborating to get things off your chest?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-28 01:17:14	@serpentgrr Welcome back!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 13:07:22	Tired of my mattress so I'm trying sleeping on the box spring.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 12:33:17	@themanicmedic Good luck, Joe
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 12:31:49	@zendao42 Until then: Take care of yourself!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 11:31:45	@chercolvin It's not you it's the job market
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 11:17:29	@Ihatethisugh1 Good on ya for applying the brakes
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 11:16:44	@chercolvin We love you! With or without a job
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 11:14:27	@chercolvin Untrue. I would.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 07:06:28	@burrohazard Great song! I can't recall having heard it before. Thanks for the recommendation
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 06:34:18	@pup_ear_nibbles That sucks. I'm sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 04:51:28	@SageSilk You're certainly not faking the whole thing.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 03:51:18	@mybipolarside Glad you're still here, man. I hope you'll be able to thrive soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 01:12:22	@KingOfWeird And that's one of the many reasons why we love you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-27 00:34:10	@chris_mahan I used to take the bus a lot, too. It took so much longer to get places.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 10:53:34	@yvette_hess Thanks, you too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 08:40:31	@MagicalBlondess Looks nice though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 07:12:50	@TweetLilLatina Ouch. Sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 06:48:18	@chris_mahan Haha. It happens to be my query. I can justify every join!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 06:44:58	@chris_mahan I was just looking at a query with 32 joins including those included in subqueries.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 06:34:34	I've been thoroughly enjoying this mix: https:// soundcloud.com/psychemagik/r- n-ears-exclusive-dj-mix …

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 06:11:15	@Ihatethisugh1 I'm feeling ok. Thank you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 06:03:55	@eb462 Thank you :-) I'm ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 05:51:04	@LePetiteNYC Yes, yes it is.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 05:46:34	@eb462 Sorry, Emily. Sending hugs
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 05:14:49	@SageSilk We love you too, Sagey :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 04:42:45	@StayStrong4Hope Good luck. You can do it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 04:01:18	@pup_ear_nibbles I know you'd do the same for me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 03:59:00	@pup_ear_nibbles Good luck w/ the meditation. I hope it helps
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 02:48:03	@pup_ear_nibbles Alright. Please tell us how it goes
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 02:46:00	@pup_ear_nibbles Ouch. I'm sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 02:35:22	@eb462 The last one is a lie. You are good enough
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 02:18:55	@pup_ear_nibbles I hope so, too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 02:13:33	@pup_ear_nibbles I find this both funny and mildly disconcerting :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 01:52:32	@_BipolarManiac I hope that the Ativan relieves some of this soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 01:35:03	@eb462 I'm sorry, Emily.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-26 01:20:13	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm really glad for this
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-25 23:07:35	@got_my_buddha Awww. Thank you, sir :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-25 10:55:05	@KingOfWeird G'night, man!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-25 09:29:34	@pup_ear_nibbles Aw, thank you so much.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-25 07:11:21	@bipolarvoice That sucks. I'm sorry that's going on.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-25 04:36:05	@leah_michal So glad to hear this

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-25 00:32:12	@aurelgil I'm very sorry for your loss, Aurelian.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-25 00:13:05	@eb462 No need to apologise. I hope you feel better soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-25 00:10:31	@SageSilk Haha :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-24 21:49:25	@leah_michal Uff. Sorry, Lisa.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-24 13:48:31	@burrohazard That sucks, man. All because of the one guy. Sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-24 03:46:41	@chris_mahan I like it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-24 03:18:26	@bipolarandlife Hey! Welcome back!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-24 03:04:45	@BiggieSmalley Looking good, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-24 02:24:27	@eb462 Thank you. I'm doing ok. Just started on an antidepressant so I'm feeling hopeful.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-24 02:16:35	@eb462 Sorry you've been the target of rudeness. Lots of good folks here. I hope you'll run into more of them
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 23:26:12	@livinginstigma See you soon :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 18:28:36	@chris_mahan I feel your pain. I just lost a great neighbor to Virginia.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 07:50:38	@drivelhe4d Ray's forever creepy to me after having seen that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 07:38:32	@BipolarSanity I have no idea
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 07:34:42	@drivelhe4d Have you seen Goodfellas?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 07:09:28	@Rivkah_g I'm sorry this is happening.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 06:42:53	@rabbitsoup_zola Please don't be too hard on yourself. You're fighting battles most couldn't handle.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 06:18:16	@rabbitsoup_zola Wishing you success
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 05:13:48	@_bluelightblue_ Nice!!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 03:55:43	@emily_the_gray Good for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 03:45:35	@pup_ear_nibbles What happened?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 01:45:07	@chercolvin Welcome back, sister!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-23 01:33:57	@BiggieSmalley Congratulations, man! That's outstanding
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-22 13:01:12	@KingOfWeird Hey, bud. How are you?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 21:24:10	#ff @leah_michal
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 12:43:55	@rabbitsoup_zola Ouch! Sorry, bunny.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 10:39:45	@burrohazard I used to like making Indian food.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 08:28:08	@Ihatethisugh1 Oh, in my experience that's pretty common for bipolar people.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 08:26:49	@burrohazard I used to cook nearly every day. Since the divorce I've not cooked much.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 08:23:19	@Ihatethisugh1 How do you mean?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 08:21:03	@burrohazard Sounds delicious
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 07:10:20	@learningtofloat Sleep well!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 06:38:40	@pup_ear_nibbles Well, I hope not
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 06:37:37	@budweena420 Haha, thanks :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 06:34:26	@pup_ear_nibbles Did you see that movie?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 04:31:44	@pup_ear_nibbles Damn! Ours is ~$2 higher
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 04:30:22	@TweetLilLatina Ouch! Sorry that happened.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 04:26:03	My cubicle is right by a door which apparently gives people license to peer into it. #grumble
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 04:25:13	@pup_ear_nibbles For a second I was wondering who Emily was.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 04:21:13	@pup_ear_nibbles Hahaha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 04:02:10	@brightonbipolar Well written! Thank you for sharing :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 03:56:37	@NicsVoice Sorry, Nic. At this point I'm hoping you'll receive it at all.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 02:38:28	@alwaysunstable Thanks for the poem!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 01:25:32	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh, if people don't follow back I might just unfollow. I wouldn't take it personally which I know is easier said than done.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 01:07:53	@pup_ear_nibbles Care to provide an example?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 01:07:17	@BiggieSmalley What're ya gonna get?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 00:42:16	@Lyingsoothsayer Yay!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-21 00:41:58	@SageSilk I'm glad it's helping!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 22:51:24	@_CongoRilla_ Happy birthday!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 10:19:50	@pup_ear_nibbles I hope you'll get some sleep for a change.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 10:12:24	@leah_michal Thank you, Lisa. That means a lot.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 10:11:25	@pup_ear_nibbles You're doing your part to save the relationship and she's not reciprocating
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 10:07:36	@leah_michal Willing to give it a shot.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 10:04:46	@pup_ear_nibbles A lot of healing can happen in four months
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 10:04:06	@SageSilk Does it make you dizzy?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 10:01:02	Saw pdoc today. Was put on Paxil.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 09:59:32	@pup_ear_nibbles Oh wow. She'll get over it at some point.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 09:55:10	@pup_ear_nibbles Well that's a relief!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 09:35:25	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm glad you're seeing your pdoc.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 06:28:59	@rabbitsoup_zola What do we have that you don’t?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 05:45:24	@pup_ear_nibbles I know how you feel there. I also talk to no one.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 05:42:48	@pup_ear_nibbles I have a good relationship with my family, and I still want to end my life a lot of the time. I can't imagine how you feel.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 05:39:45	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm so sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 04:40:10	@pup_ear_nibbles I know you'd do the same for me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 04:37:58	@pup_ear_nibbles Well, you for sure are not bothering me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 04:36:38	@pup_ear_nibbles I'm so sorry you're feeling so low.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 04:33:29	@Honest_Soul37 It's ok. I hope you feel better soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-20 04:05:42	@pup_ear_nibbles How are you doing?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-15 12:38:46	@DailyBipolar Aww, that's a very sweet thing to say. Thank you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-15 12:37:06	@SageSilk I did a quick carrot sketch last night. Nothing big of late though. Need to get back to it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-15 12:32:49	@SageSilk Ahh I'm sorry you didn't get much sleep. I'm doing ok right now. Thanks very much for asking :-)

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-13 01:11:10	@burrohazard That's really disappointing. I'm sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-13 00:54:00	@Bpd_Buddhist Oh that's so great! I wish I had a pdoc who understood firsthand what it's like to have our condition.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-13 00:47:41	@Bpd_Buddhist That's something to tell her, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-13 00:45:36	@Bpd_Buddhist I suggest making a list of your symptoms and other concerns to be sure you address each of them at your visit.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-13 00:41:00	@Bpd_Buddhist So glad to hear you're doing better in some respects.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 23:43:07	@BiggieSmalley Sorry, man. Hopefully you don't wait too much longer.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 23:25:01	@burrohazard Best of luck at the appointment
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 22:25:56	@Bpd_Buddhist Thank you. That's very kind of you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 22:25:26	@burrohazard Thanks! :-)

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 13:28:05	Deep dream generator made my #panda diabolical pic.twitter.com/1f67IRcxUs
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 09:47:23	@nyanlasers Wow.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 06:44:44	@rabbitsoup_zola Well done!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 06:09:46	@burrohazard I'm glad you still have some. The stress is very understandable. How's your blood pressure?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 05:31:12	@dcole24762 Likewise!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 05:22:04	@Bpd_Buddhist I won't.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 04:34:06	@rabbitsoup_zola Great job, Bunny.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 04:14:21	@rabbitsoup_zola From what I've seen of you I can definitively say that the first sentence is untrue.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 04:08:56	@rabbitsoup_zola You've got this, Bunny!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 02:02:16	@leah_michal Wow!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-12 01:02:16	@iseaturtles Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 23:57:37	@KristinaBipolar I'm sorry, K.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 23:40:22	@leah_michal Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 12:37:35	@alwaysunstable I hope you don't
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 11:35:52	@leah_michal You go girl
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 11:07:03	@BiggieSmalley Donated! Best of luck with the campaign :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 10:53:25	@onewintersnight Thanks for the retweet!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 10:21:56	@onewintersnight Much love to you, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 08:34:05	@Bpd_Buddhist Thanks for the retweet!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 06:58:20	@burrohazard Thanks for the retweet!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 06:39:45	@BiPolar_Witch Who needs 'em! The ones who matter are still here.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 06:38:42	@SeonaidXseonaid Good luck. I hope the appointment goes well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 06:35:08	Breaking news: Alphabet now owns Google. In somewhat older news, multiplication tables own 2nd graders.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 06:03:43	@Bpd_Buddhist I'm anxious in group, too. Which doesn't make sense I know.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 06:00:49	@Bpd_Buddhist It's beneficial that you have someone around with bipolar who can tell you how you're acting. I go to a support group for that
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 05:54:40	@Bpd_Buddhist Bright side: No matter how much you f up you can never be in as much debt as Greece is right now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 05:47:48	@Bpd_Buddhist Heh, I've done that before.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 04:19:39	@Bpd_Buddhist Wow, what presumptuous comments.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 02:45:56	@learningtofloat It has been said that it's the little, simple pleasures that contribute to our happiness rather than big things.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 02:26:07	@Bpd_Buddhist Ya, it was a bit tough to watch because I became so invested in the story; ultimately, though, it was time well spent.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 02:23:56	@Bpd_Buddhist I second the recommendation.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 02:09:02	@Bpd_Buddhist The interaction, however minimal, is still good for us.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 02:03:31	@Bpd_Buddhist I apologize.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 01:59:33	@Bpd_Buddhist I just thought it was funny. No need to take off!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 01:37:13	@nyanlasers Snail/slug joke: "I had a racing snail. I thought it would be faster if I removed it's shell but it only made it more sluggish."
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 00:12:41	@brightonbipolar I hope you feel better as the night progresses.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 00:09:36	@alwaysunstable Ha! Me too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-11 00:05:48	@alwaysunstable Maybe our obsessions don't exactly correspond to our moods but obsessing seems to be a character trait of bipolar people.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-10 23:54:28	@alwaysunstable I agree that this kind of behavior is related to our shifts in mood.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-10 12:08:48	@Bpd_Buddhist No.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-09 00:33:22	@burrohazard Thanks! I will do my best :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 12:15:27	@burrohazard Sleep well, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 10:48:01	This tablet charger blows most phone chargers out of the water.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 10:46:28	A big #ff for one of the greatest people I know @burrohazard
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 10:23:35	@Bpd_Buddhist Sleep well, sister.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 09:27:56	@burrohazard Shit.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 09:23:58	@BekaLombardo It's about a brother and sister dealing with life's tribulations. I promise you won't regret watching it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 08:36:21	Just watched the movie "The Skeleton Twins". You need to watch it if you haven't already.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 07:28:15	@Puppy_Nibbler Cheers!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 06:38:13	@Puppy_Nibbler No it's really quite efficient from my point of view.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 06:36:22	@Puppy_Nibbler I'm envious of the way you vent. You get straight to the point.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 06:31:22	@rabbitsoup_zola Yay! It makes me so happy to know this :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 06:14:31	@burrohazard Haha. I feel the same way.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 06:13:16	This has been a good week, and today has been a good day.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 05:54:55	@burrohazard Hang out here instead!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 05:08:45	#ff The legit @KingOfWeird
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 01:25:16	@leah_michal Ha!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 01:14:39	@burrohazard No need to apologise.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 00:50:01	@burrohazard Geez! I hope so.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-08 00:48:59	@BiPolarQueen2 I hope the change is a positive one.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-07 08:24:39	@serpentgrr I hope your time away is restorative. I'll miss your tweets.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-07 05:17:19	@burrohazard I hope you're able to get it corrected.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-07 01:16:45	@alwaysunstable I'm also thinking that when things eventually go wrong it's a huge disservice to my family that they have no forewarning.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-07 00:42:09	@alwaysunstable I rationalise telling my family I'm ok so I'm not a burden. In reality it can be more of a burden to not tell the full truth
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 23:53:13	@chercolvin I'm glad you've come to this realisation. I hope you'll now have the strength and means to change the situation.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 23:52:13	@chercolvin Who needs 'em! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 22:08:53	@burrohazard Best wishes for a good visit today.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 10:21:24	@Puppy_Nibbler I'm sorry you're going through some shit right now. I'm here for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 10:15:12	There are some really great people on Twitter. I'm thankful for you guys.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 10:13:11	@BiggieSmalley Hey, man. I'm sorry this is happening.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 06:51:43	@brightonbipolar I'm sorry you're feeling low. I'll be thinking of you and hoping things turn around soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 06:18:30	@leah_michal I'm so sorry that happened.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 05:15:27	@Puppy_Nibbler #badjoke And what did you restrain it from doing? In all seriousness, I'm very sorry that happened.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 04:29:36	Today I'm #thankful for this bugfix: https:// github.com/python-excel/x lrd/pull/95/files … . Thank you, https:// github.com/jmcnamara
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 04:12:46	@Puppy_Nibbler Woohoo! I hope that remains in your favor.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 02:22:16	@rabbitsoup_zola Yes, I think that would be prudent.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-06 02:19:51	@rabbitsoup_zola I trust you're only doing this because there're no other options.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 23:31:37	@leah_michal My thoughts are with you and your family.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 07:13:56	@leah_michal Why only $5? I happened to be standing outside a Mexican restaurant and he wanted only enough cash for a burrito.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 07:12:37	@leah_michal Very sorry to hear that. My day is ok so far. I gave $5 to a middle-aged man who told me he'd lost his job as a French teacher.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 07:08:34	@Puppy_Nibbler Things are gonna be fine.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 07:01:16	@Puppy_Nibbler That's terrible!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 07:00:32	@Puppy_Nibbler I'm sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 05:51:25	@HCApeggy I'm very glad to hear that you're on the road to recovery.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 05:27:43	@SageSilk I feel the same way, so apathetic.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 05:24:07	@BipolarSanity I feel the same way, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 05:10:55	@BiggieSmalley Summarily delete and repost.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 04:13:10	@Lyingsoothsayer Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-05 01:58:03	@NicsVoice It's a pet peeve. We'd not have this problem were it still called "manic depression".

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-04 09:55:59	Former neighbor is driving cross-country to his new home. He's on his 4th day of travel in Tennessee. Tomorrow he'll reach his destination.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-04 09:38:59	@KristinaBipolar Yes, me too. Could cost me my job this time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-04 07:23:18	@Puppy_Nibbler Ouchhh, so sorry that happened.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-04 04:40:34	@burrohazard Hope that you get a referral?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-04 04:37:32	@burrohazard How's the quest progressing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-04 04:27:42	@chris_mahan I'm sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-04 04:20:34	Beginning today we're allowed to wear business casual at work unless we have a meeting. Saw someone in a faded polo. He's retiring soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-04 02:47:25	@martyn666arts Glad to hear it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-04 01:19:43	The wedding was a lovely affair on a golf course on the bluffs of Rancho Palos Verdes overlooking a placid-looking Pacific.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-04 01:14:32	@burrohazard Good to have you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-04 00:04:06	Mildly peeved that this cubicle doesn't have a bed in it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-03 23:24:00	@rabbitsoup_zola You matter, bunny. We love you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-03 23:17:29	@leah_michal I'm sorry, Leah. I can't imagine the pain you must feel. While driving please don't cry so much that you can't see.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-03 16:01:18	Guy I've known for 30+ years got married and I can't believe it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-03 14:49:43	@burrohazard Funny because: It. Actually. Happened.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-02 04:52:34	@projectmonark Sorry, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-02 04:33:00	@BipolarWhisper Hey there! Doing alright. How are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-02 03:32:14	@rabbitsoup_zola I hope so, too. You do seem a little high now that you mention it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-02 03:27:27	@rabbitsoup_zola You go, bunny!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-02 03:07:30	@joe_schizo Hey Joe, likewise. I'm a bit hungover, otherwise my Saturday is going well. How is yours?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-02 02:30:27	A longtime friend is getting married tomorrow and I can't believe it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-01 07:32:45	@Puppy_Nibbler I think you think you're a bitch when you're simply venting. We all need to vent, and probably should do it a lot more often.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-01 06:59:20	@nyanlasers I'll be thinking of you and hoping for a swift resolution to the issues.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-01 06:44:20	@nyanlasers Is anything the matter? Or is this a self-imposed hiatus?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-01 06:38:58	@nyanlasers I'll miss your humor and wit.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-01 06:37:03	@chris_mahan Best of luck, Sir!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-01 06:21:37	@rabbitsoup_zola Great job, bunny!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-01 06:19:44	Happy to report that the cleaning went well!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-01 01:03:55	@rabbitsoup_zola Ah, ok. I hope you feel better soon. Sending love...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-01 01:01:31	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm so sorry, Zola. Is there a chance there's something about your flat that makes you feel this way? A gas leak or ?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-01 00:42:59	@_BipolarManiac Thanks, I will make today as positive as possible. It's good to know you're feeling euthymic!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-08-01 00:31:48	Small victory: There was a last-minute cancellation at the dentist so I get to go for a cleaning today. I shouldn't be excited but I am.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-31 14:11:29	Just said goodbye to my good neighbor who's moving out tomorrow. Gonna miss him and his girlfriend and their cats.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-31 12:38:38	@BiggieSmalley w00t!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-31 09:47:51	@Puppy_Nibbler I like you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-31 09:45:31	@chris_mahan Me, too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-30 21:26:46	Good morning one and all!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-30 12:47:10	@burrohazard Thanks, man. I hope so, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-30 12:12:47	Two of my neighbors are moving out in a few days. I just helped them move a piece of furniture. I'm so sad to see them go.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-30 07:11:18	@schizoaffected Good night :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-30 06:49:10	@projectmonark Haven't yet read that one.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-30 06:20:09	@schizoaffected Beautiful. Almost looks like an impressionist painting. Thank you for sharing it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-30 05:32:39	@burrohazard That's very creepy indeed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-30 04:19:38	@projectmonark That's a good book.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-30 04:19:00	@chercolvin Sorry you're feeling down. I'll be thinking of you and hoping things turn around quickly.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-30 02:36:30	@burrohazard You can do it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-29 23:15:32	@chris_mahan Have a good day, Chris!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-29 10:17:49	@Puppy_Nibbler Whatever it takes!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-29 07:06:02	@Puppy_Nibbler You've done well to let it out.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-29 04:57:12	@BiggieSmalley I want to do this too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-29 04:41:02	@Puppy_Nibbler I'm sorry you're feeling down.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-29 04:36:20	@Puppy_Nibbler How may we help?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-29 03:49:25	Went to the dentist for the first time in two years. Fortunate to not need any work done. Thankful that my Dad instilled good habits.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-28 00:39:56	@Thee_noise How do you mean?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-28 00:35:22	@brightonbipolar It's admirable that you push yourself to visit your mother despite how hard it can be.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-28 00:33:54	@schizoaffected I say: Who needs them!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-28 00:23:54	So I'll be writing more. I hope you enjoy the musings.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-28 00:17:04	@alwaysunstable Thanks for sharing this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-27 23:49:07	It has come to my attention that I've been quiet.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-27 23:42:40	@brightonbipolar Thank you! That's very kind of you. I'll try to act like I have more of a pulse ;-D
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-27 21:29:32	Good morning one and all. Let's make today a good one.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-27 21:26:39	@brightonbipolar Thank you for asking :-) I'm ok, just haven't been in much of a talkative mood.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-27 11:55:11	@JulieBipolar Thanks! I believe in you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-27 11:54:01	@HCApeggy I'm so sorry. Best wishes for a speedy recovery.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-25 05:52:04	@_CongoRilla_ I'll take the blame for being to quick to report.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-25 05:42:02	@_CongoRilla_ Why apologize?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-25 05:37:29	@_CongoRilla_ Reported her. Sorry you're being targeted.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-25 05:06:58	@TweetLilLatina Worth a shot!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-25 01:40:50	@KristinaBipolar I appreciate the admonishment! Took my meds last night, got a good night's sleep, & I feel much better than I have of late.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-24 23:31:19	@leah_michal I'm sorry this happened.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-24 06:46:31	@KristinaBipolar I feel the exact same way.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-24 06:23:56	@burrohazard I agree that this seems to be the best option.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-24 01:51:56	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm so glad!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-22 06:37:28	@Yeah_Screw_It To me "large" sounds concerning.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-22 06:35:47	@Yeah_Screw_It Are you thinking of getting it checked out just in case?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-22 01:10:59	@_BipolarManiac Thanks :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-22 01:08:49	@_BipolarManiac I'm ok. Could be better. Could definitely be worse. Thank you for asking :-)

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 22:18:29	@brightonbipolar Great!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 22:08:29	@LePetiteNYC @leah_michal Agree with you both. Dysphoric mania is no fun.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 10:29:04	@burrohazard So glad you're now able to get medical care.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 09:48:42	@burrohazard Shit
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 07:10:48	@BiggieSmalley "In Da Club" bumming change.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 04:47:29	I work next to someone who's often on personal calls, plays music too loudly, etc. Last week I learned: they're moving to a diff cubicle!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 02:54:29	@Lababup How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 02:43:07	@tonetalk Sorry, Tony. Funny image.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 02:29:48	@DailyBipolar Don't mention it! It's a great acrostic :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 02:29:11	@DailyBipolar Thanks. I was really upset with myself. It's very fortunate that I didn't delete something more complicated.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 01:56:35	@SageSilk I want something else. Like strong pain-killers.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 01:41:09	@SageSilk Did so last night. Didn't help anything.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 01:26:35	@chercolvin Congratulations!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-14 01:23:30	@NicsVoice @Stephobski Congratulations!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-13 23:59:29	This morning I replicated the files, and fixed a web-crawling script; all in under an hour! I think this calls for some kind of celebration.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-13 23:58:08	Last Friday I inadvertently deleted a few not-so-important files. This is the first time I can recall doing something bone-headed like this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-13 23:30:52	@brightonbipolar Sorry to hear that. Caffeineeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-13 23:16:21	I feel very lucky to have the best Twitter friends a guy could ask for. Have a great day everyone.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-13 23:11:56	@BiggieSmalley Sorry to hear this. I'll send her a tweet of support.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-13 23:09:40	@chris_mahan Good morning!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-13 23:07:17	@burrohazard Better than yesterday, thank you for asking :-) How are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-13 12:20:32	@leah_michal The routine might help...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-13 11:47:02	@chercolvin Sleep well
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-13 11:18:30	I want more from life

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-11 09:42:40	@BiPolarQueen2 Ouch. I'm so sorry.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-11 04:30:50	@rabbitsoup_zola Doing alright, thank you for asking :-) Went to lunch with a friend which was nice.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-11 04:29:09	@rabbitsoup_zola Hey. Is the pigeon still in shock?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-11 00:17:00	@KingOfWeird Ha!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-11 00:09:01	@KingOfWeird Had a nightmare about crashing my car and realized I'm very glad to be alive. Happy Friday, my friend!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-11 00:06:26	@burrohazard Ah, ok. Good song though. The rest of the album ain't half bad, either. Listening to the Little Wing cover rn.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-11 00:05:23	@mleln A most toxic donkey told me to follow you so I am. Happy Friday!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-10 12:53:38	@burrohazard Fortunately, no. Sorry that you have :-/

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-10 08:45:01	@chris_mahan Sorry, Chris.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-10 05:38:01	@ThinnerSpinster Yay! I did a little bit of cleaning yesterday. Felt good.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-10 04:38:38	@rabbitsoup_zola Yay!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-10 04:04:52	@burrohazard This is great news!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-10 02:01:30	@misandrykitten I empathise because I just tweeted a horrible poem. You can labor over something for hours and still not have it quite right
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-10 01:49:32	@leah_michal I'm sorry. I know that feeling.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-10 01:26:49	@leah_michal I empathise and recognise that this is partially depression talking. Everyone we care about is to some extent an ordeal for us.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-10 01:24:51	@misandrykitten Glad to hear it! I'm doing ok so far today.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-10 01:06:33	Heavily caffeinated I'm led from bed; destined to walk the Earth bereft of mirth; what life have I come to lead? I plead

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-09 12:13:53	@chercolvin Good night and good luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-09 11:31:23	@leah_michal HUGE dissatisfier
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-09 08:25:43	@ThinnerSpinster That would be so wrong if they did: A violation of HIPAA.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-09 08:16:24	@ThinnerSpinster Psychiatrist is a kind of doctor though...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-09 08:15:02	@ThinnerSpinster Just say doctor's appointment.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-09 06:11:08	@ThinnerSpinster Yay!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-09 02:21:31	@ThinnerSpinster Yeah, I'm not sure I believe it either.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-09 02:20:51	@ThinnerSpinster I just saw your follow-up tweet.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-09 02:20:12	@ThinnerSpinster Glad it was a beneficial visit!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-09 01:04:22	@deseraestage Nice photo!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-09 00:51:07	Slept well. Feel sharper. Took all the #lamotrigine last night instead of taking half of it in the morning as I had been doing.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 23:51:43	@rabbitsoup_zola You've offended me deeply and I'll never forgive you. I'm kidding. I hope you can go swimming again today.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 22:34:19	@leah_michal Sounds like depression :-(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 22:13:56	@ThinnerSpinster You too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 13:02:39	@MerryMadness Great!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 10:54:54	@mybipolarside That sucks. Sorry to hear.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 06:45:43	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm ok, thanks. Will be better at 5 o'clock :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 06:40:13	@rabbitsoup_zola It really was a complete turnaround. Great job!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 06:39:29	@ThinnerSpinster I believe you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 05:23:02	@burrohazard Is that the store you walked to for a snack and wifi?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 04:39:53	@ThinnerSpinster @burrohazard Sorry, she's being a real mastodon about this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 04:25:14	@debecca That *is* great news. Thanks for the update.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 04:22:24	Walked around outside during lunch. Need to do that more often.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 04:16:41	@ThinnerSpinster Sacrilege!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 04:13:54	@ThinnerSpinster It does sound like you should go to the ER...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 01:47:02	@ThinnerSpinster What happens if you try to plug something in? (Maybe there are collapsible covers!?)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 01:42:15	@ThinnerSpinster Is there something you can slide to expose the other two holes?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 01:39:19	@leah_michal They have that effect on me too. Same with sobriety checkpoints.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 01:35:25	@ThinnerSpinster I like your directness lately!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 01:31:26	I'm vowing to use the word "mastodon" more often because I feel it's not used nearly enough. Sir, will you stop being such a mastodon please
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 01:27:01	@rabbitsoup_zola Good for you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 01:17:17	@_CongoRilla_ This is what it's like to be a male.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 01:16:16	Took 1mg lorazepam and still feel on edge. Trying to calm down.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-08 01:11:06	@ThinnerSpinster Ugh.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-07 21:40:59	@ThinnerSpinster Ha. Will they re-do it?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-07 12:17:31	@ThinnerSpinster I hope the study goes well!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-07 11:07:40	@zendao42 Enjoy your day
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-07 06:24:26	I've already done a lot of the work I need to do on a typical day. Often the most difficult part of a task is finding where I put the code.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-07 01:23:56	@burrohazard This is bleak.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-07 01:19:02	@ThinnerSpinster Tell us how it goes.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-07 01:16:50	@burrohazard Oh nooo. Are you still experiencing that pain?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-06 22:17:06	@SageSilk I'm ok. Thank you for asking.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-06 11:57:44	@schizoaffected Same to you!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-05 02:20:55	@BiggieSmalley You too man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-05 01:12:13	@rabbitsoup_zola I would miss your tweets.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-05 01:07:05	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm ok, thank you. I'll be thinking of you and hoping for some relief.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-05 01:04:21	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm sorry, Zola. What you're going through sounds very rough.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-05 00:47:15	@rabbitsoup_zola Will you call for help? Please.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-04 21:10:23	@NeverGivingUpp Congratulations!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-04 04:14:16	@burrohazard Hey man, doing ok. Staycation has been very relaxing. How are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-04 03:04:34	@Lyingsoothsayer Have a great time!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-04 01:24:05	@chris_mahan Aha. Looks like a spider.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-04 01:21:53	@chris_mahan Don't see it. I see your doodle though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 08:14:08	@chercolvin Welcome back!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 08:09:38	@burrohazard IMO she still should have better things to than searching for your online activity.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 08:02:13	@DailyBipolar I'm just complaining. Pay me no mind :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 08:01:18	@burrohazard Ah, that's the part I missed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 07:59:46	Took about 5 attempts to create a bootable USB stick.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 07:56:38	@burrohazard Maybe I'm wrong in thinking this was something you could have predicted, I certainly wouldn't have.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 07:51:24	@burrohazard Geez. Sorry, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 07:30:34	@RudyCaseres Sorry, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 07:28:43	@rabbitsoup_zola Great!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 03:51:00	@ThinnerSpinster Ohhh. Well sorry you're exhausted :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 03:41:44	@ThinnerSpinster I'm sorry you're sleeping poorly.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 03:24:47	@rabbitsoup_zola Sorry people suck.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 02:46:59	@rabbitsoup_zola Well FWIW your courage is inspiring to me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 02:42:16	@rabbitsoup_zola On behalf of men I apologise.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 02:19:31	@zendao42 Good luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-03 02:18:57	@rabbitsoup_zola Haha. You can do it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-02 23:46:18	@rabbitsoup_zola You're not! We love you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-02 23:38:34	@koalaalltheway I need to abide by this too.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-02 04:28:47	@drivelhe4d How awkward. Do they then walk away?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-02 04:13:34	Thankful for today's cloud cover.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-02 02:25:38	Gotta get out of the apartment. Going to get a burrito then maybe to see a movie.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-02 02:24:52	@martyn666arts Happens to us all from time to time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-02 02:07:35	@leah_michal Don't feel so good myself. It'll pass though. Thank you for asking.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-02 02:04:01	@martyn666arts Don't beat yourself up about it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-02 02:03:34	@leah_michal Sorry, Lisa. I'll be thinking of you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-02 01:45:14	@burrohazard Can you take more klonopin?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-02 00:07:28	@KingOfWeird @tornmad I liked it as well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-01 23:44:21	@tornmad I enjoyed reading it. Reminded me I'm not alone.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-01 23:40:14	@chris_mahan Sorry, man. That sounds tortuous.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-01 23:37:04	@tornmad Really sorry this happened man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-01 23:25:35	@tornmad Oh noooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-01 09:03:02	@BiggieSmalley Glad you got out!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-01 08:35:08	@BekaLombardo Will do!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-01 06:43:46	@EOTierney What happened if I may ask?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-07-01 06:15:50	@Blueeyedfoxie Congratulations!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-29 13:36:50	@tornmad It was a good day, relaxing. Have a date Tuesday night. Will tell you how it goes.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-29 13:33:26	@tornmad Thanks man. Too warm to sleep down here. How's the weather up there?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-29 12:55:48	@yaimiana Impressive vocals. Thanks for sharing.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-29 09:57:58	@leah_michal In all seriousness, skateboards *are* exceptionally noisy.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-29 04:42:42	@ThinnerSpinster Dropped my phone yesterday. Fortunately it just resulted in a scratch.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-29 04:29:44	@ThinnerSpinster Haha! Exactly :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-29 03:49:29	@Trotter_99 Oh no. How long until you can get more?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-29 03:31:40	@chercolvin Practical is easier for me too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-29 03:27:19	@chercolvin Best of luck!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-28 00:49:28	@schizoaffected You all are fortunate to have internet while in hospital. Such was not the case for me here in the States.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-28 00:48:38	@BiggieSmalley I'll be hoping so too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-27 23:03:43	@tornmad You too!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-27 10:08:38	Drinking coffee. Remember this if I complain about not being able to sleep later.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-27 09:22:54	@aurelgil Wow!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-27 07:21:49	I'm off of work this coming week and I've got no plans. Should be a relaxing several days.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-27 00:45:06	@Schizo_Ellie Hey Ellie, haven't heard from you in a while. How have you been?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-27 00:03:00	@tornmad Thanks! Ordered. Awesome that they accept PayPal.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 23:52:56	@tornmad Thanks. I'll see about ordering it as it's not in my local library -- though another of his is (titled Bipolar II).

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 05:24:08	@alwaysunstable Happy Birthday!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 04:15:50	@KingOfWeird Haven't heard from @catpr0n in a minute...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 02:51:36	Co-worker chose to use R over Python. As an avid user of Python I'm mildly miffed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 02:45:42	@_BipolarManiac Good for you!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 02:35:41	@BiggieSmalley Glad you're ok, and Happy Birthday!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 02:23:12	My eye has recovered from this morning's malaise!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 02:17:04	@beth_1day Sorry, Beth. This sounds really rough.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 01:32:24	@ThinnerSpinster Oh, THIS is what normal people feel like...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 01:29:10	@ThinnerSpinster Oh, I'm so glad. So far my day is good. Thank you for asking :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 01:22:49	@ThinnerSpinster Aw, you guys are so caring. It's just a little dry or something. It's mostly better now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 01:18:13	@alwaysunstable Sorry, that sucks.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 01:10:42	@tornmad How's your day so far?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 00:28:34	@schizoaffected Congrats!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 00:15:48	@tornmad Thanks, it's ok I'm just whining.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-26 00:00:36	Pushing through the day with or without the unimpeded services of my left eye.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 23:50:21	Out of bed for two hours and my left eye has yet to embrace the day. Two people have asserted I'm sauced and one thought my wink got stuck.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 21:49:10	@KingOfWeird Mornin' Sir!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 12:24:19	@KingOfWeird Haha :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 12:19:24	@BekaLombardo Oh, nothing :-D
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 12:18:38	Against my better judgment I showered.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 12:15:24	@BekaLombardo Ha :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 11:12:36	While it wasn't the best movie it certainly wasn't the worst. Thanks for propping it up, Sam Rockwell and Joe Mantegna.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 11:07:14	@schizoaffected Ouch. Good luck.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 09:35:52	@_BipolarManiac Doing ok. Thank you for asking :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 09:35:06	@ThinnerSpinster Yikes!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 08:53:29	@rabbitsoup_zola Yikes!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 08:52:50	@ThinnerSpinster Well ok, so long as you're laughing :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 07:28:13	@ThinnerSpinster Sorry to hear this. How are you feeling now?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 06:17:30	@BiggieSmalley In case I forget tomorrow... Happy birthday!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 06:00:35	@tornmad I apologize for imagining you with your radio huddling over a fire in a lean-to scooping beans out of a can.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 05:02:58	@KingOfWeird Enjoy it while it lasts!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 04:29:07	@Trotter_99 Sleep well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 04:28:42	@_CongoRilla_ Sorry. What you're going through sounds rough. (And I know you're not fishing.)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 01:42:18	@Time2VentKV Glad you don't have a headache.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 01:42:01	@chercolvin See you in a bit.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-25 00:57:32	@tornmad I'm hoping you'll have a good day, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 12:41:02	@alwaysunstable I'd miss reading your tweets.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 12:39:42	@karyn_d lol
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 12:38:42	@schizoaffected My night's just beginning! I'll be hoping for sleep as good as yours!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 12:36:10	@schizoaffected So glad you slept well!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 12:25:59	@tornmad Welcome back!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 09:19:29	@leah_michal Glad to know you're feeling better. Best wishes for a smooth day tomorrow.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 08:56:20	@BipolarWhisper Yeah!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 06:36:41	@Rivkah_g I'll be thinking of you and hoping you can fall asleep.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 06:28:18	A co-worker suggested I try coffee and hot chocolate. That turns out to be an excellent idea.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 03:01:20	@SageSilk I'm so glad it's subsiding.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 01:47:09	@150pride Can't complain. How are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 01:46:27	@beth_1day Welcome back!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-24 01:11:04	@yaimiana Sorry that the exercise didn't work :-(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 23:21:38	@Stwutter "Game of Bores" is exactly right.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 20:13:53	@chris_mahan Good morning and welcome back!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 12:17:30	@Jonode You're on a roll!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 11:41:44	I've taken longer showers than the battery life of this bluetooth speaker.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 11:39:45	@_CongoRilla_ I was kinda just kidding. In all the time I've followed u I never saw u go on vacation so it was nice to see. Do it more often
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 11:10:49	@_CongoRilla_ Thank GOD
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 08:57:13	@BipolarWhisper Sorry to hear :-(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 08:41:08	Wish I could remember which films.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 08:40:44	Been noticing some gratuitous tire-screeching in a few films of late.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 07:18:08	@ThinnerSpinster Haha, no. It's good to know you're ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 07:17:34	@ThinnerSpinster Hm, this is a bit concerning...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 07:13:30	@ThinnerSpinster Well, ok. Glad you're enjoying it :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 07:12:32	@ThinnerSpinster Thanks for asking. I'm ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 07:12:07	@ThinnerSpinster Oh nooo. Have you spoken with your providers about this?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 07:00:14	Half an hour left at work then to the gym to row -- and lift some weights if I'm up to it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 07:00:05	@ThinnerSpinster Hey, haven't heard from you in a while. How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 06:18:11	@_CongoRilla_ It's courageous of you to bare your soul like this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 06:16:21	@thelistenerd Thanks for stirring fond memories of reading box scores over cereal.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 02:55:24	@chercolvin Great job!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 02:09:56	Slept 10 hours last night. Felt good.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 02:07:35	I'm thankful for our MH community here on Twitter.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 01:56:07	@NicsVoice Sorry, Nic.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 01:40:35	@leah_michal Please don't be hard on yourself. You need time to recover.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-23 00:01:57	@Lyingsoothsayer Happy birthday!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 23:31:06	@leah_michal Best of luck at the doctor.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 23:01:33	@chris_mahan Have a good flight!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 22:58:10	@Lyingsoothsayer I'd say neither so you can sleep well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 21:25:27	Good morning beautiful people! Have a great week.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 10:21:51	@tweety123pie Oh nooo. So sorry. I'll be thinking of you and wishing for a full and swift recovery.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 10:03:42	@tweety123pie Thanks for asking! I'm fine. What happened to your foot?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 09:28:23	@tweety123pie Sorry, Tweety.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 03:01:04	Watching "Bridesmaids"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 01:52:07	@biposcarwrites Hey, welcome back.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 01:41:34	At the gym trying to shake off these blues.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 01:08:36	@EverythingCatTO Happy weekend to you too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 00:39:39	@yaimiana Not too close to bedtime.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-22 00:12:05	@yaimiana See if you can exhaust yourself with exercise.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-21 12:15:29	@leah_michal Ugh. Sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-21 06:23:31	@zendao42 See you when you get back.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-21 01:37:35	@Lababup Haven't heard from you in a while, how are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-20 05:25:03	@BiggieSmalley What meds are those?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-20 05:03:27	Our thoughts, our desires Our wants, our deeds Broadcast over wires Showing up in feeds
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-20 02:43:56	@BekaLombardo Congratulations!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-20 01:29:08	@BipolarWhisper Welcome back!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-19 23:55:28	@KingOfWeird @BeautifulMined Sending love and positivity.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-19 04:12:24	@chercolvin Congratulations!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-19 04:08:40	@ThinnerSpinster I'm glad it helps!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-19 02:13:27	@SageSilk Are you considering asking for help? Your thoughts of self-harm could be enough to warrant inpatient admission.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-19 02:09:38	@SageSilk I'm sorry. This sounds really rough.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-19 00:01:40	@BiggieSmalley So glad to hear this!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 23:31:00	@_BipolarManiac Glad you're enjoying the day so far. I'm doing well, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 09:48:12	@ThinnerSpinster Sorry. That sucks.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 07:49:04	About to see the psychologist. I feel like I have nothing to talk about.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 06:59:58	@alwaysunstable Does your treatment change at all because of that?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 06:58:26	@KristinaBipolar In case that was directed at me I apologise and will desist.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 06:36:45	@yaimiana Longest manic episode I had was a few months.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 06:35:49	Tangible: (adj) edible when paired with a tangerine. #humor
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 05:45:55	@KristinaBipolar So far so good. Thank you for asking.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 05:41:18	@KristinaBipolar So glad you had a relatively good day!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 05:07:31	@imillnotcrazy Thanks for sharing your art. I friend requested.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 03:25:51	@schizoaffected Sending positivity your way. See you when you get back.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 03:09:02	@chercolvin Best of luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-18 00:57:45	@koalaalltheway Good job!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-17 22:36:24	@leah_michal Try not to beat yourself up about it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-17 22:07:26	@leah_michal Oh nooo. I'm sorry to hear this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-17 21:55:30	@leah_michal I feel ok. Thank you for asking. How are you? Still hypomanic?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-17 21:17:40	Good morning to all of you good people.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-17 05:25:08	@KingOfWeird Welcome back!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-17 02:44:29	@chercolvin Best of luck getting there!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-17 02:36:45	@chercolvin Likewise!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-17 02:02:31	@elledanmarie Sorry, D. I hope this feeling subsides soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-17 01:39:00	@schizoaffected Best of luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 22:35:31	@_BipolarManiac Glad to hear it! Mine is too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 21:43:10	Good morning, All. For those in other time zones: How is your day going?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 21:38:40	@debecca Congratulations on the house!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 21:32:19	@zendao42 I'll be hoping so as well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 10:27:16	@NeesaSunar Excellent!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 06:34:21	@NeesaSunar Best wishes for a smooth transition!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 04:47:05	@schizoaffected Good call. I'll be looking forward to your return.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 04:03:10	@chercolvin Enjoy your break.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 02:21:52	@chercolvin Ha! Didn't notice that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 02:09:49	A scheduled task is taking forever to run. Turning to Twitter to occupy me until it's done.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 02:02:43	@chercolvin Good luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 01:38:09	@ThinnerSpinster I'm sorry things are so rough.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 00:39:46	@_BipolarManiac aripiprazole and lamotrigine.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-16 00:29:05	@Blueeyedfoxie Under an hour is great!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 23:46:52	Little things can sometimes bother me. A doorknob in my building was loose for a while. I finally got around to tightening it this morning.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 21:29:55	Monday is a morass of mourning; the funeral of the weekend that was.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 20:51:36	I'm glad to say I feel much better than I did yesterday.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 20:44:00	Good morning Good People.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 12:19:18	@alwaysunstable I agree: therapy's a drag. I go for my family's peace of mind.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 12:16:54	@zendao42 Thanks. It's gone now :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 08:03:38	@KristinaBipolar Sounds like dysphoric mania.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 08:02:41	@KristinaBipolar Well described.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 07:02:51	Argh. Just asked a tough question that needed to be asked.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 03:52:38	Got out of the apartment to a world full of sunshine. It's a nice change after some overcast days.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 02:33:22	@leah_michal A bit of hypomania never hurt anyone.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-15 02:31:57	@zendao42 I'm it. It's not too bad though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-14 22:42:44	@trioformind Congratulations!!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-14 17:27:56	@zendao42 Hello & welcome back!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-14 06:59:07	Carnival across the street and I've a massive appetite for a churro.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-14 05:15:32	Carnival across the street and I'm not invited.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-14 04:04:50	Jogged three miles for no apparent reason.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-13 17:47:26	@Blueeyedfoxie Oh nooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-13 13:14:49	LA Pride! starts today. Be safe and have fun out there.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-13 12:21:08	Just saw and enjoyed "Hector and the Search for Happiness"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-13 11:38:44	@zendao42 Hope to see you Sunday!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-13 10:51:07	@alwaysunstable Trivializing, too :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-13 10:16:47	@XERO_360 Enjoy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-13 06:35:06	@blogpolar Sleep well!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-13 00:00:41	@bmwgirlnrc Happy Friday to you, too!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-12 21:59:24	Happy Friday everyone!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-12 08:19:10	@NeesaSunar Congratulations on reversing the drug-induced gains!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-12 03:59:53	@tweety123pie Hey, T. I'm alright. How are you this evening?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-12 02:12:15	@chercolvin Doing alright. How are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-12 00:48:20	@JulieBipolar Thank you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-12 00:46:17	@JulieBipolar Interesting! Can you give an example?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-12 00:33:32	Non-standard CSV files -- commas in the middle of fields -- putting a little dent in my mood this morning.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 21:41:14	@SageSilk Yay!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 12:47:13	@MerryMadness Yikes! Glad you're ok.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 12:21:34	@RudyCaseres I'll be thinking of you and hoping for the best.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 12:19:58	As I get accustomed to Abilify I find I can switch from decaf back to regular coffee. Happy about that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 09:13:47	@chercolvin You're in luck! Ten left jabs on your behalf. (My right wrist is kinda meh these days.)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 09:04:59	Was feeling really anxious. Feeling better now at the gym.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 06:52:45	@carleykoko Have fun if you go!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 06:17:54	@chris_mahan Good morning!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 04:15:50	@ThinnerSpinster Fortunately things are ok over here. Thank you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 01:40:36	@Schizo_Ellie I'm glad they're erring on the side of caution.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 01:14:44	@ThinnerSpinster Sorry. I'm hoping things turn around for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 01:01:18	Oh dear cubicle neighbor It's much to my dismay That you find reason for Thinking aloud all day
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 00:58:24	@alwaysunstable I feel the same way about my psychiatrist. She's a much better therapist than my therapist.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-11 00:16:37	@martyn666arts Sorry to hear this. I'll be hoping for a swift and full recovery.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-10 23:53:37	@Lababup Good luck. Are you planning to take a benzo beforehand?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-10 23:24:50	@Time2VentKV I'm sorry. I'll be hoping things turn around soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-10 23:02:00	@Schizo_Ellie Best wishes for a productive visit. Tell us how it goes.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-10 21:31:42	Good morning Good People of Twitter.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-10 07:44:30	@alwaysunstable Glad to hear it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-10 06:45:11	@tweety123pie That's terrible. I'm so glad you made it through without incident.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-10 02:47:27	@chercolvin Enjoy the break!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-10 01:14:34	@imillnotcrazy Best wishes for a productive visit.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-10 00:14:46	Lovely overcast weather in Pasadena this morning. Hoping it continues.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 23:05:22	@ThinnerSpinster Worth a shot.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 23:04:13	@ThinnerSpinster Oh I see.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 23:01:38	@ThinnerSpinster Maybe you could try calling the bank...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 12:43:57	@alwaysunstable Best wishes for a productive visit. Tell us how it went.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 12:26:40	@BipolarWhisper So glad to hear that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 11:23:23	@BipolarWhisper How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 11:23:03	@BipolarWhisper Doing ok, thank you. Instructed today to titrate up from 20mg to 30 daily of aripiprazole.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 10:29:03	@ThinnerSpinster Sorry it's been rough. I'm glad you have a car again!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 07:09:27	@KristinaBipolar Aside from some initial restlessness I now don't get side-effects from aripiprazole.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 05:52:47	@aurelgil Wow! It's that hot here in Southern California.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 05:40:04	@Schizo_Ellie Much better! What're ya gonna get?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 05:24:36	Had a good visit. Advised to increase Abilify from 20mg to 25 to 30 over a couple of weeks. That's supposed to relieve anxiety, depression.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 02:09:28	@SageSilk That sounds like a terrible dilemma.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 01:59:33	Psych appointment in an hour. Gonna ask for buspirone and a sleep medication as I continue to not sleep so well. #bipolar
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-09 01:00:29	@alwaysunstable Mine too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-08 23:27:14	@worldharv Ouch! Sorry that happened.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-08 21:20:06	@DailyBipolar anytime! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-08 12:56:28	@SageSilk Morning. I'm sorry to hear this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-07 00:36:11	@KingOfWeird Sorry, man. I'm hoping your day gets better.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-06 22:47:22	@Lyingsoothsayer That's terrible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-06 03:40:05	@schizoaffected Those look amazing.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-06 01:46:54	Can't stand when people on conference calls who aren't speaking don't mute their phones.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-05 08:38:32	@ThinnerSpinster I'm glad you'll soon have a new car.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-05 08:27:16	@debecca I'm hoping they respond quickly.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-05 05:23:04	@drivelhe4d you'll never know
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-05 01:33:38	@SageSilk What are the chances you can get another consultant?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-05 00:44:52	@NicsVoice Ha!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-05 00:31:47	@NicsVoice Wow! Great news :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-05 00:13:38	@imillnotcrazy Please go easier on yourself, L.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 23:51:01	Noodled on a programming problem for at least a week, trying different things. Finally had success this morning. Need to celebrate somehow.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 23:31:41	@SageSilk Thank you. How are you doing lately?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 22:59:08	Glad to be alive for the first time in a good while. Make it a good day everyone.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 13:16:04	@ThinnerSpinster Good night. I hope tomorrow's not as rough.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 11:07:04	@ThinnerSpinster So sorry. I hope this feeling passes soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 07:47:40	@tweety123pie I feel pretty good for a change; the depression is lifting. Thank you for asking :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 07:42:13	@tweety123pie Mine are accessible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 06:53:57	@KristinaBipolar Thanks for sharing this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 05:59:32	@leah_michal Try to concentrate on something other than your body.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 05:07:01	A guy by the name of Oscar (w/ bipolar) was having medication withdrawal issues and now disappeared from Twitter. Does anyone here know him?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 03:50:08	@zzzedkat I had that side-effect from risperidone, not lamotrigine.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 03:34:36	@chercolvin Sounds like a splendid idea.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 03:20:09	@biposcarwrites I see. I'm sorry. I wish things were different.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 03:17:52	@biposcarwrites This is against medical advice, right? I beg you to reconsider.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 03:15:51	@biposcarwrites You've run out of meds?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 03:15:33	@biposcarwrites Here.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 01:54:00	@debecca Best of luck.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 00:43:31	@debecca That could simply be depression talking.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 00:26:09	There's an awful lot of Monday in this Wednesday.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-04 00:24:40	@serpentgrr Sorry, Ash. I hope these feelings and habits pass soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-03 06:38:13	@Blueeyedfoxie Great news!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-03 03:40:00	@ThinnerSpinster That sucks. Sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-03 03:39:30	@ThinnerSpinster I have one but shouldn't leave early.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-03 03:13:01	Just found out it's National Leave the Office Earlier Day.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-02 23:47:24	@elledanmarie The IE has taken a dive since you left. Used to be a nice, quaint place.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-02 23:36:22	@elledanmarie Sorry, D. Hoping the feeling passes soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-02 23:35:58	How.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-02 23:25:23	@martyn666arts Good on ya!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-02 23:21:45	How can it only be Tuesday...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-02 21:26:17	@zzzedkat No need to apologize. That's why Twitter is here.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-02 21:24:46	@koalaalltheway Best of luck, Anna.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-02 11:30:39	@alwaysunstable Sorry, Meghan. I hope the feeling passes soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-02 02:01:53	@ThinnerSpinster I'm very glad to hear that!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-01 22:47:50	Good morning one and all. Let's make this a good week.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-01 05:43:47	@SocietyBasement Uf. Sorry. Not a good feeling at all.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-01 04:24:40	@NicsVoice Sorry, Nic. I hope you get some relief soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-01 03:31:49	@SocietyBasement Haha. Doing ok. How 'bout you and yours?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-01 00:34:05	@ThinnerSpinster Ugh. I'm so sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-06-01 00:15:05	@imillnotcrazy Yes, AFAIK. I'm sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-31 08:48:02	@TimeTravelnMan Haha. Good one :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-31 08:47:40	@EmoVoid Nice!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-31 05:49:56	@MaryRachelleC I agree completely.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-30 09:46:41	@ThinnerSpinster I have faith in you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-30 05:56:28	@casketscratcher Just saw this. That's so terrible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-30 05:55:50	@casketscratcher Sleep well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-30 05:40:45	@NicsVoice Sorry, Nic :-( I know the feeling well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-30 04:41:55	@schizoaffected The rest of us love you and would be sad to see you go.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-29 23:46:06	Tried Benadryl for sleep issues. Didn't seem to work. Finally resorted to the old stand-by: trazodone. Happy Friday to one and all.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-29 23:44:30	@chris_mahan We forgive you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-29 23:35:44	@SageSilk Glad you're feeling well, if only momentarily. I'm hoping it'll be more than a fleeting thing.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-29 06:05:46	Surprised myself by relatively quickly converting a program for writing data to Excel to use the xlsxwriter module instead of openpyxl.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-28 23:53:19	@NicsVoice Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-28 12:05:09	@KristinaBipolar Which have you tried?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-28 06:23:00	@ThinnerSpinster Ha. Well I'm glad things are progressing.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-28 06:00:14	@ThinnerSpinster How are you doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-28 05:04:38	And I'm continuing to ingest a steady stream of coffee. How's your day going?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-28 04:57:41	@TimeTravelnMan Ha :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-28 04:07:27	@deseraestage That's a favorite for journaling not for the attempt.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-28 03:45:39	@imillnotcrazy Congrats!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-28 00:36:13	@NAMICommunicate ...getting a 404 error at that link.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-27 08:32:06	@ThinnerSpinster Thanks, it's ok. I'm used to it :-D
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-27 06:16:50	@chris_mahan Sorry, man. I feel your pain.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-27 05:08:28	@Blueeyedfoxie Not even fox ears!?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-27 04:53:52	@tweety123pie That's a very astute observation!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-27 04:39:12	@tweety123pie Thank you, Tweety :-) If things get worse I'll pop a lorazepam.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-27 04:19:19	@KingOfWeird Hehehe. Thanks for that!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-27 04:16:56	Tenuous: my hold on sanity this afternoon.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-27 00:39:06	@BeautifulMined Sage advice.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-26 06:54:03	@tweety123pie Sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-26 06:01:20	@leah_michal Best of luck getting back into the swing.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-25 23:20:23	@Lyingsoothsayer Yay!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-25 11:12:30	@BipolarWhisper Oh nooo. I hope you have some medication which can knock the mania down a notch or two.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-25 02:04:27	@Time2VentKV Sorry. I know that feeling well.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-24 03:47:52	@ThinnerSpinster Ugh I'm so sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-23 23:16:59	@ThinnerSpinster You're excused due to very tough circumstances.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-23 06:22:03	@tweety123pie Cannot complain. Glad for a holiday weekend coming up here in the States.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-23 01:21:20	@chris_mahan Thanks, man. I can't complain. Great job on the poetry you've been posting. Keep it coming.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-23 01:13:02	@KingOfWeird Someone once asked me, "So were there 5 Big Hero movies before this one?"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-23 00:17:45	@KristinaBipolar Ugh.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-23 00:06:34	@KristinaBipolar That's terrible. I'm sorry that happened.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 23:46:48	@chris_mahan Mornin' Sir!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 23:27:41	Let's make it a good day everyone.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 23:27:39	@KingOfWeird @BeautifulMined Hey, congrats!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 23:26:43	@KingOfWeird Doing alright. Thanks for asking. How about you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 23:23:13	@KingOfWeird Hey Hey
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 11:15:39	@ThinnerSpinster It would take a LOT to OD. Having said that maybe just wait until tomorrow to take more.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 09:32:31	Been to the gym every day so far this week. Still have a bit of a gut.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 08:48:18	@ThinnerSpinster Ugh that cannot be fun.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 03:09:24	@Lyingsoothsayer Best of luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 01:13:58	@leah_michal So sorry, Lisa.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 00:55:17	@ThinnerSpinster I'm so sorry. This was the last thing you needed right now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 00:49:34	@ThinnerSpinster I'm glad you ordered food. Your body definitely needs it right now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-22 00:48:44	@ThinnerSpinster Anecdotally I've heard that the long-term effects of a car accident can be worse than the initial symptoms.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-21 10:45:48	@recovery_pati I like that!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-21 07:47:30	@tweety123pie Thank you! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-21 06:11:58	@bipolarvoice Sorry. Being physically ill is no fun.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-21 04:50:45	@ThinnerSpinster Sorry, you have my deepest sympathy.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-21 03:06:13	@SocietyBasement Can't complain! How are you, Sir?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-21 01:17:39	@SocietyBasement Hey hey!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-20 13:50:23	@ThinnerSpinster Oh noooo.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-20 05:25:25	@Time2VentKV Keep holding on.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-19 05:08:21	@tweety123pie Can you go home? To the market? To a friend's?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-19 01:03:51	Missed a dose yesterday. Feeling pretty stable. Yay for long half-lives.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-19 00:50:39	@schizoaffected Glad to hear it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-19 00:00:44	@zzzedkat I've had this feeling. Sorry to hear you're having it, too.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-18 21:52:34	@Time2VentKV Best wishes for a productive visit.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-18 21:42:54	@Schizo_Ellie Oh I'm so sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-18 21:41:03	@Schizo_Ellie I'll be hoping for the best.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-18 21:39:58	@chris_mahan Good morning!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-18 11:27:58	@ThinnerSpinster G'night!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-18 09:21:21	@ThinnerSpinster Quinoa you'll not soon forget! I've made the same mistake many times.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-18 08:30:17	@MaryRachelleC :-(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-18 08:29:39	@Time2VentKV I'll be thinking of you. Report back when you can.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-18 02:33:47	@WeakJoke Nice one!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-18 02:33:17	@Time2VentKV Sorry. I know that feeling all too well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-18 00:56:20	@leah_michal Haha. Wth.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-17 21:43:22	@MaryRachelleC I'm so sorry. What you're going through sounds terrible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-17 21:38:29	@casketscratcher Glad you're relatively ok. Sorry 'bout the noggin.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-17 04:50:24	@unsuicide Good on ya!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-17 04:48:55	@KristinaBipolar I've never had any tics during mania. I have Bipolar Type I.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-17 02:45:26	Just spent some time without Internet. Very glad to have it working again.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-17 02:44:39	@martyn666arts Sorry it's not working. Best of luck returning it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-17 01:25:14	@debecca Uf. Sorry to hear.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-17 00:12:41	@Midnight_Chat Very glad to hear that!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-17 00:01:12	My med cocktail might finally be right: I feel fine. Hoping this lasts.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 09:42:02	@SageSilk Sorry, Sagey.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 09:35:45	Trying to abstain from alcohol at least for today. It's tougher than it looks.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 08:58:00	@milkjunkie23 Who's Laura?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 04:14:16	@debecca Sorry you feel that way. I do too. I just took some lorazepam.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 03:55:03	@biposcarwrites Glad you got it out.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 03:35:38	@biposcarwrites One of my favourite songs.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 03:33:58	@biposcarwrites Sorry, Oscar. I enjoy your tweets.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 02:48:03	@_CongoRilla_ Aw, shucks :D

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 02:09:57	#ff @burrohazard For multiple reasons including his vast knowledge of music.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 02:02:25	@schizoaffected Wow. Sorry to hear that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 01:32:41	Two and three-quarter hours to debug a problem caused by unexpected database output. Sigh.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-16 01:08:16	@martyn666arts That's rather unfortunate. Can you return it?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-15 23:56:34	@thatAndrewC Welcome back!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-15 11:27:13	@_CongoRilla_ Can't believe they haven't been deactivated yet.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-15 11:25:15	@schizoaffected I'm happy and sad for you at the same time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-15 08:32:52	@KristinaBipolar And what a story it was. Thank you for sharing it with us.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-15 02:18:22	@burrohazard You're on a roll today.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-15 00:14:45	@burrohazard Hahah. My first time hearing this term...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-14 23:54:41	Good morning one and all from drizzly Southern California where the rain is desperately needed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-14 23:48:05	@debecca What a refreshing thing.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-14 06:03:53	@rabbitsoup_zola Green.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-14 05:49:35	@rabbitsoup_zola We love you, Zolster.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-14 02:51:10	@KingOfWeird I took a whole pill. I'll try a half tonight.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-14 02:49:47	@leah_michal Yeah I slept a good eight hours.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-14 00:52:42	If anyone needs me I'll be loitering at Hometown Buffet.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-14 00:44:57	Went back on the trazodone last night. Couldn't afford another night of poor sleep.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-14 00:35:52	@_CongoRilla_ Does "Ravishing" earn me partial points? (This is my imaginary dog, btw.)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-13 23:41:44	@zzzedkat Very glad to hear that!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-13 23:25:25	@SocietyBasement For the record, you've never offended me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-13 04:48:31	@schizoaffected Good night.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-13 02:22:25	@burrohazard That's a good idea. Cold turkey was a mistake.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-13 01:56:01	Last night was my second consecutive night without trazodone. I've been sleeping poorly and waking up often. Might have to go back on it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 23:06:43	@ThinnerSpinster I know that feeling well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 23:05:38	@Schizo_Ellie How are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 23:05:17	@Schizo_Ellie Thanks, Ellie. I'm doing alright. Fairly successfully weaning myself off of trazodone because it makes me too drowsy.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 10:37:27	@burrohazard And a pleasant evening to you too, Sir.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 10:32:51	@recovery_pati I'd say don't use your real name if you're at all concerned about stigma negatively affecting your career or life in general.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 06:43:07	@rabbitsoup_zola Agreed! I'm ok. Still trying to get accustomed to Abilify.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 06:41:53	@_CongoRilla_ Sorry they've nothing better to do than harass. Reported and blocked.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 06:37:09	@rabbitsoup_zola Sorry, Zolster. That sounds rough.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 06:01:10	Your grammar so l33t you should call it your gr4mm4r. Derp. https:// twitter.com/KingOfWeird/st atus/597880892896456705 …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 02:49:51	@burrohazard @ThinnerSpinster Thanks! Talk to you soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 02:43:02	@ThinnerSpinster @burrohazard For a limited time only.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 02:22:19	@PanicDisordered Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 02:15:52	@koalaalltheway Oh I see. I've also encountered this kind of attitude in emergency rooms.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 02:15:05	@burrohazard Good to see you, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 02:12:47	@koalaalltheway Ha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 02:11:29	@koalaalltheway This person should not be working in the mental health field.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 02:10:55	@koalaalltheway Yeah, she has no idea what you're going through.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-12 00:15:08	@schizorama_ I'm right there with you. Hang in there!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-11 09:07:46	@ThinnerSpinster Wow, that's wonderful!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-11 08:57:53	@SocietyBasement I also like "Hands" by The Ting Tings.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-11 08:16:54	@SocietyBasement I like "Sweet Emotion" by Aerosmith the best of that group of ditties.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-11 07:40:02	@Blueeyedfoxie Makes no sense save in the illogic of the bottle.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-11 07:39:28	@ThinnerSpinster I'm glad he called.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-11 07:18:56	@Blueeyedfoxie Sorry, Foxie. That sounds rather rough. I think they should warn you next time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-11 01:11:51	@ThinnerSpinster Ditto! And happy momma's day to you too (Abby).
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-10 11:26:19	@leah_michal Great job!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-10 10:32:27	Could really use a drink.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-10 10:31:48	@ThinnerSpinster U ok?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-10 02:31:19	@KingOfWeird Ayooo, wassup?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-10 01:46:32	@imillnotcrazy Don't beat yourself up. We all have those days.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-09 23:46:18	Entertaining tune: "Audacity of Huge" by Simian Mobile Disco http:// open.spotify.com/track/7A4hUAE3 3LMKn7r8Lsuyeg …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-09 23:43:07	Forced myself to go to the gym this morning. Feels good to exert myself. Still having to force myself to finish the workout. Such is life.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-09 23:16:50	@rabbitsoup_zola Where we going? (Kidding)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-09 22:39:14	@imillnotcrazy That's alright. We do what we can.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-09 22:37:20	@zzzedkat I'm hoping for the best!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-09 07:16:30	@schizoaffected Sorry, that sounds rough.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-09 06:08:47	@Lababup You can do it! I believe in you!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-09 03:02:58	@ThinnerSpinster That, I believe, is the definition of tired.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-09 01:06:10	@DailyBipolar Great job!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-08 05:20:15	@Schizo_Ellie Great news!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-08 02:42:10	@Wheatie1966 Congratulations on getting out!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-08 02:29:17	I don't know what I'd do without lorazepam. What a wonderful medication.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-08 01:10:19	@schizoaffected Good on you for doing your part!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-08 00:46:50	@Schizo_Ellie You don't have to suffer. If you feel like you need it times like these are what emergency services are for.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-08 00:45:59	@Schizo_Ellie Oh no. You need to find someone to talk to then.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-08 00:42:53	@Schizo_Ellie Sorry, Ellie. If you have a benzo now might be a good time to take it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 23:12:01	Good morning, good people. Let's make it a good day. Random thought: I rarely tweet from my mobile phone.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 21:45:49	@elledanmarie Yes. I think it's normal.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 09:52:54	@Tamalehawk Retweeted for "catamaran bathroom" alone.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 09:50:22	@ThinnerSpinster Thanks!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 08:45:46	@schizoaffected Sleep well, if possible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 06:05:26	@ThinnerSpinster That's a perfectly normal thing to do. Fucker is wrong.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 06:03:17	@zzzedkat Sorry, Zoë.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 01:16:49	@chris_mahan Thanks, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 00:31:59	@BeautifulMined Thanks! That is helpful to hear right now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 00:31:23	@BeautifulMined Very wise words indeed.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 00:22:14	@KingOfWeird thanks, man. I'm still happy to be alive and mostly healthy.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 00:21:41	however, I still held out hope that things would improve. I'm handling it well so far. I'm jogging a bit, and am going to the gym most days.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 00:21:15	It was a long time coming so I'm relieved to have that resolution. Of course I could've ended it earlier if I felt like it wasn't working;
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-07 00:21:01	A little update: Overall things are going ok. This past Monday my girlfriend of five months broke up with me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-06 23:48:03	Good morning, e-people. I wish you all the best today, and if the best isn't possible I hope you make the best of what life has given you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-06 02:21:58	@rabbitsoup_zola The medication I most value at the moment.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-06 01:47:59	@elledanmarie Good for you. It has a side-effect I don't much appreciate. The alternative is worse, though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-06 00:44:34	To avoid exacerbating the activating nature of Abilify I've switched to #decaf .
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-06 00:24:03	@elledanmarie Thanks. The feeling mostly goes away with lorazepam. I'm very thankful for that medication.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-06 00:19:42	@elledanmarie Ugh. I have these quite frequently :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-06 00:10:35	@elledanmarie ...very sorry to hear this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-05 23:47:37	@leah_michal Haha
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-05 23:45:58	@Lyingsoothsayer You've got such a positive outlook; it's inspiring.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-05 23:10:14	@lithiated Meditation has a soporific effect on me as well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-05 23:06:24	@lithiated ...very glad to hear this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-05 23:04:22	@gravbeast Absolutely gorgeous. Thank you for sharing.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-05 23:03:46	@rabbitsoup_zola Hang in there, Zola. We love you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-05 22:02:56	@leah_michal Hang in there. Mine minimizes mental illness. I'm hoping yours will give it its due respect.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-05 07:13:13	@NicsVoice Still... tell your psychiatrist please.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-05 07:11:19	@KristinaBipolar It seems to have fewer side-effects than risperidone for which I'm very thankful.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-05 00:25:06	Missing @burrohazard this Monday morning.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-05 00:11:30	@mahannay Guess I haven't been watching my feed closely enough. I had no idea you'd moved out there. Congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-04 23:50:43	@SageSilk It's ok. Please don't beat yourself up about it -- not that you were.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-04 23:19:43	@martyn666arts Excellent self-awareness.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-04 23:19:06	@menhealuk Sorry, man. I'm hoping your day turns around.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-04 22:41:28	@KristinaBipolar So glad your moods are leveled out. I take my 20mg dose in the morning because it is so activating. When do you take yours?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-03 09:26:54	@BipolarAuthor Congratulations!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-03 08:52:35	@ThinnerSpinster Thanks. I'm doing an ok job distracting myself so far.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-03 07:25:36	@ThinnerSpinster Hoping it doesn't get out of control...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-03 03:00:40	At the gym dawg
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-03 00:33:21	Ah, yes, a depressive episode...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-02 10:46:25	@thelistenerd *feebly and hoarsely mutters*: Don't mention it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-02 09:17:58	@ThinnerSpinster It's alright. I'll hope it works next time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-02 08:59:47	@ThinnerSpinster Strava. First time it ever let me down.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-02 08:18:51	Jogged a healthful 3 miles round town. Tracker thing ain't picked up but 1. You're gonna need to trust me on this one.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-02 01:17:29	@rabbitsoup_zola You aren't! And anyway this forum is meant for you to whine if you need to do so.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-01 09:48:05	@ThinnerSpinster oh no that's terrible
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-01 09:27:32	@SocietyBasement Thanks. I'll be hoping for the best as well.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-01 03:40:30	@milkjunkie23 Thanks, man. How's life?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-01 03:09:54	@SocietyBasement @burrohazard Was there a reason given?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-01 02:14:44	@ThinnerSpinster Thanks :-) You're always so supportive. You and @burrohazard. Glad to know you both.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-01 02:06:05	Lorazepam is helping in a pinch.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-01 01:51:46	@burrohazard Enjoy your offline time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-01 01:50:43	@Blueeyedfoxie So sorry to hear this...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-05-01 01:31:25	As the cycles continue, I find myself dipping into low-grade #depression . I feel fortunate, though, that it's not a more serious episode.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-27 00:50:49	@Lyingsoothsayer I definitely felt manic at the start, even just on 5mg.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-26 23:21:59	@Lyingsoothsayer Thanks for sharing your lived experience with the drug. I'm thinking I might benefit from a more gradual upward titration.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-26 22:52:08	@NicsVoice So glad to know you're doing ok. Overall I'm ok, too. Thanks again for sharing your experience with the drug.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-26 22:50:37	@ThinnerSpinster Interesting description!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-26 22:33:18	@ThinnerSpinster Like my use of lorazepam it's not ideal but neither is life. More power to you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-26 22:29:28	@rabbitsoup_zola That generally works for me.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-26 22:26:02	@rabbitsoup_zola Sorry, Zola. How can you best distract yourself?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-26 22:23:35	@leah_michal No feeling like that, right? And it's difficult to explain to others. Thank you for your empathy. I really appreciate it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-26 22:21:40	@BipolarConf Yes I agree. I really appreciate your empathy.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-26 22:03:22	Abilify seems to cause #akathisia (restlessness). Sometimes I just can't sit or stand still. Lorazepam seems to counteract.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-19 02:46:47	@ThinnerSpinster Thank you for caring. I think I was just manic irrespective of the Abilify.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-19 02:07:11	Sure hope this period of euthymia lasts! Going up on Abilify -- from 10mg to 15mg -- for two weeks, then up to 20mg.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-19 01:03:38	@tweety123pie Happy Anniversary!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-18 00:19:27	@debecca Nooooo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-18 00:08:14	Eight hours left to go I wanna be sedated That Ativan flow
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-17 23:57:13	Good morning, Good People of Twitterland.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-17 20:46:33	@ThinnerSpinster Yikes!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-17 07:01:27	Runnin' outta juice like a Android phone on Lollipop #bedtime
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-17 06:51:14	@_CongoRilla_ Alien. Better story. They're both excellent, though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-17 02:33:01	@lithiated You deserve and have a right to help just as much as the next person.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-17 00:40:59	Taking a cue from @ThinnerSpinster and practicing positivity: Glad to be alive and relatively healthy this morning.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-17 00:37:46	@ThinnerSpinster Heh..
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-16 03:41:37	@BipolarTweets I'm sure they do shackle our brains. By the way, I'm on your side in spirit. I don't want to take meds. I do it for my family
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-16 03:38:38	@BipolarTweets It definitely dulls us from mania. Going on an up can damage the brain.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-16 03:35:33	@BipolarTweets The easy answer: If you want the bipolar to get worse, do not take your meds.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-16 01:44:26	@iproposethis That it's not worth sacrificing your mental health.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-16 00:03:38	Mornin' Twitter. Let us add some flavor to the day.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-16 00:02:05	Cubicle neighbor clearing throat A thousand pale blue shoats Sacrificed to her as she bloats Fry up their coats She'll snack Smack and hack
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 23:56:05	Solely in my mind I turn over Attempt to unwind Pull tight the cover Return to slumber Under my eyes dark umber
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 23:54:17	Woke to sounds Of car doors slamming Shot off some rounds Clanging, ricocheting Released the hounds Their jaws a'clenching Tension abounds
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 23:48:34	@SocietyBasement @burrohazard @TWC_Help Well it's a start
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 23:43:27	@NicsVoice I've taken to carrying around lorazepam for such circumstances.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 22:47:17	@Schizo_Ellie Will be thinking of you, Ellie
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 22:46:54	@SocietyBasement Yuck
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 22:45:32	@Wheatie1966 Best of luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 06:09:05	@burrohazard Sorry to hear. That reminds me of your move. How did it go?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 05:58:14	@burrohazard Would put the money instead towards a Hulu subscription since they have Criterion Collection films.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 05:57:42	@burrohazard Good to know. I think I would cancel at this point if girlfriend wasn't watching "House of Cards".
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 05:54:33	@ThinnerSpinster Glad you're feeling better for now. If only for now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 05:54:02	@burrohazard Ahh, I see how my reply could impart snarkiness. I meant that Netflix gets films which don't necessarily merit their own fee...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 05:47:32	Elaborate on how you arrived at Kim Jones' nickname. Jones -> Joans -> multiple Joans -> Joan Rivers + Joan Cusack = Nickname: Rivers Cusack
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 05:44:07	@burrohazard It must be great: it's not available on Netflix.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 05:38:02	@leah_michal Well done! You made it through!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 05:33:04	Thanks to those who've RT'd. For the rest of you, I don't know what you're doing with your life, I really don't.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 05:17:34	@beth_1day A pleasant afternoon to you (from the States).
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 04:34:18	Maybe she's born with it Maybe it's #ketamine
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 04:26:47	@_CongoRilla_ I think that means you're now an honorary Panther. Best get to marchin'
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 04:23:30	@_CongoRilla_ Go you with your badass trim
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 04:22:21	@_CongoRilla_ Ya, ok. I can see how that follows.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 01:12:11	Oh, so it's gonna be that kind of morning
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 01:12:02	@ThinnerSpinster Hang in there. We care about you and want you around. (Selfish, I know.)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 01:11:06	@ThinnerSpinster Ah, the small victories!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-15 01:09:56	@ThinnerSpinster We take what we can get! Btw, glad to hear you're out and about.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-14 23:55:10	@koalaalltheway Sorry, Anna.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-14 04:46:12	@LonelyBPDgirl hope u r well
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-14 03:24:42	@burrohazard @ThinnerSpinster I didn't get a good night's rest but I feel ok on alcohol, coffee, ativan.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-14 02:20:52	@SageSilk you can do this
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-13 13:10:19	@recovery_pati I too want to leave a mark. Realistically it'll be a small one.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-13 05:52:40	@ThinnerSpinster @1toZen It seemed to have done so for me too. Now I'm leveling out though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-13 05:30:56	@1toZen Abilify
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-13 03:39:05	@1toZen Best of luck w the move!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-13 02:10:57	@1toZen Thanks for asking. I have a new AAP.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-13 02:09:55	@SocietyBasement Hahaha!!.. Rapid cycling is a term used to describe frequent oscillations between mania and depression in bipolar disorder.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-13 01:53:47	Yay for rapid cycling #sarcasm
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-11 04:54:54	@Lababup Yes, I'd be one of THOSE people ;-) ...miserable about any and every affliction!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-11 04:52:14	@Lababup Good on ya for seeing the silver lining.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-10 10:01:37	@ThinnerSpinster You have a healthy attitude about it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-09 23:56:48	@koalaalltheway Sorry Anna. Please vent your feelings to us if you can. Better than holding them in.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-09 23:55:35	@leah_michal Hey don't beat yourself up. I'm doing the same.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-09 21:49:01	@jathanism Have a great time!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-09 16:16:40	@1toZen Missed you, man. Very good to have you back.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-07 08:51:53	@unsuicide Welcome back! Good to have you :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-07 07:50:57	A direct personal email just got directly answered and I feel like I've been hit in the stomach. I need much thicker skin.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-07 06:53:27	@_BipolarManiac You're definitely not alone!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-07 02:49:37	@beth_1day Sorry. It sounds rough. We're here to listen to your thoughts during this difficult time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-07 02:47:47	@leah_michal Heh. Same. I've been riding some turbulent hypomania, girlfriend's giving me A LOT of space, & work is too much. Hang in there.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-07 02:33:27	@leah_michal Hey it happens. Try not to beat yourself up too much. Ask to leave early if you can.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-07 02:16:37	@Lyingsoothsayer Wish I had clonazepam... just have lorazepam for now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-07 01:54:53	@_CongoRilla_ Tail. They were so clever
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-07 01:26:35	@rabbitsoup_zola Glad u don't cuz we'd miss u dearly.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-07 00:39:24	@NicsVoice As a former Catholic I feel constant guilt. Not sure what to do about it other than to recognize that I'm human & thereby flawed.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-07 00:14:37	@NicsVoice It's a symptom of our illness to feel guilty. Acknowledge that feeling and move onward and upward from there.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-05 23:19:18	@beth_1day Sorry :-( My empathies to you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-05 23:10:40	@zendao42 Oh a lot was wrong imo
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-05 08:08:55	@bipolarlifeuk Glad you can now talk about it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-05 05:10:59	@zzzedkat Hang tough. You got this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-05 01:17:43	@KingOfWeird Thanks man. Really needed that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 20:51:47	@KingOfWeird @zendao42 Ya @_CongoRilla_ is the glue. I don’t think there are any other mutual friends.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 20:44:29	Another day is less bright without our friend @1toZen Anyone know how he's doing?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 20:26:59	@SageSilk No need to apologize! We are here to non-judgmentally listen.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 19:22:04	@SageSilk A quotidien concern for me as well. My empathies to you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 12:31:14	@SageSilk Thanks! And sorry to hear about the sleep... I know that irritable, unrested feeling too well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 12:27:26	@SageSilk I vascillate between euthymia and despair. Ty 4 asking. How are you, Sagey?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 12:24:56	Should go for a run shouldn't I?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 06:54:41	@SocietyBasement @Stabuintheass Hopefully that gets rectified!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 06:16:29	@SocietyBasement Aw man
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 06:15:35	@SocietyBasement who's the other one?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 06:14:15	@SocietyBasement Nobody knows. It seems like he got fed up with something or someone.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 06:12:59	I hope he's doing ok
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-04-04 06:12:37	Mourning the loss of one @1toZen

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-30 23:54:48	Apparently I have repressed at least one experience of childhood sexual abuse. Fortunately I think it only involved some genital fondling.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-30 05:31:00	@weswroten It's good to practice marksmanship for the impending zombie invasion. Take some diazepam to lower pulse / minimize jitters.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-30 00:15:40	@weswroten Hahaha. That's all we're good for at this point!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-28 05:10:16	@NWSLosAngeles Thas sum ruhdickulus bullshit. On a more serious note: Thanks for the update!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 22:02:07	@1toZen @FatterSpinster Thank you both so much. I was just thinking about you two in particular last night: I really value our friendships.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 21:49:46	@imillnotcrazy Please be as kind and understanding with yourself as you'd be with a loved one.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 21:47:24	@zzzedkat I feel like this is a miracle drug. It makes me more normal without perceptible side-effects. I take 400mg daily fwiw.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 21:45:18	@FatterSpinster I should be sleeping. I'm experiencing hypomania it would seem :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 09:52:14	@JackieEllCee I apologize on behalf of The Folk of The Twitter. Hope the rest of your night goes well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 09:28:39	@Blueeyedfoxie That sounds rough. My thoughts are with you during this difficult time. Plenty of tea and/or coffee if you drink those...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 06:23:17	@DanielleHark Glad you're out. Best wishes for a smooth, full recovery if possible.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 04:55:38	@PsychHike Yeah, ended my marriage of almost nine years. Has created strife between me and my family. Has hurt countless other relationships
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 04:48:17	@PsychHike Definitely.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 04:43:13	@leah_michal One behalf of men I apologize. I'm very sorry someone made you feel that way.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 04:41:31	@PsychHike Looks good! Very readable.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 04:40:38	@leah_michal Great! That's a terrible thing to have happened, though, ughh.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 04:23:16	@imillnotcrazy I just learned of this memoir of a guy who survived a jump from the Golden Gate bridge: http://www. goodreads.com/book/show/1767 6306-cracked-not-broken …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 04:15:33	@bipolarwendy Packing makes good people bad ;-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 04:02:44	@FatterSpinster Ahh, that's no good. Walking the dog should be helping though...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 04:01:29	@FatterSpinster Dang. You're gonna live forever.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 02:14:23	@andrea_5972 Yes! so rewarding though :-) The brand I typically use is Prismacolor Nupastel which are much harder than the typical pastel.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 01:58:41	@andrea_5972 Thank you so much :-) Your comment means a lot to me!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 01:44:30	@1toZen Thanks! Thru that tag I found this one which I love: http://www. nga.gov/content/ngaweb /Collection/art-object-page.89679.html …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 01:38:10	@1toZen Wonderful painting!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 01:18:40	In hindsight that wasn't the right thing to have done. I should've vented in a healthy way. Suppressing the emotions gave them power over me
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 01:13:14	At school I never got severely beaten up. I was the target of slaps and slurs. A couple times I retaliated. Mostly I practiced nonviolence.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 00:48:44	@lithiated Best of luck w/ that. My thoughts are with you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 00:29:45	@MaxineBPD Welcome back! Vent away!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 00:24:17	@FatterSpinster Good work! After a couple of days putting it off I showered last nite. At this rate we'll be perfect by the year 3000 or so.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-27 00:05:27	Super song sounds so smooth: https:// play.spotify.com/track/7j53PiG5 cA3UY4sdVE5yza …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 23:57:49	@FatterSpinster Do it gdmit! :-) I know what you mean though...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 23:21:58	@andrea_5972 @myMindWork Just to give credit where it's due: I believe this quote is from Anais Nin.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 22:41:10	@1toZen That sounds terrible man. My thoughts are with you and your daughter.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 22:39:44	We're alive. Life gives us lemons. Let's squeeze them for all they're worth, grate the skin for zest, plant the seeds, compost what remains.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 13:35:04	@Ma88ie_E That's awesome! Keep it up!! I'm running once or twice a week now. No races planned so no motivation :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 11:17:49	@Ma88ie_E Great job!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 06:09:15	@beth_1day No worries. We'll see you when you're back.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 06:06:12	@BipolarSanity Dogs should be groomed, pet, walked. Hang in there, bud. You've been through much worse than this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 04:31:22	@zzzedkat Good! You'll be fine, I swear. If it's anything like the calls I get it was likely a useless telemarketing call.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 04:19:30	@BipolarSanity I've been there, man. I'm sorry. I used to think life would've been easier if I'd been gay. Not so sure that's true, though.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 02:48:30	@LonelyBPDgirl When I opened up about my diagnosis this kind of thing happened a lot. It comes to this: those people were never your friends
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 02:30:48	@LonelyBPDgirl Ah, ok. Sorry to hear you're sick. We're here to chat until you get better.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 01:48:15	@FatterSpinster And you'd think that'd be a lesson which only needs to be learned once...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 00:56:53	@FatterSpinster Haha. I prefer that to being stopped up :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 00:55:04	@FatterSpinster We're here until you can get out. Aside: I didn't take any lax & things are moving pretty quickly this morning.. #MakeItStop
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 00:50:38	@FatterSpinster Shower, get out, walk dog... ANYTHING except letting those thoughts feed on each other.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 00:39:55	@LonelyBPDgirl Still here. Still care how you're doing. IIRC you hadn't been tweeting as much since you got a job... hope that's going well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 00:09:29	@Schizo_Ellie Good luck w/ rTMS, Ellie.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-26 00:07:29	@FatterSpinster Exactly! Thoughts are just thoughts. You're doing a good job of compartmentalizing them.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-25 23:58:27	@FatterSpinster Hehe
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-25 23:14:26	@FatterSpinster Just a minor setback. Do NOT beat yourself up about it please :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-25 23:03:24	@lithiated Alas such is our condition.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-25 23:03:07	Over 800 songs on a playlist have been whittled down to just over 400. About time to search for some new artists. Recommendations welcome.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-25 11:53:36	@1toZen Geez, man. I'm sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-25 08:32:36	@Midnight_Chat Hang on! You can weather it. If you have prescription medication you can take as-needed please do so.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-25 05:43:18	A nice song: https:// play.spotify.com/track/40f9IDTM DpFf3CnTcPhY5F …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-25 01:52:02	@FatterSpinster Sounds terrible. Hang on. Tough to see now how you'll make it through. You will, though, since you've been through worse.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-25 00:15:43	@beth_1day Nice drawing tho!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-24 07:54:21	@leah_michal Sounds terrible. I'm hoping things turn around soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-24 07:49:09	Spotify's recommendation engine appears to be down, or I'm listening to some shit that bears no resemblance to anything else.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-24 07:12:54	@1toZen Thank you Sir.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-24 06:56:41	Yay! I can stop taking my nemesis medication risperidone. In its place I'll take aripiprazole (brand name Abilify). I'm hopeful about this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-24 06:14:29	@BipolarTweets You can stop; that's your decision. If you stop & something bad happens don't be surprised if they're no longer there for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-24 04:22:13	@Lyingsoothsayer Sleep well, if possible
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-24 02:45:44	Psych appt in 2 hrs. Will ask @quetiapine vs risperidone. Per http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16889453 q outperforms r for depression w fewer side-effects.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-24 01:42:07	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm glad you felt comfortable to let out some of your bottled up feelings. You're going through a lot. Give yourself credit
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-24 00:45:01	@1toZen Oh I haven't seen that one. Thanks for the recommendation!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-24 00:29:14	@1toZen Agreed! Reggie's one of a kind :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-24 00:07:54	All of you are inspirational. Keep sharing how you're doing, good or bad. Lots of love to you this morning. Let it be a good week for us all
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-23 01:51:01	@FatterSpinster You're a kind, loving person. Thanks for sharing this story.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-23 00:29:04	@DramaLlama85 Thank you for retweeting those beautiful photos!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-20 08:05:10	@SageSilk Please go easy on yourself. You're successfully fighting a battle which would destroy most of us.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-20 07:01:39	@MaryRachelleC Uh, that's not good. As someone who's ignorant of the Canadian healthcare system I appreciate you posting these observations.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-20 03:56:21	Five attendees, at least two of whom intermittently dozed off. Distributed peanut-butter cups at the conclusion. One remarked, "A bonus!"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-20 02:45:31	In 15 minutes I'll moderate a workplace #meditation session for the first time. I brought a Tibetan singing bowl for the group to check out.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-19 08:15:09	@FatterSpinster Ugh. That sounds rough.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-19 08:13:23	@weswroten Will do! Thank you for the suggestion :-) Related: I've recently gotten into some sausage links w/ maple syrup.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-19 08:05:56	@Lababup Congratulations on making it further than you'd expected!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-19 00:57:39	@imillnotcrazy I believe I have some symptoms of AvPD as well. The only cure for that, afaik, is therapy, therapy, and more therapy.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-18 07:07:14	@recovery_pati @PsychHike You look fine. No RBF there IMHO.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-18 05:52:08	@FatterSpinster A small setback. Please do not beat yourself up for it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-18 05:46:23	@recovery_pati You could have RBF ;-) http://www. urbandictionary.com/define.php?ter m=RBF …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-18 05:03:15	@FatterSpinster Possibly medication tolerance? I hope you're able to get them adjusted ASAP.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-18 04:30:52	Things are ok. Not great, but fine. If this is normal I can live with this.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-17 06:29:41	clamoring for an appointment with me today. We'll make it up to you by giving you one free blood-draw on the occasion of your next visit.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-17 06:28:35	Hey, so you seem fine... How about you cancel your follow-up appointment. I have all of these people who refuse to listen to my instructions
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-17 06:13:45	@NAMICommunicate Spoke with people close to me, attended moderated guided-imagery session at my workplace.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-17 06:03:21	@NicsVoice Hang in there!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-16 23:06:12	@imillnotcrazy Breathe normally, fluidly. Nothing in there is too much for you to handle. And you've handled much more that this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-16 00:08:37	@recovery_pati What a difficult journey that must've been.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-15 23:50:47	@recovery_pati It seems completely terrible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-15 12:59:57	This is temporary and the med situation will get ironed out.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-15 11:13:44	@ShannonTrimble Sounds like it's about time for a Snow White 2!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-15 09:26:22	@BipolarConf @1toZen Yes! That's an excellent goal. If it could be considered more acceptable that's even better.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-15 08:19:03	@FatterSpinster Thanks. Dysphoric mania. Ha. I'm taking Risperidone as needed. Don't want to be doing so. It's what I've got to do though.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-15 05:18:38	@1toZen @leah_michal Great questions to be asking
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-15 03:01:57	@MaryRachelleC Interesting. I would prefer to do it in isolation.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-15 03:01:07	@MaryRachelleC In the beginning have no expectation that your gestures will be reciprocated. People assume an ulterior motive; I have.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-15 02:59:04	@MaryRachelleC Despite my inclination to believe this it is simply not true. Make them care. Care about them.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-15 02:52:27	@zzzedkat It sounds like a terrible feeling. My sympathy goes out to you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-14 09:07:02	@biposcarwrites Lamotrigine?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-14 03:51:35	@FatterSpinster Breathe calmly, slowly. You got this!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-13 03:17:44	@imillnotcrazy Think u should. Relatives might want to help. U don't want to burden them. U need to do it though; lest u resent them w time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-13 02:21:15	@JulieBipolar You got this! #allezJulie
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-12 05:40:16	@imillnotcrazy Hang on. If relevant and feasible please take whatever emergency med(s) you need to get you through.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-12 05:31:08	@EddyZDavis Apostrophe aside maybe the "E" is on his thumb and he'd have to break it to be grammatically correct.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-12 01:30:23	@Lyingsoothsayer I'll be thinking of you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-10 07:59:24	@LonelyBPDgirl Wish I could drink. After visiting ER last Tuesday AM I've been instructed to not drink again.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-10 07:58:47	@BipolarSanity Hang on, man. Do what you can to let the thoughts come in and flow out. We're here for you. Vent. Complain. Cry. Yell.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-03-10 01:39:44	Risperidone is controlling mania. It's a much better med than I gave it credit for. Feel fortunate to have it, and to have a psychiatrist.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-02-24 07:05:52	@1toZen oh man that's terrible. What, if any, are your options?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-02-24 06:23:51	@rabbitsoup_zola I understand why you'd say this. Please try to let that feeling flow out of your mind as quickly as possible. Sending love.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-23 03:44:44	@Lababup I think these are rational reasons for anxiety. I believe that such thoughts may lead to thoughts of suicide to avoid this fate.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-22 23:52:50	@zzzedkat you could need both. Lithium will help normalize the highs and lows; antipsychotics can bring mania under control.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-22 12:35:24	@leah_michal I'm glad you switched. One would think it would've occurred to the previous psychiatrist to try ER.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-22 10:16:17	@FatterSpinster keep us posted. I'll be thinking of you and hoping for the best.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-22 10:13:58	@FatterSpinster you seem to be doing so much better. It's very heartening to witness.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-22 07:34:34	@LonelyBPDgirl yes, it can hurt more near the bone. Also some areas -- with more nerve-endings -- are much more painful, e.g. ankles, feet.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-22 07:32:54	@LonelyBPDgirl no need to apologise. Sleep well.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-22 07:15:53	@jathanism thanks, man. It really helps to know that others have similar issues.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-21 09:27:27	@tweety123pie thanks for your empathy. I was afraid of losing that battle since I'd be arguing about a nebulous earning "capacity".

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-14 10:31:13	@Schizo_Ellie sorry, Ellie. I've been there and it's not a nice place at all
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-14 02:41:20	@chocy_pants sure thing! Welcome!! I hope you're able to find some peace and solace through connecting to people with similar experiences.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-13 13:27:40	@leah_michal yep :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-13 12:48:20	@1toZen sounds good to me, man.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-13 01:46:58	Well, yes, if you must know: I'm quite enjoying this song atm: https:// play.spotify.com/track/47prNzqR UL0L9z9qZRRbZj …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-13 01:02:10	@FatterSpinster congratulations!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-13 00:53:08	Mornin'. You may ask: "Are you a #PandaBear ?" And I'd say, "No, madam I am not." And you'd say, "stop wasting my time then, you fraud."
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-13 00:47:34	@FatterSpinster sorry. That's frustrating :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-12 10:23:43	@FatterSpinster hahaha

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-10 17:23:19	@chris_mahan thanks! Likewise.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-10 11:57:17	@MaxineBPD oh noooooo. So sorry :-(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-10 11:47:38	@BipolarSanity sorry, man. We care about you and hope things improve soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-10 08:05:44	@rabbitsoup_zola there's something about you, girl that makes me sweat

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-09 05:51:20	@BipolarTweets It's been 21 months for me. I'm now certainly glad it's over. I've since realized it was an emotionally abusive relationship.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-09 02:43:24	@FatterSpinster sorry, sister. Hang in there if you don't; another opportunity will come soon enough.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-09 01:05:28	@JulieBipolar Hey Julie. Thank you for the insight. I feel sorta stable. I'm under control enough to begin to work on social anxiety issues.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-07 23:12:54	@Schizo_Ellie sorry, Ellie. I will be thinking about you and wishing for a swift conclusion to your symptoms.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-07 23:10:29	@FatterSpinster there's some evidence that the simple act of chewing gum improves brain function.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-07 07:33:27	@BipolarGrrl good for you for standing up for yourself! Best wishes for a favorable outcome.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-07 05:37:06	@BipolarTweets I'm hoping for the best, man. You might need to heavily rely on your healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms to push through.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-07 03:55:36	@1toZen ahh nooo... Well despite my pref for a healthy beard I suppose it's good to try something new. I'll carry the beard torch for now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-07 03:36:40	@Lababup very sorry to hear this, too. I'm hoping you bounce back soon.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-07 03:26:17	@Baconarchist saw that. Sorry, man. Effing losers with nothing better to do, ugh.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-07 02:05:29	@chris_mahan it's very refreshing to see someone not letting hubris get in the way of getting the job done.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-06 01:41:13	@weswroten gah! I hope you get it cleared up soon. I'll be thinking of you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-06 01:21:50	@DramaLlama85 serrated-edged knives work well to get through the skin. Be extra careful and remember to always hold them with your knuckles
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-06 01:14:45	@SageSilk it's good to consider the thoughts of others. Ultimately only you know if it's right for you to move. I'll be thinking of you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-05 23:54:35	@FatterSpinster you and your doc have this covered so I won't reiterate the unfortunate characteristics of #CymbaltaWithdrawal Best of luck.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-05 06:59:43	@drivelhe4d ahahaha. All joking aside: You would wear it proudly ;-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-05 06:58:46	@rabbitsoup_zola it still counts as a holiday celebration in my view. Enjoy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-05 05:21:05	@MaxineBPD I know the feeling. I hope you make it through this tough time. I care about you and want the best for you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-04 03:32:57	@FatterSpinster so so glad you found that out and have stopped taking it! You already seem more optimistic in general.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2015-01-04 03:28:21	@BipolarSanity sorry, man. That sounds really rough :-(

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-31 01:29:43	@Schizo_Ellie pdoc no good? Sorry, sister. It pains me to read this.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-31 00:15:21	@BipolarTweets oh wow. That's quite a bit worse than anything that occurred during my manic episode. I'm glad you made it through that.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-31 00:00:03	@BipolarTweets same for me. It was a long, strong manic episode, and I'm fortunate to have gotten through the ensuing depressive episode.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-30 23:48:03	@BipolarTweets after reflection I realise I had both a hypomanic and depressive episode at least as early as age 17 which made uni tougher.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-30 23:33:17	@BipolarTweets heh, about the same. Maybe less drinking though; I'm a lightweight :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-30 23:31:27	@BipolarTweets sorry, man. We love you & are pulling for you.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-30 02:15:25	@ThinnerSpinster sorry. It sounds like a very rough time. If you want to talk more about it I'm here.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-30 02:08:45	@ThinnerSpinster you've never been one that I can recall. I'm sorry you feel like life is not worth continuing.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-30 02:04:45	@ThinnerSpinster hey hey. Haha. It means that I hate hypocrites, too. Unfortunately I sometimes realise after-the-fact that I have been one.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-30 02:03:50	@tweety123pie well rhymed!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-30 01:50:35	@tweety123pie that sounds bollocking to say the least :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-30 01:40:41	@tweety123pie sorry, sister. I'm holding out hope that the ramifications are minimal.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-29 14:40:36	@BipolarTweets it's ok, don't be too hard on yourself. You'll be back on track in no time.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-29 12:23:25	@BipolarSanity sorry, man.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-28 06:01:37	@drivelhe4d when you don't know what to get you need more time. If you start w a small 1 it could probably be covered if you later regret it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-28 04:55:59	@weswroten oh boy, that's no good.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-28 04:47:57	@ThinnerSpinster sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-28 04:35:00	@weswroten what did it do to you? I think it increased my appetite.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-28 04:16:19	@ThinnerSpinster I'm glad you got home safe.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-21 07:37:29	@tweety123pie You're fine; letting it out is healthy. It's part of their job to glean relevant information from whatever you say.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-21 06:29:31	@Blueeyedfoxie Haha. I think that's ok as long as you're not trying to board a plane.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-20 14:54:02	@_CongoRilla_ Followed closely by "best check yo'self beeyotch"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-20 14:52:24	These past few weeks when we've needed Dennis Rodman to speak with Kim Jong-un where has he been!?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-20 05:14:55	I'm indulging in a #daydream of a world where a manic episode is not followed by a depressive one. #bipolar
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-20 05:08:56	@Schizo_Ellie You're too kind :-) I've seen you do the same. Together we'll all get through this!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-20 04:48:33	@ThinnerSpinster Always a good idea to plan ahead. You're not leaving us yet though! I hope you have a pleasant weekend
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-20 02:56:19	@weswroten To my non-Dutch ear it sounds like: uw-TREHHHKT
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-20 02:27:58	@weswroten If emphatically enunciated "Utrecht" is fairly fierce as well
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-20 02:22:51	Excerpted from a recent phone conversation w/ my boss: "Can't come in to the office rn. Kim Jong-un is unhappy about some of my projects."
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-20 02:17:20	@deseraestage It'll be a short book! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-20 00:34:07	@Blueeyedfoxie A slew of small victories add up to a pretty good day!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-19 14:06:13	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm so glad!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-19 13:50:38	@BrokeBucket I know that feeling. There's no reason we shouldn't miss it aside from its terrible aftermath.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-19 12:37:42	@BrokeBucket I don't know the specifics. I would just say: when I'm depressed all I can see are the problems.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-19 12:34:15	@BrokeBucket My answer changes depending on my mood. If I try to be as objective as possible: Overall I'm glad to have had manic episodes.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-19 12:30:37	@1toZen @JulieBipolar Maybe the question becomes: as the illness worsens over time how often should we expect to NOT experience an episode?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-19 12:28:16	@1toZen @JulieBipolar I guess you sort of agree: if you're in a mixed-state or in a rapid-cycle-induced episode you're symptomatic.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-19 08:47:16	@drivelhe4d From time to time I get this feeling, too :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-19 08:46:09	@drivelhe4d Very sorry to hear this, sister. We're here for you if you want to talk about it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-19 08:17:39	@rabbitsoup_zola Sorry to hear this, sister. If you have to be haunted by a ghost, Michael Hutchence isn't a shabby one
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-19 03:22:33	@XERO_360 Hey hey, I hope you are able to get enough rest so you can heal as quickly as possible
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 15:22:46	@SageSilk Mornin' lovely lady. I'm headed off to sleep. Have a marvelous day!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 14:36:34	@rabbitsoup_zola Fine 'n' dandy. Nearing the end of this meandering day as you start another.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 14:29:22	@rabbitsoup_zola Mornin' dearie
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 13:53:47	#fuck Just needed to let that out. Carry on.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 13:42:47	I don't want texts from you. I am close to hoping you lose your phone and don't have your contacts backed up. #MeanTweets
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 13:35:48	Too #sober for this fine Wednesday evening
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 13:33:17	@Psquatch You've never let me down. I'll try this @LHGarrett . If he fails to pull me from my ennui.. hang on I'll think of an empty threat..
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 13:28:16	@nancyrobles7 Hahaha. One day you'll find the perfect mix
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 12:47:39	@Schizo_Ellie If you wanna talk about it in more detail we're here for you.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 12:45:25	Tossed a bottlecap directly into an empty tin of fish from three feet. It's all downhill from here.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 12:36:41	@PWPnews Well done preventing an outage from turning into an outrage
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 12:35:09	@matthewfugere Welcome back! Missed reading your unique take on things.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 07:50:11	@BipolarCursed That's understandable. Well then I hope that feeling passes.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 07:11:08	@BipolarCursed Sometimes it's well warranted!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 01:27:54	@weswroten Haha. Euthymia: normal mood.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-18 00:23:14	@weswroten Don't mention it :-) I'm as close to euthymia as I've been in a while and glad for it!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-17 23:58:14	@DramaLlama85 We love you!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-17 23:12:43	@ThinnerSpinster I'm so glad things are looking up! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-17 14:38:13	@PrinceTweets2U and onto my face
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-17 12:44:40	@My_Bipolar_Mind Remember how it can turn on a dime.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-17 09:21:47	@BipolarCursed Sorry to hear this, Chris.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-17 07:27:18	@1toZen I've reached the age when hearing of Grammy nominees and upcoming guests on talk shows makes me think, "why is the TV volume so low"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-17 06:45:05	@nancyrobles7 Sorry to hear that, sister
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-17 05:26:35	Squeaky chair squeaks squeakily #squeak
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-17 05:23:08	@_CongoRilla_ Preferable to being an asshole with the ketchup! I still can't believe someone would do something like that
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-17 02:04:29	@deseraestage Best of luck!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 22:19:37	@ThinnerSpinster I agree with @treacle130 . We all have bad moments. Try not to beat yourself up for it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 12:27:27	@rabbitsoup_zola Good morning. I hope you have a great day
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 09:42:32	@ThinnerSpinster I really did laugh. Maybe since I'm at work the reply was too serious. I say impulsive stuff all the time. No offense taken
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 08:45:53	@ThinnerSpinster No problem. Thanks for apologizing.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 08:22:11	@ThinnerSpinster It is possible they changed their "@" and their name since you followed
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 07:47:01	@ThinnerSpinster You're fine :-) When someone goes quiet it's a bit more worrisome
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 05:41:28	@ThinnerSpinster You'll be back on track in no time! I just heard about a market that had to toss $70k worth of food due to a power outage.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 05:36:30	@ThinnerSpinster Clicking I think is generally a symptom of a bad battery, yeah. Batteries last 3 to 5 years or so.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 05:25:29	@ThinnerSpinster Ugh, sorry... Were they able to help you out?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 03:08:31	@chris_mahan My faith in humanity has been restored! I'd been in need of that since I just saw a bloated function I wrote a few years ago...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 02:52:59	@SageSilk I feel similarly on seeing others' art. For many years I was so self-critical that I didn't produce any art; medication has helped
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 02:00:28	@SageSilk Thank you :-) More here: http:// instagram.com/el_guerito_loco
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 01:45:20	@SageSilk Lately I've been doing more in pencil. Trying to get back to pastels. My profile image -- the scary face -- is the latest pastel.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 01:37:05	@SageSilk It's a great feeling to have created something! I enjoy showing my art to people via sites like this to see how they react to it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-16 01:18:03	@chris_mahan Heh. I hope your day doesn't continue in that vein...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-15 02:57:50	@reallyannarose Yeah in CA! It's the Kern near Sequoia National Park :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-15 01:59:05	So glad you're feeling better, @tweety123pie ! I'm doing alright
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-15 01:32:42	@chris_mahan Likewise! I hope it's a good day for you
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-14 16:07:41	@Blueeyedfoxie Seems a rant was more than merited there. Sleep well!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-14 09:40:47	@rabbitsoup_zola I thoroughly enjoyed your lyric-laden spree. Sleep well!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-14 08:56:23	@rabbitsoup_zola Pulp! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-14 06:44:12	Mouth in shock from some delicious and fiery King Taco salsa #HurtsSoGood
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-14 05:35:14	@ThinnerSpinster Big feat!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-14 04:49:46	@ThinnerSpinster Oh they looked fine. Feet are generally odd things anyway. Will never understand how someone can have a foot fetish...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-14 03:58:55	@NicsVoice So sorry, Nic
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-14 02:55:51	@ThinnerSpinster That's alright. From what I gather not many of them deserve much ;-p
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-14 02:20:48	@ThinnerSpinster How's the Christmas shopping?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-14 02:15:58	@DramaLlama85 Hahaha. This is the motivating factor behind upwards of 73.2% of siestas
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-13 07:33:55	@BipolarCursed I think you've made a good decision. Enjoy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-13 05:59:40	@ThinnerSpinster Thank you :-) I've never seen Bobby Flay on TV yet his name popped into my head; the insidiousness of advertising at work!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-13 05:23:33	To "Silver Bells" melody: Pasta shells, pasta shells It's dinner time in the kitchen Ring-a-ling, they don't ring Soon I will be Bobby Flay
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-13 05:02:32	@1toZen I know this feeling. I'm glad for the decline because it might be tiresome for both sides if I had to continually reject invitations
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-13 03:47:44	@_CongoRilla_ You could, and if he accepts say, "The CIA informed me you have been wracked with regret. Wanted to give you a second chance."
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-13 03:41:25	@KingOfWeird Sure, though I'd caution against it for the sake of their digestion
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-13 03:38:15	#FF @KingOfWeird for your own edification
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-13 00:57:39	@SageSilk So glad!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 23:24:19	@ThinnerSpinster It's your right to do so. A concern I have is how alcohol can amplify emotions which when sober may be manageable.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 09:18:28	@BipolarCursed Sleep well -- if possible!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 09:17:35	@1toZen Best wishes on the interview! You got this!!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 08:33:38	@DramaLlama85 Clarification re favorite: Happy about the fox-watching. Enjoy! ...less enthused by the required inebriation.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 07:34:23	@ThinnerSpinster Looks a bit like "grumpy cat" of internet fame
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 07:28:38	@NicsVoice G'night, Nic. Glad you had fun w/ your friends for a bit
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 06:12:13	@ThinnerSpinster Ah yes, just saw that
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 06:03:32	@ThinnerSpinster I'm not suggesting you consider keeping both pets... How feasible is it to do so and keep it undetected by management?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 05:44:41	@ThinnerSpinster I can say with some degree of certainty that right off the bat you two have a communication problem ;-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 05:36:54	@ThinnerSpinster I blame the cat!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 04:58:20	@jathanism I wrote a code and a SQL
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 04:03:20	@SageSilk I enjoy reading your tweets, wildhorse. I hope you'll reconsider wanting to die. I know what you mean, though, and I'm sorry.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 04:02:21	@BipolarCursed I don't think you need to feel that way. So far I've enjoyed reading tweets. It seems like you're in a depressed state atm.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 01:23:48	@BipolarCursed That's great! I enjoy a lot of digital art. A graphic-artist once told me that he must work digitally to keep up with demand.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 00:28:12	@NicsVoice Congratulations on getting out!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 00:24:33	@ThinnerSpinster Ah this is a sticky situation!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 00:23:49	@KingOfWeird Probably so. We "met" through the one and only Rilla
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-12 00:10:52	@ThinnerSpinster Thank you :-) I'll do that. How does the pet situation look?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 23:48:46	@tweety123pie I'm sorry to hear that. We are here for you, too: your non-local services.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 23:45:44	Hey, @tweety123pie ! For now I'm glad to be alive and well. Would like to work on a new drawing or two; mayhaps this weekend. How are you?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 15:12:16	How did we have an #AmberAlert without my phone beeping? Stay in school, kids. And don't kidnap anyone. Least of all your own children.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 14:37:59	Have you ever felt that your life wasn't complete without SQL-like "grouping sets" in Python? If so, peep this noise: http:// codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/7226 9/sql-grouping-sets-in-python-using-pandas …
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 13:15:28	@BipolarCursed Working on them keeps me away from cigarettes and to a lesser extent alcohol. Being a little inebriated cures perfectionism.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 13:12:53	@BipolarCursed Yes they are :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 12:32:33	@BipolarCursed Sleep well!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 11:43:23	@BipolarCursed Well done!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 11:41:18	@ThinnerSpinster Sleep well. Thanks again
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 11:41:00	Dear sisters and brothers with #bipolardisorder and/or other mental illnesses: Thank you so much for being here. You provide such comfort.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 11:36:36	@BipolarCursed I was forced to when on the psych ward. The patches helped a bit. I couldn't wait to get out so I could smoke. Sad, right?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 11:33:58	@ThinnerSpinster Haha. Thanks for the tweets of support. I'll try to behave
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 11:23:20	Distract me with your tales of debauchery and/or malfeasance
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 11:20:10	Cigarette craving dammit
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 10:23:27	@BipolarCursed Do you want to feel like you do when you're hypomanic? Often that's how I feel. Coffee gets me partway there; crack the rest.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 05:50:00	@hedwyg @deseraestage @lttphoto It is so sad how he struggled for so long before being diagnosed, and beautiful how he reflects on his life.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-11 00:36:30	@BipolarCursed You too! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 16:48:34	@rabbitsoup_zola I wish you a good day; as I drift off to sleep
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 15:59:25	@Jonode Your time will come or my name isn't Lorne Michaels
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 15:23:15	And then there was a pool And beyond that pool there was a school pic.twitter.com/xMTsQVeHhG
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 13:45:05	@My_Bipolar_Mind I submit that this is what euthymia looks like :-) Enjoy!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 13:21:41	@chris_mahan Nooo... I for one look forward to your tweets
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 11:20:34	@deseraestage As a kid I did so on occasion; not lately though
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 08:44:20	@BipolarCursed Thanks for the poetic description of how our condition sometimes makes us feel.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 06:21:58	@BipolarCursed Yours is a bit different, too. Is it something you made? or found?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 06:07:12	"Well maybe you should feed it more often if it's heading to your bookcase for sustenance."
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 05:44:18	"Python looping a dictionary multiple times" Ah how I love when #python programming questions have meaning out of context :-D
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 05:42:39	@BipolarCursed Ah, I apologise for that. It is a pastel painting I did with a lot of digital filtering applied. If you want I can change it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 05:15:46	@deseraestage @lttphoto Not joking: "Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 04:57:21	@deseraestage @lttphoto Hehe, erm, yeah well I should clarify: It's an unfunny reference to a mid-90s film
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 04:53:47	@deseraestage @lttphoto How great! A thing to do in Denver when you're not dead
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 04:53:05	@BBRFoundation @PsychCentral Thanks!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 04:46:59	@DailyBipolar Likewise! Love that hashtag. My experiences bonding with people on Twitter prompted me to attend a local bipolar support group
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 02:48:29	@BBRFoundation @PsychCentral Seems like an interesting article. I see this message: "Sorry, Article Not Found"
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 02:18:26	Currently working through an overdose of lemon-poppyseed muffins. Your thoughts and sympathy are welcome.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-10 01:48:54	@nancyrobles7 I very nearly OD'd on lemon-poppyseed muffins. Hopefully you make a better decision!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 23:58:09	Good morning good Tweeple of Earth
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 12:06:43	@ThinnerSpinster Soon you'll be helping me out of a rut :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 12:01:57	@ThinnerSpinster If you have any very technical reading nearby may I suggest you dive into it right about now
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 11:59:48	@ThinnerSpinster Heh. Sounds like a fun one. I haven't yet been prescribed it. Hopefully I will someday soon
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 11:58:16	@1toZen Thanks, man. It means a lot to me
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 11:57:20	@ThinnerSpinster Sleep well. I look forward to reading your tweets tomorrow
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 11:53:53	@ThinnerSpinster I'm cracking open a crap light beer to that. Cheers to another tomorrow
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 11:48:58	@ThinnerSpinster Why oh why do you have so much. I know why just lamenting
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 11:47:37	@ThinnerSpinster So sorry
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 11:45:26	@ThinnerSpinster These are all temporary issues
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 11:43:07	@ThinnerSpinster No! I won't allow it
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 11:41:30	@ThinnerSpinster Sounds that way ;-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 09:56:45	@ThinnerSpinster Tbh I don't often want to be here either. Because we don't know what follows let's hang on for as long as we can. We love u
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 09:52:05	@ThinnerSpinster Nooo... I for one enjoy reading your tweets. It helps to know that others have similar issues.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 07:36:51	@ThinnerSpinster Arggghh. Sorry to hear this :-(
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 06:32:20	@ThinnerSpinster I can relate. Regularly hear a metallic clap as cars drive over a gate-rail and a low vibration from an adjoining apartment
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 02:52:23	@ThinnerSpinster Hehe. I wish. No, I guess I really don't wish. Have had issues w/ this individual before. Sadly it's par for the course :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-09 02:49:28	First thing this AM I'm confronted w/ nonsense. I explain why it's nonsense. Explanation isn't understood. I explain again. "Erm, well ok."

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-08 13:01:16	@1toZen Thanks very much for the encouragement, Sir. I'll think of this the next time I get a craving.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-08 11:53:50	The streak is over: Smoked one cigarette yesterday and one today. I will take it as a setback and not give up trying to quit.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-08 11:51:52	@rabbitsoup_zola I've noodled on it and come to the same conclusion as @tweety123pie
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-08 11:48:28	@thelistenerd Lol. Excellent work, Sir
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-07 11:36:58	Really wanted a cigarette. Forced myself to jog instead. Seems to have quelled the craving for now.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-07 06:35:51	@ThinnerSpinster Alongside @treacle130 I'm also supportive of venting; much better to let it out! :-)
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-06 17:06:07	@NicsVoice Please don't feel guilty. You need the bed. Otherwise you wouldn't be there. Sending hugs.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-06 16:40:22	@jathanism A noble goal if there ever was one!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-06 16:38:36	@_CongoRilla_ Argh. Want a cigarette. So badly. Perhaps more drinking will help... Gulp, gulp, gulp... Nope! That actually makes it worse.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-06 08:23:24	@BipolarBlessed I very rarely desire to answer personal calls; even if I like the person.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-06 06:07:50	@rabbitsoup_zola Maybe add honey if you have it.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-06 05:56:54	@rabbitsoup_zola That settles it then.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-06 05:27:26	@ThinnerSpinster I know exactly what you mean. Social anxiety has definitely kept me from going to this point.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-06 04:42:39	Planning to attend a bipolar/depression support group for the first time this afternoon... kinda excited about it! #bipolardisorder
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-06 04:28:47	@rabbitsoup_zola You had a question?... I'm all ears!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-05 05:20:44	@ThinnerSpinster It's good to admit that. Stay in bed and don't feel guilty if at all possible.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-05 04:49:43	@ThinnerSpinster Sorry to hear this :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-05 04:49:07	@ThinnerSpinster Yesterday I was reminded that bipolar depr differs from unipolar depr. And you're saying I can also have unipolar depr? Ugh
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-05 03:47:22	@BipolarBlessed Heh. I have also felt that trazodone doesn't work. :-/
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-05 03:08:06	Experiencing mild #veisalgia more commonly known as "a hangover".

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-05 02:33:56	@BipolarBlessed Oh yes I have read that benzodiazepines are addictive. I have trazodone to help with sleep; have you ever taken that?
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-05 02:11:11	@BipolarBlessed I'm very glad to hear it! I sabotaged my sleep last night by drinking too close to bedtime and leaving music on... :-/

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-05 00:28:26	Just saw a spam IG account with photos of a white person they allege goes by the nickname "brown sugar". I'm not falling for that one again!
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-05 00:25:18	@_CongoRilla_ I look at that & want it to be "Foggy af" then maybe just "Faf" which is not right but "Faffy in Vegas" sounds good right now.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 16:18:27	Maybe that means I'm expecting medication to do more than it's expected to do. If that's the case please don't tell me not to self-medicate.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 16:12:14	If you believe that #BipolarDisorder is a real illness I assert that the currently available medications for it aren't complete solutions.

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 14:18:50	@Schizo_Ellie It's very comforting to know that others are going through similar things. I hope you are able to get some sleep at some point
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 14:12:28	@Schizo_Ellie By the way, thanks so much for asking about my experience with mania. I'm very grateful for all of these digital friendships.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 14:08:15	@Schizo_Ellie My mania starts as the most wonderful feeling: everything seems to make sense, life is grand, etc. Then I become irritable.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 13:40:09	@Schizo_Ellie Oh ok. Your mania sounds different than the mania I've experienced.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 13:29:36	@Schizo_Ellie Glad you're able to say that. It means a lot that you recognize you're manic and you know you can ride it out bc you have b4.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 13:27:16	@Schizo_Ellie Oh, yes. I definitely agree with your pdoc. Mania is as bad if not worse than depression in my experience.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 13:25:15	@Schizo_Ellie Wow. Once a week. I am sorry. That sounds really rough.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 13:24:14	@jathanism So we'll see you on the first Monday in 2016 I guess...
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 13:22:12	@Schizo_Ellie Do you have meds for it?

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 09:20:42	With #BipolarDisorder it seems alcohol, caffeine, cigarettes, medication help so I am inclined to use all of the above to alleviate symptoms
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-04 08:42:40	@trioformind Likewise! And thanks for your efforts on behalf of all of us with mental illnesses!!

105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-12-02 13:24:14	#bipolar I know what I have to do, and I can do it; for a while. Then it becomes unbearably monotonous. *sigh* I'll give it another chance.
105939344	mechanical_meat	2014-11-29 07:27:02	@ThinnerSpinster That could be true. Anecdotally I've noticed that people interact w/ Twitter differently than they do w/ other sites/apps.
