21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-12-18 18:16:40	My mood lifted and I feel great x
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-12-08 19:07:10	But sleep does, that's all I'm doing is sleeping.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-12-08 19:06:24	Going on all different social media and coming up with the same thing I feel shit nothing cheering me up, or distracting me enough.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-12-04 22:10:53	I know I should be with people but when I am with people all I want to do is go home :(
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-12-04 16:59:19	I'm still feeling very fed up, I haven't got worse maybe even a bit better but I just want to stay in bed for the rest of my life.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-12-04 01:30:11	Maybe I should lay down and give up just let this episode come and try and prevent it getting to bad.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-12-04 01:29:10	I've done so much on preventing a relapse, I've even done a course on it, my therapy sessions but nothing seems to be working
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-12-03 17:32:10	Ok I'm feeling a bit off today, a bit low. Plz don't say it's the start of an episode.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-11-29 17:57:02	I'm doing therapy but I don't know what therapy I'm doing some weeks it's emdr next ITs dbt. It's a bit of everything I think.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-11-29 17:54:56	@kc_fight4life but mindfulness does came me down makes me slow down and think.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-11-29 17:53:58	I've been doing lots of mindfulness. Mindfulness to deal with anger, mindfulness to deal with anxiety. And I still get wound up and agitated
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-11-29 17:45:20	I can't take it anymore I try and help and u do fuck all to help ur self so I'm washing my hands with it all x
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-09-18 18:15:16	@InTheLifeOfKate thank u X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-09-18 04:04:31	I'm proud of myself this is small but it's huge to me.g.p trust me enough to have 28 days of meds that's 4 week a whole month.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-09-16 16:46:33	It doesn't make sense I eat bad and it's there but has less to say, I eat healthily and gosh it gives me the 3rd degree.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-09-16 16:44:40	Ed head talking to me :( can't have a healthy diet without it talking :( x
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-09-09 21:42:39	@xxFloatingxx u will get ur time Hun x
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-07-25 23:15:47	And said they don't know when they are going to come see me and it's not going to be the person I thought it was going to be.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-07-25 23:14:14	Crisis team was suppose to come and see me at 2, then they said 2:30-3 then called me up just before 3 and said 3:30 now they called me up
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-07-19 21:22:35	@xxFloatingxx just so annoyed X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-07-19 21:21:47	Just grrrrrrrr
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-07-17 06:32:43	Bank stopped me buying anymore. :( and it's to late to call them.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-07-15 18:38:25	Back in bed with my dayzie staying her till mum comes and visits. X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-07-15 17:10:02	I'm trapped in my house with a dog that needs walks.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-07-15 17:08:56	Feel so shitty today :( took my dog back last night and maybe it was a mistake because I can't go out to walk her. Just the garden scary.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-07-14 01:12:22	@xxFloatingxx that's what I thought I like her already X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-07-08 11:24:20	Hello everyone been up for a while now. I love seeing the sun sat good morning :) X

21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-06-17 15:23:36	Start therapy today.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-06-03 19:52:54	Think I've got a migraine coming, neck hurts got headache and feel sick. X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-06-03 01:43:53	@InTheLifeOfKate you will get there Hun, u be out on leave before u know it. They just care Hun x
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-06-02 23:26:42	@InTheLifeOfKate why are they saying no, ur getting better X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-30 16:53:50	I don't know if I have abandonment issues but I always think if my mum dies how will I cope. It frightens me so much.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-29 18:30:27	Hopefully once my mum comes round my emotions will stop giving me whiplash.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-26 21:22:09	Thoughts are racing.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-25 18:10:13	Omg my mood just lifted X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-25 15:25:53	Feeling absolutely shit this morning. Woke up disorientated.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-24 00:16:56	Self- medicating probably isn't the best idea but if it gets me through then why is it such a bad idea.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-23 15:12:41	Really struggling this morning, gone from sleeping 13-17 hours a night to 3-4. This illness has got hold of me so much. #depression
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-23 00:18:15	So many tasks to do, so unmotivated #depression
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-22 01:10:22	I did activity sheets with crisis team today. And I have made my bed and had a bath, but I'm finished for the day now.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-21 22:32:55	My mum came and took me to shop. Don't know what I do without her. X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-21 20:12:55	Hate being trapped in my own home, waiting for people to come see me, I need to go shops but I can't face leaving the house. X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-21 19:22:36	Today is so hard. #depression #crisis
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-21 02:14:02	@xxFloatingxx don't be sorry u not done anything wrong X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-21 01:46:03	Really struggling tonight, think I'm going to watch Hollyoaks then go straight to bed.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-20 01:53:34	My goal for tonight is to have a bath, I'm a dirty bitch at the moment.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-14 15:52:44	Back at mine and in bed.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-14 15:24:26	I just want to go back to my house.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-14 14:26:13	11 hours sleep and I'm still so tired. #depression
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-14 03:01:41	Gone to my mums for the night. Can't stay by myself like this.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-14 00:34:23	This day has been long and hard, think it's a case of another extremely early night. So going to bed soon. Can't face this day much longer.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-13 21:58:26	Ok I'm finally washed and dressed.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-13 20:18:06	Keeping my mind busy with stupid quiz, it's better than I was doing but still don't think it's good.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-13 17:16:40	Been up for 1 hour now back to bed. #depression
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-12 22:36:47	My sensors are high. Getting irritable by dogs making noises, the light shinning into the living room and this uncomfortable sofa
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-12 15:56:02	Maybe taking dayzie for a walk might help me. X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-12 15:53:48	#nomotivation #cantbebothered #sad #Lethargic #overwhelmed #anxiety #blackdog #depression #intrusivethoughts
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-12 15:47:55	I still say this is mild but it's getting more and more server as the days go on. #depression
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-12 14:43:54	I don't want to get up today X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-11 03:00:46	Back in bed X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-10 21:56:47	Back in bed for few hours can't be bothered anymore X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-09 22:09:58	I'm finding it a bit hard to just be by myself at the moment.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-09 19:00:47	Sun bathing in my mums garden
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-09 03:09:28	I love #jessglynne
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-08 17:27:24	Now I just got to learn not to let things get to me.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-08 17:26:10	The slightest thing used to trigger me. Now I get the emotions when something happens but I learned how to ride them out.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-08 17:25:01	I'm a lot more stable then I used to be. I don't crack when I dropped anymore.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-08 17:21:44	I love them to pieces but they wind me up.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-08 17:20:13	I've noticed the only people that really make my emotions swing is my family. Mainly my mum and brother. #bpd
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-08 02:13:05	Surfing my emotions #mindfulness
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-07 19:59:45	I can't live in fear with what could happen and do nothing with my life.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-07 19:59:09	But I'm scared it will break me
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-07 19:58:43	I want to volunteer. Get a start on my life again
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-07 15:08:24	Doing gardening today. If the weather says up.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-07 02:59:29	Ok mindfulness really does work I was agitated when I got home did a 5 min mindfulness and feel calmer now :) X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-07 01:02:56	I've came to realise I probably do have bpd. I can go from happy to cross in a matter of seconds.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-06 17:15:03	Feeling really odd today. But can't put my finger on what's going on. X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-06 03:42:04	Watching last weeks BGT
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-06 03:39:22	Just got a knock on door and freaked out #anxiety
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-05 23:55:25	I don't know what to do with myself.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-05 15:54:11	@xxFloatingxx I'm doing gardening when my plants turn up. X but I need to get some pots ready for them X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-05 15:29:28	Got someone from supportive housing coming soon. Well at 11. Then I don't know what to do with my day.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-05 02:59:34	I've had a few drops in my mood but not as bad as they have been. Probably natural dips X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-05 02:58:15	I decided last night this is the longest time I've been pretty stable for 7 months. #bipolar
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-04 22:41:59	@xxFloatingxx love u hunni X I'm just a txt away X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-03 03:42:57	My email address has shut down so I have to change everything I possible have to a new address. :(
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-05-02 14:52:10	Took dayz out now back to bed for a while.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-28 17:30:00	@xxFloatingxx no ur not Hun x
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-28 17:28:32	@xxFloatingxx but I do u haven't seen me in forages and now I turned into a Heffalump.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-28 17:27:42	It's my tummy I hate it. It's so big at the moment.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-28 17:25:57	Just want to lose 1 stone to 1 1/2 stones.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-28 17:24:29	Having the urge to restrict and go on a massive diet. What I know will not be a diet.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-28 15:11:40	Got my support worker from supported housing coming at 11 and I need to do so much before she comes but I still don't want to get up.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-28 15:06:25	I do not want to get out of bed this morning.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-28 00:50:09	Just hope it stops raining before the journey back X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-28 00:49:10	Got to my mums before it pedalled it down. I'm so lucky
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-27 17:02:40	Maybe I need to cut down on my coffee. But I love it so much.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-27 05:10:29	I missed this amazing bed. It cuddles me.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-27 04:30:46	I am not going on a diet because I will get obsess.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-27 04:28:46	I start my healthy eating tomorrow.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-26 20:01:22	Having cuddles with my dayzie #dog
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-26 16:30:32	Couldn't sleep last night, because it was a last min choose to have a sleep over I didn't bring my meds.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-26 16:29:13	Shopping went good yesterday. #Meadowhall
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-26 02:46:01	Sleeping round my mums tonight. #sleepover
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-25 15:20:33	Can't be bothered to get out of bed. Got a busy day today. It's my brothers birthday,
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-25 01:43:29	Looking at positive quotes to try and get my mind off my anxiety.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-24 22:43:06	@xxFloatingxx I'm going for my brothers birthday X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-24 21:21:35	Going to Meadowhall tomorrow. Already nervous #crowds #anxiety
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-23 18:21:29	Deciding what I want to do with my gardens. I feel so grown up.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-18 22:59:30	All my low mood is doing is making me not want to do anything but if I have to do it I still do it.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-18 22:57:47	Because if it was my bipolar I would know about it. I mean I would not go out do basic tasks or sometimes get up.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-18 22:55:57	I think it's my anxiety effecting my mood not my bipolar. If that is possible.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-18 22:54:08	But I think the problem is more the anxiety than the mood.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-18 22:53:04	Although I'm still able to function to some extent with my mood.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-18 22:51:42	Going to go tomorrow to my psych appointment and be honest. This anxiety is to much for me and my mood is ridiculous.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-18 04:14:15	Hate the feeling when ur expecting something bad to happen all the bloody time. #anxiety
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-17 17:25:42	My mum called me round her house but now she gone and got washed and dressed and I'm sitting here like now what.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-17 16:10:52	My mood just plummeted :( I want a good day
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-16 04:34:02	Why does my laptop always want to update when I want to watch Netflix in bed
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-12 16:02:14	Only just woken up and I went to bed early must of slept for 11 hours but still so tired. #depression
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-10 21:59:48	Listening to sad songs and wanting to cry. But at least I'm getting my emotions out.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-10 00:56:29	Anxiety is a fucker. It sucks so much. Feel like I can't breath.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-09 20:25:37	I love her to pieces but I can't care for her like she needs me to. I can't even give her the love she needs me to. I'm struggling to go out
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-09 20:22:23	I'm think of giving my dog to my mum for a while. My mood so low and it's unfair to keep her. I don't know what to do. Help??!!
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-09 16:55:48	Feel really crap today. Can't be bothered to do anything :( #depression #bipolar #eupd #sadness
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-09 16:54:11	Couldn't be bothered to get up but then I thought I was being lazy so now laying on sofa instead.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-04-08 15:59:08	Feeling really shit today. Just want to go back to bed.

21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-03-12 05:53:21	Listening to sad songs. I want to cry. To feel something. To breath again.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-03-12 05:22:03	Not knowing what I'm doing when is making me agitated.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-03-11 05:31:36	Knowing that why am I still so sad. #depression #bipolar #borderline #bpd
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-03-11 05:30:33	Get my keys in Monday #newhouse #overwhelming
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-03-09 18:40:25	So I'm waiting for my support here to come but I don't think they are coming X do I go down stairs X
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-03-09 06:12:25	Hopefully I will sleep well tonight then in morning got a meeting with support here and a meeting with my new cpn.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2016-03-09 04:16:27	Lost all concentration. Just keep standing up, sitting down. What is going on with me. #borderlinepersonalitydisorder #bipolar #bpd

21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-03-22 02:37:07	I cant think like I used too. my meds have taken away some of my creativity. the part what makes me imagine the imaginable.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-03-22 01:22:15	I love nurse at the moment on bbc2, Tuesdays at 10pm, I think it should be on bbc1 but maybe the bbc is ashamed about mental health problems
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-03-21 21:22:06	can you have bulimic behaviours only when you r having a low episode or suffering strong with your social anxiety?

21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-03-20 04:37:50	just wish I could talk to someone who knows how it feels to be so scared to be embarrassed they will not go out.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-03-20 04:36:55	my mood disorder is kind of the thing that can kill me but my social anxiety is my everyday struggle. apart from when im HYPER of course.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-03-20 04:35:17	I know this is not my mood swing disorder shit this is 100% my social anxiety and that something would has been hidden.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-03-20 04:33:53	but got my cpn sometime tomorrow going to have a long chat with her on how I can move forward from this.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-03-20 04:32:38	today has been a slow but positive ish day. done lots of art but just the thought of going out is freaking me a lot right now:(
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-03-19 07:40:51	I could look on the positive side there are times when even going to my garden is to much for me. #positive

21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-03-19 07:38:51	just the thought of going out is causing such server anxiety. I would say I just stop thinking about it but I cant :0
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-03-19 07:37:29	I know I really need to take my meds and go to sleep but there just something stopping me tonight :(

21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-02-27 05:58:03	@xxFloatingxx u don't look pregnant hunni x
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-02-26 20:05:25	- I'm just a lost case at the moment with no hope or strength to fight.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-02-26 20:03:45	- but to stop people worrying about me I put on a smile and say I'm ok but I'm not. Even saying that feels painful at times x
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-02-26 20:02:45	- I got so many things to be excited about right now but I feel nothing at all. No love, no enjoyment, no pleasure just darkness
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-02-26 20:01:23	- I have totally stopped caring for myself in most ways possible. And this doesn't help my mood but I'm lost
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-02-26 20:00:27	- I'm just a wastes of space at the moment and I want to change that but I don't know where to start.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-02-26 19:59:34	- I have no energy to do anything pro active so I just sit on my bum watching tv and playing on my phone all day long.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2015-02-26 19:58:24	So time to be truthful, because my head is full of lies I tell people. I'm not ok I'm coping by purging, I hate doing it but I need control.

21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-14 09:33:49	if I keep busy I might then be able to go to sleep quicker #nooverthinking
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-14 09:32:21	[2] I should spend the early night doing proactive tasks like tidying so I don't feel guilty sleeping the whole morning away.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-14 09:29:06	I been thinking instead of doing the same thing evernight of sit her on computer all night till I go to sleep then sleep all day. {1}
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-14 08:41:24	I want to have a bit of a diet before Christmas but scared it will trigger me. do I try? x #ed
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-14 08:13:03	5. remember to have my meals and eat healthier. forgetting meals don't help my mood or my shape (e.g. fat) any good.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-14 08:10:32	4. sort out a few house problems and call people up. not going to be easy with my social anxiety I hate phone calls and strangers. #anxiety
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-14 08:06:05	3. have some TLC time. I brought hair die just before I went into hospital. die my hair.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-14 08:04:11	2. tidy bedroom. a tidy and peaceful room make a tidy and peaceful mind.

21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-14 08:00:43	i'm starting 2 feel very gd about myself and life. I know how hard life has been and im gd right now and that's all I can ask 4
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-14 07:56:54	got up early this morning to go to sleep earlier tonight but not even tired.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-13 04:00:18	even this week when I had a bug. well I didn't think you really had a bug it was your mental health condition. NO IT WAS A TUMMY BUG!!!
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-13 03:57:35	she really does use it to try and knock me down sometimes and I am not letting her do that tonight.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-13 03:56:30	tonight i'm walking away because I don't feel up with her using my mental health as a way to put me down.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-13 03:54:37	if you don't want me to worry don't tell me how much pain u are in. if you want me to worry let me just get on with tidying.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-11-13 03:53:19	I sometimes feel I can never win. if I do the work for her she says I worry to much if I don't she says I don't care. #whatever

21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-06-13 00:03:35	Until I get a full diagnoses of a mental health condition that meds do help. I'm not taking any meds. #medsdonthelppdpatients
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-06-13 00:00:57	Meds don't work for all mental health problems and all people.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-06-12 23:51:55	I feel I want to learn to be in control no meds put things in place and so when I have my lows and my highs I'm still in control.

21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-06-12 23:43:44	[] for: it MAY stabilise my mood
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-06-12 23:43:08	[] against: there has been no proven research that scientist have found mental health problems are a chemical imbalance.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-06-12 23:41:31	So my question on my mind is meds or no meds? I been researching So much about this. So here are the 4's and against! []

21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 23:28:49	Ok I finished talking to myself :/
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 23:28:10	My mood-(10) I feel like I'm giving up just as I'm getting somewhere but maybe I can't fight any longer.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 23:26:50	My head- (9) I'm trying so hard to keep a bit of hope. I want a future I just don't see one. I want a life but maybe I want to much.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 23:25:00	My head- (8) if there was just a light at the end of the turn people talk about it but I can't see it. All I see is a cycling mood.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 23:23:30	My head- (7) I'm so scared about getting that agitation: energy and doing what my brain keeps think off.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 23:22:19	My head- (6) but I can't let my family find me I just want to vanish. Disappear from this pain but I'm so scared.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 23:20:35	My head- (5) I could easily put a razor to my wrist and sore at my ulnar artery and then just go in bath and let it happen. #disappear
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 23:18:51	My head- (4) I hate these drops in mood that I feel I can't or am to weak to control. But I can't do this anymore.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 23:17:22	My head- (3) I don't want to be dead as much as I just don't want to put my family and myself through this anymore.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 23:15:46	My head- (2) I feel guilty on how much I'm putting my family through. I hate myself for hurting my family. I wish I could just disappear.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 23:14:14	My head- (1) I feel lost, isolated and detached from society. I feel I have no hope, I'm worthless and guilty.
21430271	kc_fight4life	2014-05-30 22:42:15	@KatiMorton #katiFAQ (2/2) but now I'm scared b.c I'm going to put in mood stabilisers and I'm scared I will never fully recover.
