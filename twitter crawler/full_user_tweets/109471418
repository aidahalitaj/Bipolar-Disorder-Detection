109471418	monicasteans	2016-09-19 08:50:25	You. I'm beginning to learn I get what I want. Like I'm not ready to be in a relationship yep I'm 30 and I like to sleep alone and
109471418	monicasteans	2016-09-19 08:49:49	Or a white girl with a booty. But always back to your overly loyal smart beautiful black woman. Until she gets enough sense to leave
109471418	monicasteans	2016-09-19 08:48:56	Like when you would ONLY fuck with "redbone" chick with long ass hair and a girl that's Asian or Spanish girl. BRUH I'm dead

109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-11 21:06:19	If I find one more fine ass black man to be gay I'm going to fucking scream!

109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-10 09:29:22	How do you say congrats to someone that got married at 14 years old. Like wtf I was in 8th grade and I couldn't be married or pregnant

109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:32:55	Sorry BRUH no sympathy from this bitch
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:32:34	Now he's stuck with a women man for life because he thought with his dick and not his mind. And kept reminding me of how much his life sucks
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:31:37	Really I keep helping him. Supporting him and I become public enemy number one. I deserve better. He's mad at me because I cheated and
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:30:25	Divorcing her. Lied to me about everything. Wyatt why lie when you can tell me the truth. This is the last time u fight for you. I'm done !
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:29:19	I used to love him so much he kept blocking me and all he used me for was to complain about his immigrant wife he lied about divorcing hey
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:28:27	When you waste 5 years on a Nigga and he keeps you on strings with lies and manipulation and you realize you're better than him
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:22:56	Man. Like really appreciated on a sexual level
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:22:34	Asian woman but I just don't get it . Plus he is open about his sexuality and opened me up too. It's the first time I feel loved by a black
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:21:16	Woman. Like I want to dig into the fact he has a white woman when the first night we were in bed talking he said he will marry a black or an
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:20:20	Hard knowing your spot in this said relationship. Like the sex is ridiculous but he doesn't meet me on an intimate level because he has a
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:19:17	I'm totally open to have conversation. Like I'm in a relationship with a polyamorous black man it's hard we have a connection but it's mad
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:18:06	Because ayo black men and women can we talk first before I have sex with you. Let's get really intimate. Share your darkest secrets men!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:16:59	But it still bothers me immensely being passed up by Black men for white women. And y'all niggas don't be giving two shits about us
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:15:49	But I feel bad as if I'm still in the wrong color. Ahhh to be White in America?The power would be mine. But I'll stick with #blackgirlmagic
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:14:21	Dating interracially and see what happens instead of saving myself for the right Black man to come around. If other men will have me.
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:13:11	Because it's so fucking hard and tiring fighting for y'all when you ain't got my back. I wasn't into it at first but I'm going to start
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:12:16	Btw some white women are cool but honestly black boys/men I beg of you please support me and the rest of black girls/women
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:11:14	White man reminds him of rape and that white women sex is like a big fuck your to racists white men. Black boys your reasoning is flawed
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:10:18	My black male acquaintance says that it's totally okay for a black man to seek sex with women but a black woman willingly have sex with a
109471418	monicasteans	2016-06-09 17:09:09	So Twitter what's the reasoning again why black men love white women so much?! For purely sexual reasons?! Spill the tea black men!!!

109471418	monicasteans	2016-05-22 16:28:06	When TJ leaves my life in a few weeks/months I will be grateful that he showed me how amazing loving would be. Some men care about sex.

109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-11 02:46:13	I have my own problems and issues and worrying about cultural wrongs by cops, celebrities and coworkers doesn't help me own mental health
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-11 02:45:34	I'm almost at a point where I'm about to say fuck this shit. And seriously not give a shit about black folks
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-11 02:44:57	Because some find and say that all black folks are the same and that's why they won't date us. We're too loud, too ghetto, too Concious
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-11 02:44:16	I hate how as a black woman I get stomped on by men how don't understand my general dislike of black men/women who date outside of race

109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-11 02:29:52	And my country America loves labels because it's easier to put everything in a box that's nice and neat
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-11 02:29:08	Just a thought. It won't happen just like talking about race in America will never change. Because honestly we are curious and
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-11 02:28:20	And should we get rid of blogs, articles, conventions and books for "mixed raced people" and "tragic mulatto stories" too?!
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-11 02:27:30	You know I just thought of something if we all want to be one with race should we get rid of the terms "multiracial" or "biracial"
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-10 21:26:51	When your good sex is good and you can't do shit about it. Fuck man, never have great sex with someone you can't have!

109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-10 07:06:38	@ObiNwike if you're offended that's your thing but some men will swear off women of a certain color that's clearly wrong too
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-10 07:05:39	@ObiNwike no all interracial relationships are about self hatred but some are. Sometimes people clearly can't or don't want to deal
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-10 07:02:14	I'm going to start dating again when the spring time hits. I love dating when it's warm out
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-10 06:58:51	I talk about race often it doesn't make me a bad person just observant. And often I discuss white privilege. My friends know the real me
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-10 06:58:10	@blatantlygabby he's been annoying
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-10 06:57:37	@ObiNwike but basically some black folks can't deal with being black and they date outside their race.....

109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-10 06:56:34	@ObiNwike it seems that a lot of women/men married outside the race can self hate. He likened Beyoncés Super Bowl dancers outfits

109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-05 16:50:37	Thoughts between Truth and Childish Gambino and amber rose being horrible towards me. Woah nightmare city

109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-03 21:07:40	I wish I could be open on Facebook about my mental illness. Bipolar disorder is so tough. I'm medicated and I'm still anxious and it sucks
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-03 20:56:16	Sometimes childish Gambino don't say shit that makes sense but he's so fly. So I'm currently obsessed with him this week on Spotify
109471418	monicasteans	2016-02-03 19:23:56	I wasn't ready to be ft needed some more time. Because it's rushed and I'm far from better. Back to bad side effects for hydroxyzine

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-26 21:02:39	I felt so sorry that everyone will look at him and his outbursts and write him off. Clearly he needs medication.
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-26 21:01:53	Because everyone can't do that. They're brain wants too but somethings don't work that way. I saw a man this morning clearly out of it.

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-24 08:57:04	You get judged for your true feelings and that's bullshit too.
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-24 08:55:59	It's like I feel so villianized for not being comfortable with everything trans, gay, and protesting for every cause.
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-24 08:53:10	Being trans is hard on everyone!!!!! The family included. And I still won't be comfortable seeing my son in a dress and heels and makeup
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-24 08:52:00	Saying that if you're not comfortable with a transgender child then you don't deserve kids is complete bullshit! Being trans is hard.
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-24 08:50:47	Why do people get shamed for having an unpopular opinion against the "popular opinion"

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:39:38	As I silently listen to my heartbeat in my ear. I reflect and just listen to just the sound itself
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:32:27	I deserve love from someone that authentically loves the shit out of me. I don't have to beg or pled for his love.

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:17:24	@We_Got_The_Jazz I didn't say they didn't do shit but I don't have enough support I see from black men in rap, dating, sex, and relations
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:15:45	@We_Got_The_Jazz and you have to take responsibility for your kids!! Period no exclusives
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:15:22	@We_Got_The_Jazz but that doesn't give them a reason to up and leave these amazing black women and fail us to raise there kids without dads
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:14:31	@We_Got_The_Jazz because you said they should stay in there place in the back
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:13:57	@We_Got_The_Jazz one day we have to take responsibility for yourselves and stop always blaming racism. The hopes of our ancestors
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:13:17	@We_Got_The_Jazz lots of more growing to do. And look where black men are now? Not in the home like they are supposed to be.
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:12:21	@We_Got_The_Jazz that's very sexist man. Very sexist I expected for you too know better man. I see you have some more growing to do
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:11:40	@We_Got_The_Jazz that has nothing to do with it!!!! I damn sure don't have Black men. But if that's how you feel then I can't change you
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:10:26	@We_Got_The_Jazz so you really aren't going to name any of the "black women" that are responsible for change
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:09:53	@We_Got_The_Jazz he wouldn't be shit without Fannie Lou Hamer, or any other woman or man that we will know about
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:09:07	@We_Got_The_Jazz and his sexual exploits are important to speak on its important because cheating ruins families
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:08:34	@We_Got_The_Jazz there was some great women that took a backseat to his greatness and his hard work
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:08:07	@We_Got_The_Jazz just like Obama they needed to have the "face of civil rights" mlk was it but he's NOT responsible for all of it
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:07:26	@We_Got_The_Jazz ahhhhh man. But you should also know it's kinda political ya know
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:06:53	Because obviously you don't respect me
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:06:39	Where's the good in staying with a cheating man?! Please give me a reason. I'd be the woman that leaves and gets divorce
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:06:06	Do another.... Hypocrisy at it finest. Again why should I go back to my man if he doesn't respect me by cheating. Again what's the reason
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:05:24	Ouch even if a man is a "great" man and you go and cheat on your wife you also cheat on your family too. How can you preach one thing and
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-19 02:03:53	@We_Got_The_Jazz @_JackNForTweets well because it's the truth......

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-13 01:32:04	Because you have to work a second job because I have so many bills.

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-13 01:30:27	I'm learning some shit about myself. I have been deflecting a lot. Because, it's hard to confront the mistakes with yourself.
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-13 01:29:00	Advocate for yourself . Had an amazing convo with my girl shaquita. Man are evil. Lol. Had a discussion about Kayne.

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-08 20:57:03	@solomondsteeley morning
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-08 20:56:51	We live in such a "male dominated" society. It pisses me off
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-08 20:55:20	Shit about it because I make the baby although I'm being responsible for your sperm too. Lazy sons of bitches. Why do women suffer
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-08 20:54:28	So some Germans came up with male birth control and of course men go nuts. Selfish dicks. So I have to destroy my uterus and you don't say

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-06 01:30:03	Because living on the poverty line and below it is starting to annoy the shit out of me and her. It's unfair and I gotta pay this student
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-06 01:29:25	I need God to help me and guide me to the right career. And my sister too because I wasn't born to be dead broke forever.
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-05 17:43:15	@QuanYe I'm NOT Voting for her
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-05 17:40:45	Racism is alive and well. It's disgusting . And I'm not racist against white folks. I just get annoyed by my peoples' lack of privilege
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-05 17:15:39	@MoniquePressley thank you for being a cool attorney. Handling all your interviews with such class.

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-05 07:02:52	@yesitsalgebra "run and ride" is my song.
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-05 07:00:44	I'm clearly disgusted by the fact that a white man that doesn't even know me refers to racist jokes in my presence
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-05 06:59:56	@We_Got_The_Jazz I don't know man. But then again Nas says black babies were born with rhythm
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-05 06:56:30	@We_Got_The_Jazz and sadly they treat me better than some of my other friends. So they're are a few cool white peoples out there
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-05 06:55:50	@We_Got_The_Jazz nope they're definitely or there I have a few cool white male friends. They fully understand me and appreciate me
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-05 06:53:31	@We_Got_The_Jazz fuck yeah. But I have to say this some white men have no chill or swag. Ugh if I ever were to be with one he can't be goofy
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-05 06:49:01	@We_Got_The_Jazz we just po' black folks of we don't follow him we hatin' . I don't know what's wrong with black folks anymore I give up

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-05 06:43:10	I was so sleepy all day at work cannot wait to go home eat and then sleep
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 21:03:27	For me not to talk about or not see race.
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 21:02:07	Am I a racist. Nah just awake. Being a brown woman race isn't blind and enough though I've met some really great white people it's hard
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 21:00:27	White men why must be slightly racist . It's fucking gross you make it hard for me to like you
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 20:58:54	Granted some criminals are scum and need to be on death row
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 20:58:14	Now if they could pardon all the brown people on death row like they want to pardon the white one
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 20:55:00	Thank you Jesus

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 02:40:13	@We_Got_The_Jazz And i cannot find nothing whereas i see people out of work and babymommas got hubbies and not me?! #anissue
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 02:39:32	@We_Got_The_Jazz im NOT attracting academic black men like myself. It almost makes me think whats wrong with me? I work, no record or kids
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 02:38:49	@We_Got_The_Jazz the more i speak on black love i get bashed by my OWN.That includes family and friends.....I'm like wtf. Oh and by the way

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 02:02:33	@We_Got_The_Jazz then we're fucking stuck
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 02:01:22	@We_Got_The_Jazz omg I'm like . Blacks really fuck my head up big time. I have undying loyalty for what again?!
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 01:57:16	Black people and conspiracy theories
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 01:52:33	It crazy that we as humans can all look exactly the same no matter what race. I guess that makes us all basic
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 01:45:30	Like all white folks don't then why do we?! White people can bitch all day long, but black folks become mute. Like is your tongue cut out?!
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 01:44:36	Folks. It's like in American only a few mixed blacks and a very educated/poor "choice" blacks can speak for all of us. We get generalized
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 01:43:42	I don't want to lose my focus. Black people make you feel so ashamed to speak the truth. Like they're continuously trying to protect white
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-04 01:30:05	@We_Got_The_Jazz why do only black academics get "air time" when it comes to race in America? Like people like me and you don't have value
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-03 23:52:07	Black people I repeat do not shade or degrade attorney Monique Pressley. She has a job to do. Period . She is allowed to defend him
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-03 23:51:10	Watch what you do or say?! The United state of public opinion will destroy you.... I.e. Bill Cosby?! If he did do it shame and jail time
109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-03 09:43:56	So I couldn't help myself and I texted him to see how his New Years was and he text me back and says can I come over until 11 and I said yes

109471418	monicasteans	2016-01-01 12:00:36	Men can be completely insensitive when it comes to females that have been raped. Just because you don't get it doesn't mean it didn't happen

109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 23:28:25	Why don't black peoples get more air time to talk about fixing black on black violence. We have become complacent. And violence continues

109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 12:28:56	@We_Got_The_Jazz I started on it later in life BUT. You can't tell a woman what to do with her sex life
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 12:28:01	@We_Got_The_Jazz you sound like you guys become dumb as fuck
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 12:27:44	@We_Got_The_Jazz negro did you just say vulnerable because of an erection
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 12:26:46	@We_Got_The_Jazz what you just said about birth control
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 12:26:04	@We_Got_The_Jazz yeah and I've been on it since I was 24
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 12:25:42	@We_Got_The_Jazz I just can't with you right now
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 12:20:06	@We_Got_The_Jazz I don't know man ..... I would say y'all still lack accountability
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 12:19:20	@We_Got_The_Jazz wow! So everyday that I'm horny I have to remind you of what to do
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 12:18:54	@We_Got_The_Jazz are you serious! That's fucking foolish.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 12:00:24	@We_Got_The_Jazz guaranteed for a fact women will give up sex and reevaluate their lives. Will men ever do the same and speak up?! Waiting
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:58:22	@We_Got_The_Jazz you get called pussies if you respect yourself and you're not willing to give up your dick because of desires of flesh
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:57:02	@We_Got_The_Jazz no men think like that. No man talks like that. Applauding men for being virgins, chaste and respectful
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:56:16	@We_Got_The_Jazz it's so easy to say I'm worth more than your sex. Men gotta lock that shit down more often. And just know you're worth it
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:54:47	@We_Got_The_Jazz true and men and boys got to make each other accountable and not be so "giving of dick on demand"
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:53:57	@We_Got_The_Jazz everybody ducks everybody hence std rate being high for women and men. Nobody talks about it. Come on you know that
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:45:19	@We_Got_The_Jazz we Asa community need to make love more . We need more love
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:40:50	@We_Got_The_Jazz always wear condoms. Most people don't
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:40:34	@We_Got_The_Jazz what happens when you're in a relationship and you're not married
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:30:31	@We_Got_The_Jazz and maybe men need to not have unprotected sex. see you're saying shit on emotion not logic. I can feel you're hurt
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:29:10	@We_Got_The_Jazz i.e. Chris brown does dumb shit on emotion not logic
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:28:52	@We_Got_The_Jazz damn sure not based off of logic my love. Based on emotion
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:28:33	@We_Got_The_Jazz and if men think "logically" why do y'all do so much fucked up shit. Men do shit on emotion as well. Why do men murder ?
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:27:06	@We_Got_The_Jazz ouch !!!!!! But I absolutely disagree nah. Y'all don't have all y'all shit together
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:24:28	@We_Got_The_Jazz we need to fucking communicate more and OFTEN
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:24:08	@We_Got_The_Jazz it's difficult ain't it. Not just women are broken. Men treat women like shit because they're broken as well
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:04:54	@We_Got_The_Jazz okay plz tell me what they are
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:03:59	@epicarthouse @We_Got_The_Jazz I keep finding some black men that claim are "conscious" but date white women and only fuck black women
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 11:01:29	About to take a sleeping pill

109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 07:52:08	@We_Got_The_Jazz she was like it's not about race he's a nasty pedophile and then she says everything is not about race and I said yes it is
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 07:51:35	@We_Got_The_Jazz I just argued with my sister about the nasty pedophile r kelly. I was like they wouldn't drag him in the mud he was white

109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 01:32:35	I promise black men I forgive you for your tom foolery. Get over yourself. Get out of your feelings and love yourself. Your pity party
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 01:31:42	Black men sometimes your self hatred oozes through your pores. Sometimes you get diarrhea of the mouth and you speak some stupid shit.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-30 01:30:56	Black women, some times black men come for our necks. Don't let that bother/anger you . Just press on with your fly self!!!!

109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 11:39:07	Having the worst luck finding a brown man
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 06:03:50	Dinner time
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 00:44:32	I have to work on the fact that I need to work on myself a lot . Like a whole lot but I've also made progress
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 00:41:19	And I don't know what happened but my love for black men is out of control. I can now have brown babies and be okay with it.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 00:40:50	I also learned how thirsty males are out here and learned about tinder and the love that white boys have for me is unreal
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 00:39:02	@QuanYe fuck that noise! I hate snow
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 00:38:48	Felt great naked, brought a great smelling candle, lost one of my bestirs, and I've grown so much this year
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 00:38:01	Started meds again, started counseling, started to evaluate myself, gave my sister some honest advice. Been through lonely nights
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 00:37:13	Got an iPhone,laughed my ass off, put myself through turmoil with stupid niggas, laughed some more. Hated on some people
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 00:36:01	And I joined a meet up group, met some great people, working part time at a daycare, kissed a really hot man, make a great pitbull
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 00:35:19	In 2015 my ex really left me, a lover left me, I worked fast food and full time, I got a job and got fired. Gained a new job, started dating
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-19 00:34:35	Even though I'm still sad about a few things and depression is still high I'm doing a fucking lot better than this time last year
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-18 13:35:44	Well the person you put your is done with but you weren't expecting it. This is why I have #trustissues ! Everyone ALWAYS Leaves Me

109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-18 01:19:28	@We_Got_The_Jazz hahahaha it's not like he even cute like that. African girls lobe white men
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-18 01:17:51	I really enjoy the teasing part though
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-18 01:17:35	So the story goes he says he has work but he probably doesn't. Man men are so very predictable
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-17 23:14:39	But...... I just gotta say No!!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-17 23:14:20	I want a relationship so I took off all my dating sites and tinder off so let's see what happens
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-17 23:11:42	When is present and you want a real relationship and be looking good and he kisses good . Girl run! Because will hurt in the long run!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-17 23:10:35	So apparently I think I won't be married but i also have to partly accept that I'm not ready to stop doing what I am. Then I suffer
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-17 21:20:12	I need not to be single so I can wake up and having morning
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-17 21:13:26	Second time he asked and I'm like what the fuck?!

109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-16 20:45:59	I love how people think depression is a choice or that mental illness is a choice. Is Cancer a choice?!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-16 20:41:23	Especially doing this shit alone few friends, lovers, family don't understand it. Sad but true. It's hard out here man.

109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-16 20:39:11	Just kill myself because you can't and won't take the hurt anymore. I keep fighting because I want to make something out of myself

109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-16 20:37:32	Living with mental illness is not easy their is a lot of loneliness, loss hope, suicidal thoughts that NEVER go away! No anti depressants
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-16 20:31:17	That's why I love Twitter
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-16 20:31:07	And nah I'm far from racist but just beyond aggravated about a lot of shit. Some say it's mania and I say it's overstimulated.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-16 20:30:18	We care more about kayne and Kim more than blacks killing blacks. Crime in our own communities and white people fucking up!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-12-16 20:28:55	My generation and the generation after me is lost. They don't like to discuss the influence of race in America they rather be colorblind.

109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-30 02:05:36	@We_Got_The_Jazz I just really enjoy the flow and overall activism/positive flow of hip hop. I gets down with ratchet stuff too
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-30 02:04:53	@We_Got_The_Jazz I have to check them out. I think one song by digable planets. Don't hate me because I don't know all old school hip hop
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-30 02:03:33	@We_Got_The_Jazz *it. Idk I'm at a crossroads. The more I support them the more it blows up in my face. I still feel #blacklove is sparse.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-30 02:02:10	@We_Got_The_Jazz back to black men. Some of the men have ambition, some degrees ....patience is hard. Sex is sex. I don't blame them for it
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-30 02:01:02	@We_Got_The_Jazz I've been a fan of Nas since I was 7 thanks to my bro. Fan of true hip hop. Love gang Starr, common, the roots,
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-30 01:56:33	@We_Got_The_Jazz I love them both. Rap today suckssss
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 21:54:54	All he does is sleep
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 14:29:13	And He's knocked out drunk. Its my fault
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 10:58:40	@We_Got_The_Jazz well it depends on the man. Most want sex but a few men want just to be friends just depends on the date
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 10:57:04	@We_Got_The_Jazz my type is all over the place everyone from thugs to hippies to hipsters to educated and what not
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 10:55:30	@We_Got_The_Jazz I absolutely do have a type
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 10:52:38	@We_Got_The_Jazz I sure hope so. I'm educated and I can't find one to keep me
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 10:49:30	@We_Got_The_Jazz ya ya ya but still......
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 10:47:03	@We_Got_The_Jazz I still think we may choose y'all over y'all chooses us.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 10:41:19	For Aaron... Because it feels good to sleep next him. pic.twitter.com/eELFqRLJx1
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 10:31:09	@We_Got_The_Jazz that's so nice to know . I thought I would be in trouble . Maybe it's my location
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 08:27:36	@rozordie liessssssss
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 08:27:07	@rozordie dude was supposed to come over but didn't . Why must men lie
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 08:20:56	@rozordie hey girl
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 04:32:32	It's like the more I love men of color the more they shit all over me?! #confused
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 04:31:39	Why do men find it funny to fuck with you. One day the fuckery will be too much
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 02:31:54	@mikeviimusic because we live in America
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 02:30:20	White feminism just kills me. I'm NOT a typical feminist. I'm NOT a typical Black Woman Protestor! I am a black woman in a fucked up America
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 01:58:12	If black men can date outside their race and be complimented... Why don't I get any love. It goes straight to the white girls!!HELP PLEase
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 01:57:10	Why is it so hard to date men of color outside my race?!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-29 01:56:51	I really want to date an Asian man!!!! Ughhh why don't they like me?!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-28 03:28:14	Damn my sis and I just trying to be heard
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-28 03:28:03	Leave it up too lots of white folks talking about mental illness and only one or two black folks talk about it.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-28 00:44:18	I have to do better because I keep fucking up
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-27 22:27:26	For the first time I think I can say deuces to people I love the most. Peace of mind is paramount
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-27 22:14:38	In 2016 I have a lot of work to do. I hope God gives me the strength and right mind to complete all my goals
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-27 22:14:07	But healthy is healthy. And sometimes you gotta let family go. If it's not good for your health don't be bothered
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-27 22:13:32	It's kinda selfish to distance yourself from people you love. Especially when they helped you when you when in your time of need
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-27 22:12:47	I hope one day she realizes she can control some of her actions. Clearly I'm pissed at both of them. My siblings..... They both know better
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-27 22:12:00	When the storm has came in and you can't do shit to fix and it's not your fault but you geeked blamed
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-27 22:11:26	One day you'll grow up and know that you're worth more than just a one night stand or fly by night
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 22:56:21	Next year I want my drivers license and a full time job at the daycare and new apartment while I work to find a full time state job #goals
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 22:54:56	This sleeping human. That's my sister. I miss her so much. I gotta try my hardest to get my license next year pic.twitter.com/n66V6xcmKH
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 22:46:25	I need help shopping for my sis!!!! Help me. I need cute styles that match her personality and body too.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 22:45:51	Fat shaming sucks. It happened to me and I have to stop doing it too others. Gotta teach women how to dress for your size
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 22:34:44	@DanMerriweather happy thanksgiving
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 22:34:27	@DanMerriweather is everything. I love how he supports the #BlackLivesMatter movement. I love his music but this is so cool
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 21:19:06	My feet are killing me
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 21:19:06	Friday it's a sister day I'm taking my sister out for pizza, Virgin Shirley temples and ice cream. She needs it!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 21:19:06	I'm totally convinced that white people grew up with zero manners
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 07:57:18	@rozordie I'll be with my family. Hopefully laughing my ass off and getting full and hope to god no drama. Tonight we going out though.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 06:53:55	@rozordie happy thanksgiving a day early lady
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 06:25:24	Not really but ....
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 06:25:15	I'm seriously about to move to the hood.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 06:25:02	Can someone get me some #whiteboyrepellent please!!!!!!! Ughh why don't the men of color like me. Fuck Albany is killing me.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-26 05:57:00	When you're fine and then everything and sound annoys the fuck out of you. #hypersensitive #annoyed
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 20:49:34	I know black love is possible.... Why haven't I found it yet. As much as black men get on my nerves I still love them. The beauty is REAL
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 20:46:15	But commit everything in your power and all your support to a white woman. How dare you call me out my name and worship her in the next.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 20:45:34	Didn't raise you to be a "player" or reckless with your mouth. Or a man who desires nothing more than "booty" from a black girl
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 20:44:28	I just can't anymore. They hurt me so bad. I kinda expect it when white men but some of y'all make my heart hurt. I know ya momma
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 20:43:45	First Michael b Jordan and some other no name rapper hating on black women but they want Kim Kardashian?! How can I support you?
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 20:42:48	Because clearly some black men got they priorities fucked up. These black men have gone crazy. Talking out they neck about our women!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 20:41:38	Maybe my blind support for a people that don't give two shits about me should stop or I should just give up. #blackinamerica
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 20:17:43	@QuanYe Ughhhh isn't it the worse
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 20:17:11	@absoul @JheneAiko @CaseyVeggies make amazing music together. I can listen all day!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 18:26:23	This black thanksgiving is #everything
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 07:40:37	As much as I'm trying to be open to white men I just can't....... Because lord chocolate is so good !!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 01:36:52	My white man gotta have swag. He gotta be super cute, intellectual.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 01:36:14	So my friend says that I shouldn't limit myself to only dating men of color. But they sexier though.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 01:20:37	Second time I've been called a nympho. I should seek help.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-25 00:40:29	Just scheduled my first driving lesson 1/9/16
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-24 00:17:37	When you pay for your bus ticket and you find out you lost it.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-23 10:32:22	I hate being single. How do I change that
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-23 10:31:59	@rozordie you ever turn a dude out?!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-23 10:31:29	Social media is a BEAST! @aaroncarter is making a comeback!!! Wait for the next album to Drop! It's gonna be
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-23 10:29:54	When you turn a guy out?!

109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-23 10:09:00	When you've met this sexy black man and you can't have him because he's unavailable to you. Lord why must you tease me!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-23 10:08:13	@rozordie what?!

109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-22 06:34:14	@rozordie girlllllllllll there's nothing sexier than a black man
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-22 06:33:57	@rozordie sex was awkward but it was so nice to have a strong man In my bed this morning
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-22 03:44:27	@rozordie why is it always like that ?! Find a cool , chill guy and it doesn't work out
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-22 03:37:29	@rozordie best , weirdest experience ever!

109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-22 03:34:15	@rozordie
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-22 03:34:06	@rozordie you know the rest. Sadly it was a one time thing and it's sad because the height ruined everything
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-22 03:33:23	@rozordie a 6'3 very masculine black man
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-22 03:31:20	@rozordie girllll I have some tea to tell you
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-21 01:47:56	@RichieBrave hahaha

109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-21 01:01:40	This week is ass! Fucking worse week ever
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-21 00:38:56	But tonight I need to get laid but looks like that shit isn't going to happen this weekend so I'm pissed
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-21 00:38:18	In December I gotta get on my grind
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-20 22:03:52	It's all types of cold
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-20 00:26:41	Be nice to me and my sister. Today is a tough day for us . @monique_charity
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-19 23:05:53	The mania is gone and now just anxiety rolled in
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-19 21:38:15	ADHD and bipolar just don't mix. I need meds that work and a job that will understand my diagnosis.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-19 21:05:53	@rozordie that's my girl
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-19 21:05:24	Prayers up for the world and especially for my twin sis and myself. We need stability and deserve stability
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-18 22:41:55	@ComplexMag only in Texas
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-18 13:37:01	I'm wide awake and not happy about it
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-18 10:30:22	Had the most amazing time at my meet up group
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-17 01:24:02	I'm trying to find my man. A mixture of culture consciousness and sexy and smart and beautiful thinker and writer. In love with black
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-17 01:23:01	I saw a couple today at the bus side. She with braids and him with dreds. So beautiful
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-17 01:20:34	Like I told my friend .... Black men are so hot but y'all get on my nerves sometimes. #sincerelyloverofblackmen
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-16 07:14:06	Where's my KING at?!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-16 00:47:23	Note, not all white folks are bad. But some of the shit y'all say is reckless as fuck.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-16 00:46:29	White folks lucky as fuck. #whiteprivilege
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-16 00:45:57	White folks should STOP complaining. They can speak on any issue they choose without having to stand up for an "entire race"
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-15 23:21:00	@rozordie can't watch that anymore
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-15 06:32:06	@monique_charity it's so disgusting Mona. Ppl are going nuts over Islam. Stupid racist bastards!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-15 06:30:00	Times of tragedy being out blatant racism in my country. I'm so embarrassed at some of my countries soldiers. Some are racist...
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-15 06:06:12	I don't know If I'll ever be comfortable being completely alone. Nope I don't think so
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-15 04:09:41	@KWestSavali you know white folks... Every time something happens the "real phobias" pop up
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-15 04:07:43	Now you know how it feels... Zero fucks given
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-15 04:07:27	Completely fucking up your countries. Everyone forgets everything..... I felt sorry for her ass and then I said NOPE. Welcome to America
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-15 04:06:22	And how the "great "white hope" white women" came in and checked on her. Asians love white folks.... You know they are responsible for
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-15 04:05:32	I give zero fucks to that Asian girl that got called out for feeling "fear after she felt afraid of a black man" "harassing" her.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-15 04:04:17	I get so sick of how racist my country is... Especially fucking white folks .... And some Asians too.... So Americans y'all be outta pocket
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-14 17:19:53	Now me ish and Ericka off on our way to Denny's! Been out all night!!! I'm so ready to sleep
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-14 07:15:09	Before the end of 2016 I need to have a drivers license And a better job
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-14 00:19:14	Have a date tonight with my little cousin
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-13 23:09:48	Praying I can find a better job so I can get another apartment
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-12 21:20:19	How does that make sense
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-12 21:20:10	They say I have to be comfortable being alone. It's a sinking feeling. You're asking a severely depressed girl to be okay with being alone
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-12 20:37:55	Fighting is a daily routine. There is no media coverage, no medal, no empathy but only a secret pain only some understand.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-12 20:37:03	Because mental illness shouldn't be taken lightly. Some days are better than others. I know, I press hard everyday so I can LIVE!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-12 20:35:26	To everyone that woke up this morning but wanted to "end" it. It's good man. Proud of you. Life is rough as Fuck. I know the feeling .
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-12 19:57:07	Having a really rough time emotionally and severe depression has hit and is crazy now holidays approach
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-11 23:47:50	Pray for me y'all it's going to be hard but much needed
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-11 23:47:30	I'm going to try a sex free few months so I can get my mind right
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-11 22:11:57	What an asshole instead of being mature he blocks me. Real mature WAE?! Whenever you need me I'm here... Not anymore . What a waste
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-11 09:57:34	@rozordie join the club.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-11 09:52:25	@rozordie enjoy
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-11 09:47:53	Disrespectful and then want to shit all over us and want all the help from us. Just to leave us for kimmy. She wifey right. The hate
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-11 09:46:47	It's real sad when some black men hate they own women!!!! Like negro you must hate yourself and your momma because she gave birth to you!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-11 09:45:22	@rozordie @latry I have one like that up here in ny. But loves to call me. Whenever he wants something
109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-11 09:44:56	@rozordie @latry they all be like that!!!! Always, always, the secret fetish to like there own women.... It's a damn shame

109471418	monicasteans	2015-11-02 02:21:39	The saddest part of ending a friendship/relationship is knowing that you have to let that person grow and develop without you.

109471418	monicasteans	2015-10-27 12:14:30	Sex sucks so much. Sex is the worse. Bad partners, bad life. The worse part is that you're used too it.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-10-27 12:13:23	This is the time I wish when I didn't have sex ever. Sex leads to depression and low self esteem and disappointment and loneliness

109471418	monicasteans	2015-09-27 07:08:52	Child sexual abuse is no joke. Be very careful you never know how those children turn out.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-09-27 05:55:07	This movie Mississippi Damned is good it's just so sad how people get abused and kids turn into damaged adults.

109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:33:21	@ProducerSnafu in less than one year i went from an office job to mcdonalds to another low paying job. So I literally started at the top
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:32:38	@ProducerSnafu queen of excuses ..... one day I pray to get better. And not to be so damned scared of failure and life.

109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:31:21	@rozordie I was trying to connect with more people that look like me.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:29:59	@ProducerSnafu making/caring babies is a real concern with the meds too.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:27:51	@ProducerSnafu it's like you never fucking win. #fuckbipolar
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:27:27	@ProducerSnafu umm dude side effects of meds..... not cool you need like a month to two months to heal... it fucking sucks.ughh
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:26:23	It feels good to get this instant support on twitter about bipolar disorder. wish I could meet people in person
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:24:29	@ProducerSnafu right now I'm definitely not stable enough. Eventually when I get back on meds and go to counseling again
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:23:24	@BipolarGoggles I have to push myself to get back to the pdoc.

109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:17:35	@AJameelLikeGod you have BP disorder. ... its refreshing POC being honest about the illness.much love for that man.

109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:12:30	@BipolarBrink I know you're just diagnosed there is going to be a roller coaster of constant emotions. Sometimes go through it. it's okay.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:10:18	Will I ever get to have my dream of spreading awareness about mental health without a masters. How do I make this a paying job?
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:07:43	@BipolarUs I wish more black people were honest about the struggles of bipolar. I was diagnosed 3 years ago and it's a constant struggle.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:04:31	I always get scared who will want to be my boyfriend, finace, husband because I have bipolar disorder I too deserved to be loved too.

109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:02:11	To be black and mentally ill in America is horrifying.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:01:44	No one knows how crippling this mental illness is. Most days I feel I can't go on. Do you know how terrifying that is #black twitter
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 09:00:40	@monique_charity goes by the book with meds and all and I'm scared to death of everything letting my bipolar trample my life.
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 08:59:47	God I wish more people than me and @monique_charity spoke openly about bipolar disorder
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 08:58:37	@rozordie do you have BP disorder or is that just your name?
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 08:49:00	However I'm not against marrying another person of color. But my kids will be cultured beautiful and brown like me!!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 08:47:44	Now, nothing is sexier than a black man. Something so sexy about his color and skin. #black beauty #sexyblackmen #brownonbrownlove
109471418	monicasteans	2015-08-01 08:45:49	It's so true "Once You Go Black" yes gawd!!!! Because 10 years ago I was sure I'd marry a white man just to have mixed babies.

109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 20:46:16	I love what's he done for me. Put shit in perspective for me as far as men and sex. He made me realize I'm worth it!
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 20:45:23	The kind of love when you look at you partner and you smile he's really made me a new woman in the past 8 months.
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 20:44:12	I've grown so much in 9 years I cannot believe I felt "safe" for the first time in 9 years. No guilt just pure, safe, passionate love
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 20:39:59	I Love my Brown men!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 20:39:49	And a 50% chance i marry a black man. Still on my biracial babies things just if definitely will be with a man that's brown like me.
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 20:38:12	Damn these fine was light skin men.... I have an addiction to them. So my husband will be one of the following : Spanish , Indian , Asian
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:30:08	My best male white friends Aaron a med student and brad a law student
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:29:30	Very cool white friends which are VERY few but I love them non the less not fake they understand white privilege and work against it!
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:28:34	I'm very cautious what people i let into my life. I have my "street" family and my friends for life. Intelligent people of color and cool
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:27:09	Im stating to come "full circle" almost with my "blackness" but don't get it jacked up I will punch you if you disrespect me.
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:26:08	Do what my mom did appreciate and learn Black culture while learning about other cultures at a young age and now I crave diversity !
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:24:30	And I'm considered a "revolutionary" or "extremist" or "racist" but no one has issues with st. Patty's day or "Columbus Day"
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:22:57	I hate the feeling of possibly have to explain why people may hate my babies because of they're beautiful melanin! It's funny I "self-love"
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:21:56	"Unclean" "Rachet" "ghetto" "ulgy" "pretty for a Black Girl" it's exhausting. I still struggle with my brown skin and having black kids
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:20:37	And treated like shit because I was dark when I could be "mixed" and I would be considered "desirable" and "exotic" instead of "bad" "lazy"
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:19:09	Because America has a HUGE problem with "dark girls/women" I mean I wished I was white for 14+ years. Why would I want to be chocolate
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:17:52	But how do they talk to her about her Culture and her birth parents, and really begin to learn although she's different she's still pretty
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:16:40	They're conscious in ways they shouldn't be. But they had a Little Black girl will be raised as Jewish which I have no problem with
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:15:39	I was jacked up yesterday a young Jewish man bag hrs wife adopted 9 kids and that's AMAZING and BUT I saw the kids act like little robots
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:13:48	I feel like I'm growing stronger as a Black Woman. I wish we could all get along but "guilt driven white folks aren't agreeing with me"
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:12:44	Racist, uncaring or labeled "it's not my problem" they hate when I talk about "white privilege" it's like I'm the elephant in the room!
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 18:10:46	White Liberals are something else. Starting to think some white people care about social justice because if they don't then they'll be
109471418	monicasteans	2014-04-14 00:29:36	Started from the bottom and now I'm here! Me in 1999 and now! Thank god I turned out to be a pretty… http:// instagram.com/p/mvJwrFHVWH/

109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-11 23:40:02	Jesus people don't post negative ass news about someone Getting shot or Killed
109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-11 18:59:28	Because I'd think I would cheat if I had sex with another person and he/she was better than my husband we would have an elicit affair.
109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-11 18:57:28	ATTN men women are not: whores, tramps, sluts. Just sexually experiencing life. I would never wish i was a virgin when I got married.

109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-11 18:53:23	I can cook, clean, work, take care of the kids and yet still someone will find me sexy. No one owns me but me! And my vagina is MINE!
109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-11 18:35:27	I used to wish that I was white 12 years ago BUT I began to learn to love my brown self. I don't have to deal with "white privilege"
109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-11 11:48:33	By the way people..... "Lies They Tell" pregnancy is not all that it seems! It's painful and quiet frankly I don't want to be a mutant
109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-11 11:47:30	I'm only getting pregnant 3 times and if when I'm marriage we desire baby number 4 then okay but 3 is perfect for me!!!!

109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-10 21:45:13	Because If I hear one more raggedity man talk out how women should know how to cook and clean and give you sex and still take care of you
109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-10 21:43:59	Maybe if Black Men want better Black Women then SOME of you need to stop bitching, take care of your shit, uplift your women!
109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-10 21:42:25	It's must be nice not to be Mayor of Newark.... You're out of the hood Mr Cory booker

109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-10 19:53:51	Then what does that make me?! People should be one to judge dumb asses oral sex is still sex. Just because they're isn't penetration....
109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-10 19:53:05	And why they gotta have so many damn kids this is not the 1930's and y'all are not on a damn farm?! Going at it like rabbits! #closetfreaks
109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-10 19:51:41	I'm 100% sure young "Christian" Couples get married so early so they can have "sin-less" sex. sex without marriage is an abomination!
109471418	monicasteans	2014-03-10 18:34:56	Jesus, I can't believe how racist America is!!!!

109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-29 17:15:06	If one more black person gets an Oscar for playing a crook, whore, or domestic I'm going to Fuckin scream.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-29 16:51:35	We're all guilty of basing in joy of seeing others feelings get hurt when we're mad. BTW, this shit sucks

109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-29 16:45:52	God knows we tried to get our shit together! I will talk about sex, race, mental illness, drugs, intervention until I die. Get over it!!!

109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-18 22:26:23	The military needs to understand that lots of people mask mental illness to get in the military it's no surprise to me why suicide happens
109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-18 22:25:35	I mean I'd be dead, just another statistic and a veteran commits suicide and it gets national news coverage. We aren't robots
109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-18 22:22:54	This was your choice no one put a gun to your head and said join the military!!! I'm appalled how some of our veterans act
109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-18 22:22:09	I support our veterans but seriously they're hasn't been a draft in years!!!!! And people bitch and moan about themselves remember
109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-18 22:21:25	Use mental health services the government pours millions every year to the VA and still suicides exist. Mental health care need to change
109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-18 22:20:27	Government should work together to give all the same/fair mental health care to ALL. So, I continue to suffer... How many Veterans
109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-18 11:13:12	I have to count my blessing that suicide didn't take away my life. I'm not one of the 5%!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-18 11:07:04	I keep smiling and doing the best I can but i have to remind myself I'm sick!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-07-18 11:06:34	For the truth, seriously I feel like booty!!! today is a mental health low to be real! Emotional day. Feeled with dread!

109471418	monicasteans	2013-06-25 11:43:23	Because let's be honest who wants to hear a person who's severely depression and severely mentally ill say "I'm okay for now" at this second
109471418	monicasteans	2013-06-25 11:42:28	I figured out when people ask you "How are You" if you can't say "everything's great" they don't have time to listen

109471418	monicasteans	2013-06-03 23:37:08	My success is waking up and getting through each day. That's it. It literally drives me crazy to think otherwise.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-06-03 23:36:20	It's just sad that they will never listen and mental illness and success to them means my salary of $56,000/year.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-06-03 23:34:12	If she thinks I'm inadequate I wonder what she thinks about her parents

109471418	monicasteans	2013-06-03 04:46:24	I think I'm always semi understand why people don't come around the family anymore! I totally get it!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-06-03 04:42:38	Some bitches are fuckin' heartless!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-06-03 04:42:26	So many mixed emotions.... I think the fave part was hearing I'm a hypochondriac and that I have a Wikipedia illness.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-06-03 04:32:41	I know some of the most unsupportive people in my life. None happen to be friends.......

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-31 09:34:38	I fell for the $300,000 college dream and now they wanna garnish wages of more than $2000/month?! FML

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-30 22:45:45	John Stamos is that dude that could wear a trash bag and still be sexy!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-30 21:52:42	Yep, I said it!!!! That's totally true..... How can you tell someone they aren't "gay enough" for gay culture. How Rude!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-30 21:51:51	People often talk about gay bashing but what about gay people that say you can't fit into the "gay culture" there's hatred everywhere
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-30 19:02:55	I forgot something at work!!!! Dammit
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-30 13:48:04	But really though it sucks being attracted to someone that doesn't like you the same way. I absolutely hate it
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-30 13:45:42	I would have never been attracted to black men. I swore them off 8 years ago and now I can't get enough.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-30 13:45:12	Damn I wish I had a picture of him. Wait i do. I think he's the cutest. It's funny 7 years ago I would've never pic.twitter.com/wobLyeT1Tq

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-30 13:36:58	Adopted Black babies in Hollywood are the hottest accessory, everyone has got to have one. What happens to those kids family?!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-30 13:02:48	You can't just massacre people and get away with it because because you we're drunk and high, I blame the military!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-30 13:01:59	I think Robert bales should get the death penalty. Just because you're in a war zone does not mean you get a pass to murder people!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-30 00:40:02	I love this skirt!!!! http:// instagram.com/p/Z5xW4CHVS6/

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-22 18:20:27	It's funny people think I'm always negative and just can't wrap there heads around Mental illness. I get jealous sometimes.

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-16 20:49:18	Contemplating what I'm getting my cousin and his wife for there baby shower I'm going to miss

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-16 19:44:16	Like having biracial kids is going to solve my racial identity issues. Nah, they won't just resentment to my children and jealousies
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-16 19:43:31	I'm fixated on having biracial kids because it was torture growing up knowing I will never be more beautiful with my dark skin
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-16 19:42:31	Twitter, as you can tell I'm totally confused 99% of my life. I don't know what the Hell I'm doing with my Life anymore. #adulthood

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-16 18:11:27	No alcohol or pork... For the Muslims. The Muslims have beautiful calls to worship. Music to my ears but I could never convert.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-16 18:08:26	And the only reason I know of Malcolm Shabazz is because of Nas. He song "Purple" made me do research. How Nas, how I love you!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-16 18:07:26	RIP Malcolm But, I didn't know Muslims were allowed alcohol, I thought that was strictly forbidden. I may be wrong though?!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-16 18:04:02	Just imagine if Malcolm Shabazz was just any tragedy in Mexico. No fame... No name.,, it would have never been reported. #deadblacks

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 23:33:49	At 26 I have $85,500 in student debt, in poverty, no marriage or house or children, barely scrapping by. All I have are dreams
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 23:31:27	I thought at 26 I'd be married with kids and have a house with a $40,000/ year job. I was dead wrong. Instead no man, kids, or $40K.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 23:30:17	Through the past 7 years I've learned so much about people and continue to do so. I didn't think I'd be doing this at 26.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 20:01:31	So utterly confused by all men of ALL cultures but especially my own African American men!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 20:00:48	It's like damn you don't want to settle down ? Nah, But you know what it is? I'm a positive brother... You know... Helping my community.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:59:29	BTW, I love when " positive" men are changing the community but still have time for the occasional "quickie"
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:53:24	That's why I made a self commitment of 7 years to get my life together and find the right husband. Education is power!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:52:16	For women that have the option! Birth control is your best friend!!?!! Be your own cheerleader... Not ready for kids... Don't have any!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:51:21	Parents you need to do better! No excuses push, push, push hard! If you're not prepared to put work in don't get pregnant!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:50:26	Smart, intelligent some just use the system, others give up, some can't even read?! Wtf in 8th grade with a K reading level?! Parents
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:48:28	I know I can be super stubborn but I feel sometimes we don't push our kids enough. Especially in urban communities! I know those kids are...
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:47:25	I wasn't the Best student and got teased all throughout my schooling But was determined and worked tirelessly to do the Best I could.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:46:12	The human brain is an amazing thing! I struggle with learning so I get it. I struggled to get my college degree but I didn't give up!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:45:04	High expectations i know. I just want them to be smart and understand that there brains can you places a sport never could!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:44:02	It mystifies me.... As a future parent my children's grade have to be amazing for them to join any sports team... The must learn balance!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:42:47	Realistic option to get out the "hood" don't forget that books and education is just as cool if not more powerful
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:41:50	If a Black woman can be motivation without sports then men should have the same expectation! I almost feel Black men feel its the only...
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:40:30	I don't know what it is about Black Men and sports that pisses me off?! Oh wait.... I know.... Education is not the main focus!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:35:07	Breakfast. My body is killing me! Abdomen, and cramping. #cramps #cycle #inpain #killme http:// instagram.com/p/ZVLL6_nVSE/

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-15 19:32:09	If cramps are just a small taste of labor pains I'm going to pass out in pain, rip all the IV's and scream at everyone in the hospital.

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-09 18:40:59	And then eventually internationally. As I discussed with a friend mental illness is not racist or discriminate against class.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-09 18:39:34	First, I want to tap into my culture and figure out why mental illness effects Black folks and then expand to other minorities
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-09 18:38:31	It's funny how my people strive for togetherness BUT are so far apart with everyone's personal agenda and there own glory.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-09 18:06:20	I'm literally exhausted. Mind, body, and emotional.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-09 09:42:40	I think one of my faves is "Get It Together" by India Arie! It always brings tears to my eyes every single time. I can relate!!!!!

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-08 19:11:19	Wait, I'm not sorry. I guess I'm a horrible person because I need about $75,000/year salary to live and pay back these $200,000 loans
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-08 19:10:13	75/hours of work with salary of if your lucky $11,000 with $200,000 in student loans.. Sorry if my idealism is flushed down the toilet!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-08 19:09:10	Being an AmeriCorps alum you begin to realize how the hell is one going help others if YOU remain desperate poverty!!! $11,000 for 75 hours?
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-08 19:05:28	Interesting find in 2012 http://www. glassdoor.com/Reviews/City-Y ear-Reviews-E147224.htm …

109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 22:39:22	@BamaMan87 be aware Ty Ty I tend to be a LOT more truthful here!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 22:29:06	My passion to understand my mental health disorder.... Getting help for myself is my #1 goal, I can't help others if I too am too sick!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 22:28:16	I too have a dream of being a phD candidate and eventually Dr. Steans even if I'm 75! And if I don't complete my dream. I NEVER want to lose
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 22:16:30	I wear weaves 3 and half months out of the year and then blow out my real hair for the rest of the month!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 22:15:36	OMG women I repeat STOP! Wearing weaves! Be proud of your real hair!!!! Or damn give your hair some appreciation!!!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 21:20:55	Laundry time until 1pm
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 20:02:06	Damn so if become a mom at age 34 I'm considered old..... Hmmm
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 19:22:00	Like babies and husbands are the answer?! But, I think hey at least I will have support!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 19:20:48	Is full time work even possible?! I know mania is full blown when i don't get sleep and I don't have support or outlet for the past 10 month
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 19:19:39	Btw, if I work full time when can I go to the doctor and get meds. I almost wonder what's the best jobs for people with mental illness
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 19:18:31	As you can tell I'm pretty pissed if this is mania this shit sucks!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 19:17:59	Would you tell someone with cancer to get over it?! HELL no you wouldn't so don't do that to me. #insensitivesociety #nolove #wtf
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 19:16:03	If one more damn person tells me to get over being depressed or bipolar? I'm getting to slap the shit out of them!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 19:15:15	For Medicaid which means no medication, no further screenings to figure out anything. God, why must you make me suffer
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 19:14:01	I'm so sick of being sick! I've been actively seeking help but can't get it because no insurance, I'm not pregnant and not eligible
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 19:12:54	It's beyond frustrating being this sick. Shit, saying I have cancer is a Hell of a lot better than saying I have Bipolar. I love that....
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 19:11:23	Why does pregnancy seem to be the ONLY way I can get the health are I need meds and ALL!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 18:55:53	Damn 8 years and counting, can't wait until the day when I wake up to a husband and my own child.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-05-07 18:37:30	I would what Beyonce would look like with no weave like her sister Solange..... Solange.... I like her... I think Beyonce would Freak out!

109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-25 13:56:00	From mental health issues. Sleep is important to all BUT I need more than most people especially because I'm unmedicated!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-25 13:54:55	I hate my sleep pattern. It doesn't help that I need 8 hours or more to fully function. Sleep is so important to other suffering
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-25 13:36:56	Sooooo I can only sleep for like 4 hours when I go to bed before 12am.

109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 23:15:27	When I go to grad school in a few years I'm going to take advantage of study abroad and exclusive vacations!!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 21:47:33	Work! I refuse under any circumstance to be a single mother!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 21:46:46	Why do I talk about babies and marriage so much is because I want it to happen for me! And I'm freakin' 26
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 21:46:19	Friends, Family say that marriage doesn't not guarantee that he will stay BUT I will do whatever I have to, to make my marriage
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 21:45:23	Only have one good example of "co-parenting" or two in my family that I could look too
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 21:44:48	I will continue to do so until I feel that I'm ready to be a mother myself at 33 wayyy before 40n
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 21:43:43	Thanks friends and family for having "baby momma" and "baby daddy" drama. That's why @26 years old I remain childless!

109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 20:53:14	Is just wired differently and yes I still need to be aware of what I can do to change
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 20:52:41	The way that I think is highly controversial and because of it I lose family, friends, lovers and future friends. I'm NOT crazy my brain
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 20:45:22	3 million dollars in a divorce settlement.... No need to work anymore..... Allen Iverson's wife made out just fine!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 20:29:56	Men just know when that money dries up she will walk away with ALL your money and leave you broke
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 20:25:36	Adoption is a part of who Iam as a person. I will not lie to my kids to protect anyone!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 20:24:27	I'm NOT the perfect daughter, sister, or friend BUT I try to do what I can. The definition of love to me is confusing
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 20:23:28	Family to me means people that can fully accept you for who you are and only try and uplift you not discourage you
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 20:22:54	The definition of family is absolutely re-defined more and more. The definition of family is no longer what its supposed to mean.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-24 19:59:14	It's always so awkward being in planned parenthood. They check out Vayjays all day. It just feels so weird. #safesex #checkup

109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-17 22:46:12	Today is a really bad day for me in fact this whole week sucks so far.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-17 21:48:50	I need help but help cost me $600/ per session. Why isn't mental healthcare free?
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-17 21:48:19	I feel like a failure for considering SSD and my triggers are bad and I don't know what to do anymore. I don't even understand.

109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-17 21:44:39	My options are take meds that make me feel like shit or deal everyday with the un-predictable mood swings and NEVER become a Mommy.
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-17 21:41:59	I'm un-insured, no job and I can't qualify for Medicade because i don't have kids meaning I will Be increasingly sick for years to come!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-17 21:40:19	I wish non-believers that think Bipolar/ Depression is just laziness could have my brain. Imagine being sick and told you can't get help!
109471418	monicasteans	2013-04-17 21:32:46	I feel screwed over in so many ways right now. Angry is just the beginning to understand how I feel right now.

109471418	monicasteans	2013-03-24 23:00:09	I should date with no limitations on race but I can't help if I'm physically attracted to men of color. Maybe I should open myself up!

109471418	monicasteans	2013-03-19 20:08:25	Mental illness is something else. You can't really understand it until you've been through it on a constant basis.

109471418	monicasteans	2012-12-22 22:14:27	Of course I Have to work But I don't want to miss my baby's milestone's.
109471418	monicasteans	2012-12-22 22:13:35	Funny how my Biggest goal in life is circa 1940's-1950's is be a wife and mother. Really Not interested in corporate ladder to success!
109471418	monicasteans	2012-12-22 22:12:05	I didn't and still don't have that foundation. I'm just terrified of failing at this thing called motherhood.
109471418	monicasteans	2012-12-22 22:11:13	A Good father creates that solid fountain for the kids and woman. He supports her in raising respectful children who do the right thing.
109471418	monicasteans	2012-12-22 22:09:44	But I'm looking all the time. I'm 5 years away from being 30 and I want kids in 2 years. I don't my baby to be raised by me alone!
109471418	monicasteans	2012-12-22 22:04:38	Or I will become an ex-wife! I refuse to be some dude's baby mom's. He has to put a ring on. Or simple solution. I give up sex for 10 years
109471418	monicasteans	2012-12-22 22:03:18	My worse fear is bringing my child into this world as a single. Motherhood is NOT to be Alone. I don't care what it takes my Husband will!
109471418	monicasteans	2012-12-22 22:01:45	Like people Keep telling me you can't LOOK for Love. It just finds you! I don't know if I believe that.

109471418	monicasteans	2012-06-10 05:00:33	Intracism is alive and well... Racism without your on race!
109471418	monicasteans	2012-06-10 04:59:46	I wonder if Trayon wouldve have been a big deal if it was a Black man that shot him. Mostly likely wouldve made the news!
109471418	monicasteans	2012-06-10 04:22:09	I like bi-racial guys and I'm 100% Black... I guess its nothing to be ashamed of. Its not a big deal when a guy likes a white woman!
109471418	monicasteans	2012-06-10 03:27:51	@xmsmoniquex it def could be due to adoption but Identity issues!!!
109471418	monicasteans	2012-06-10 03:09:52	What happens since I'm 100% Black and Confused. Identity Issues! Why is there no group for that. It would be easier to be Bi-Racial!
109471418	monicasteans	2012-06-09 23:01:28	There's nothing wrong with high standards when you date. No BA, no job, and baby momma drama=undateable!
109471418	monicasteans	2012-06-09 21:26:56	Why did I major in Criminal Justice... Almost 2 years later I'm doing nothing with my major. I'm going to be doing Marketing for a year.
