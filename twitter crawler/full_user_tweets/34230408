34230408	TriPolarTroy	2016-11-14 03:17:18	so the Broncos run QB sneaks on 3rd &1 to get 1st downs? we should probably try a couple of those

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2016-11-14 02:10:05	well that drive sucked ass

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-12 03:11:07	Oh well that was fun
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-12 02:04:58	Hey eagles just keep running that read-option play action, roll right hit any of the 3 wide open receivers for 1st downs ....all day long

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-11 23:45:38	Looks like the Saints are wearing the black pants/white jersey combo .....not a fan
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-11 23:42:11	@GambrellRenard you are probably right but if they keep giving up 45 to not so good teams they will be 1 and done in the playoffs
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-11 23:39:54	The talk of Sean leaving for Miami or Colts is irritating me ...Look I get mad when we lose but I don't see a better coach out there for us
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-11 10:56:50	I don't give a fuck what anybody says #TCU is not the 2nd best team in the country ....maybe 12th but not 2nd

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-05 09:51:10	I feel like Sean's sole motivation is to prove to everybody that he was right about picking Ingram in the 1st round
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-05 05:42:15	@allbenjamens haha ...playing good football despite the key injuries

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-04 08:34:50	@missseventhward sloppy un-disciplined every year .....waaaaaaaaay too much talent not to be consistently top 5
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-04 08:32:09	@missseventhward you are right but LSU puts more players in the NFL than any other team every year ....we should be better week to week
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-04 08:26:11	@missseventhward because Les Miles is the worst coach in the history of college football ....I like the guy but always under-performing
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-10-04 08:24:04	HEY LSU let me help out your play calling Play 1 - Pitch left to #7 Play 2 - Pitch Right to #7 ---- REPEAT! fuckin morons

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-07-01 12:30:18	@3lViS87 agreed they need to come up with some new ideas and effects ....the Kyle Reese character was a whining, skillless bitch
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-07-01 12:26:56	@3lViS87 it tried hard to stay true to T1 & T2 but it failed miserably
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-07-01 12:24:42	#TerminatorGenisys is fuckin trash ....waste of my time and energy

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-07-01 02:04:42	I'm hoping my low expectations of #TerminatorGenisys makes for pleasant surprise
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-07-01 01:17:30	@saintcool13 exactly ....rock salt or rubber bullets or the writers treating it like a super hero movie where anything is possible

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-29 10:15:19	@saintcool13 complex and quite relatable ......well for me anyway
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-29 10:09:41	@saintcool13 yeah agreed ..... his character was a lot more realistic than most people would ever want to know
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-29 10:05:43	@saintcool13 I guess not which kinda sucks because he was an interesting dude
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-29 10:02:45	#TrueDetective okay I'm still sitting here like an idiot trying to process what just happened
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-29 06:14:40	@Mags_1597 I could be guilty of this ....I don't always remember yesterday js

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-28 00:23:06	Am I the only person on the planet that couldn't give 2 shits about watching anything in 3D? Give me a movie in true HD and I'm good
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 09:10:19	My thoughts on today's #SCOTUSMarriage decision https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=7K9aCn n9M20&feature=youtu.be …
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 08:55:50	correction 25 miles in 3 weeks.....maaaaaan they must not have seen #TheFugitive or #TheNext3Days
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 08:53:52	How in the fuck did these 2 geniuses escape from a max prison but only manage to go 25 miles in 2 weeks? Id be in fuckin Siberia by now
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 07:12:47	@swiehe99 lol the decision doesn't affect me directly ....I have no plans of getting married again to anybody regardless of gender #ImDone
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 07:01:02	@swiehe99 Im not gonna pretend to be a #SCOTUS expert but if its outside of their scope of authority Im sure we'll hear about it
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:48:40	@MadameCharisma lol yeah a few folks clearly being ridiculous to make a point
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:46:23	@MadameCharisma I'm also tired of hearing "Well damn what's next a bird can marry a cantaloupe?" just stop stupid
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:45:15	@MadameCharisma probably right
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:42:16	@MadameCharisma honestly I don't want to hear details of anybodys sex life or see pda regardless of gender, race or anything else lol
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:40:44	@MadameCharisma no its not now but it was at one time it was as hated as the same-sex topic today ....by some
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:37:35	@MadameCharisma true but I still have friends that squirm hearing about me always dating outside of my race ....aint anybody's damn biz
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:34:14	@MadameCharisma and a lot of people are still uncomfortable with interracial couples which is just ridiculous ....their problem not mine
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:32:39	@MadameCharisma exactly
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:32:05	@MadameCharisma the folks who claim gay couples are morally bankrupt & not capable of providing a healthy family environment
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:30:14	@MadameCharisma in a lot of cases yes they were not allowed to be there or make decisions with regard to life support
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:28:09	@MadameCharisma I also think straight couples need to stop acting like they have perfected Marriage ...divorce, broken homes, abuse is real
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:26:20	@MadameCharisma I've never been okay with someone dying alone because their partner can't be next of kin & their family as abandoned them
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:20:55	@MadameCharisma yeah that's true
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-27 00:03:42	@_RagingCajun welcome to my world ....yup

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-26 23:19:59	@ListSmasher I know .....the fact that it ever was illegal is pretty disgusting & idiotic
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-06-26 23:06:47	Okay so are the people who are anti same-sex marriage also still against Interracial Marriage which was illegal until 1967? #SCOTUS jw

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 12:38:50	Floyd has won more rounds so now he's just blocking and dodging. ...last round a little boring
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 12:08:09	Pacman won round 2
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 12:02:38	Round 1 goes to Floyd
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 11:50:07	I'm so confused by the Burger King guy walking with Floyd
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 11:48:33	And they are almost in the ring
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 10:49:58	Agassi and Steffi in the front row yo
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 10:35:54	Good God the star power at this fight is straight up nuts
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 10:13:20	I think its very nice of the MGM Grand to hire Transgender ring girls
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 10:09:12	Jim Grey is such a stupid asshole ....really wish he would get fired
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 09:39:11	@peta @JMCappiello The NFL would probably just expand the rosters to fill in the spots

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 03:52:59	@Nader723 I think they are leaning toward a more ground & pound style with short high percentage passes like NE
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 03:51:38	@shoepick22 yeah .... lol ....didn't happen often ...he was always in the reach disadvantage and lit fuckers up
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-05-03 03:49:59	Roy Jones Jr. telling people that the taller fighter always wins ....Really Stupid? Please tell me how many times Tyson was taller

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-04-30 08:27:53	Pretty sure I'm getting the fight even though I can think of about 8 million things I'd rather do with $99

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-01-02 12:42:24	This game is far from over but if anybody thinks either one of these teams is beating Oregon you are smoking meth
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-01-02 12:19:19	@krusso14 agreed
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-01-02 12:10:03	Oregon will hang 40 on either of these teams

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2015-01-02 08:50:17	Oregon might score 50

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-15 00:45:42	@Robot_Insect @CollectiveEvol whether or not it has to do with the health, well being & safety of the consumer is debatable
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-15 00:44:23	@Robot_Insect @CollectiveEvol yes it is a choice but I dont know which foods are GMO just by guessing ...I choose not to eat corn syrup also
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-15 00:43:20	@Robot_Insect @CollectiveEvol so all food products currently on the market "Voluntarily" labeling their food?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-15 00:41:40	@Robot_Insect @CollectiveEvol thats fuckin bullshit and you know it ....it's not about "Special" labeling just include it
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-15 00:40:53	@Robot_Insect @CollectiveEvol is Corn Syrup "Voluntarily" labeled? Come on man it needs to me mandatory like most other ingredients
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-15 00:38:02	@Robot_Insect @CollectiveEvol Even if that stat is correct it still doesn't answer WHY foods aren't labeled with regard to GMO or not
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-15 00:23:32	@AmandaLang_CBC You said "I don't have a choice to avoid non-gmo corn if I live in America" the same could be said for Corn Syrup #Stupid

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-01 12:21:15	@NeauxLAPeach but I also love everything about the Holiday Season(Christmas music, decorations, food, movies) & football in full swing etc.
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-01 12:19:48	@NeauxLAPeach be glad too .....I think that fact that I seem to be several degrees hotter than the avg. human has something to do with it
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-01 12:16:47	@NeauxLAPeach LOVe love love the fall and winter .....If I had to wear a jacket all year long that would be just perfect
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-01 12:14:39	@NeauxLAPeach lol ....& that fact that I already have about 15 is irrelevant .... I'll get another one next winter too

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-01 11:31:35	@JMLeblanc23 Exactly .....and they are both pretty dumb, immature & terrible leaders which does not help
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-01 11:28:47	@JMLeblanc23 I'm surprised that his coaches havent corrected his throwing mechanics, when he drops his elbow he slings it into the stands
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-01 11:27:03	@JMLeblanc23 lol ....no he's not .....I'd bet a lot of money that Stafford will have a better career than Cam
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-11-01 11:22:23	So I'm re-watching the #Saints vs Panthers game & Scam Newton is fuckin garbage ....cant read defenses for shit & too many side arm throws

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-09-30 04:52:16	#AMillionWaystoDieintheWest is pretty fuckin funny....js
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-09-29 23:51:34	@ctceric333 agreed and Sproles is not as easily replaceable as most people thought
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-09-29 23:46:26	@ctceric333 I agree and it's very confusing
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-09-29 23:30:34	@SaintsSoulja there are 2 choices right there ....Go for it or punt it ....a half-assed fake punt is rarely the correct strategy

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-09-29 08:46:37	If we don't score a touchdown on this drive Im driving to walmart to punch a random baby in the back of the head
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-09-29 08:42:55	We would get the same exact amount of pressure on any team's QB if I were fucking playing DE

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 22:15:34	@DrNush whoever didn't know that is a moron
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 22:14:11	I hope I'm wrong because I like him but I don't think #RG3 is getting better, he still throws off his back foot falling away & cant slide

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 11:14:49	@jessperate @twitter wow I just said this word for word
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 11:04:56	are these fuckers serious right now in #Ferguson ?? the law enforcement has really lost their damn minds ...this crowd is calm

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 10:22:57	@lexxicon8887 yes
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 10:01:53	@BulldogSST this year is gonna be painful ...they clearly want every game to be 63 -70
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 10:00:32	@GodlessPoutine hahaha good luck with that egypt
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 09:57:27	So basically the #Browns still have no idea who the fuck their starting QB is gonna be
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 09:44:57	Watching these dudes face plant in the water after a 25 min back story on #americanninjawarrior is fuckin hilarious
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 09:37:07	"What did you get?" No clue but its Jacked with protein ....then he smells it
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 08:28:06	#JoeHaden is a fuckin stud son!! #RG3 just got schooled
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 08:25:09	Is #RG3 fuckin retarded? Why does he not know how to slide or get out of bounds without getting killed ....he looks like a spaz
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 08:09:52	I love when people call my number by mistake ....I tell em a shit-ton of crazy ass nonsense before they figure it out or just get pissed
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 08:05:15	The new Madden graphics look pretty sick ...guess I'll go get that XBOX1 now

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 06:22:27	@kupkakekami @ImJustCeej agreed
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 06:19:10	Let me say this, if I lived near #Ferguson I would go down there cause all of these rules about how they can protest is some fuckin bullshit
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 06:10:31	@ListSmasher hahaha yeah that would have a high success rate .....any girl that likes to watch tv as much as I do is #wifematerial
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 05:09:36	@mpoppel @ForteanWriter no link to the vid?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 05:08:41	@FeministaJones @princss6 I'd say about 97% of the folks throwing around the word Racist honestly do not actually know the definition
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 05:01:37	Okay let me recap "I really want to appear as if I care about #Ferguson but I dont know what to say cause it doesnt directly affect me" smh
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 04:56:01	@KittyBradshaw think he was trying to say Black & Hispanic boys aren't getting a fair shake in school then said well some are criminals
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-19 00:02:12	@NyomiXOXO have you been hacked or do your really want somebody to call or text you? lol
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:55:32	@docrocktex26 @princss6 it really is ....I'd much rather be around people smoking weed all day than drunk as fuck
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:52:58	@docrocktex26 @princss6 smoking weed makes people chill not charge
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:50:14	@Almae1 Exactly!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:49:58	@weakSquare @NopeNotThisTime @radiographicman lmao ...I don't have the time or energy to be made at imaginary things
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:48:40	@sawngbyrd28 @kupkakekami generally speaking when the threat or perceived threat is retreating then deadly force is no longer needed
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:46:35	Still waiting for an #AtheistMingle .com commercial ....the Godless need love too ;-)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:43:34	@NOLADuchess I hear ya
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:41:57	@NOLADuchess true
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:39:37	@NOLADuchess @Whodat_chic and this department has already proved to have a selective release of info process
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:39:00	@NOLADuchess @Whodat_chic yeah they can but my point is most high profile incidents get moved to the top of the priority list
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:37:07	Most don't understand that people dont instantly die or do a back flip when shot like in movies most cops taught to shoot till threat stops
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:33:54	@Whodat_chic look for regular shmos ...then yes it takes weeks but for High Profile cases they get that shit done fast ....within days
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:32:13	@iAmJoeBlunt @Ms_Frantrele yeah but they don't seem to know or want to tell the distance of each shot & I haven't heard the caliber 9mm?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:28:04	This shit about the toxicology reports taking weeks is complete bull fuckin shit ...they are already done but not released
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:26:46	@Ms_Frantrele @iAmJoeBlunt bullest very often "Tumble" and or bounce off of bones and organs ...they are almost never through & through
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:25:43	@kupkakekami @GhostwritaMusic & imo was clearly on his knees for the shot on the top of his head which is just unacceptable & brutal
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:24:33	@saints63213 true
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:21:43	@saints63213 interesting but it still doesn't explain why non-lethal methods were not used on an unarmed man
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:20:14	@SOJeckyllSOHyde I hope not ...well unless you visit the Tenderloin District in San Francisco ....evidently they are always in style there
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:16:40	@PlCTUREPORN @SOJeckyllSOHyde I remember seeing these ........in 1977
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:15:27	Somebody has to have cell phone video of the altercation before and during the shooting #Ferguson
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:12:35	@magalie_hunter yeah and that is a little surprising
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:11:50	@BtheSportsGuy exactly ...most use of force policies have several non lethal options before deadly force is used
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:10:24	@magalie_hunter it really isn't ... I'm wondering if his arms were up when the was shot in his arms
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:07:50	@misskanu @ninamills & #JordanDavis :(
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 23:00:00	Just in case any of y'all were wondering -----> Dr. Baden might be the best Forensic Pathologist in the world #Ferguson #FergusonShooting
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 22:56:21	@JustNancieP yes exactly ....I don't need any more opinions I want to hear the doctor's expert account of the wounds
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 22:53:46	This presser is not really telling us anything we didn't already know ....not sure where he is going with it #Ferguson
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 22:51:30	@THATBRAIDGIRL I could eat the whole box in about 35 seconds.....js
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 22:04:36	@Whodat_chic no they are not & since EVERYbody has an HD video recorder on their camera, media outlets need to re-think how they report shit
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 21:58:37	@Whodat_chic I was just saying the same thing
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 21:51:31	@Ms_Frantrele milk ....water works just fine ....the bottom line is that it sucks ass

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 12:53:11	@7inchheelz &during the 12 min version of Purple Rain some fool through their nachos in the air it landed on my head ...I had long ass hair

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 12:45:07	@7inchheelz hahaha yeah I went with my Brother but he was too young to remember
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 12:44:06	@SaintsSoulja #truth
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 12:43:00	@7inchheelz No NO NO way ....lol but thats only my opinion and because I went to his concert during the Victory Tour ....best ever

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 12:17:35	@saintsfandan agreed kids should not be anywhere near this madness
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 12:15:22	@AC_Hussle @ELobo & 99.99% of the time the shot progression is lowest to highest from this it looks like he was on his knees for head shots
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 12:07:10	@Cecil_Downer that is a great idea though
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 12:06:01	@NeauxLAPeach bottom line is he will never get out of jail ....people were seriously acting like he was going home which is just stupid
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 12:05:05	@tatru05 that would be nice but you know its not happening anytime soon....that PD has already proven to be cooked AF

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-18 00:03:45	@Classy_Diva49 this is me in 2012 in middle of ridiculous storm ....I was already wet so running made no sense to me pic.twitter.com/3nVxy9nx0C
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-17 23:59:48	@Classy_Diva49 exactly
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-17 23:59:29	@kupkakekami consider yourself lucky then...on twitter it's understandable due to the 140 character limit I tweet some barely readable shit
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-17 23:57:30	@Classy_Diva49 yeah their practice facility is not exactly fan friendly with regard to protection in Inclement weather
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-17 23:53:16	@Classy_Diva49 during 2 of the practices I went to last year it rained like the world was ending so screw that noise
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-17 23:50:40	@Classy_Diva49 I was going but it looks like it might rain so I pumped the brakes on that plan
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-17 23:47:42	@kupkakekami but I see it in texts, emails and fb posts where their are no character limits .... I just curious

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-17 23:25:38	@saintcool13 or they say it with a very vague & indisputable statement "At the end of the day.... it's all real" Uhhhh yeah I guess

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-17 23:21:40	I really think the phrase "At the end of the day" is painfully overused ...Does nothing happen at the beginning or the middle of the day?

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-17 07:47:10	@SaintsSoulja my exact response to almost everything
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-17 07:42:48	@jay_gizzle yeah I guessprobably because everybody they played knew they could just score on them immediately even if they did give up a td
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-17 07:32:04	@jay_gizzle it was pretty nice but keep in mind aint nobody gonna leave Dez single covered that close to the endzone in a reg season game

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-16 02:36:10	@_iamSHANEL @Whodat_chic This is why they delayed releasing his name. to make sure all of his social media pics & google searches are erased
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-16 02:30:42	I'm certainly no Doctor or a Female but if I were I'd stay far away from Transvaginal Mesh..according to these commercials they are trouble

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-15 07:12:43	#ZombieApocalypse from 2011 is another gem to add to my "Bad Movies" collection ....I say bad movies but I find them very entertaining js

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-14 03:49:39	@MeWeFree I'm sure he would go off a few days before the show and who knows how long before he started back up again
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-14 03:44:59	@MeWeFree Some people close to him said he would stop taking meds before a big show in order to induce a hypo or full manic state
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-14 03:40:56	@MeWeFree very true
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-14 03:37:53	@MeWeFree evidently using the term "Depression" is lot more accepted than bipolar or they are just to lazy to get the story right
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-14 03:36:33	@Tania_2943 nope ....nobody does and we will hear it again when the next celeb repeats this

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 08:16:23	@oropherion you are welcome, I also tweeted the quote from Bob Zmuda on CNN earlier today that you might also want to use.
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 08:02:52	@oropherion sure http://www. rebellesociety.com/2014/08/12/bip olar-disorder-robin-williams/ … http:// psychcentral.com/blog/archives/ 2014/08/11/robin-williams-bipolar-sufferer-dead-at-63-due-to-suicide/#.U-lg7lv3Ie0.twitter … http://www. commdiginews.com/entertainment/ five-celebrities-besides-robin-williams-with-bipolar-disorder-23601/ … http://www. theholistichomeschooler.com/2014/08/why-i- cried-when-robin-williams-died.html … http://www. rebellesociety.com/2014/08/12/bip olar-disorder-robin-williams/ …
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 07:46:45	@oropherion yeah me too so I've just been posting links that specifically say just that
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 07:41:54	@seashellxboy @axavier__ @abedelrey yes we do ....you are very observant
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 07:41:12	@ListSmasher yeah I really have no idea but the media sure seems to think that is what pushed him over the edge
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 06:45:06	@NOLADuchess there's another way? lol smart kid
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 06:43:58	I'm really getting tired of some of y'all saying Robin Williams was in deep depression as a result of his heart surgery .... #stopthestigma
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 06:38:02	@PersephoneDMT agreed
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 06:34:41	@SheilaLAshley well said
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 06:21:59	@abedelrey Agreed ....I've been basically screaming this for 2 days now
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 03:06:31	"Ya know he was Bipolar & of course when you get in a situation his highs were high & unfortunately his lows were very low"~ Bob Zmuda @CNN
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 02:50:45	@CarinesMoncada Wow thank you for the retweet
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 02:45:48	FINALLY friend of Robin Williams for 35 years Bob Zmuda just said on @CNN that RW had Bipolar Disorder not just depression
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 02:21:38	@DaehyunniesBABY yes
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 02:19:41	I'm curious what level of stupidity is required to be a field reporter ...these idiots keep asking the same questions at this presser for RW
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 01:55:05	@MKiev11 @TracysTMI Agreed
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 01:54:45	@TracysTMI Might be the best article I've ever read bout Bipolar Disorder ...Damn! Thank you
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 01:11:40	@erinlyddane because unless it affects them directly they really don't care about getting it right
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 00:20:21	@Tourettes_Mum I'm with ya
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 00:17:52	@Tourettes_Mum I just texted this to a friend of mine almost word for word
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-13 00:07:45	@kenzie_rae319 I am hoping for the exact same thing but I'm not very optimistic
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 23:46:21	@LucyKeating1994 me too
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 22:09:14	@phoebeyonce I am too ....its really pissing me off
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 19:43:13	@CNN @NBCNews @TeamHLN Would it kill y'all to report Robin Williams suicide correctly,he suffered from Bipolar Disorder NOT just depression
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 19:37:33	@arco5986 Evidently every media outlet either does not know or doesn't think it's important enough to report it correctly. It's not okay
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 18:50:11	@h8trsbegone that was a perfect explanation of the depressive aspect of bipolar depression
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 11:04:01	@heylittlecourt yes and I wish it were being reported correctly
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 10:59:38	@makaye8 agreed

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:59:01	@KappnKronix Yep ...I speak from experience
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:55:30	@KappnKronix get arrested, lose your family, job and mind and end up in a hospital
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:53:26	@gvicknair @david_s_goodwin exactly
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:52:05	@bluemyfriend yep ....me too

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:33:50	@AvaEmilie well it would be helpful if the media would actually report it correctly
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:33:02	@dammitcoco it's really starting to annoy me ....I wish they would be more responsible with their reporting
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:31:51	@mentaldog2 @crazyjane13 yeah and I have removed those people from my life
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:28:44	@mentaldog2 @crazyjane13 I have too and people treat you and talk to you like you are mentally retarded ....which is not the same as ill
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:24:17	@mentaldog2 @crazyjane13 agreed ....very hard
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:23:08	@drdrew Could y'all please talk more about his battle with Bipolar Disorder and less about substance abuse
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:16:16	@mentaldog2 @crazyjane13 nobody can pretend to know what kind of pain is going on in somebody elses head
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:08:44	@mentaldog2 @crazyjane13 I know
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 08:00:22	@Writes4Rights EXACTLY ....they need to make this more clear in the media ...very irresponsible
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 07:59:29	@aCORDing_to_me @JAS_watuWANT what do you mean?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 07:59:15	@JAS_watuWANT yes he was
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 07:56:45	@TreKeepIt3Hunna yeah I do and I really wish the media would mention it as opposed to only talking about his substance problems
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 07:51:44	@SnowWhiteKC I was thinking the same thing :-(
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 07:10:25	@dikell3 I've read a million articles and stories indicating that he suffered from Bipolar Disorder ....he did seem manic most of the time
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-08-12 07:02:48	Wow ..... this makes me very sad ...RIP #RobinWilliams

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-07-16 07:05:11	@SkinnyInTheCity yeah it was crazy especially since me,him & 2 other friends all hung out 3 days before it happened,he got arrested in class
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-07-16 07:01:05	@SkinnyInTheCity got high as fuck & broke into his neighbors house & killed the 2 people in the house after they recognized him
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-07-16 06:57:55	A friend of mine has been in Angola State Prison since we were 16 years old ....kinda sucks when I think of how much Ive done since then

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-07-15 07:13:14	@e_pL4MzZ yeah I don't think she knew they were being recorded but just bcause she didnt call 911 doesn't necessarily mean she murdered him
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-07-15 07:08:00	@e_pL4MzZ that's what I want to know ....Im sure the dude wanted to be shot up but didn't want to do it himself...she should've called 911
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-07-15 03:16:15	@DUB_ESQUIRE @CCBooze he seemed to be content with just laying on a rock waiting for day 21....a little to passive & timid to kill something

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-07-07 11:09:00	@Breedius shit ....I dont even think he can hunt with a gun ....his idea of hunting is waiting for granny to bring him a plate of food

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 10:31:09	#NakedAndAfraid y'all may as well have brought a can opener & a wrench
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 10:29:34	@Uber_Mario exactly ...both are bad choices ....fire-starter & machete should be what everybody brings
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 10:28:14	@nicosuavey yep ....always! period

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 10:03:26	#nakedandafraid this dude is only 27 but looks older than me with that wild ass beard
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 09:53:42	@MorrillChelsea she is pretty useless but he is a self absorbed jackass even though he has more survival skills
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 09:52:12	@MorrillChelsea such a horribly stupid fuckin thing to do
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 09:49:42	@Boobie_Baybiiee ExACTLY ....I would eat my own hand before I eat a random bird head
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 09:40:58	@DartFred exactly ....he is a punk
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 09:38:21	@melissak35 I think most Women have a stronger primal, survival gene
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 09:24:28	@kay_tee_clay LMAO!! that's hilarious
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 09:23:51	@KimKimcobb because he is self absorbed ass-clown
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 09:10:29	@xVivaLaGigi this would make me a little nervous
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 09:08:28	@BtheSportsGuy @NakedAndAfraid I agree
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 09:06:04	@hivanessaaa hahaha yeah they were draggin ass

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:51:27	@samimachete yeah almost every day ....that at Michael Chicklis
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:47:22	@samimachete yeah that was really stupid ....never eat any plants you dont know for sure are safe to eat
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:46:15	@UrbaneDoc4Kids we have gotten very soft and complacent & way to dependent on luxurious ways of living
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:45:04	@UrbaneDoc4Kids The fact the we are centuries removed from that way of life is the exact reason I think its necessary to hone those skills
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:43:51	@UrbaneDoc4Kids Lol....Im not thinking zombies, probably more like an earth shattering asteroid or EMP knocking out all electronics
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:39:44	@UrbaneDoc4Kids Don't get me wrong I love my A/C & TV but I like to know I could survive & thrive in a post-apocalypse or survival situation
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:37:51	@UrbaneDoc4Kids I like to prove to myself that I have the skills & mental toughness to survive as a Primal Hunter/Gatherer
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:35:40	Okay for all of yall watching #NakedAndAfraid I hope you understand exactly how critical a fire is in every situation
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:34:26	@UrbaneDoc4Kids Lol ...oh I definitely would
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:33:15	@BarefootBoomer yeah I agree ....I can't wait to see it
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:31:52	@KerianFitzpatri lmao at everybody thinking he's gay #SurvivalOnTheDownLow
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:29:50	@BarefootBoomer So I'm not the only person that noticed that?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:28:56	@UrbaneDoc4Kids that's how most people feel ....but folks that consider themselves #Survivalists are wired differently
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:27:56	@Trakenstein Exactly ....acting like an ugly fuckTard to your partner aint gonna help either one
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:23:31	@UrbaneDoc4Kids yep
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:23:06	@Trakenstein He stays pretty chilled the whole time ....pretty impressive
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:21:03	@jennie_cox lmao
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:10:18	#NakedAndAfraid okay I dont think then flies are smelling any infection lol ...you've only been bleeding for like 6 seconds
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 08:05:14	@karenlizettt nope
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 07:59:59	@gekalynn Lol ....it makes you realize how useless carbs and sugar are
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 07:51:18	@jeff_zausch Other than overcooking the fuck out of that 1st snake y'all kicked ass
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 07:49:31	@live2hover He's fine
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 07:44:24	How about this dude FAKING a seizure to avoid tapping out like a punk #NakedAndAfraid
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 07:43:08	@Lara1Italian Exactly ....only thing you win is the pride of knowing you had the skills to survive this 21 day challenge without tapping out
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 07:22:15	@Lara1Italian Nothing
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 06:56:40	@GravesMX926 lol ...but you can go much longer than that without eating
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 06:43:18	@westprairievtg Lmao
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 05:42:04	@nolabucket Lol .....I agree
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 05:38:56	@nolabucket yeah and I fuckin hate snakes
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 05:26:03	Okay one more time folks this #NakedAndAfraid episode is in the Atchafalaya basin thats 260,000 acres of swamp, u cant just walk to safety
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 05:24:29	@HereLetty Oh sorry ....I am getting bombarded with folks who clearly have no idea that there are about 300,000 acres of swamps here
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 05:22:12	Okay the No. of people that think u can just walk out of a swamp to civilization are severely misinformed..do some research #NakedAndAfraid
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 05:19:51	@HereLetty @NakedAndAfraid NO not quite ....y'all obviously have no idea how big these swamps are down here ...LOL you cant just walk out
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 05:16:04	@Fulanigrl ask Cody Lundin how much he enjoyed the Swamp episode ....dude will never be back
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 05:15:00	@Fulanigrl LOl..you are killing me..surrounded by millions of venomous snakes, spiders, alligators, water moccasins, nutria & nothing is dry
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 05:12:28	@Fulanigrl You should come visit and take a swamp tour ....it will change your mind the show #dualsurvival had to be rescued too many gators
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 05:05:15	@Fulanigrl The Louisiana Swamplands are arguably the difficult environment & ecosystem to survive in...wet 100% of the 21 days
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 05:03:02	@nolabucket this is right were I live .....Very impressed with this episode
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 04:49:06	you can't drink water just because it looks good
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 04:34:03	@octbeauty Lmao! :-)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 04:02:42	@ThatGirlFrann Lmao!! true for 99.9% if the people watching :-)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 04:01:18	@XliNaXmX Yeah it is you think you're gonna die after one day but you can go several weeks & longer without eating
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 03:58:46	@chaber25 he is very ugly ....this is not one of my favorite episodes because of him being an ass the whole time
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 03:58:01	Everybody watching #NakedAndAfraid should try fasting for 24 hours leading up to the show ...it aint easy going weeks without solid food
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 03:53:27	@ThiSLiBRAesqZiT only competing against themselves to prove they have the skills required to survive this 21 day challenge
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-30 03:49:08	#NakedAndAfraid okay shane in addition to having anger issues u sound like a whiny, complaining pathetic bitch ..she was deathly ill ..u ASS

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-27 01:02:34	@rihanna Saints #WhoDat
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 22:00:08	Privacy is incredibly underrated & undervalued
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 12:36:46	@DarrenYkema @kyfurneaux evidently :-)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 11:46:06	@LiLiwyte yeah he was at first
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 10:33:23	@JamesOrtiz19 @Discovery looked like a .308
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 10:32:45	@ferullo_anne Agreed
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 10:06:53	@JungnanKang I've been saying this for years ....keep makin fun when y'all hungry AF and Im chillin with fire, shelter & food
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 10:04:34	I guess its a good thing y'all killed that deer ....y'all must have been starving after 4 hours without food #DualSurvival
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 10:01:20	Sooooooo we have just given up on the idea of a massive signal fire? wow this episode was a little silly #DualSurvival
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:57:15	If Matt & Cody were teamed up on the #DualSurvival they would have a 5-star resort built with guests checkin in----> inside of 2 weeks
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:52:39	So I guess all of my Deer Hunter friends who waste millions of hours waiting for that one shot ,,should watch this episode #DualSurvival
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:45:37	LMAO ...Joe said "it sounds like the noise you'd hear if you punched a goat in the face" ....that was hilarious!! #DualSurvival
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:42:47	@ScottF6105 Yeah seriously ...."Take 37" okay Joe try it again
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:42:05	@BtheSportsGuy Yeah this might be it for me...although Cody's replacement isn't the problem..its this idiot Joe...Cody & Matt would be great
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:39:14	Why even bother shooting anything Joe? At this point yall will find resort soon ....just keep looking for staged shit #DualSurvival
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:36:07	@mdg276 @Discovery LMAO!! Ahhhhhh I would much rather be watching a Breaking Bad rerun right now than this staged mess
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:32:15	Come @Discovery why not just have them find a fuckin Holiday Inn & call it a night? smh #disappointed #DualSurvival
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:29:35	@1stclasscutie1 hahaha yeah I was being a smart ass but this episode has too much planted stuff ...kinda ridiculous
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:24:07	@mdg276 @Discovery This episode is just ridiculous ....pretty pathetic way to end the season guys
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:20:25	I got 50 bucks that Joe doubles back to search for more ammo #DualSurvival
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:15:53	@XliNaXmX LOL ....I could not agree more .....I've been armed since I was about 7 but they are not in a combat zone
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:13:24	So y'all have no fresh water source, no fire & no shelter & thought hunting is a priority?Come on this is ep is stupid already #DualSurvival
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:10:17	@XliNaXmX in this situation...NO it's not and just makes Joe look like more of a careless, trigger happy buffoon
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 09:03:27	@LiLiwyte lmao ...Joe has already said Situation about 30 times ...hahahehehe
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 08:07:36	@kyfurneaux y'all were in the Atchafalaya Swamp ...... I asked around ....thats a big ass swamp #NakedAndAfraid
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 07:52:00	@LiLiwyte @ferullo_anne Agreed ....the show was much better with those 2 ....I like Matt a lot but I wish Cody would just start his own show
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 07:41:38	@LiLiwyte @ferullo_anne lmao
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 07:35:09	@LiLiwyte @ferullo_anne yeah he really didn't & we know that he had ZERO respect for Cody..so I dont know why he has to be so ugly with Matt

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 06:44:02	@LiLiwyte If you really want to get drunk change the word to "Situation"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-26 05:44:52	@LiLiwyte Lol ... oh you know his shirt is coming off ....he will figure out a way to make it happen for ya

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-23 10:49:23	@NakedAndAfraid Y'all should expect other networks to start their own version of y'alls show ...its getting extremely popular

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-20 01:05:56	@ejsnyder333 There is nothing in the world that will put your life into perspective more quickly than spending time with terminally ill kids
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 22:00:35	@LiLiwyte Agreed ....I have no doubt that he is a legit badass & could kill a lot of people very effectively but his raw survival skills ehh

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 10:04:01	@carlsbadbugkil1 I either put 1 in my checked it bag or if I'm going somewhere that I visit more than once I buy another 1 & leave it there

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:57:19	@carlsbadbugkil1 very true ....Im never anywhere without at least 1 of my 47 knives
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:55:31	@DreecieDre Im not even lying, when I was living in SF I had enough survival gear to rappel off the bay bridge & colonize treasure island
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:53:30	@carlsbadbugkil1 ya know what you are right ....Ive never even tried but I guess I should
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:52:49	@DreecieDre He has a show now but did a 3 part series last year called Naked Castaway which really got him going... his show now is Marooned
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:50:42	@DreecieDre Yeah I like him for the most part but I'm glad there are more to watch now
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:49:42	@DreecieDre Actually my favorite right now is @Ed_Stafford ....that dude has awesome skills & funny as hell ....Ed is always alone
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:48:07	@DreecieDre Survivorman kinda of started all of these shows & he has awesome skills but can be annoying & cheesy
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:43:25	#DualSurvival If Cody Lundin & Matt were teamed up they would build a fuckin 5-star resort in about 3 weeks ..while Joe is diving for glass
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:41:39	@carlsbadbugkil1 I know my limitations which is why I've had a fire-starter in my Go-Bad since 1996 ....same one & it still throws a spark
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:40:33	@carlsbadbugkil1 Lol ...yeah he makes that shit look easy ....& he and Cody make firemaking look easy ....that shit is NOT easy at all

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:35:46	@carlsbadbugkil1 Yeah he is impressive with that fukin thing
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:34:18	#dualsurvival I predict that Joe will double back to reassemble the motorcycle & drive through a combat zone for fun
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:31:38	@carlsbadbugkil1 Especially when you consider who you are with ... it takes Matt about 30 seconds to make a fire
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:30:31	@MistydawnD AGREE 100% ....Joe is a fucking dumbass and very very annoying
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:29:25	@carlsbadbugkil1 Lol & his logic is so fuckin stupid "IN A SURVIVAL SITUATION YOU MUST BACKTRACK TO GET THAT GLASS LENS" the fuck?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:27:42	@carlsbadbugkil1 Dude when he jumped back down into that cave I almost stopped watching but a lot his stupidity is scripted
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:23:32	@carlsbadbugkil1 & Im a former Marine so I get where he is coming from but he too impatient & does some really stupid shit
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:19:42	@carlsbadbugkil1 Matt is awesome .....I also watch him on Dude You're Screwed .....I know what the show is trying to do but Joe is careless
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:14:49	@carlsbadbugkil1 I guess I've been so annoyed by Joe ....I didnt notice Matt's attire...I mean I know he only wears flip flops
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:11:30	@MyBijouxbotique @john_siracusa agreed ....he is careless, wreckless spaz and not very likeable
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 09:10:20	#DualSurvival Matt has mad skills but I don't remember when he started wearing Tarzan shorts
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-19 06:28:08	@AlanaBarfield Just watched your episode again & very impressive especially after your partner faked a seizure in lieu of just tapping out

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-15 08:18:17	@1TomByrne In Game 2 the Heat played as well as they could possibly play & won by 2 points, Bosh will not play that well again #ItsOver

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-10 07:49:47	@Sammibunny23 Listened to you latest podcast today .....very good just kinda wish they were a little longer :)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-09 22:17:25	Ok here's what I saw last night, the Heat played the best game they could possibly play & only won by 2.Bosh will not make those shots again
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-09 10:20:36	good Lawwwwwwd NBA players are soft!! Any contact whatsoever causes & near fatal collapse
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-09 10:00:50	I think it's sinking in for Lebron that even if he scores 90 their bench is so terrible the Heat won't win
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-09 09:37:13	Man these refs suck tonight ..... are they making calls based on flopping and expressions alone?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-09 09:36:01	Well I see Lebron isn't wearing his black leotards tonight
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-09 09:33:00	@1TomByrne Yeah you do and I'm sure you agree they do not get talked about enough
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-09 09:18:43	@1TomByrne Thanks for the #FollowBack Tom ....your show rocks bro! #83Sixers my all-time fav NBA team
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-09 01:12:15	They are called #ELECTROLYTES #LeBron .....they are your friend and prevent dehydration #NBAFinals
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-08 22:56:10	@Sammibunny23 never mind ...I got it ....I'm an idiot
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-08 22:51:29	@Sammibunny23 Hey Sammi I'm at your podcast site but I don't see an option to buy multiples
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-08 11:08:24	@Sammibunny23 We have the exact some diagnosis & I was wondering how up-front you were or are with dates or significant others
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-08 09:46:20	COME ON #KINGS finish this thing ....4-4 now ...gotta win at home!!!!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-08 07:55:44	@gvicknair It's fukin bullshit!! They don't do that shit in any other sport ....you need to qualify for the big dance
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-08 07:41:52	Chrome's Owner is right ...It's complete bullshit that horses can race in the Belmont without running the Derby or Preakness #Bitches
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-07 09:04:28	So on Sept.11, 2001 I got pulled over by the #CHP going 95 on the shoulder ....they were not happy at all ... I would not recommended it
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 23:39:50	Maybe Lebron shouldn't wear leotards under his shorts ....js
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 22:00:49	So Germany & Japan had a plan to take over the world & U.S. & U.K kicked em in the fuckin teeth #DDay70
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 20:25:47	@Espngreeny does Lebron not understand the importance of hydrating prior to games ....seems to happen to him more than any other player
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 12:43:56	NFL players regularly get IVs at halftime so I guess NBA players are too delicate for that level of dedication? Smh no guts man
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 12:41:05	@Court__Knox so every other player knows the importance of hydration as a pro athlete except LeBrons weak ass?Shit He gets cramps with A/C
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 12:06:08	So LeBron can't step up to the mic and answer questions about being a punk because he still has cramps? Weak Ass!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 11:58:54	So it's a thousand degrees and @sagesteele manages to still look amazing! #NBAFinals
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 11:47:06	So EVERY player on both teams were hot and dehydrated but ONLY LeBron James went out like a bitch? OK I got it now
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 11:32:47	And this is why LeBron James is a punk ...Michael Jordan would be getting fluids through an IV on the bench just to get back on the floor
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 10:54:58	It looks hot as fuck in that place ..... A/C broke ?? Fuck that I'd be home watching this shit
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 09:25:23	Go ahead MANUUUUUUUU!! #NBAFinals #FuckDaHeat
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 09:18:09	Chris Bosh trying to cover Tim Duncan is hilarious ...Duncan might score 50 #NBAFinals
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 08:30:51	Anybody who thinks guns laws will change are confused about how powerful the NRA
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 08:29:13	@HnstyNgov @GOP The NRA is too powerful & nothing changed after President Reagan was shot ...losing battle ...Mental Health system is broken
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 07:53:45	#SPUshooting Hey maybe if the broken Mental Health system continues to be under-funded and ignored these incidents will magically stop
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 03:24:46	LMAO at the Pres working out with 5 pound dumbbells
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-06 03:18:06	Why does Barbara Starr speak as if she is the former Director of the CIA or Cmdr of SOCM? Fuckin please CNN hire somebody with real cred

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-05 20:46:47	@Prof_JG I feel the same way and it's really pissing me off
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-05 20:44:56	#BringOurGirlsBack It really bothers me that finding the girls is no longer a story on our National News, our Special Forces would find them
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-05 12:28:00	@Throughtheworm0 The orange juice & vinegar test was a very small sample of some obviously mentally weak non-theist
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-05 11:33:08	@NMoe good ...I was starting to wonder
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-05 11:31:11	Evidently I'm the only person in the world NOT obsessed with Game of Thrones....tried to watch it 4 times ....giving up on it
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-05 08:36:11	Don't be mad or depressed if have scars (I've had over 700 stitches) its proof that you survived an attack or surgery ...either way its cool
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-05 08:32:47	Seriously if you do NOT currently own a #SamsungGalaxyS5 ....you need to go throw your phone into a river on your way to getting one
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-05 08:30:42	If you are not following -------> @Sammibunny23 well you should be ...She is pretty awesome!! ....js
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-06-04 01:20:58	I liked a @YouTube video from @sammibunny23 http:// youtu.be/do3Fc684LBs?a My Experience With Mania, Bipolar Disorder

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-27 23:20:13	Supposed to rain like the end of the world later this afternoon
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-27 23:18:28	@Vintage_Tokyo you read it yet?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-26 22:46:19	@Vintage_Tokyo Agreed ....I also think there are some traumatic events missing from his manifesto......obviously I'm no expert
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-26 22:39:47	@Vintage_Tokyo his parents are partly to blame by allowing his self entitled, self absorbed, anti-social behavior to go ignored & untreated
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-26 22:34:15	@Vintage_Tokyo Oh there is no doubt in his distorted mind he felt 100% entitled to everything that he felt he deserved from a young age
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-26 22:32:16	@Vintage_Tokyo You're welcome & his hatred toward women is extremely disturbing, but its about more than just being turned down by them
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-26 22:26:37	@Vintage_Tokyo It's very well written, but his self entitlement, delusion & ridiculous obsession with winnning the lotto are all extreme

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-26 22:14:34	@DaWoman504 hahaha yeah I did a while ago ....I look the same though :-)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-26 22:11:06	I read all of Elliot Rodger's 140 page manifesto & watched his video & I think he has an EXTREME case of Narcissistic Personality Disorder
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-25 13:48:52	I liked a @YouTube video http:// youtu.be/ojBMMWp86Rg?a "Lightning Boy" Kory Gibbs riffs Stevie Ray Vaughan

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-05 23:11:41	@Urbanqueenz Nobody is looking for them which is why we need to do it ...A SEAL Team would find them in about 15 mins
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-05 23:01:57	#BringBackOurGirls - We need to send Seal Teams & Marines to Nigeria to rescue these girls & kill every member of Boko Haram
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-05-05 08:28:52	@VJ1969 Ha! well they are used as take-out boxes or if a place delivers but most people transfer it to a plate & not just eat out of the box

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-09 11:23:42	@DarrenSproles My reaction when I heard the news about 43 http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=QiQ72y s9wiM …
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-09 02:29:52	@ssherma33 @NOLALadyDee yeah I get that ....but he will not be as able to replace as some people think ...trust me he isnt done yet
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-09 02:28:53	@NOLALadyDee lmao ...yeah two genius moves
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-09 02:26:17	@NOLALadyDee yeah ask the Chargers how that worked out for them & I have a special place in my heart for undersized players - I was one too
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-09 02:21:51	@NOLALadyDee yeah I trust Loomis but I think they will regret letting Darren go ...he is not going to easily replaced
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-09 02:03:37	@NOLALadyDee It's gonna a be a while before I recover from losing Sproles and Lance at the same time .....I'm still sick about it :-(
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-08 14:05:20	@DarrenSproles I'm not just saying this because we are the exact same height but this is one of my saddest days as a Saints fan Thank you D
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-08 13:40:46	Saying goodbye to Sproles & Lance on the same day is about as fun as getting lit on fire & kicked in the nuts ....FuckThisMan
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-08 01:14:02	@LanceMoore16 Thank you for 9 great seasons Lance & helping us win Super Bowl 44 ...Definitely one of my All-Time favorite Saints #WhoDat

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-06 00:57:26	I really can't stand listening to Dan Patrick....he just sounds like an arrogant, pompous, egotistical, pretentious, self-absorbed Ass

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-03 11:32:42	I'm sorry y'all but #Gravity sucked ass ....One of the most retarded movies I've ever watched
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-03-02 23:39:02	WhaChu talkin bout Willis?

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-22 09:53:51	"Sarcasm has been proven to make you smarter and more creative." @UnusuaIFactPage Wow I must be a fuckin genius!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-22 09:41:59	If you are one of the folks that says "I COULD care less" v.s. "I could NOT care less" please smack yourself in the face with a hammer
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-22 08:29:19	@SHO_HouseOfLies I feel like an idiot for just now watching this show ....it's okay I'll be caught up by Sunday
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-22 07:14:54	Okay off-brand or generic #AnimalCrackers are almost as delicious as tree bark....not sure where these came from but they goin in the trash
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-21 08:15:17	@WMBWInterracial My Mom doesn't care at all..my Dad though is a jackass about it but I've always been attracted to girls outside of my race
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-21 03:17:36	@WMBWInterracial Me too
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-17 11:29:01	Thank God for #TheWalkingDead & #Shameless tonight because this #NBAAllStar game is unwatchable
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-17 02:36:22	@robivod @oldtimer1968 it really has and sadly I'm sure we will see more of these cases in the not so distant future
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-17 02:34:48	This is a cool song but maybe it should be renamed to BuzzKill .the end of this vid ..smh John Newman - Love Me Again http:// youtu.be/CfihYWRWRTQ
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-17 01:59:05	Can someone please explain to me why they liked #Gravity ? Please because I just don't get it ....it was retarded
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 12:05:27	@machinegunroy Agreed this format is making it unwatchable
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 12:04:12	This NBA #DunkContest is about as thrilling as watching concrete dry
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 12:01:23	@adriannakocz @HoodieAllen its pretty lame so far
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:50:28	@Urgurlkels Neither do I ...Angela Cory should have been removed after the GZ trial
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:48:05	@Urgurlkels Agreed ...well hopefully the state of Florida's prosecution team wont fuck up the re-trial
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:45:51	@Urgurlkels lol ....I'm not saying justice was served today but this shitbag being acquitted on all charges would have been much worse
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:44:18	@Urgurlkels agreed he SHOULD also be in prison for life but he's not ....I'm sure Trayvon's parents would sleep better if was ... I would
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:40:58	@Urgurlkels I agree it is pathetic and disgusting and disturbing but I would bet my life that Tm's family would like GZ to be in jail
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:39:50	@Urgurlkels I'd feel great...smh you are missing the point ....he is NOT going home EVER ..Im not saying its perfect but he is going to jail
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:38:16	@lukejcole @Urgurlkels Man I completely understand you and agree but Im talking about all of the people who think he is a free man
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:37:21	@lukejcole @Urgurlkels You don't think anyone is doing that? Dude twitter is blowing up with idiots that havent watched the trial
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:36:27	@Urgurlkels So would you agree that going home to your family every night is a little better than being in prison for at least 75 years?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:34:54	@lukejcole @Urgurlkels I agree it is disturbing and sucks but the people that are acting like this asshole is going home are fuckin idiots!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:31:46	@Urgurlkels Not yet ...but he will never leave prison .maybe you are confused about the restrictions of being incarcerated in a state prison
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 10:26:55	@Urgurlkels I wouldn't say getting 75 years in prison is "Getting away" with it ...js
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 09:11:15	@EricaCnkotb Agreed ....I had to stop reading tweets about the verdict because I was losing brain cells by the second
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 09:09:04	@EricaCnkotb My God I was pretty sure that I was the only person that understands that this human garbage is going to jail forever
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 09:06:58	@EricaCnkotb exactly !!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 09:05:42	@enriquevbjr ask Travon Martin's parents if they would sleep better if GZ was in prison for the rest of his life
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 09:04:21	@enriquevbjr so it doesn't matter that he will never be out of jail ....well that's not what Jordan's parents just said
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:54:09	@kstronach24 because the "Attempted" murder took place after he already killed Jordan ....because he shot at the vehicle as it was leaving
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:51:14	@ChillyChill99 they just said they will retry for 1st degree murder
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:44:30	@ChillyChill99 Oh I do too and Im sorry if I sound insensitive but dude will not be be meeting GZ for celebration drinks EVER
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:42:34	@histomeli Lol ...yeah he does but yeaaaaaa I'm gonna say he has never struggled to find a date
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:39:39	@ChillyChill99 Hopefully,that idiot retarded buffoon of a Florida State prosecution team has made an official announcement yet but they will
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:38:22	@imaocgirl Its fusing fine but the fractures were so bad the nerves at S1 are still being pinched ...thanks for asking
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:37:28	@ChillyChill99 because it's Florida and I think the state should have charged him with 2nd degree murder of Jordan
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:34:20	@RaniaKhalek because he shot at the vehicle as it drove away..AFTER he already killed Jordan ....the state screwed up by charging 1st degree
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:31:08	@imaocgirl ehhh not great ...thanks for asking
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:30:47	@imaocgirl No I get it but everybody is acting like that asshole is going home tonight ....he will be in prison for the rest of life
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:28:47	#DunnTrial 1 more time!Dunn shot & killed Jordan (jury could not agree on 1st degree) then he shot at the vehicle (Attempted Murder)Guilty
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:24:35	Okay I understand that the perfect verdict would have been guilty on ALL counts but Fuckin-A y'all he is goin to jail for LIFE!!! it's a win
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:22:22	@enriquevbjr are you kidding?? he will get a min of 69 years probably 75+
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:21:27	@ifstonefan PLEASE she should be fired immediately
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:19:34	@donlemon Okay he is going to jail for at least 69 years ....would y'all rather he was found not guilty ....HE WILL DIE IN PRISON
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:16:50	@kerriCJ No none at all he looked smug and irritated
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:15:20	#DunnTrial Ok let me try again... Jury was hung on 1st Degree Murder of JD but GUILTY of Attempted Murder of the other 3 thats 75 yrs
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:13:28	@rhda8386 it's because he was found guilty of the Attempted murder of the 3 occupants of the Durango which happened after he murdered JD
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:10:22	@KenYelverton no problem CNN is making this way more complicated than it is
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:09:20	#DunnTrial Okay yall listen very carefully unless Dunn is a fuckin vampire & can live beyond the age of 110 then he will be in jail for life
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:06:43	@KenYelverton NO that is not what it means ....he will get a min of 60 years for the other counts
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:04:54	@FastLaneLiving_ @MichaelSkolnik no problem the media has made this more confusing than it really is ...he will get a min of 60 years
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:03:20	#DunnTrial OMG some of y'all fuckin retarded..the is mistrial is ONLY on the charge of 1st Degree Murder he is GUILTY on every other charge!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 08:01:56	@FastLaneLiving_ @MichaelSkolnik its only a mistrial on the one count ....he is guilty on all other counts he will be in jail for life
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 06:19:27	RT Okay twitter world thanks to ----> @KadyKeahon here is a pic of the charges with possible sentences #DunnTrial pic.twitter.com/xCeW4Lj8jB
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 06:17:17	@KadyKeahon Yes Thank you!!!!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 06:13:51	@DarrenKavinoky @KadyKeahon Thats what I thought ...Thanks!!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 06:12:07	@DarrenKavinoky @KadyKeahon So Darren any idea how much time he could get even if the Murder 1 charge is a is mistrial?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 06:10:50	I'm so irritated & disgusted with this #DunnTrial jury I'm sick to my stomach.....WHO in TF believes this sack of shits version of events??
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 05:44:24	@SunnyHostin Wow!!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 05:40:05	@SunnyHostin Thank you so much Sunny for your real-time updates .... this case is stressing me out more than the GZ case #DunnTrial
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 04:30:36	@BriannaPhilly I've been doing this for longer than most of y'all have been alive and ain't anybody ever told me shit ....oh wait I know why
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 03:45:36	@dearaskhole HLN's coverage of this trial has been nothing short of pathetic and embarrassing
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 03:19:15	@wawrongwiddat probably and I'd rather see a hung jury than and acquittal ...Guilty with a life sentence would by preferred though
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 03:04:54	Just made my first batch of homemade beef jerky & mother of pearl this shit is deeeeLish.... much easier that I thought
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 02:57:00	& another thing filmmakers ....its impossible to simply order a #Whisky since there are many diff ones Scotch, Bourbon, Irish, Canadian etc
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 02:12:59	@EV_R0D @HotChoc1217 Lmao !! I love this idea ....and start pumping Justin Bieber music into the jury room
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 01:31:09	@DreSeaux504 people can say what they want about California but that jury put Scott Petersons Ass on death row & her body was not even found
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 01:07:04	@DreSeaux504 Me too ...I would have bet my own life that Casey Anthony's disgusting murdering ass was gonna be guilty ...I was wrong
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 00:51:25	@TCinOP man don't come at me with your weak ass arguments and theories when you obviously dont know the facts
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 00:50:17	@TCinOP How in the fuck is the music moot? Thats what started the whole thing ....dunn didnt like hearing the loud bass
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 00:49:25	@TCinOP and Davis was getting out to do what? to a man still in his car with the windows up .....Dunn could have driven away
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 00:44:58	@TCinOP probably but no young person assaulted anybody in this particular case unless playing loud bass is an assault
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 00:43:27	@MigueleSantos1 exactly which makes this even more ridiculous
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 00:42:39	@LIPSLE @Whodat_chic It really is &I was a Marine & Federal Law Enforcement Ofcr &have never seen such a complete disregard for human life
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 00:29:44	#DunnTrial Maybe the #StandYouGround Law should be renamed to "Stand Your Ground against Black Males in their 20's minding their own biz"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 00:27:47	@sheryl_ortega Evidently
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 00:26:16	(2/2) Even though there was no return fire, no witnesses, no weapon found, no audio of another weapon being fired?Just one angry mans word?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-16 00:24:28	#DunnTrial So let me see if I get this..In Florida you can shoot & kill anybody then say you saw a weapon or feared for your life (1/2)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 08:27:15	@Garjag seriously Angela Corey should get prison time for how badly she has fucked up both of these cases #DunnTrial
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 05:35:22	@amellarrowfan they probably would have but we all know THERE WAS NO SHOTGUN this jury best get their minds right
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 05:21:15	@2Phierce4u this is stressing me TF out .....this jury better get this right
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 04:53:09	@Jalisa100 Agreed and I am
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 03:18:34	@ThePr3ttyOne IKR? I'm trying not to panic ....dude better get life ...Period!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 02:50:30	@expedience2 wait what? who had a silencer? dunn? if so that's a felony charge by itself
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 02:44:30	@ThePr3ttyOne Not yet ....15 hours and counting
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 02:13:31	@_RachiePOO I agree
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 02:09:49	@_RachiePOO I'd be okay with 2nd degree and 3 counts of attempted murder ....he would still get life
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 02:06:30	@_RachiePOO the amount of time this is taking is officially making me nervous #DunnTrial ....come on people do the right thing
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 01:55:33	@Necolejo #DunnTrial he really did, if it bothered him that much he could have parked further away but the world revolves around him
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 01:53:36	@ellabella1792 it really is.. and in my opinion #AngelaCorey is joke and should have been replaced after the GZ trial ....she makes me sick
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 01:43:33	@lukejamesbgn He's calm because he is a Narcistic, self- absorbed maniac..he never feels he done anything wrong & killing someone is no diff
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 01:37:18	@ellabella1792 agreed ...I thought they would have learned that lesson from the GZ case .... I guess not
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 01:06:55	@EV_R0D oh shit
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 00:57:03	@JanvierNoir you're better off following one of the live feeds online ...HLN's coverage is pretty pathetic http://www. news4jax.com/news/watch-mic hael-dunn-trial/-/475880/23432654/-/1chosjz/-/index.html …
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 00:54:16	@JanvierNoir Not until the jury has a verdict then several news outlets will carry it live
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-15 00:51:47	@EV_R0D @Miasbeautyblog I'm starting to think one of the jurors is holding out ....this better not be a hung verdict
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:45:52	@Reese_Sherman @1oped he felt very confident that he could use the "It was a car full of black gangsters, so I was scared to death" Defense
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:39:07	@Reese_Sherman nothing ...no pipe no stick no nothing that even remotely resembles a shotgun or gun of any kind
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:36:53	@Reese_Sherman absolutely not which is why he invented the shotgun theory
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:28:19	@Reese_Sherman LMAO yes exactly ...thats what he said to himself as his road-rage intensified after they turned the music back up
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:26:51	@Reese_Sherman Yeah if I wanted shoot at every young person regardless of race that made a smart ass remark then I'd run out of ammo
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:24:54	@Reese_Sherman (2/2) & not once have I ever heard one say to anybody "This shit is going down right now" as a preface to an attack
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:22:45	@Reese_Sherman & another thing I grew up in New Orleans & lived in Oakland, CA & have heard thousands of young Black men say things (1/2)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:17:39	and since I'm on the topic of correcting film writers ....Not nearly as many people drink their Coffee Black as y'all think
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:15:44	& another thing film writers I know exactly 1 girl in the history of my life that drinks bourbon or scotch straight or neat... like me
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:14:12	Ok film writers I'm gonna say this again, in the 46 years I've been alive I've never seen ANYbody eat Chinese food from the box w/chopsticks
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:10:35	@Reese_Sherman @zellieimani well in his defense. he did see an imaginary shotgun & w/the windows up & painfully loud rap-crap heard a threat
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 23:02:38	@tmbecena I'm embarrassed the he and I are the same age ...... I want people to know this not a generational thing ...he is just an ASShole
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 22:46:49	@tmbecena He was carbing up in preparation for the attack by the gangsters ....(o_O)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 10:03:07	Happy Valentines Day to all my Lady Friends :-) I hope y'all have a great day
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 08:29:43	@gr8fulconnie yeah I was thinking the same thing ....they are more composed than I would be
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 08:25:53	@gr8fulconnie I thought I was the only one who noticed this ...I'm all for being positive and shit but he seems a little to happy
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 06:54:04	@histomeli Lmao ...yes or that .....one of my all-time favorite words ...I probably use it about 50 times a day :-)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 06:51:39	@histomeli yeah they seem to either be confused or very thorough
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 06:41:39	@histomeli Still no verdict
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 04:47:06	@honeywrites13 it's Florida..remember? they got the Casey Anthony and George Zimmerman verdicts wrong...hopefully this one will be different
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 04:42:17	@Necolejo Well said ...this is exactly what happened
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 04:35:00	@blackismy uhhhhhh he's a scumbag
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 04:34:16	@birgiterika nope not yet
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 03:52:07	@HotChoc1217 God I hope not ....they better find this maniac guilty of something...smh
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 03:39:53	@EV_R0D Hopefully because they need a poster sized sheet of paper to list all of the charges that they find him guilty of
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 03:37:09	@TheD1vineBeAuty Exactly what Ive been saying
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 02:07:15	@Nettaaaaaaaa I'm hoping he held that presser because he knows he is gonna lose
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 01:51:47	@tiffanypennamon Yeah if was justification I should have been shot a long time ago
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 01:44:07	@EricaCnkotb yes we do
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 01:42:42	@LoveGuruBlaire Lol ....I had no idea that there are people on this planet who are not familiar with the term "Drinking the Kool-aid"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 01:40:16	@revursuhtl Not yet
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 01:33:16	@TheNamesHeidy this is exactly correct and how many counts of attempted murder which should be 4
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 01:29:14	@goldietaylor Honestly I don't know how she still has a job after giggling like a buffoon after they completely fucked up the GZ case
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 01:04:46	@AutumnNAlston I was thinking the same thing ..."Genuine& real" EXCUSE ME? Dunn came across like a lying, manipulative psychopath
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 00:48:13	@MrsJTillman @D69Dale Agreed
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 00:44:32	@MrsJTillman @D69Dale IDGAF what their background is ...they were sitting in a fucking Durango waiting for a piece of gum & got shot at
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 00:38:53	@MrsJTillman He also needs to say that about himself
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-14 00:27:29	@spockmonkey nothing yet ...jury about to break for lunch

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 09:50:38	@histomeli yeah his dumb ass overly dramatic, escaped mental patient acting girlfriend had an upset stomach so he ordered a pizza? TF man!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 09:49:22	@histomeli YEAH I saw his entire testimony & not only did he fake cry he talked with a lisp & with the tone & inflection of a 12 yr old girl
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 09:46:36	@histomeli Lmao! yeah his ass better get life in prison ...fukin maniac!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 09:06:52	#DunnTrial The jury is done for the day they will resume at 10:00am EST tomorrow #JordanDavis
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 08:48:38	@saintcool13 and the jury is now asking to see the video from inside the gas station again
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 08:29:14	@saintcool13 Yeah I guess it depends on the the case but this is one very complicated ...murder 1, murder 2, attempted murder of all 4
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 08:22:36	#DunnTrial Okay all of y'all that are spazing out about this taking too long .....a superFast verdict usually means not guilty
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 08:03:36	#DunnTrial Does this AssClown really think anybody believes that Jordan said "I should kill you muthafucker this shit is going down now"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 07:57:25	@_RachiePOO He knew he had to eat before the gangsters tracked em down ...lol

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 07:07:37	@LadyJustice2188 Evidently ....oh wait he didn't call it Thug music ...he calls it "Rap Crap" ....jackass! but yeah you are a Thug now
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 07:04:20	@LadyJustice2188 Lmao! yeah I gotta be honest....I play my music stupid loud never been asked to turn it down. Guess I'm not approachable
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 06:55:05	I wonder if #MichaelDunn would have the balls to tell me to turn my music down(My shit is loud) never mind..he wouldn't tell shit .. #Guilty
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 06:21:24	@AlsoKnownAs_SK Deliberations started about 20 mins ago
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 06:19:56	@IowaPeg Because when you are a narcissistic asshole the entire fucking world revolves around you
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 02:35:31	Michael Dunn's permanent frown makes him look 25 years older than he really is #DunnTrial #Guilty for killing #JordanDavis
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 00:47:19	@kevin_faulconer Congrats Mr. Mayor!!! Now lets go restore Ecco Sands :-)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 00:45:40	@JesterRadio and even worse in this case there was no threat
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-13 00:45:03	@JesterRadio Shooting at a vehicle leaving the scene is the wrong thing to do in any Law Enforcement agency, Always let the threat leave
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-12 04:14:11	#DunnTrial Can somebody please tell me what the hell is wrong with this woman?? I'm confused ....she is a mess!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-12 04:11:47	#DunnTrial What the hell is she crying about already? Maybe cause she knows her husband is going to prison for life
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-12 02:01:30	@RhemaThompson Yeah I caught that too....he even had a smirk when he said it....this asshole is proud of himself for killing an unarmed boy
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-12 00:43:38	@DemureVixen @foreva_RN_ladii yeah prosecution should destroy this lying buffoon ---> #Guilty ..his childlike tone & inflection make me sick
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-12 00:35:37	@foreva_RN_ladii @DemureVixen Okay so let me get this straight he was worried about the local gangster, his wife was queefing & eating pizza
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-12 00:00:00	@cicitty evidently he has selective bad hearing ....only 1 ear works but over this painfully loud music he hears every word they say? ASS!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-11 23:57:15	@Jordan_Brianna he's trying to sound cute and sweet but he's a liar and he is making me sick to my stomach ,,,,he better get life!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-11 23:49:54	@DrNush Lol.he sounds pathetic..it should be obvious to the jury that he is trying way too hard to sound sweet and calm...its making me sick
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-11 23:47:09	#DunnTrial WTF? Dude is the same exact age as me and he easily looks 15 years older than me & he doesnt like loud music ....I love it
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-11 23:45:40	#DunnTrial Anyone else notice that #MichaelDunn is trying to sound like a 12 year old girl? Man I hope the jury doesnt but this act

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2014-02-07 22:42:03	@Octavia_J83 Not only is he an asshole & a douche he clearly doesn't know what he is doing, he seems to think Semantics will win this case

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-14 01:35:49	@WhoDatDiva16 yes I agree
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-14 01:25:30	They've been deliberating for almost 8 hours already
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-14 01:24:24	Well the Jury worked through lunch I wonder if that means they are close to a verdict?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-14 00:10:38	@FleurDeDre #J4TM #Trayvon and the entire Marin family deserve Justice .... pic.twitter.com/oWGnXTe5J6
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:49:38	@FleurDeDre yeah were just talking about it on HLN a few minutes ago
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:46:52	@FleurDeDre and they were in tears and one of them just flat out balling toward the end of the prosecution #JohnGuy 's closeing statement
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:44:38	@FleurDeDre 6 Women and 5 of them are Mothers and one has 8 kids
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:41:11	@FleurDeDre I agree and didn't hell himself by looking pissed off and at times falling asleep ....You know the jury noticed his demeanor
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:38:16	@FleurDeDre Is it just me or did he have a smug, arrogant ,irritated look on his face the whole trial ....I saw no remorse or give a shit
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:36:00	@FleurDeDre lol....Yeah he really does ....there is NO way in the world he would have followed TM without being armed smh
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:33:26	@imaocgirl Oh yeah there is no doubt Taafe is a racist so I wouldnt be surprised if GZ had the same mindset. Cant wait for Taafe to go home
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:32:16	@FleurDeDre He really wanted do something that he considered "Police-Like" to prove to everyone that he should be a cop...just my opinion
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:29:21	@FleurDeDre Dude needs to learn some portion control ....smh
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:28:46	@FleurDeDre You and me both ....he was itching to use his weapon and save the neighborhood from the suspicious characters aka Black men
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:25:57	@FleurDeDre They came back with the not guilty verdict in about 10 hours
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:24:24	@Raye_100 Yeah it's hard to say...I would have be my own life that Casey Anthony would be found guilty....and I was floored when I was wrong
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:23:22	@FleurDeDre Well based on previous high profile cases ...OJ for example the jury sat through 7 months of testimony & reached verdict in 4hrs
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 23:19:52	#J4TM -----> I don't think the jury will have a verdict but the longer it takes the better it is for the prosecution
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 07:51:48	@el_raul That is the truth right there
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 07:48:51	@el_raul Thanks yo :)

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 07:13:43	@Almae1 Agreed on on both ...West is a condescending ass and Omara sounds drunk

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:58:18	Great point "If a 17 year old Black boy called 911 & said These fuckin crackers always get away" then killed GZ? Shit he'd be on death row
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:55:09	@MaximumAtheist @TeamHLN lmoa!!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:54:54	@Chrissyguthrie1 Yeah It is painfully clear to everybody who has actually worked in Law Enforcement that #GZ was a classic Cop WannaBe bad
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:42:00	@LSUArsenalCorey Yeah You're right it does seem to be on every channel

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:39:46	So based on the commercials I see on @TeamHLN Network ....99% of the viewers need some sort of a facelift or a date with a Christian....lol
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:37:34	@JTfromMp Trayvon Martin was just trying to get to his Dad's house with a damn bag of skittles, but GZ thought he was acting suspicious smh
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:35:54	@Classy_Diva49 Yeah I hear ya .....its ongoing battle that isn't gonna stop any time soon
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:30:23	@imaocgirl Yeah every now and then I just need to verbalize or tweet my frustration .....I've been away from Southern Louisiana for a while

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:20:58	Ive been screaming at my Dad all week that just cause #TM was a Black Teenage boy doesnt mean he was "Up to no Good" or Suspicious ..1 of 2
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:16:40	@haolegurl808 LMAO!! thats funny
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:15:51	& I'm a stressed about this fuckin trial & I and have a fuckin toothache....so go ahead & fuck with me today & next week
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:11:57	@haolegurl808 Yeah I imagine he is...I know it's irritating some of my racists redneck POS family that Im not "Like" them IDGAF about them
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:08:37	@haolegurl808 @FleurDeDre @Court__Knox hahahaha nice ....I love it Id rather drink it than anything at starbucks
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 06:05:53	I'm not in the mood for stupidity today I about punched my Dad in his fuckin face last night defending #TM so I have prob doin the same here
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 05:53:44	@FleurDeDre @Court__Knox Exactly and I dont drink starbucks ....I was just trying to make a point,
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 05:51:11	@FleurDeDre @Court__Knox Especially since there are people like me who are white & who's tweets and comments in person are 100% anti-racist
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 05:49:21	@FleurDeDre @Court__Knox It seems to becute & trendy to make fun of white people assuming ALL people are rich or soft ...I was neither
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 05:44:39	@FleurDeDre @Court__Knox I don't make these generalizations Id prefer that they not be made about me which is I posed it as a question
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 05:43:26	@FleurDeDre @Court__Knox Some people think that all white people drink starbucks & some think that Black folks looooove orange soda
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 05:41:57	@Court__Knox WhypeopleRiot is trending for some reason & evidently it's funny to assume we would riot if starbucks ran out of coffee
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-13 05:31:34	#WhyWhitePeopleRiot So If white people riot when Starbucks is out of coffee then #BlackPeopleRiot when Popeyes is out of #OrangeSoda ?? HA!

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-09 02:39:32	@Rexsalot I got re-tweeted twice by Sanya Richards- Ross during the Olympics ...highlight of the Summer!!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-09 02:38:11	@Rexsalot lmao!!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-09 02:35:43	@Pattyann48 @imaocgirl well no shot I don't for a fact ....who does? Since im Not AllKnowing just my opinion
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-09 02:33:26	@Pattyann48 @imaocgirl Are u even watching the trial? 3 people used this description of him in their testimony
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-09 02:30:06	@Pattyann48 @imaocgirl lol...yeah but actually hot hired...wanna be refers to people that want to but never do ....come on u know that
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-09 01:53:42	@VndlizinHaPerlz true ....they are mostly just being smart asses ....it's just my preference
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-09 01:22:33	@VndlizinHaPerlz @Rexsalot now I have been called a racist against my own race cause I only date Black Girls ..MJ shrug....what can I say?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-09 00:51:54	@scrybbling lol....... Her testimony was pathetic
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-09 00:50:47	@TripleD_Bre @Daybrenai I really really don't like that dude ...he doesn't even hide that he's a racist
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 23:50:01	@scrybbling yeah with the defense she was like "ohhh ahh ummm I don't think....Im didnt hear ...uhhhh what was the question again?"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 23:30:54	@elissa_ox Most Women that I know are pretty good a lie detection so Im sure they can tell that old bag was clearly full of shit
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 23:24:15	@elissa_ox Ole girl all of sudden answers every question by #Omara with "Not at all" and "Absolutely" .....come on lady!! #Racist
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 23:19:48	@elissa_ox LMAO!! It's so obvious that she is just saying whatever she can to make it sound like #GZ was just chit chatting
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 23:16:29	Now I don't know about y'all but when I really like somebody I often refer to them as "Fuckin Punks!" .... you dumb bitch go home!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 23:11:30	The Second he says "These assholes they always get away" was exactly when he starts breathing heavy cause his fat ass started running
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 23:08:55	Y'all know why #GZ said to 911 "Can u have them call me, I'll tell them where Im at" its cause he was still following #TM instead of NOT
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 22:58:38	Lady you a digging a hole under oath ...it is so obvious you are lying through your nasty little teeth it aint even funny!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 22:46:37	So these #Zimmerman witness want u to believe they VERY close friends but had NO idea dude was arrested...TF? yall either lying or not close
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 22:39:36	Now I don't know these people & Im not a fan of judging people but I see a common theme with all these witnesses ....Never mind lol
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 22:37:32	The Defense really think they are clever by asking for breaks when things aren't going their way...The Jury is like "We good, Next Witness"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 22:35:11	@Sweet__Amor Exactly ...shit they may as well call me to testify ....they wont be very happy with what I have to say though
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 22:33:20	@ziggy_cp3 @toshamack_ent Exactly!! because ya know SCREAMING for your life sounds identical to talking calmly in a reg convo... #Idiots
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 22:31:12	So from what I can tell #Omara defense strategy is to have all of #Zimmerman 's friends & family testify that they hear is voice on the tape
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 21:58:47	Okay #GZ friend #MarkOsterman the word you are looking for is "EXTERNAL" Safety not Exterior....you'd think a Federal Air Marshal would know
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 21:55:05	@elissa_ox & when you are under oath and explaining what was said with regard to the case, You must say word for word what you heard or said
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 21:49:38	To the #Zimmerman Prosecution you do NOT need to apologize for the use of "Bad Language" y'all in a court of law, TOUGH FUCKIN SHIT #GrowUp
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 21:44:50	I'm still confused by #GZ saying "These fuckin assholes they always get away" TF exactly was #TM doing that he needed to get away from?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 21:23:58	Very interesting #Zimmerman best friend was a Federal Air Marshal & yet more proof IMO that GZ desperately wanted to be in Law Enforcement
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-08 07:48:03	New #Dexter tonight ....gotta get my knife collection set up ....maybe I'll tweet a pic of it ....its fuckin impressive!

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 08:28:06	@imaocgirl I feel ya
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 08:11:20	@imaocgirl I agree, it is making me sick as well ...very senseless but I do not have a good feeling about this Murder 2 charge ....
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 07:39:45	@Pattyann48 @imaocgirl He probably didn't start the fight but he also would't have gone anywhere near TM if he wasn't armed
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 07:38:19	@Pattyann48 @imaocgirl Look I understand and proof & evidence & so far Murder 2 hasn't been proved ...smh at not having manslaughter option
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 07:37:15	@Pattyann48 I'm sure he has ...I just don't like the pissy look on his face as if he's being inconvenienced by this trial,
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 06:28:34	@CheleDanja No I didn't see it ...Im sure they will replay it
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 06:13:08	@CheleDanja They probably should not have called the Step Mom and the damn medical examiner sounded insane
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 06:12:05	@CheleDanja yeah I think the Prosecution did a poor job ending their case ....they should have TM's Mom be the last one to testify
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 06:09:30	@CheleDanja @imaocgirl He asked her repeatedly if she hoped that her son didn't do something that caused his own death... TF?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 06:06:13	@imaocgirl @CheleDanja I noticed that also, because he fukin knew He was on very thin ice with that line of questioning
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 06:05:21	@imaocgirl @CheleDanja Omara was very disrespectful asking the Mom if she hoped TM didnt cause his own death....TF is wrong with u man?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 05:59:23	@imaocgirl I agree, I just have a problem w/somebody so desperate to be in Law Enforcement carrying a gun cause they start to think they are
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 05:51:24	@Pattyann48 @imaocgirl And they description of weak, soft lazy unable to defend himself were quotes from 2 witnesses...
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 05:50:16	@Pattyann48 @imaocgirl I worked in Law Enforcement for 17 years so I have some insight into folks that desperately want to be in LE .Opinion
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-06 02:59:00	@maxirabor Agreed!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-05 23:34:46	HA! I love it the medical examiner Dr. ShipingBao told #DonWest "I am under oath so what I say it truth, do you understand what oath means"?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-05 23:05:17	@imaocgirl I hear ya....it's awful and I can't even pretend to imagine how horrible this is as a parent.
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-05 22:58:19	Watching Mr. Martin's reaction to his Son's autopsy pics breaks my heart, watching #GZ inability to look at who he killed just pisses me off
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-05 22:54:12	@imaocgirl Yep & the truth is he was and still is a soft, weak, lazy, ignorant, Cop-WannaBe, pathetic excuse of a human being
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-05 22:42:29	#ZIMMERMAN should be forced to look at EVERY fuckin one of these autopsy photos...YOU DID THIS, TRAYVON IS DEAD BECAUSE OF YOU, OWN IT
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-05 22:20:16	@CheleDanja Good, because #Zimmerman is lying about so many things I've lost track
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-05 22:14:26	@CheleDanja Well by them being college educated & professional that makes them more qualified to be in a court room than #DonWest & #Omara
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-07-05 22:11:23	@CheleDanja I knew IMMEDIATELY what he was trying to do... they should have already known the fabric of this family instead of assuming

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 03:32:58	@DreecieDre Exactly ....GZ was a cop wanna be and had no biz carrying a gun ....there are probably very good reasons why hes not a cop
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 03:26:00	@DreecieDre stupid ass prosecution had a witness say that he saw somebody with a hoody on top of a hispanic dude with a red jacket on ..smh
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 03:22:05	@DreecieDre yeah it is ....Im exhausted just watching it every day ...especially when #DonWest starts talking ...damn bruh
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 03:17:45	@DreecieDre I'm serious ...It is seriously pissing me off ....the people sayin that shit are just straight up racists PERIOD!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 03:00:05	@DreecieDre Some of the shit people are tweeting < "IF #Trayvon would have just stayed in the store until #GZ was finished his patrol"-HUH??
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 02:58:01	@DreecieDre Yeah evidently ....he was going to his Dad's place and none of the areas he walked thu were private property ...
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 02:42:27	#Omara :"With a head injury,is it possible for one to have an injury to the head? If the head is injured does that mean the head is injured?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 02:34:27	@scrybbling lol...
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 02:11:03	@scrybbling @DeterMInd_Dee Now you are just insulting the #UniversityofPheonix .. #DonWest -----> idiot, annoying #WorstLawyerEver
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 02:01:31	@MzUndastood_ and Skeletor
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 01:59:45	@ChuckGLP Agree on both ...but the main diff is Walt White is awesome and #DonWest is an Ass Clown!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 01:58:09	#DonWest :"Objection your Honor" Judge-"On what grounds"DW-" Well I dont have any I just like saying Objection for no fukin reason whatsoever
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 01:54:47	@ChuckGLP yeah he does ...hmmm k Im gonna need you to go ahead and come in on saturday
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 01:53:17	@tolessag No you are not ...I think about 8,000 people feel the same way #Condesending #Ass
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 01:49:14	@luvsmytwoboys Agreed NOBODY finds Condescending cute or pleasant
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 01:47:30	@whiteangora @bobkealing either that or Mr. Propofol
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 01:46:04	@KissMyJazz__ LMAO!!! Exactly...Trust me when I tell you .I have more tweeted more shit about how terrible #DonWest since the trial started
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 01:44:21	@freckmonster I'm right there with ya
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 01:43:51	@_CT89 Shit I NEVER get where #DonWest is going ....primarily because I'm quite sure he is confusing himself
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 01:43:05	@KeepCalmImChels I couldn't agree more
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 01:40:54	@scrybbling Shocking ....I do NOT understand why this idiot does't hydrate during the hour or so he is listening to the prosecution
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 00:08:33	@abramsmom probably ....smh
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 00:05:26	RT LMAO #TM trespassing @abramsmom or if Trayvon wasn't trespassing GZ never would have been watching him.
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 00:03:43	@jamol70 @abramsmom trespassing really? its first time Ive heard that I thought he was walkin to his Dad's girlfrend's house..please explain
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-29 00:00:20	@jamol70 @HyltonHylton123 that is possible but people lke #GZ not only should never be cops but shouldn't be the neighborhood watch capt.
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 23:55:08	I love how #Omara is tryin to make #TM out to be a highly trained #MMA fighter...trust me #MMA skills not required to kick #GZ 's #soft ass
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 23:51:57	@abramsmom So it's obvious that #GZ can't defend himself but he is carrying a weapon enabling him to start shit & shoot when he gets beat
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 23:48:24	@jamol70 @HyltonHylton123 basically ....if you kill somebody but really didn't mean too there is always chance you're gonna get man1 or2
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 23:42:36	@abramsmom #TM wouldn't have needed to be on top kicking #GZ 's ass if #Zimmerman would not have followed him in the 1st fukin place
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 23:36:37	@Btrswet Exactly
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 23:08:02	@jamol70 @HyltonHylton123 a friend of mine in 1998 was pushed to the ground, he got up punched the dude once, hit his head and died, Man 1
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 23:05:36	@jamol70 @HyltonHylton123 not guilty of muder 2 ....Im fine with but IMO he should be guilty of manslaughter
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 23:03:34	@jamol70 @HyltonHylton123 #GZ "fucking punks---these assholes always get away" doesnt exactly sound like he was going to shake #Tm 's hand
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:58:24	@jamol70 @HyltonHylton123 I dont think we will ever know who started this confrontation because none of the witnesses can say for sure
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:57:17	@jamol70 @HyltonHylton123 no it doesnt but #GZ shouldnt have followed him in dark in the rain...we dont know who iniated contact
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:54:31	#Omara :"Okay would it be fair to say that you heard #TM say, Im goin to kill u & the only way u can stop me is to shoot me in the heart" TF?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:47:37	#Omara :"So does this jacket look like the red you saw on the man?" I dont remember?" Right but does this red look the same? TF? I DONT KNOW!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:42:00	@gabriellllie @jamol70 Good point because If I have a #CreepyAssCracker chasing me I sure in TF dont want him to know where I live
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:37:50	@dkmask yeah its possible...and I don't even care if its #GZ because if his ass would have stayed in the fuckin care we aint talkin about it
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:36:25	@CandiBates81 yeah no kidding ... #reddiwip taste like a chemical to me shit is nasty
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:35:30	@Whodat_chic I agree...if I had to guess I'd say it's #TM
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:34:47	@gabriellllie @jamol70 or maybe he tried to run away & slipped on the wet grass and wiped out allowing #Zimmerman to get right on top of him
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:32:18	@CandiBates81 Yeah exactly ...O'mara is official as confusing as #DonWest
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:31:22	#Zimmerman ...I'm not gonna lie, I cannot tell who is screaming on that 911 call & I know it's not but it sounds like a female
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:29:46	This #reddiwip commercial is so irritating I'm gonna go buy 10 gallons of #CoolWhip instead
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:27:14	#Omara :"so you aren't telling this jury that you are not, not certain that it is what you heard & is exactly the opposite of what you" huh?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:24:01	@HyltonHylton123 @jamol70 you are exactly correct, 3 people have testified & made it painfully clear that #ZM was not to approach anyone!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:04:15	@Pretty_Lil_Jay Daaaaang #Faded
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:02:07	@jamol70 yeah because there no doubt he would have outrun #Zimmerman with no problem
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 22:01:05	@Almae1 I agree its ridiculous
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 10:10:17	@Professor_Ryan @nerdreign LMAO .....than cord may as well be connected to an atom bomb ....reaction is the same

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 09:07:41	@jamol70 Oh I don't, I just don't believe he was walking back to his car when he was attacked by TM as some are suggested.
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 07:21:40	@jamol70 How do I know what?

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 07:14:51	@LeahDelorey agreed
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 07:13:23	I'm really curious to see if #Zimmerman is gonna take the stand & if he is seriously gonna say he was attacked by #Trayvon unprovoked #Lies
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 07:07:37	@Raye_100 I was never a fan of her before all of this ugliness came out

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 00:55:36	@MariaVoeng Agreed , he is unprofessional, condescending, unclear, confusing, incompetent & quite possibly not even a real attorney! js
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 00:53:05	Does this arrogant Shit-Stain #DonWest honestly expect anyone to believe #Trayvon initiated contact & attacked #Zimmerman ? #ComeOnMan #No
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-28 00:50:59	@Felicia_SoRaw @sankofa27 I'm with ya ... #DonWest is confusing and a complete asshole!

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 23:58:53	@MojoJBeans Exactly ...just as stupid as celebs who make millions getting DUI's ...how fuckin stupid are you hire a damn driver ...TF?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 23:50:02	I guess Florida's current use of deadly force policy is to go from ..strong words right to drawing your weapon & killing people #genius
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 23:47:53	@MojoJBeans yeah cause acting like thug makes you a tough guy wanna-be until your stupid ass gets arrested & goes to jail for life ...IDIOT!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 23:46:20	Here's another question is there some reason why this cop wanna be #GZ didnt have pepper spray to use 1st instead of goin straight to gun?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 23:41:21	@Self_Made_Mandy Believe me Im on her side &considering how confusing #DonWest is she doin ok & I know she's not dumb which is why I said it

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 23:23:20	@MadameCharisma I find listening to her wonderful compared to #DonWest dumb, irritating ass but yeah she aint even trying
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 23:18:29	@Vintage_Tokyo Im being sarcastic...cause he is clearly confused on how to ask questions :-)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 23:13:02	NEWS UPDATE: The #Zimmerman trial expected to last an 3 addl yrs. so #DonWest can go back to law school & relearn trial procedures

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 23:03:49	@sheryl_ortega Yeah Im sure he does #ASS
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 23:02:09	@DarrenKavinoky #DonWest is boring this jury into a coma ...trust me & him making fun of her inability to read cursive was a bad idea
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 22:59:03	#Zimmerman is clearly still very uneasy with the large number of "Suspicious Looking Characters" in the court room ... aka "Black People"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 22:56:46	@MadameCharisma that shit was funny "Don't you find that to be a racist comment?" Rachel -- > "No"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 22:55:18	#Zimmerman lookin a little winded I bet he was running down the street looking for a Sonic
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 22:51:50	@dikell3 There is no doubt in my mind that I could give his idiotic ass some advise that would be very helpful but I dont like him, so NO!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 22:44:46	@TeamHLN This #DonWest line of questioning reminds of the OJ trial when they bored the jury to tears w/6 hrs of DNA facts..get to the point
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 22:35:50	@dikell3 very

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 22:21:03	News Flash #DonWest you have made this line of questioning so confusing the jury will not remember any of it ... #DumbestLawyerAlive

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 22:12:29	@Vintage_Tokyo Some dudes think they are above the law or they simply can't control their anger regardless of how good they have it #idiot

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 22:01:14	@Vintage_Tokyo hahaha yeah I hear ya ...yeah he isnt smart enough to have a plan
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:59:44	She should answer every one of #DonWest questions with "I do not recall" & Im sure his skeletor, Walter White lookin ass will snap
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:55:57	@Vintage_Tokyo shit I might just make up a resume to include law school &my experience through watching Law & Order..Id be better than him
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:54:24	@CandiBates81 I could not agree more ...its exhausting man
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:53:20	@Kill_Bill_V2 EXTREMELY!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:53:00	@UnkleRa1911 Agreed...he's just not smart enough to pull it off..there is no doubt in my mind he will be losing clients as a result of this
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:50:06	DAMN #DonWest how much fuckin leeway do you need man? If you would ask questions correctly you wouldnt need to be beggin for more leeway
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:45:32	Is there a remedial trial Lawyer class that #DonWest can sign up for? because he clearly needs a refresher course immediately
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:42:11	@DreecieDre I can't count how many times people say I look like a cop.....oh wait nevermind :-)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:40:01	@DreecieDre Ive also been told I look like a hit man for the Irish Mob, again "Look Like" not Act Like ...
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:39:10	@DreecieDre Its offensive if somebody calls me or thinks Im a SH cracker....but not offensive if its used as a description
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:36:23	@EbonyNDIvory Your name tripped me up ....I was like why in TF is this girls twitter name "Loading" my computer is a mess LMAO!! #Clever
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:34:53	I been called a "SkinHead Looking Cracker" wasn't offended & didn't think it was a racist remark.. I do LOOK like SH but y'all knwo Im not
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:30:48	I just love how trial lawyers expect you to remember everything you have ever said in your entire life & its illegal to change your mind
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:29:33	He's trying to trip her up by talking in circles & if you keep it up she is gonna call you a #CreepyAssCracker on national TV #DonWest
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:25:52	#DonWest you are now insulting the jury. You think the jury is too dumb to figure out that you a condescending, arrogant, pompous dick!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:21:21	#DonWest "12 years ago didn't you say you said why he lookin at me like that kind of way is it true you also said." FUCK man ask one question
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:19:07	@elissa_ox yeah he's doing that also in a very condescending way which nobody likes #DonWest you are not cute & funny you are a prick
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:17:51	@CandiBates81 Thanks haha and doesn't he understand this is an all Female jury, generally speaking they are more sympathetic then men
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:15:01	Picking at her inability to read cursive is just going to come across as mean & uncalled for .. #DonWest you are a punk & a terrible attorney
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:12:25	I know people exactly like #DonWest & he really thinks he is being clever & witty but trust me he is irritating that jury
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:10:52	@Whodat_chic He is ...he stating what she said yesterday & asking her if thats what she said ....HEY STUPID U HAVE THE TRANSCRIPTS ..READ IT

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 21:07:10	and here we go again with #donWest confusing himself struggling to ask questions in a way that can be understood #Zimmerman #Trayvon
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 04:41:50	@ThatGirlLanelle Thanks for the #FollowBack :-)

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 01:00:09	@DreecieDre Living in Cali for 18 years has made it more difficult for me to understand the level of racism that still exist, makes me sick
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 00:58:35	@LadyAtheist No I havent but Im sure it will make me sick
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 00:57:04	@DreecieDre Yes she should, an apology on YouTube is very weak & some of the shit she said was unforgivable IMO.... Im sorry doesnt cut it
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 00:55:28	@iambabygirl813 He was a troll , I checked his bio page and he was following 3 people and had like 4 tweets ....idiot
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 00:53:52	@DreecieDre Yeah I agree "I dont know what I said, Y'ALLL" with her exaggerated southern accent....She said some very, ugly hateful things
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 00:50:00	Man #PaulaDeen should just ZIP It ....she is digging herself into a bigger, ugly hole
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 00:47:35	@xdracco true ...I'm glad I didn't have kids with mine either ...damn that has to be just awful

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 00:22:22	@DreecieDre It was not directed at anybody other than a few people that are being unbelievably ugly and not very "Christian Like"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 00:20:56	@DreecieDre I don't understand why so many (not every) people who have faith in their God think they superior to those who don't.....
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 00:18:33	@DreecieDre Sorry but I'm being attacked but a few
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-27 00:06:07	@FreeGZ187 @iambabygirl813 Sooooo she doesnt want justice for her Son's Killer? Come on now #Stop ..You sound like an idiot

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 23:44:26	Does #MarkOMara have a speech impediment or is that just his accent? #JustCurious not trying to be ugly
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 23:42:15	@iambabygirl813 without question!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 23:41:21	@franny_kay @AxiomAmnesia Well said I agree 100%
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 23:40:50	@AxiomAmnesia Yeah I noticed, I'm sure he thinks he sounds nice & caring but instead he talks to people like they are 5 & stupid
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 23:15:07	@D1SPOSABLE_HERO Do people think they sound cute when they talk like that?It's something I'll never understand, IMO it's as stupid as a lisp
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 23:13:47	@D1SPOSABLE_HERO Oh damn there is NO excuse for an Attorney who I would assume has better than average education ...say Happy BirFday

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 03:36:21	@DeLaRiondaTeam Yeah he seems to confuse himself...he looses his train of thought mid sentence & the way he asks questions is very confusing
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 03:25:48	@DeLaRiondaTeam that line of questioning was idiotic and unbelievably irrelevant...he is clueless ..something is seriously wrong with him

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 00:45:30	@Chrissyguthrie1 Haha! dang he is just awful ....Thanks for the #Follow :-)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 00:24:50	@RdBush10 Man yesterday, he lost train of thought mid sentence, & finish with "Or whatever" then stop to drink water they rifle thru papers
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 00:15:45	@Chrissyguthrie1 I've watched every second of this trial and #DonWest might be the WORST defense attorney I've ever seen
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-26 00:00:10	#Zimmerman constant look of arrogance, irritation or asleep is not going to help his case ...I'm saying its fair but that's reality
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 23:47:17	@itzTeeCee @Malt_bia Yeah it really sucks when good kids can't get the benefit of the doubt simply because of their skin color
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 23:42:14	@RdBush10 Oh believe me ha was lost yesterday also...it was like he would lose his train of thought mid sentence and just say "or whatever"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 23:40:53	@Malt_bia @itzTeeCee Yeah I'm not surprised ....it's friggen ridiculous and hateful
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 23:38:26	@Michelle3972 Very surprised!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 23:37:54	@itzTeeCee @Malt_bia Because they are ignorant racists shit-stains that also think that All Black males in there 20's are up to no good!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 23:35:44	@CJM_2011 Yup -- 911 Op:"911 what's your emergency?" GZ: "I see suspicious characters" 911:"What are they doing?" GZ:"They're Black"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 22:48:30	Does anybody know if that Black girl sitting behind the podium on GZ's team? Because I see her laughing every now & then... love to know why
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 22:46:24	@elissa_ox Thanks for the #FollowBack M '-)
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 22:45:59	@elissa_ox I don't doubt that TM was punching him but that is ONLY because GZ profiled, followed and aggressively approached him #ASS
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 22:43:07	@FoxNews Are y'all brain dead? The jurors were not stunned when they heard f-bombs, they do allow cursing during trial ...not that uncommon.
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 22:41:37	@elissa_ox Yeah cause he thought he could lay some whoop ass on a 20 yr old ...until TM beat his ass down resulting in him getting shot
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 22:36:26	HLN is now reporting that #Zimmerman just called 911 from the court Rm due to several suspicious looking characters in the court room ...
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 22:33:57	@dikell3 Yeah he definitely hit that 911 speed dial WAAAY too often especially if he saw a Black male in his 20's.
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 22:21:08	#Zimmerman :"Hello 911, yeah I see 2 suspicious characters walking thru my neighborhood" 911 Op: "what they doin?" GZ: "Well they're black"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 22:16:11	WOW! Okay so let me break it down for y'all....according to new 911 tapes if u are black & walk thru GZ's neighborhood he was calling 911!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 21:59:56	@TeamHLN Okay I understand y'all won't exist without paid advertisers but (I timed it) taking a break after 1min 30sec? watching on-line now
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 21:51:25	@Whodat_chic @MissingNOLA Exactly ....if GZ stays in his car we aren't having this covo
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 21:41:42	@JennTaylor914 awwwww isn't that a sweet story? THE HECK??
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 08:59:07	@ebaudo HLN is painful ....they are like 25 mins behind and they go to a commercial break about every 3 minutes
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 08:46:49	@MadameCharisma What? I'm serious he is terrible
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 07:07:28	@thesherylralph @janevelez Watching y'all now --> Mitchell on HLN now!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 04:48:08	@Bitter1one LMAO!! yes very true ...I don't remember any of those being options when I was in school

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:51:18	@ebaudo Check it yo ....I grabbed video live this morning before they knew F-Bombs were gonna fly http:// youtu.be/wTLMipGQz0E
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:43:19	Okay I've heard it all so #Zimmerman lawyer is upset because his client doesnt have as much support in the court room as TM...Tough shit!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:39:51	It's a good thing #DonWest didnt have Chad @ochocinco Johnson's judge or she would have thrown his ass in jail for not being serious #NoJoke
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:29:58	and yet again more instructions to #DonWest about what exactly the purposes of an opening statement are.... come on Man get ya mind right!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:24:32	@VictoriaAshleys loL! Oh yeah It's clear he can talk for days about nothing ....dude should start looking at a career change immediatly
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:23:15	#DonWest "My client is fat, stupid, lazy, retarded, slow, bad breath, soft, impotent, non-athletic, ugly, no teeth" Okay fuck we get it!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:18:52	Are we 100% sure #Zimmerman Attorney #DonWest finished law school & passed the Bar or did his ass just stay at a fuckin #HolidayInnExpress ?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:14:49	OOOH hell naw the Judge just reminded this incompetent buffoon #DonWest what the fuck the opening statements are supposed to be..you idiot!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:12:35	#Zimmerman attorney #DonWest is almost as Exhilarating as having an IV full of #Propofol blasted into your bloodstream
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:07:00	@MariaVoeng Well I think I'd rather just defend myself, at lease that would improve my chances of staying awake & dudes looooong pauses tho
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:05:48	I stand corrected ...I no longer blame #Zimmerman for falling asleep .... #DonWest could put a #methHead to sleep
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:03:44	@VictoriaAshleys NOt only is he not finished, he has yet to complete a thought or sentence & is confusing himself at this point
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 03:02:47	@MariaVoeng I wouldn't let this fool defend my worst enemies ....just wouldn't be fair...he is unbelievable terrible and boring and retarded
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:59:51	#Zimmerman attorney #DonWest "I'll give you an example, a few yrs ago, cant remember when, bought a big mac orrrr something so there's that"
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:56:08	@prettyeyes502 "I waaant to faaaal in love with ...BLAAAAA!" I cant sing their little song with puking on the floor
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:42:58	@prettyeyes502 You are correct and here's the proof ---> http://www. knoxvilledailysun.com/lifestyle/2012 /november/christian-dating-sites.html#.Uccaq3R6ZO0.facebook …
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:38:55	Man these #ChristianMingle .com commercials make wanna vomit....so cheesy and pathetic
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:35:59	@ebaudo Exactly if I didn't know any better I would not guess that this was an opening statement
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:35:14	@ebaudo I missed it then but if he is doing most of the talking during the trial the jury is gonna be lost
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:33:45	@ebaudo He just is doing a very poor job of painting a clear crisp picture of their version of events. He is ALL over the place
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:32:46	@ebaudo Well then he should have mentioned that....thats just my point this dude is very hard to follow and Im not easily confused ...smh
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:28:29	2 of 2 ....Anybody who has been through fireams training is taught to shoot just like that in close combat. doesnt meanTM was on top of him
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:26:59	If I'm #GZ I fire this #DonWest so he spent 10 mins talkin bout how GZ didnt extend his arm to fire,& that he fired from the Hip..SO! 1of2
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:12:06	@AngeZed I am to but damn we have GZ on tape saying "Fucking Punk" so he already had an opinion about TM based on what ...his skin color?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:05:42	@AngeZed lmao! just shows how ignorant they are
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:03:12	@AngeZed He he comes across as sarcastic, condescending and just not very likeable
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 02:01:27	@AngeZed I have no Idea "Knock knock, Who's there?" George Zimmerman, Who's that" hey you're on the jury ...nothing? come on that was funny!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 01:59:16	@AngeZed He's mispronouncing name and words of key details and follows with "Well something like that" HUH?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 01:58:16	@AngeZed He sounds confused, pauses continuously as if he just isnt prepared, or he was asked yesterday to put together an opening statement
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 01:57:00	@AngeZed He started his opening statement by pointing out that the Martin family was present & not GZs family then tells a knock knock joke
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 01:55:29	@AngeZed He rambles on about things that dont matter,stops mid sentence "We'll get into that later" he cant remember street names times etc
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 01:53:42	If your client, the Defendant on trial for a Manslaughter charge is falling asleep what in TF do u think the jury is doing?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-06-25 01:52:29	I'm not just saying this to be silly & have watched many high profile trials & this Defense attorney #DonWest is possibly the worst Ive seen

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-25 09:18:10	The Heat are soft ....they cry every time they get touched #SuckItUp
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-25 09:16:30	@ByeKandace is it a wreck or just too many damn people on the road?

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-24 08:21:54	@robynd323 Yes overall much shorter but it will likely be twice as long as the first penalty phase and more gruesome
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-24 07:47:07	@MikeMason830 Evidently the word #Unanimously needs to practiced .... #Idiot
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-24 07:45:30	@MikeMason830 LMAO!! No kidding ...seriously? Ability to read in English must be a requirement for that position!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-24 07:33:26	This jury must be extremely concerned about jailhouse recycling and book clubs #JodiArias
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-24 07:31:23	@marcfox10 Impossible ...in my opinion
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-24 07:30:16	Oh lawwwwd ...No verdict for #JodiArias ...I'm not surprised, this jury sounded weak anyway...smh #ThanksForNothin

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-23 07:52:23	@keka66 Yeah true but it's gonna be hard to find a jury that they can agree on ....I get the feeling it's gonna get dragged out for a while
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-23 07:47:29	@Dawn_nola I know you can but according to HLN & CNN life without parole wasn't one of the options which is ridiculous
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-23 07:40:24	@Mami_isworthit actually a sentence hasn't been decided and she has done several interviews in the last 2 days ... #Ridiculous
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-05-23 07:37:26	I got bad news about the #JodiArias case....this jury is gonna end up being hung which sucks cause life means possible parole in 20 yrs

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-04-24 09:06:17	#30for30 #elwaytomarino How in TF has NOBODY picked Darrell Green? Holy shit! I guess cause he played for Texas A&I ...TF is that?
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-04-24 09:02:23	@DanMarino omg how badly every team that passed on Dan wish they had a draft day #DoOver
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-04-24 09:00:00	@TheRealButters yeah me too .....man a bunch of scrubs got picked in that first round
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-04-24 08:40:04	#30for30 special "Elway to Marino" I remember this '83 draft like it was yesterday, still can't believe how many teams passed on Marino

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-01-04 12:45:36	@IGotIt2AScience That sounds about right.....he will not be playing QB in the NFL ...maybe in the CFL
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-01-04 12:44:50	@LSUfanDan I agree ...I just don't know how so many so-called experts had this dude rated so high at the QB position ....I mean damn!
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-01-04 12:39:18	@LSUfanDan Man this is pathetic...this dude obviously racked up some sick numbers against garbage teams all year long....he is not a good QB

34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-01-04 09:36:59	Collin Klein has a really weird throwing motion
34230408	TriPolarTroy	2013-01-04 09:31:30	De'Anthony Thomas is one fast duck!
