500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-12-15 08:27:38	Finally, finally diagnosed #BPD after years of saying I was bipolar. Sure, but that didn't explain it. Now what? How do I fix me?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-28 04:55:53	Please someone help kill me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-28 04:55:34	The one thing I'd been trying to do for so long was to not make life worse. I've done that immensely lately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-28 04:54:51	I can't figure out if I hate myself more than other people do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-28 04:52:38	Why does dying have to be so difficult when you want to and easy when youv don't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-28 00:57:31	@tlscadden1 what did I do that you blocked me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-28 00:03:18	I woke up. Sigh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 14:32:14	Is there a chance I might not wake up? That'd be nice
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 14:22:11	So many pills and booze and I feel sober. Was trying to kill myself our at past out for a day or two. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 14:19:07	46 and a first time cutter. I even suck at this. pic.twitter.com/1LCxEX8itH
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 14:13:35	@mechanical_meat sure, we'll see. Convenient timing
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 14:11:21	@mechanical_meat even ppl here.are blocking me. Fuck.it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 14:10:11	@tlscadden1 why did you block me?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 14:06:46	@mechanical_meat I'm not.ready yet to stop feeling sorry for myself
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 14:04:40	@mechanical_meat I need to sleep. I have just been taking klonopin, hydrocodone, and vodka. Lunesta might actually knock me out or ambien.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 14:03:43	@mechanical_meat no
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 13:59:40	@mechanical_meat and it's not counting what I did.The last twenty four hours, just the last hour
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 13:59:12	@mechanical_meat don't even feel it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 13:59:04	@mechanical_meat I've had five shots.And more pills
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 13:54:44	@ELECTR0N1TE it was a test. Trying to work up the courage to cut a vein.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 13:54:18	@mechanical_meat but you are not physical ppl to me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 13:42:58	@mechanical_meat I called people.and they told me to leave then alone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 13:40:55	I've never cut before
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 12:11:41	It's bad enough no one loves me, but I'm finding out right now that they actually hate me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 11:49:36	I thoughr actually telling people you were trying to kill yourself might get then to care
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 11:25:17	I've given ebb very suicide warning sign to people I'm close to, and they are all ignoring me. I think they are telling me something.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 11:23:07	How many pills does it take to swallow a life?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-27 04:50:17	I'd be surprised if i don't attempt tint or tomorrow
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-26 21:26:12	Not dead yet :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-26 11:57:04	It was so bad a year ago, and it's so much worse now. I can see the things left to fall don't know how I'll survive, or why I'd want to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-26 11:32:15	I have to rely on someone who can't stand me to keep me safe for the next day or two. I'm not sure who will the day after that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-16 06:10:30	@mechanical_meat terrible
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 03:53:44	@NiKKi_E13 not really, but thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 02:00:25	@tlscadden1 that's debatable
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:56:55	@tlscadden1nothing. But why do you think i have something tangible to gain
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:53:02	@tlscadden1 they can't fix the problems I have caused and don't http:// know.How to fix
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:50:10	@tlscadden1 I.can promise. I'm not often in here

500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:23:22	@tlscadden1 no don't see it. Ib don't see any of the things ib do that screw up my life
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:22:56	@tlscadden1 you keep interrupting my delicious gelato ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:20:48	@tlscadden1 I get no not from it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:20:29	@tlscadden1 I can always pay ppl to listen to me, even fuck me, that doesn't help. I make plenty of money. Ib just night a beautiful new car
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:19:26	@tlscadden1 idk. I made a really close friend here and she deserted me.because http:// hew.new.bf was jealous.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:18:06	@tlscadden1 it's my own fault. I outage then all away
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:17:43	@tlscadden1 it doesn't help. I have no actual people to keep me company and take care of me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:16:12	@tlscadden1 I cant decide if I want to be safe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:15:27	@tlscadden1 probably now. Not last night. I blacked out and texted something about a knife
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:14:32	On the bright side, after at least six pills last night, kissy of vodka and rum, I'm not hungover. ::
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:13:28	@tlscadden1 idk, I'm kinda of not quite right
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:12:41	@BipolarSanity I thought the cider was good. OMG the gelato is yummy. It might be a reason to live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:11:44	@tlscadden1 the only two friends I thought who might care
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:10:21	@tlscadden1 what is that
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 01:10:11	Cider, pills, gelato, and metallica for breakfast.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 00:04:40	@tlscadden1 the one two friends I have.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-14 00:03:21	I basically texted period last night I was drinking taking pills and feared for my safety, and they all ignored me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-13 15:54:26	@mechanical_meat pills and bopxr
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-13 15:53:58	@mechanical_meat you don't knotw men pills and bitter and dull knives tonight
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-13 14:53:02	I.shouldn't be alone tonight, but there is no one to call or talk to
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-13 14:52:28	Maybe my knives are dull, but I don't even know how to cut
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-13 14:41:58	I'm just talking to myself pretending someone is listening.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-13 14:41:22	I wish I had the guts and the means
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-13 14:39:54	I'd say I want someone to love me, but I'd accept having just any friends. The only ones I have are my ex wife and ex gf.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-13 14:38:13	I should take more xanax not more alcohol. The former will help me pass out, the latter will make me do something stupid.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-11 09:55:14	@mechanical_meat thank you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-11 09:46:01	@mechanical_meat ???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-11 09:42:48	@mechanical_meat I'm not sure I'm suicidal, but I think I feel worse than when I was.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-11-11 08:32:07	I only seem to hang out here when I'm getting suicidal. This is the thread I hang on by I guess.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-10-22 22:04:45	No talking will fix it. I fucked up again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-10-22 22:04:28	It's do ready to lose everything in a minute. I hate life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-10-01 05:37:14	I'm broken
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-14 08:26:22	Always depressed and anxious. It never goes away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 07:42:29	@tlscadden1 sure
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 07:41:57	@tlscadden1 we are both bipolar I assume
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 07:41:44	@tlscadden1 sorry. Got a phone call
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 07:25:19	@tlscadden1 ok
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 07:25:08	@linzmama76 thank you. It certainly is better than nothing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 07:12:01	@tlscadden1 ok
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 07:11:48	@tlscadden1 saying something doesn't make it true unfortunately. Everyone I love didn't want to deal with my problems
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 07:10:04	@tlscadden1 I wish it would mean something. I don't know you at all. You are some random person on the internet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 07:07:52	Sometimes the world tells your it would be better off without you. I just wish it would do the job for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 07:07:06	I read the warning signs of suicide, and I scream or most of them. Does anyone notice? Nope.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 07:03:59	Anyone want to come to Maryland and drink with me?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-10 06:54:04	I'm a failure at everything. What is the point of trying suicide, I'll fail at that too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-07 12:18:56	How do you get past the booze and pills stage to numb the pain so you can even sleep?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-07 12:18:08	Way too hard to kill yourself when you want to and way too easy when you don't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-06 04:14:14	There is a reason no one loves me or puts up with me. I'm too unstable. Why can't the world let me go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-06 04:13:19	I'm starting to feel guilty going on dates. These women don't deserve the problem I am.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-06 02:51:33	Nearly everything is going badly
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-06 02:08:55	So what if I'm unstabl help me then.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-09-06 02:05:27	Very depressed, semi suicidal, and no friends. Ex wife doesn't want to deal with my moodiness, and pseudo gf thinks I should man up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-08-29 22:27:09	Pills, wine, knife, tub. I'll prolly just fall asleep
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-08-29 07:47:08	@tlscadden1 not sure how to respond to that
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-08-29 07:45:57	Time to try again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-08-29 07:45:17	I hate dating
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-08-12 14:03:58	Random strangers don't even care
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-08-12 13:55:41	How many Xanax days it take until you don't feel physical pain?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-08-12 13:46:33	Aren't I supposed to feel something???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-08-12 13:40:55	No one would care even if it wasn't in the middle of the night
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-08-12 13:36:37	Vodka, 3mg of Xanax, will that be enough to be numb and move on to more serious endeavors;
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-08-12 13:24:41	I never thought about what I wanted to be wearing when someone finds my body.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-08-06 22:34:43	Is it possible to be happy that I'm less unhappy?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-06-10 06:06:12	@mechanical_meat hanging in there. How are you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-28 05:23:24	When you leave your wife because she treats you worse than the dog, and then the women you date treat you like the dogs poop.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-28 05:19:26	What the hell happened to my life?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-23 09:33:00	I'm completely out of strength
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-23 09:32:45	While I was worried about asking for divorce, she asked. It's so real, I feel sick. I have no friends. I am so alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-22 21:15:03	@tlscadden1 can, but often doesn't, even with treatment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-22 21:12:24	@tlscadden1 can a good medical team cure cancer?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-22 21:07:34	@tlscadden1 well no other choice, other than to have others take care of you or let things completely fall apart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-22 21:02:13	@tlscadden1 it doesn't mean there is. Humans tell themselvesa lot of lies to get by.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-22 20:52:41	@tlscadden1 how do you know it's progress? Mental illness impairs judgment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-22 20:48:22	If things have anyways been bad, maybe it's you? Change or die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-22 20:38:56	For how many days and years do you have to be brave enough to get out of bed until you are allowed to stop?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-06 05:15:44	@BiPolar_Witch steak!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-05 09:49:28	For all I do for her, he gets the credit. Fuck him and fuck me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-03 17:44:03	@tlscadden1 have to either go back to sleep or go to work. Thanks though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-03 12:00:26	The pill that keeps me from being suicidal is also keeping me every night from falling asleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-05-03 11:53:30	Too damn hard. And no one to talk too. Want to run away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-25 19:04:35	@BiPolar_Witch hahaha, been there, done that!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-25 10:24:02	@BiPolar_Witch happens all the time with mine. Their school closes constantly
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-24 07:02:12	If you love someone and you let them go, then you don't deserve to keep them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-23 23:23:28	It's too damn hard bring me, even when I'm not depressed
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-23 22:51:11	@BiPolar_Witch diverse vocabulary
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-23 22:47:46	Dating sux. Hate rejecting nice people, and hate being rejected even more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-22 10:51:30	Living on pills. I had a friend on here that used to do that, and I never understood why, but I do now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-22 10:01:24	I'm finally not suicidal, and everything in life goes wrong.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-20 12:07:21	Even when things are getting better, they are getting worse
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-20 03:41:46	@BiPolar_Witch I can't live without either either. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-19 23:38:32	@BiPolar_Witch yes
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-15 08:43:06	Xanax isn't strong enough. Breaking out the klonopin.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-15 03:37:47	Maybe not. Weird.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-15 03:37:20	Xanax and bullets
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-15 03:37:12	Bullets
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-15 03:37:06	Xanax
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-15 03:35:01	Didn't realize Twitter had a censor
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-15 03:29:57	Alcoholism kills I have heard
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-14 22:43:48	I need a humane way to die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-14 22:41:59	Why is abortion okay but not suicide. They both assert that control over ones own body justifies the termination of life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-14 22:34:20	@mechanical_meat that's a stupid piece of pop psychology. If our society was truly compassionate, they would find gentle means for sufferers
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-14 22:26:08	Reading websites. It's really hard to kill yourself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-14 13:47:57	@tlscadden1 am I not entitled to respect? I never forced her in any way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-14 13:25:35	@tlscadden1 that is ridiculous and takes the position that a woman can do no wrong
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-14 12:50:50	She spent two days telling me how badly she wanted me, then we get together and she decides she wants to go to sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-14 12:49:32	@nejireta_ki I hope things work out for you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-14 12:47:38	Amazing how quickly you can go from being hopeful to suicidal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-05 04:08:12	Good weekend. Serious outlier. Three good dates in three nights with three different women.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-04-02 06:05:18	@BiPolar_Witch me too. Hang in there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-30 09:47:55	Everything I touch surely dies
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-27 04:11:04	@PinkPunkRebel that's what mama cats do
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-19 13:31:20	People w mental illness R very bad at taking responsibility 4 their actions. It's hard 2 B friends w someone who never thinks they're wrong.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-18 04:39:28	@BiPolar_Witch of course they do. Women think too much and won't give a guy a chance. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-18 04:36:40	@BiPolar_Witch I'm 45, but only women in their 50s will gladly date me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-18 04:33:37	@BiPolar_Witch I'm the latter, and it sux. Women my own age won't date me because I look too young. Younger women won't because I'm too old.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-17 05:33:55	What doesnt kill you can make your weaker and disabled. Don't buy into the pop psychology and the affirmations.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-16 04:55:30	Not only isn't life getting better, is teasing me with possibilities and then tearing them away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 23:28:50	Embrace the suck
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 22:28:55	No courage yet to die, and I can't stand anything worse than this. I'm already self medicating too much.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 22:28:19	I'm going to get treatment. I've never every been this bad, and I already know that circumstances this summer will be worse....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 14:59:11	Six drinks, xanax, and a muscle relaxer, and the pain still isn't numbed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 14:48:02	@debecca no I'm not. If you arent going to be real, don't talk to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 14:46:06	@debecca not the point. Treatment didn't work. I just want the courage to die
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 14:45:27	@BiPolar_Witch it's easy, Judy go to a doc and ask for if
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 14:40:37	@debecca not interested in treatment
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 14:39:02	I should take more pills than booze, less bad calories
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 14:38:14	What's that Pink Floyd song, is there anybody out there
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 14:35:01	I wish I had enough pills to end it all right now, although my kids would find me, and that would be bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 14:34:09	I was told not to take my muscle relaxers with xanax, due to risk of respiratory distress. I guess its bad I took then both with vodka.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 14:08:11	I am completely alone. Have ro take care of some but have no one to take care of me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 13:51:32	Are booze and xanax.reasons to live? Cause otherwise, I got nothing
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 13:40:24	Things don't always get better. Sometimes despite best efforts, they get worse. That's life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 13:39:12	Last time I was this suicidal, I got treatment, and it's been an awful for years since. No more. Just want the courage to die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 13:32:57	She is with him, and I'm alone in a bat trying to forget.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 02:41:37	Is it too early to drink and die?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 02:38:50	Such a bad parent.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-13 02:35:11	I've long given up hope. It's an awful way to live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-11 12:28:35	Finally have a current prescription for xanax. Can stop worrying about drug testing at work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-11 09:08:39	@BiPolar_Witch hoping it's short lived
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-11 07:20:56	I always make bad choices. pic.twitter.com/873ZrOamiq
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-10 22:37:10	Fell for M. She broke up with me yeaterday after seeing me take a xanax with vodka. Said I was too unstable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-10 22:36:15	Everyone leaves me in one way or another. I even want to leave me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-10 21:54:02	Waiting to get a checkup. Hoping they find out I'm dying of anything. Then I can stop having to justify wanting to die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-10 21:50:51	@BiPolar_Witch those episodes come few and far between
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-10 21:50:09	No one left.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-10 20:32:54	@BiPolar_Witch don't you when they don't tell you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-10 03:28:58	I'm afraid of fucking up my suicide attempt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-10 03:23:56	Nothing distracts me long enough. All is pain and misery. Where is my mercy?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-09 22:02:28	Lost my only friend. She said I was too depressed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-09 21:55:02	I can't thing of anything better than today is a good day to die
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-08 11:00:31	I want to call.suicide hotline and just fuck with them. Jk
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-08 09:43:55	Xanax, muscle relaxers, and four drinks later, I'm soberiing up. Ugh. @BiPolar_Witch
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-08 07:30:23	I may need so many drinks and pills tonight that I may need a sick day tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-08 05:25:54	Too depressed to be suicidal
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-07 02:49:36	@BiPolar_Witch my son tries to emulate me, but I am not a great role model at all
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-07 02:43:48	On the bright side, I went to the gym for ninety minutes with no back pain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-07 02:43:15	I know it's cliché, but I need someone to save me from myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-07 02:42:16	@BiPolar_Witch I was thinking that too. I tell my kids to be better than me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-07 02:41:38	I'm a junkie who can't get his fix.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-07 02:27:03	@BiPolar_Witch yup, no filter
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-07 01:32:52	@BiPolar_Witch my 14 says things like that. "Why would I think it if it weren't true?" ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-07 00:36:49	I'm just not going to date
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-06 15:53:16	@BiPolar_Witch he is good
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-06 03:17:45	I am no more mature than a passion half my age, so I will never form a new relationship. Ex was right about me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-06 03:15:52	Online dating sucks and I don't have friends who can introduce me to people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-06 03:07:33	Such a junkie. Everything had to be about sex or gambling or drinking or even exercise, just something that gives me a rush.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-04 13:23:53	I suspect no one would notice if I was gone for at least three days, and then only because my job might call the cops.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-04 12:39:33	I'm so broken. It's wrong of me to try to find someone. How could I do that to them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-04 12:30:33	Apparently I haven't had enough booze to sleep
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-04 12:06:10	I'm so lonely. Don't know how to cope other than to numb myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-04 11:37:08	The woman I love is with her bf. God, I make bad choices.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-04 11:12:24	I drink a lot more now that I'm single.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-04 09:29:12	Being single is driving me crazy. I want good at it when I was young, and I ain't any better now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-04 09:08:35	I want someone to be excited to be with me. Is that too much to ask?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-04 08:39:29	@BiPolar_Witch touché
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-04 08:28:09	@mechanical_meat yay, so glad for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-04 08:26:38	@BiPolar_Witch and you just want every guys attention, right? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-03 11:09:49	@BiPolar_Witch yeah, it's drink more than I do, but exercise and fitness are one of my obsessions
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-03 11:01:25	@BiPolar_Witch I shouldn't say anything. I'm doing the same lately too. I hope you are doing ok. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-03 10:56:59	Three drinks, a Xanax, and a muscle relaxer. Still nothing. It'll have to do I guess.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-03 09:21:54	New online dating profile: Desperately seeking someone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-01 12:54:40	@BiPolar_Witch y'all right? You are taking about drinking a lot. I know I'm a day late on this post.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-01 12:51:09	@AWinters1982 congratulations! Long time coming.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-01 12:50:27	@BiPolar_Witch still not movie popcorn, but closer and pretty good. My 14 came up with it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-03-01 12:49:41	@BiPolar_Witch take butter and soften, not melt, then put it in a huge pot and mix w pocorn salt, which you can make by grinding real salt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-28 01:50:38	@BiPolar_Witch ok. Woke up a few times because of my back.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-28 00:10:59	@BiPolar_Witch I had a whole lot of vodka and muscle relaxers, but it just made me tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-27 11:22:31	@BiPolar_Witch just one? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-27 11:21:51	@BipolarSanity just making me tired, not getting high. Dam.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-27 10:17:41	Vodka and muscle relaxers
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-27 08:59:22	Hate women
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-26 23:11:21	Sex is like sleep. I can't function if I don't have it every day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-26 09:35:09	I see online dating profiles saying happy confident woman, and I think she definitely wouldn't want me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-25 11:27:27	I might just be ready to die
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-25 11:24:15	I don't know how to keep going.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-24 14:42:25	I am so alone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-24 14:30:24	Why can't I just have a heart attack and die in my sleep. I'm old enough.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-24 14:28:02	I don't care anymore to fight for myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-23 11:40:45	I love two women. One I lost, and the other I never had. I feel so heart sick.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-23 11:13:10	I'm sleeping w my only "friend". She has a serious bf. She keeps telling me it's going to end with us. I sure know how to fuck up my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-23 09:22:51	@BiPolar_Witch bad weekend. At least during the week I'm too busy too think myself into misery. Thanks for thinking of me. Really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-22 10:58:38	I'm still alive, and I'm pretty sure I'm not happy about that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-22 00:04:23	@moonyarah hi. Eh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-20 14:51:21	It's very hard to break the survival instinct.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-20 14:49:19	When the pain is physical and you know it's only going to get worse. What do you do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-20 14:15:49	No one knows what it's like to be hated https:// youtu.be/DLJ6tJU9bQQ
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-20 14:08:56	When you get older no one cares anymore, until you want to die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-20 13:59:15	What if it's a bad life? pic.twitter.com/xmM6DNoO90
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-20 13:53:40	Mental hospitals aren't to heal, they are to drug and sedate, so you aren't trouble for anyone else.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-20 13:49:57	Invisible again, except when I want to really disappear, then I am yelled at.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-20 13:35:25	Co-worker said my frequent migraines could be dangerous. I almost smiled though the pain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-20 13:30:43	I'm the tree falling in the forest with no one around to hear.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-18 10:13:16	@LePetiteNYC {{{hug}}}
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-14 03:49:06	If you honestly think that suicide is NOT a solution,.then you are brainwashed. Please.explain why someone should have to.suffer for years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-14 03:34:56	@moonyarah then I suppose I should just hope it works
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-14 02:27:17	Would a suicide attempt get people to love me?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-02-03 13:29:38	I suppose I've been somewhat hypomanic lately, but it beats being suicidally depressed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-29 12:36:47	@BiPolar_Witch up with is getting worse sometimes
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-29 12:36:31	@BiPolar_Witch I always figure I can put up with a lot if there are times of pure joy. There haven't been enough of those. And what I put
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-29 12:35:14	@BiPolar_Witch ditto. I'm the same.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-29 12:34:26	@BiPolar_Witch I used to have that much anger, but it turned in on myself in recent years, hence suicidal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-29 11:46:17	@BiPolar_Witch it's definitely better than being suicidal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-29 09:38:38	I'm either falling apart or finding myself, or maybe both.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-29 09:37:39	@BiPolar_Witch thank you so much. I'm on such a roller coaster. I'm better momentarily at least.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-22 06:56:10	Where should I run away to?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-21 12:30:40	If i went back, she'd still hate and resent me. How the hell do youlearn to love yourself when everyone hates you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-21 12:20:27	No one notices, or cares that I'm completely falling apart
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-21 12:09:00	EVERYTHING has gone wrong this year. I suspect moving out was the end of me. Idk if it's worth dragging it out. Just get it over with soon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-21 11:59:16	If i need xanax multiple timesa day as a painkiller, why do I still needto be alive???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-21 06:48:16	Eating xanax and still feel sick.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-21 06:41:39	All my worst nightmares have occurred at once. Where is my angel of death?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-20 12:34:43	I'm fairly certain I'llbe addicted again in a month
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-20 12:10:07	I wish I knew what it was about me that made everyone I loved pull away from me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-19 10:38:21	I've awakened. I was suicidal, but change is a death. I'm ok again. Finally.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-18 22:50:38	I'm in way too good a mood. Wife is crying, and I'm grinning ear to ear
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-18 22:06:29	Moving day
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-18 11:37:47	@ajane622 nooooooo
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-16 23:34:28	Just gotthe keys to my new apt
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-13 08:01:03	Cut my hair. Been years since i haven't had a ponytail. Now let's hope it isn't years until i have sex again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-12 11:54:11	I'm so tired of feeling lonely
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-12 10:31:48	@xDissociatedx lol. I'm not sure i give my best lately, but i haven't quit yet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-12 10:29:35	@xDissociatedx being realistic doesn't mean you aren't trying
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-12 10:27:54	@xDissociatedx me neither. Telling yourself stuff doesn't make it true
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-12 10:25:07	@xDissociatedx seriously!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-12 10:17:42	Xanax and alcohol make me sad. But it is physically painful without them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-11 19:00:49	@DailyBipolar doesn't feel like it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-11 09:18:35	@zoe_bearx so if we read them, are you owning us?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-11 09:17:17	Leaving your wife is trading one set of problems for a different set.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-11 05:56:41	I've burned every bridge
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-11 05:44:39	Every time I think it couldn't be worse turns into a teaching moment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-11 04:26:11	I hate myself
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-11 04:00:16	The first layer is stripped away. Working on the second.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 21:38:37	If you have real friends to spend time with, your life isn't as bad as you think it is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 12:17:43	@mechanical_meat apple ginger
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 12:14:42	I suppose i can't complainin sadwhen I'm high on xanax and cider.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 11:28:50	@BiPolar_Witch crazy bad. I've been married twenty years can't say it's been worth it, but i still hate losing it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 11:21:55	@BiPolar_Witch omg. That is really really messed up. I guess that can cause an unexpected issue. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 11:19:53	@BiPolar_Witch thanks. I appreciate it. Really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 11:17:35	@BiPolar_Witch so you'll have twelve
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 11:13:41	@BiPolar_Witch losing someone like that sounds awful. I am sorry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 11:12:52	@BiPolar_Witch both? Finally had the strength to do it, but it seems like leaving will be the easy part. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 10:46:50	@BiPolar_Witch that is so depressing. Mine is ending, but i really hope to marry again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 04:28:44	@LeslieGreening_ thanks. it was awful, but youdo what you have to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-10 03:56:07	@LeslieGreening_ about totell my kids that their mother and i are separating. I feel your pain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-09 08:55:03	I'm seriously thinking about quitting my job and running away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-09 04:54:17	@ajane622 sorry you are sick
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-08 08:27:42	I have no one
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-08 08:20:16	The only way i stop feeling physical pain and suicidal is more and more xanax. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-06 12:28:54	Being injured AGAIN isn't helping my anxiety and depression at all. Another week I can't be at the gym.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-06 12:13:55	She doesn't care about me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-06 10:01:50	Found a new apt, signed up for dating sites. Doubt I'll feel better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-06 08:15:17	Women are like jigsaw puzzles with pieces missing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-06 04:31:38	@ajane622 no it hasn't
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-06 04:30:21	@ajane622 my 20th anniversary is tomorrow, and I move out in less than two weeks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-05 10:39:06	@BiPolar_Witch pagans are so much more interesting and fun than Christians. One shuns all earthly pleasures while the other celebrates it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-05 10:32:37	@BiPolar_Witch you sure it wasn't a compliment?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-05 10:32:04	I don't know whatever happened to that boundless bipolar confidence.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-05 10:30:43	Feeling incredibly sad and lonely.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-05 05:23:56	@AWinters1982 moving in two weeks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-05 05:18:55	@AWinters1982 it could be worse, but nut good enough to stay
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-05 04:47:53	@BipolarSanity and where your spouse belittles you in front of friends, and tells you that you will never find anyone better than her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-05 04:46:36	@BipolarSanity how about being in a marriage where no matter how much you ask for love and attention, you are denied.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-05 04:45:55	@BipolarSanity then they say they stuck it out anyways. Like that is an accomplishment. Of course you did, there was nothing wrong.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-05 04:44:40	Reading marriage blogs. These women talk about tough marriages where they don't like the way their husband didn't finish things or snores.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-04 05:38:29	Payback is a bitch
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-04 05:07:48	I'm afraid to hope
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-04 03:57:25	@alittlesalty I had a flip phone in 1995 for a lot less.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-03 14:13:17	@DailyBipolar I'm a doormat anyways, just four different people
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-03 14:11:25	@DailyBipolar that is highly debatable, but thank you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-03 14:09:49	@DailyBipolar yes. It is all very difficult
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-03 09:17:49	The only person taking to me is the wife I am leaving in two weeks for being emotionally abusive. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-03 08:05:59	Why am I so different. It's more than bipolar. People shun me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-03 08:01:58	I think the Xanax is required tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-03 07:38:45	I can't physically sit still around the wife. Too much anxiety. I leave in two weeks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-02 11:38:31	@ajane622 we haven't really yet
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-02 11:29:19	What is my reward for not killing myself? Forty more years of futility and frustration.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-02 10:57:27	They've damaged me so much, I'll never have a good relationship.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-02 10:48:28	@ajane622 how long?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-02 10:47:57	I can't live in the moment. I need love and attention desperately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-01 10:26:34	Drinking pina coladas
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-01 05:35:48	@Jennka1 I don't complain publicly about how difficult my life is. No one would understand. It's almost like light mental illness is cool.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-01 04:59:14	@BipolarSanity I just want to scream be thankful you cope so well. Or that you don't have schizophrenia, bipolar, or are borderline.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2016-01-01 04:57:40	My Facebook feed is full of posts about how hard it is to have adhd, anxiety, depression by successful people in loving relationships.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-31 10:54:45	Maybe I need more Xanax. The physical pain is still palpable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-31 09:39:43	I can't let go of the only reason I have to live, even if I suffer more for it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-31 09:39:01	She is the only thing that brings me any happiness or joy at all, and I am just an occasional distraction for her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-31 09:37:48	There is physical pain in mental illness. I don't want to be forced to suffer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-31 09:36:53	I take Xanax so that the anxiety stops physically hurting. I feel tired but rational. And I see no point inn continuing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-31 09:32:42	I don't understand anymore why most people even want to live
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-26 22:04:46	I've alienated absolutely everyone I've ever loved. It's a mercy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-26 21:36:33	shotgun
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-26 21:36:12	Everybody deserves better than me. I want someone to love so badly, but if I love that person, how can I ask them to put up with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-26 10:35:19	If I can't get someone to truly love me, maybe I can get them to hate me enough to kill me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-26 03:32:25	If you want to make me out to be the bad guy, then I guess I can't stop you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-26 01:37:34	Recovery isn't real. At best, it's just remission. It will always come back.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-26 01:17:55	Padme lost the will to live and just died. How does that work?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-26 01:15:16	Despite gobbling Xanax the last day or so, I can still barely control myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-25 11:57:25	No man is a failure if he has friends, so says this xmas classic. I guess I'm a failure.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-22 06:22:56	I've been sick for forty years. Will someone please put me out of my misery.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-22 05:54:19	Crazy, really crazy thoughts
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-22 05:14:40	I only know how to run away
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-22 05:14:17	I don't want to suffer anymore, but I'm to afraid to do anything about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-22 05:13:53	I've messed up my life, and I don't know how to fix it. And even if I knew how, I don't have the strength.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-21 09:19:03	Mood slipping again
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-21 06:34:05	Nausea, cold, and bad kids. Not a good day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-15 11:51:12	@mechanical_meat a little better for now. Thanks! :) how are you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-15 10:16:54	Hey everyone, I really really want to hear what YOU have to say, not always what someone else says and you retweet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-15 10:14:54	She is being so loving, and next week she will want to dump me. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-14 10:32:52	I feel like teenager with her. Always anxious.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-14 10:31:53	@ajane622 we just watched ep four
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-09 05:01:39	@BiPolar_Witch hahaha. Never thought of it that way. ")
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-09 04:19:54	@ajane622 not entirely
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-09 04:19:33	@BiPolar_Witch lol. We will see
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-09 04:19:11	@BiPolar_Witch they never stop talking it seems
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-09 04:18:26	@BiPolar_Witch have to take care of yourself. It's not just appearance either, it's health.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-08 10:48:24	@ajane622 stop letting him get to you like this
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-08 05:59:39	@ajane622 I wish
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-07 11:12:59	@BiPolar_Witch I notice that myself all the time. Makes me sad to see.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-07 01:06:23	If you blame other people for everything, it's no wonder you aren't happy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-05 12:49:59	When I die, I know I'm going to heaven because any place is heaven compared to this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-05 08:58:41	@ajane622 :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-05 04:41:33	Check social media to remember why.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-04 19:45:33	They say time heals everything, but what if you keep getting hurt again before you heal?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-04 08:58:41	Everything other than my relationships is going well. But that is enough to make me lose control.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-04 08:54:05	I'm having a fucking breakdown. Can't function.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-03 04:54:15	What is wrong with me that no one will love me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-03 04:53:59	She is just going to keep pulling away. I either have to keep fighting or let her go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-03 04:50:55	@ajane622 you are
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 22:30:28	I wish I knew when to quit
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 11:09:29	I've stopped being jealous and angry at other people who are happy. It's not their fault that I can't be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 11:08:34	@mechanical_meat thanks. You sound like things have improved? I'm glad for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 11:03:37	@mechanical_meat awful, but thanks for asking
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 11:01:37	@mechanical_meat oh crap. Sorry. I wasn't talking to you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 10:50:41	I've been on meds, and they made things worse. Just anything. Please.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 10:49:45	Next, but with nothing to look forward to. I have no courage to end my life, but I can't function anymore like this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 10:49:06	I am so desperate to still feeling this badly. It's been four years of compete misery. Fighting through each and every day to get to the...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 10:44:18	If my life is going to be mostly misery, why do you think you have the right to tell me I have to live?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 10:39:27	I've alienated you too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 09:00:18	I have to go. I will die here. Its my only chance to survive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 08:59:47	I just hope I can survive alone while I try to rebuild my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 08:59:29	I am going to leave my family because I don't love their mother anymore. She ignored and berated me for too long.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-02 07:59:58	Can you will yourself to be sick and die?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-12-01 11:36:17	I can never fall asleep after jiu jitsu, no matter how tired I am. Either too sore or too much adrenaline or both.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-30 09:21:07	I've already taken one Xanax, and I may need another. I've sat on this couch nearly the entire weekend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-30 09:14:53	I was all cried out months ago. Now I just feel tired and heavy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-30 08:56:23	Watched inside out. Couldn't understand how sadness helps people. No one comes to help me feel better when I'm sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-30 08:29:10	@the3hound @LePetiteNYC not that you feel strongly about it. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-30 08:23:36	Too early to take the knock out pill and get eight hours of near oblivion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-30 08:22:54	And I have no interest in anything at all anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-30 08:22:22	I can't even distract myself without being annoyed at how foolish I am being.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-30 08:19:43	So depressed, I can't even fantasize about a better life without feeling stupid.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-30 07:36:13	@the3hound @LePetiteNYC isn't that they point???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-30 03:00:41	I really don't know what I want. Being unhappy and depressed makes.it hard to change things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-30 01:09:35	I suppose xanax could help me break up with her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 23:27:18	@AWinters1982 well it needs to speed up or be cured
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 23:17:30	What if toxic people are the only people in your life?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 06:04:18	Yes, I know I'm negative. This is how I feel. Always. It's why I don't want to live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 06:03:37	Tired of her pulling away from me. Being upset at me. Never telling me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 05:13:49	Too depressed to get off the couch. Or eat. I showered though. It was a good place to hide.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 04:49:10	Alone in a crowd
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 04:48:39	Desperately need to connect
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 04:46:19	I've learned to shut my mouth and not complain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 03:11:53	Love sux. The one you love loves a another, while another loves you who you don't want.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 02:16:08	Twitter is occupied by the PC police. Ugh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 02:15:12	When you know things that matter can only get worse and there is nothing you can do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-29 02:10:21	Why do I feel so bad about possibly hurting the person who has caused me so much hurt?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-27 09:31:58	I feel so old and unattractive and useless. Why should anyone be my friend anyways. I don't understand people, so how can I be a friend back
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-27 08:31:00	Another Xanax and bed night
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-27 08:21:48	@ajane622 msg me if.you want
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-27 08:17:28	@ajane622 I can't fix it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-27 08:14:53	@ajane622 I've made such a mess of things
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-27 08:01:40	I don't know how to improve things without hurting the only people left who care about me. My life is a disaster.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-27 08:00:41	It's not like things are bad, they just are never good and they're getting worse. I have no desire to live but I won't do anything about it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-27 07:57:26	Haven't seen my parents for the holidays in 15 years. Can't say I want to, but I wish I had parents I did want to and who wanted to see me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-27 07:51:11	I know I don't want to stay, but I have no other friends or support system.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-26 10:26:02	@LePetiteNYC and cheaper...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-23 10:45:37	Is there a world record for the biggest poop by a five year old?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-16 09:22:21	I've noticed I don't post here much when I'm hypo. Guess what I'm not?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-09 10:52:34	Such a rollercoaster lately. Can't end well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-09 10:51:17	@LePetiteNYC just my mind? (Sorry, but someone had to say it)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-08 01:58:22	@Honest_Soul37 when do you move?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-04 05:29:19	@DailyBipolar hard not to tell. I keep existing to wake up back in my old house
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-11-04 04:47:23	I am dissociating again
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-29 03:23:55	I should go back on meds
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-29 02:05:05	It's surreal when someone you know is murdered by someone else you know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-28 08:03:44	It's not always the guy that is wrong
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-16 02:24:37	Crappy birthday to me. Actually its not so bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-13 03:38:14	People don't look past the surface. Don't decide if I'm right for you until you've actually met me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-13 02:36:44	Love is the best and worst emotion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-13 01:56:20	Love is the beat and worst emotion
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-13 00:50:56	Not feeling a little bit stronger
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-11 11:55:46	@LePetiteNYC knock on doors
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-11 10:55:47	Why do I never learn?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-11 05:41:40	@LePetiteNYC resting comfortably against the thigh of a hot waitress/bartender
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-11 05:40:36	@LePetiteNYC screwed
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-10 08:16:12	Sangria is still good
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-10 05:04:31	@Honest_Soul37 lol. It's fine
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-10 04:55:54	@BiPolar_Witch I am thoroughly enjoying!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-10 04:55:30	@Honest_Soul37 I like looking at it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-10 04:54:28	@Honest_Soul37 why do you keep changing your pic so often is the real question. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-10 04:11:11	@BiPolar_Witch one of my faves.. Making it now actually.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-09 09:48:07	@Honest_Soul37 me too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-09 01:01:54	Want to run away from it all. My failed marriage, my kids, my job. Somewhere quiet where my brain can stop thinking, my heart stop hurting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-09 00:58:17	@Honest_Soul37 head first?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-09 00:57:14	Never thought I'd prefer to be alone, but there it is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-08 09:56:26	Really trying to get a little bit stronger. https:// youtu.be/22zB6Soc2Gk
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-08 09:28:03	@Honest_Soul37 meanie
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-07 21:52:46	How am I supposed to find the strength to be alone. I can't even muster enough to get out if bed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-06 12:08:49	No sex and no sleep. Fun night.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-06 12:08:08	The last time I went this long without sex was the eighties.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-06 03:09:06	Things can always get worse. That is what keeps me up at night.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-05 09:01:18	After having this bad a day, I just want to have sex. But it'll be a year maybe before I do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-05 00:22:49	@zoe_bearx not if you like things salty
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-04 21:26:53	@zoe_bearx when people put ketchup on their fries without trying them... :D
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:45:28	Does anyone really believe that if guns were banned in the U.S. that violence would disappear here? Crazy anti gun people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:41:56	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything and you still ignore the 0.26 of your own county, so yes conversation over. I win. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:41:26	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything you aren't much of a math person if you group the 0.2 in Ukraine with the 10.6 of the U.S..
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:38:34	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything you kill a person with it?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:38:21	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything does putting a gun if front of a decent person make then want to shoot sometime? If I gave you a gun, would
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:37:17	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything higher, more than four times japan. What is up with that????
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:36:40	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything equivalent, not equal. They are both small in comparison to the U.S. And the http:// U.K.is even
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:35:48	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything like an inanimate object
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:35:40	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything why is it so hard to accept that the U.S.had bigger problems than guns. Why do people have to blame something
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:34:47	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything and they ask dwarf the us
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:34:19	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything you also mentioned the UK which had 0.26, which I believe is more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:31:37	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything toy are an idiot if you say guns shoot themselves.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:30:49	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything Ukraine is equivalent
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:22:11	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything no, have you even been to my country? It's a very violent culture. It doesn't need guns.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:16:59	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything it's not the guns, it is the culture in the United States
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:16:40	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything are you aware that there are many countries that allow guns but have just as few gun deaths?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:14:50	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything wait...no
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:14:44	@ianhamilton_ @denyyeverything can you have a shooting with just a gun? YES.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 07:06:44	@denyyeverything what is the difference? Blame anyone but the shooter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 06:58:43	It's so easy to stay to drink too much
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-02 05:56:49	Drinking seems to calm now that I can't exercise.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-10-01 09:30:45	Developing a serious tolerance to alcohol. Does that mean I'm drinking too much?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-29 04:15:39	@ThatSkinnyMum but they are soooo cute all swaddled up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-27 21:43:19	How am I supposed to have faith when I fail all the time. And I have no friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-27 21:22:12	I'm back to hating seeing other people happy. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-27 21:20:10	When the sadness is overwhelming, the best thing to do is....throw a temper tantrum and make things worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-27 11:04:58	Help
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-27 11:04:53	I dont know how to not torture myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 23:10:30	@LePetiteNYC @bullfrogr it's awful to go back
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 22:19:23	@bullfrogr it's ok. Just a lot of work to do. Ttyl. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 22:18:51	@bullfrogr ok idk
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 22:18:00	@bullfrogr hey it's been great taking, and we can talk later, but I have thirty ppl coming over in as few hours, so I have to start cooking.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 22:17:17	@bullfrogr no, just episodes, mostly blackouts as far as I know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 22:16:45	@bullfrogr we need to forgive ourselves. I mostly have, although the ppl around me havent
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 22:15:32	@bullfrogr I have no real experience with any psychosis, at least not since I was a kid.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 22:14:11	@bullfrogr :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 22:10:12	@bullfrogr I can be normal til Im not. I even see it switch over. But Ive done so much damage over the years, Im living w the repercussions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 22:02:47	@bullfrogr I took lithium for a while. It was amazing. I felt normal for the first time ever. Then I got side effects.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:55:04	@bullfrogr my son takes that. Keeps him calm, sort of
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:53:29	@bullfrogr well than that is a good thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:52:24	@bullfrogr Xanax is s Benzo, for anxiety. Very highly physically addictive. Awful awful drug.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:50:55	@bullfrogr meds don't help with the bpd thinking. Although the Xanax keeps my mouth shut
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:46:59	@bullfrogr maybe. I've been taking small doses of xanax as needed. It's helped and I don't have the physical need I used to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:45:53	@bullfrogr I suppose that is the conundrum
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:45:26	@BiPolar_Witch things only seem bad until they get worse
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:45:06	@BiPolar_Witch from what you've told me, you'll get they're again. I'm still technically successful, but I've found the easy way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:43:12	@bullfrogr I'm sensitive to meds, have all sorts of other problems.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:42:23	@bullfrogr if you had cancer, they'd accept it and allow you to die. But we just have to suffer. I won't do it just believe in the right to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:36:32	@BiPolar_Witch I'm sure it's hard for you, but I would be thrilled to get back to where you are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:32:17	@Danger_To_Self_ exactly
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 21:31:59	@bullfrogr isn't it cruel for them to just watch us suffer?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 18:33:19	It's even more depressing to see how your life really does suck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-26 04:58:24	@DailyBipolar thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-25 11:21:01	Cried more this summer than I have in the rest of my adult life. I would take depressed over having a good reason to be sad any day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-23 07:38:41	Nobody wants a guy that cries
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-23 07:11:47	@BipolarSanity I can't even spell. Ugh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-23 07:02:52	My idea of a prefect evening: curl up with a few drinks and a Xanax.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-22 10:09:37	And no one cares, so why should I?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-22 10:09:20	I can't do what I know is best for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-21 09:41:35	Women only think they want a guy who understands feelings. When they get one, they just call him a girl.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-21 09:40:21	Toughen up or break down. You can do both at the same time apparently.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-21 07:45:01	Started surreptitiously drafting a separation agreement.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-21 02:39:03	I don't have enough places to run to
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-21 01:00:04	@ThatSkinnyMum good luck!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-20 20:45:03	@Honest_Soul37 dedication? What, did they have a boat?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-18 03:35:00	@BiPolar_Witch don't be so sure
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-16 10:03:29	That would be no one pic.twitter.com/ywQTeqKDm2
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-15 07:42:37	So lonely
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-14 04:55:44	Leave the pieces https:// youtu.be/pHfSuBglk8E
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-14 01:40:08	Everyone is fighting, even the cats.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-14 01:30:39	And today alone and broke is sounding better than it really should.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-14 00:54:00	Hurt my back, wife is quitting on me again, and my kids are just mean to each other. Happy Sunday!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-14 00:43:13	I chose jobs to minimize how much I had to work. Now I hate weekends. Nothing left it seems.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-13 23:21:01	@Honest_Soul37 mine never fails to remind me as well
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-13 20:38:14	The more cleverly sounding the tweet, the less you should listen to it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-13 09:13:28	@Shawnie_0405 I exercise plenty. Lift three times a week, train jiu jitsu another three times. Still can't sleep. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-13 08:08:34	What should I drink tonight?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-12 20:40:24	Five hours of sleep again. Not even an entire bottle of wine could get me sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-12 09:39:25	Booze, gambling, and sex.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-12 08:56:14	@LePetiteNYC hmmm. What is that vodka drink with the ginger beer?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-12 08:54:53	@LePetiteNYC haha. Awesome. Now.What should I have?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-12 08:52:44	@LePetiteNYC have one for me!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-12 08:47:34	@LePetiteNYC don't we all? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-08 02:48:10	What I've done...again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-08 02:47:51	Medication wont undo all the damage I've done.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-08 02:43:30	No one likes a whiner, not even other whiners.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 23:31:16	Fine. I'm not strong anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 22:35:09	@AuntKwazy don't be scared to complain. It was definitely out of line.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 09:30:07	@BiPolar_Witch I believe it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 09:27:28	@BiPolar_Witch it usually does. Never thought of it that way
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 09:13:59	@BiPolar_Witch I've anyways mania and lsd provide the best insights
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 09:13:19	@BiPolar_Witch loss is the hardest
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 08:57:28	@BiPolar_Witch very profound
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 08:54:49	@BiPolar_Witch ain't that the truth. I sometimes wish I could be xtian and stupid
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 08:53:50	@BiPolar_Witch just a poll really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 08:38:41	@BiPolar_Witch wish it were easier to pretend sometimes though
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 08:11:02	@BiPolar_Witch sounds consistent with my experience.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 08:05:31	@Honest_Soul37 what happened?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 07:49:25	@BiPolar_Witch I hate life...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 07:11:08	Not sure why I keep resisting the Xanax and the booze.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 07:03:45	In such a bad bad place.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 07:03:13	@AuntKwazy tell her supervisor
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-07 06:19:34	Who thinks it is selfish to commit suicide?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-06 23:30:07	@Honest_Soul37 I've had enough experience for one lifetime
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-06 05:20:59	I am completely coming unraveled
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-06 05:04:45	I'm so sick of being a disappointment to everyone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-06 05:04:12	I always lose.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-06 04:54:05	Pretty sure I'm just getting what I deserve
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-06 04:31:51	Was pretty manic a few days ago, now I'm wishing I want such a coward when it comes to suicide. Sigh....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-06 00:26:47	@oldandskinny broke? Ni thank you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-06 00:06:39	Wife is right. No one else will put up with me. It may not be great with her, but at least she wants to be with me. Happiness is overrated.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-05 20:59:48	@Honest_Soul37 well I guess it isn't me anymore
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-05 07:02:52	I'm making a habit of falling in love with woman who don't love me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-01 10:41:15	@Honest_Soul37 is that a good or bad thing?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-01 08:57:39	I'm losing perspective
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-01 04:50:03	@tidelake hi!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-09-01 04:45:15	@tidelake rednecks aren't racist, despite popular bigotry towards them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-31 03:07:13	@teenwithbipolar my life too. Hope it gets better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-30 23:33:15	@Honest_Soul37 just let me know if you need additional moral support
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-30 23:29:12	@Honest_Soul37 it'll feel better once you do it. You'll feel worse if you don't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-30 23:05:10	@Honest_Soul37 yes you can. Just go. You can always come back.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-30 11:50:40	@LePetiteNYC wow. If I only could.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-30 08:08:39	I'm sure loads of people would be halt to have my problems. Well, I'd be glad to give them up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-30 08:07:42	You ever feel like the Biggest Loser, but not in that TV feel good kinda way...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-30 07:28:18	Given up on perfection. Just trying to stay alive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-30 01:34:38	That moment you realize that even though you are climbing out of the pit, you are still inside the pit nevertheless.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-27 08:17:08	@Honest_Soul37 read what?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-24 03:35:26	@BipolarSanity but I've never been dxed with bpd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-24 03:35:06	I need to stay taking more about #bpd than #bipolar . I can control my moods better than my behavior.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-23 09:02:05	About to be single. I'm 44 and everyone I know and work with is 30. I look younger, but I'm not sure how I'll meet anyone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-23 07:34:44	How the hell do you start dating again after 20 years of marriage,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-22 22:31:10	@danyellmarie117 I don't know... :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-22 22:23:22	At least I'm back to the upside.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-22 22:22:03	Decide to separate. Now we get along. So she doesn't want to separate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-22 09:02:20	@Honest_Soul37 there you are
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-21 17:58:56	@BiPolar_Witch if you see anything like me, the meds only work for so long
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-21 10:23:04	@BiPolar_Witch ever getting out of bed
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-20 07:54:30	Talking about smart things doesn't mean you are smart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-19 22:39:32	@Honest_Soul37 what happened?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-19 08:14:16	I want to live passionately again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-19 06:07:57	@Honest_Soul37 Saw them... ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-17 10:29:37	I am also pretty good at turning rock bottom into Rocky mountain high. Can always find a new low.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-17 10:27:17	I'm acting like a child. It's so humiliating and I can't control it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-17 10:26:07	Why can't I at least fuck up my life while enjoying a manic high?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-17 10:24:31	I'm really good at making things worse than I thought they could be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-16 02:02:56	@el_guerito_loco thank you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-16 00:36:36	Yup. It's decided. I'm going to be single.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-15 22:52:40	When you take the kids away, we have nothing left to say.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-15 22:45:23	I can't remember ever feeling this alone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-15 22:44:29	I have to tell my mom that my marriage is ending right before she watches her nephew get married.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-15 22:36:34	The end of a marriage is a pretty quiet thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-15 10:51:20	@nejireta_ki I'm sorry to hear that. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-14 09:32:47	@Honest_Soul37 take them off first!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-14 09:32:25	@Honest_Soul37 I'd be a big disappointment
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-14 09:31:51	@Honest_Soul37 and why was that ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-14 08:58:52	@Honest_Soul37 oh my...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-12 11:23:48	@Honest_Soul37 wish you could help me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-11 11:00:15	I don't need your permission to have these feelings. I won't feel bad for having them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-09 06:33:11	@DailyBipolar thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-09 06:30:48	@Honest_Soul37 I'm sorry
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-09 06:30:32	I'm not really trying, and I don't really have any hope.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-09 06:28:44	Apparently what everyone here calls self care is what my family calls lazy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-09 04:56:11	It's a Xanax day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-07 10:03:58	@Honest_Soul37 or a nightmare
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-07 10:01:03	@Honest_Soul37 or 45
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-07 04:50:41	@BiPolar_Witch you react to him and end up being the one who looks bad?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-07 04:39:43	@Honest_Soul37 all night poker?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-07 04:33:25	I can't remember how I used to trigger my (hypo)manic episodes. Dammit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-07 04:22:36	@BiPolar_Witch yeah. For all the good that does. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-07 04:17:40	Bipolar women are drawn to me and me to them. It's like a magnet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-05 10:42:07	@Honest_Soul37 look who isn't depressed anymore! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-05 09:12:33	@Honest_Soul37 something hard... Very hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-05 05:23:16	Lots of people seem to get better. I just go downhill very very slowly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-04 09:37:30	My heart is breaking into lots of little hearts. And those hearts are all being broken and crushed one by one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-04 09:27:08	I don't think I am rational. I am living on autopilot. And making major life decisions. This will end badly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-04 09:12:53	And I felt good on my way home too. Dammit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-04 09:11:23	@BiggieSmalley it's more wrong to nut need one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-04 09:09:42	Another turn for the worse. Doesn't seem to matter which way I turn.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-03 11:15:04	I've been the perfect boyfriend to someone who doesn't want me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-03 10:45:03	@sam_stone152 then they'll just make us work Saturdays.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-03 09:06:51	I'm very unhappy and dont want to deal with my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-03 07:20:57	@fuckitallidk so stop intimidating them. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-03 04:16:05	I hate my life and what I've done to it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-03 04:14:23	I may have said this before, but if suicide were easier, the population strain on the planet might come more into balance.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-03 04:08:04	Went to the mall for contacts, exhausted now. I hate this
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-03 03:46:30	Feel like the only thing I have to say is how unhappy I am. Probably not the best way to get people to want to be around me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-01 22:42:16	Cling tight come hell or high water or completely let go. There really is no middle ground now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-01 22:07:28	Love isn't all it seems I did you wrong, I'll stay here with you till this dream is gone...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-01 09:06:39	Of course I now feel like its all my fault.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-08-01 09:05:58	Slowly falling apart, just like my marriage.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-31 06:37:25	@AimeeHinds not yet. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-31 06:23:11	@AimeeHinds mine give us a whole tray at a time. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-31 03:13:16	@Honest_Soul37 none of then talk to me, and half are inactive accounts
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-30 11:53:44	@fuckitallidk not properly diagnosed, but yeah.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-30 11:51:31	@fuckitallidk me too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-30 04:05:54	My teenager is so lazy that he has his younger brother make him meals.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-30 03:52:55	@Honest_Soul37 he doesn't have his own, and he doesn't even know how to love you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-29 08:20:16	@Honest_Soul37 I've never said that
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-29 07:02:40	@Honest_Soul37 sounds like my house
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-29 07:00:50	@Honest_Soul37 he is old enough to feed himself
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-29 06:57:50	@Honest_Soul37 you are a good mom
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-29 06:49:10	@Honest_Soul37 he looks soooo happy. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-29 06:46:34	Good friend of mine pointing out how crappy it is to be single. I already know how lousy it can be married. Wtf?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-27 09:15:48	Well I benzo'd away my feelings for a short while.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-27 02:06:02	I always feel more at peace when I accept that I don't want to be alive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-27 00:29:09	According to my wife, my parents sabotaged my marriage
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-27 00:23:21	My marriage is over, but I think I've decided to stay. I am not functioning enough to take care of myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-26 23:42:43	If this was a physical illness, all would see how much I suffered and for how long, and would be happy for me if my suffering was ended.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-26 23:40:16	Release me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-26 23:25:35	Can't breathe well from the anxiety
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-26 23:14:24	Sadness and depression is an overwhelming combination.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-26 21:35:47	Wife explained that she had resented me most of our marriage. My moods were to volatile in the early years.At least she is finally honest.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-26 06:12:23	There IS a huge difference between depressed and sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-26 05:23:28	For my crush... https:// play.google.com/music/m/T2c6bl vtwpnsvr5wvdhvr6zaeyi?t=No_Air_-_Jordin_Sparks_Chris_Brown …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-26 05:20:47	https:// youtu.be/Mu6sdbxD3gU Leave the pieces when you go. This song is my whole life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-24 21:18:09	Burning house by Cam. Reflects my life. https:// youtu.be/wlhBizyeo8s
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-24 21:12:30	I'd rather be depressed than this sad. At least I would know rationally I should feel better and that I'll snap out if it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-24 11:29:33	Trying so hard to be happy. Failing
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-24 11:28:46	Can't stop doing dumb stuff
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-24 04:38:06	If you aren't into sex, I don't think you are bipolar. Just sayin'
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-23 12:10:16	@Honest_Soul37 how come
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-23 10:40:55	@Honest_Soul37 and....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-21 08:53:45	@BiPolar_Witch so sorry. Been there. Eat more ice cream? Hope you get past it soon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 05:59:55	Now what?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 05:58:05	Filled out and paid for the application for wife's apt. Feeling very numb right now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 04:39:21	@BiPolar_Witch @pl_larsh it's a very odd thing to me but very true.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 04:27:44	I was gonna tweet that going to the pool makes me sad....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 04:26:39	My former karate instructor, who was so violent that he broke my finger the first time I ever sparred, just announced s/he is transgender.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 04:22:31	@BiPolar_Witch thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:56:53	@BiPolar_Witch stats and math can be two different things. There are formulas and "interpretations". One is exact and the other...isn't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:42:52	@BiPolar_Witch math. I'll spare you the details. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:35:42	@BiPolar_Witch that is awesome! Congrats!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:35:14	@BiPolar_Witch we are. So what? Not like we can change it much.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:25:49	@BiPolar_Witch what was your thesis in if you don't mind my asking?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:24:02	@BiPolar_Witch I was happiest in school. Actually was kinda addicted to it. Fell apart upon graduating with the phd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:23:11	@BiPolar_Witch came out fine. My intelligence is what allows me to function. I do take mh days from time to time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:19:05	@Honest_Soul37 I try
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:18:55	@BiPolar_Witch 13 diag adhd, anxiety. Pretty clear that 13, 11 are bp though, esp 11 who is just like I was. 5 is a pain in the ass but norm
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:16:25	@BiPolar_Witch mine are 13, 11, and 5. Top 2 are definitely bipolar. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:14:18	@BiPolar_Witch I am pretty sure you have social skills. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:11:58	@BiPolar_Witch like that. Sry. :/
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:09:53	@BiPolar_Witch I think I life that. How old are your three?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:09:16	@Honest_Soul37 keep pissing him off. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 02:08:03	@BiPolar_Witch dictionary defines nerd as "a foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is boringly studious."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 01:49:27	@BiPolar_Witch dammit! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 01:45:26	@BiPolar_Witch hmmm. Where is the cherry???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 01:38:22	@Honest_Soul37 I had a 20 lb cat. He was big boned.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 01:36:20	@BiPolar_Witch I really want to be turned on, does that count? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 01:33:25	@BiPolar_Witch love ice cream, love sex. Yet, can't believe I'm saying this, not sure the combo sounds good at all. :/
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 01:27:54	@brightonbipolar are black ppl proud to be nggrs? No, it's nasty and derogatory. You are proud to be who you are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 01:26:11	@brightonbipolar yeah, I don't buy the whole embrace the insult thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 01:25:39	My son just said that a meteor could make humanity extinct at any time. Which is precisely why his mom and I are separating.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-20 01:23:16	@Honest_Soul37 he isn't that big
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 23:36:13	@Honest_Soul37 enormous?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 22:42:37	At the risk of sounding nerdy, it might be nice to be assimilated by the Borg. To feel powerful and never alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 22:38:39	@Honest_Soul37 please tell me it's a dog
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 21:48:00	A very very pretty girl was fully stretched out on my bed this morning wanting to be caressed...meow.

500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 12:27:21	I truly am an awful person. I suppose it's no surprise I'm alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 12:25:05	I'm tired but the anxiety will spike as soon as I go to bed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 12:23:29	Let me have the strength to let ppl go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 10:06:39	@el_guerito_loco I hope so. Or I'll be lonely and overwhelmed taking care of the kids
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 08:45:52	My boy cat drools on me when I pet him. My girl cat plays hard to get. Who says animals aren't like people?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 08:35:11	So for those left who know about my marital problems, she is moving out probably this week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 07:30:31	@LePetiteNYC they probably could :D
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-19 07:29:18	@LePetiteNYC gorgeous eyes...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-17 11:56:09	Xanax will calm me down by making me accept how pathetic I am.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-16 03:38:45	@Honest_Soul37 I like it. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-15 06:31:05	The new pathetic is watching your chat to see if your message is read.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-15 03:43:41	It's going to be very strange if I keep the house but she keeps the kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-15 03:40:35	So very tired of being lied to. At least four people I am close to have done so in the last few days.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-14 09:15:57	Who am I kidding
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-14 09:01:55	I'm gonna die crying
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-13 09:24:57	I've never understood why ambien wakes me up before it knocks me out
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-13 06:08:04	I doubt I could be in a more foul mood.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-13 02:20:55	@danyellmarie117 it certainly sounds good, but if you are willing to die for a cause, sometimes that is what happens.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-13 02:15:48	@danyellmarie117 not sure if I think you can often win, but it's a good start.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-13 01:57:58	@danyellmarie117 how do you feel about racists, bigots, misogynists, etc?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-13 01:31:53	@danyellmarie117 then why do we do it?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-13 01:11:30	Why isn't it hypocritical to hate someone for being hateful?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-13 00:21:47	@LePetiteNYC good to be a woman then, you can wear a skirt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-12 02:24:28	I may be a black belt in karate, but I'm a white belt in life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-08 03:58:15	Wife called me at work to discuss details of the separation. Couldn't wait until we were home in person.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-07 10:37:10	I want to lie naked in bed with a woman and her tell me how happy she is. #impossibledream
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-07 03:30:33	Had sex with my wife. #WeekendRegretsIn5Words
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-06 03:05:08	@el_guerito_loco thanks. For the best, at least it'll be progress one way or another.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-06 03:03:21	The separation is for real.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-05 23:54:50	If I am going to live alone, I need to try and do things right. Or is it left? I'm so confused...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-05 06:36:29	It appears that we are going to have a trial separation
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-05 03:32:35	@el_guerito_loco @ThinnerSpinster me too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-05 02:49:35	I don't even act normal anymore. The pressure has given way to cracks and fissures.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-05 00:25:22	Fight or flight response kicking in.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-04 08:05:59	@BiPolar_Witch we must be better than the date! ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-04 02:01:17	Bought a new Gi! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-03 12:40:51	@36Shades_Of_Me good for you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-02 09:57:14	Been getting so much shit about contemplating suicide despite having children. Solution is simple: live dangerously.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-02 09:55:11	I think my life is getting to the put up or shut up point. I whine and complain. I need to act or just keep it to myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-02 09:51:17	@LilMiss_Prozac @36Shades_Of_Me yeah, I have that anxiety, but I still agree with the second part.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-02 09:50:09	@BiggieSmalley I'm the opposite, always thinking there is more I can get out. Never accepting it's over.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-02 07:21:22	This had been the worst week in years
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-02 07:17:39	Sometimes the best thing to do is clean house. Get rid of everyone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-02 04:55:45	@LePetiteNYC and I'd rather get hurt me physically than the emotional shit she has put me through
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-02 04:53:44	@LePetiteNYC I don't hit people. But I've been hit by my wife.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-02 04:51:08	@LePetiteNYC I didn't mean that
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-02 04:50:11	@LePetiteNYC the crying is not always any different.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-02 04:46:58	When women are upset, they cry and everyone feels bad. When a guy is upset, he gets angry, and the world punishes him for it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-07-01 12:24:05	@hairypeachbill not at all, but it's sweet you thought of me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 23:20:14	@coffeetattoos that just isn't true. Maybe it works for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 23:16:54	@coffeetattoos in fact, I could say your initial response to me discounted all the years of pain and suffering that I've been through
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 23:15:18	@coffeetattoos in the context of your response to me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 23:10:43	@coffeetattoos lol. Don't get defensive. I said what you haven't been through not what you have. There is a difference.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 22:48:33	@hairypeachbill that's sweet, but it's been working out that way
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 22:43:33	@coffeetattoos I actually cope well, but it really isn't worth it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 22:43:02	@coffeetattoos not yet you haven't. Take another twenty years. Add jobs and kids and marriage. I felt the same at your age.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 22:38:49	@coffeetattoos you are too young to say that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 22:36:18	I'm sick of trying and being second best. I quit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 22:33:04	Why are humans so against suicide. The fleeting moments of happiness aren't worth the work and pain in the interim.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 22:26:06	I'm willing to Fuck everything up on the chance it might get better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 13:09:04	The manic ended yesterday, but now I am in the process of losing every important relationship I had. It seems to be a goal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 09:31:32	I'm just being ignored.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 09:25:21	I fell of the cliff, but I didn't die. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-28 05:49:57	Single and paying whores might be the way to go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-27 14:50:47	I am not well anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-27 14:39:17	WRONG!!! The best girls will care about you and treat you right. https:// twitter.com/EternalQuote_/ status/614276985867481088 …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-27 14:15:23	Knowing something is going to happen and dealing with it when it does are two totally different things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-26 06:22:38	@36Shades_Of_Me have fun!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-26 04:24:17	@36Shades_Of_Me where are you going?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-22 03:39:24	@LePetiteNYC I'm lucky not to have dealt with the latter. They probably think your issues are some unrelated disease
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-22 03:34:04	@LePetiteNYC I suppose mine were loving, but way too self centered to have children.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-21 10:00:03	@djsooz1 @jongoulding @ahddrv by no one, I mean most would still disagree
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-21 09:59:20	@djsooz1 @jongoulding @ahddrv you would still be unhappy because no one would agree with you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-21 01:27:48	@djsooz1 @jongoulding @ahddrv I just don't understand the quote. It sounds like you advocate revolution.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-20 12:36:31	@jongoulding @ahddrv @djsooz1 ok, why is it good to be actively disobedient?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-19 07:23:57	@djsooz1 @ahddrv maybe. The candidates control the debate. Anyways I respect your opinion
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-19 07:16:27	@djsooz1 @ahddrv just saying that good people won't run. And even if they did, they'd be bad politicians.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-19 07:12:59	@djsooz1 @ahddrv it's not a conspiracy that people who wasn't to run are arrogant. Its human nature.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-19 07:06:24	@djsooz1 @ahddrv I don't know where you live, but when your candidate loses, It is still democracy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-19 07:04:16	@djsooz1 @ahddrv we already have that. Democracy means that half the time, you wont like the way things are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-19 06:58:17	@ahddrv @djsooz1 why would it be a good thing for people to be aggressive and disobedient?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-19 06:44:48	Crush and kids giving me an anxiety attack.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-19 05:24:48	Super anxious about something I should be happy about. I don't get me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-18 09:29:51	@BiPolar_Witch mine is girls, poker, and pills...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-16 08:24:33	@leah_michal @LePetiteNYC hahahaa. I do that. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-16 08:23:26	@LePetiteNYC you aren't too bad at tweeting. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-16 08:21:03	@LePetiteNYC people think I am odd when I tell them not to call but text me if they want me to respond.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-14 23:25:49	If a person is uncomfortable with their body, do you think it's okay to have plastice surgery? Nose.job, breast augmentation, sex change?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-13 10:18:35	@Jennka1 finally!!! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-12 07:33:34	@Jennka1 I never liked talking to people who would wait for you to say things based on their setup
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-12 07:31:26	@Jennka1 I get it. Last month, I spent a couple of days trying to figure out what was going on with this guy I knew. Wasnt gonna ask though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-12 07:22:08	@Jennka1 did you want someone to ask what the message was? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-11 10:05:36	@Numbaholic and the other ten percent will never leave you alone again
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-11 08:40:12	@LePetiteNYC secret to life...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-11 08:33:36	@LePetiteNYC eh, I don't believe you. At least on the moment, you were content. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-11 08:12:49	In an effort to post good things, we had a work picnic today, and it was a lot of fun. Made new friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-11 08:11:56	@LePetiteNYC you look happy. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-09 23:03:31	@sam_stone152 it wouldn't be awesome unless it was better than most.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-07 12:46:04	@LePetiteNYC if only...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-07 01:00:08	It is depressing to realize you don't have something good to focus on. https:// twitter.com/Modern__Hippy/ status/606958818258395136 …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-07 00:55:11	I'm not feeling suicidal, but it would be easier.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-07 00:21:49	If I think about it, I realize I am way past the breaking point. But I'm also reaching the where I can't distract myself anymore either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 21:50:27	@oldandskinny then you must own your house outright? No mortgage is a good thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 21:46:46	I need to take this to heart. https:// twitter.com/LivinwithBATma n/status/607181309195239425 …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 21:41:49	@oldandskinny don't you have insurance?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 21:37:58	@oldandskinny that is awful. At least this is a problem that will pass
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 21:26:14	@oldandskinny are you ill?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 21:23:46	@oldandskinny you aren't in prison or tied up, so it's really mentally impossible for you. You've put up barriers. Things you won't do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 21:10:49	Badly need to escape
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 20:07:53	Had the chance to sleep all morning. Even took a sleeping pill. Woke up at 630. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 19:24:19	Have a bad feeling about this weekend. Lots of things may be coming to an end.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 07:16:46	@Loopylou1710 didn't say they didn't love me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 06:59:43	I've become too miserable and selfish to be a good dad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-06 05:37:49	Way too tired today to have kids. They don't sympathize with this problem.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-05 08:26:56	I hate feeling I have to beg for sex.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-04 04:58:02	@LePetiteNYC hurts more too. #ignoranceisbliss
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-04 04:55:53	@LePetiteNYC liver shot is better
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-04 04:23:19	@LePetiteNYC how about purrs and meows? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:44:51	@el_guerito_loco yes very very agitated.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:43:47	@LePetiteNYC options are good too...Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:43:28	@LePetiteNYC lots of opinions are good. I like a woman with an opinion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:43:06	@Numbaholic thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:41:13	@LePetiteNYC I wish. I have Xanax and ambien available. Oh and ice cream.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:40:19	@Numbaholic haha. I'm shaking. So that sounds about right
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:36:49	Mania plus depression equals...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:34:04	@_elegantgiraffe you need a lot of energy. I would agree with you on your description. Too bad you have to put up with that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:23:50	@_elegantgiraffe she will get herself fired eventually
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:17:57	@_elegantgiraffe haha. I remember that. Everyone for themselves.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:14:19	@_elegantgiraffe been there, that is a lot of work. I liked restaurants, but it's exhausting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:11:29	@_elegantgiraffe sorry, was asking if you worked as a server in a restaurant
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 08:05:25	@_elegantgiraffe server?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 07:37:23	@Jennka1 aren't we the exact opposite? Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 07:35:36	I still hate peppy people
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 07:22:41	Was feeling pretty good too, but I managed to depress myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 07:02:35	Instead of being excited to see her more, I feel terribly sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 06:32:52	Really don't want to be in love with the crush. Haven't even slept with her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-03 05:19:51	@36Shades_Of_Me HATE 8
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-02 22:43:32	Have to choose between two good choices. Could have worse problems. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-02 22:06:58	@LePetiteNYC if it won't fit right if you lose weight, then that is motivation not to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-06-01 09:36:13	@Anonynay how many peni are you looking at?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-31 14:09:18	@36Shades_Of_Me take another Xanax and go to sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-31 14:08:51	@36Shades_Of_Me listen to the lyrics https:// youtu.be/0IJiVwE1y3c
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-31 01:53:46	@LePetiteNYC happy happy happy! You are an adult now! ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-26 21:47:10	@36Shades_Of_Me haha, swing it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-25 10:09:56	@36Shades_Of_Me I'm honest with you. But I'd say that if I was lying too. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-25 09:31:48	@36Shades_Of_Me what happened
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-23 22:23:30	@oldandskinny I did. Nice choice. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-23 21:58:09	@oldandskinny no idea who that is. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-23 21:48:27	@oldandskinny which sexy movie star???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-23 12:02:43	I want to leave so badly
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-23 11:47:46	If you are gonna pray for me, be kind and don't make judgment on the best way to end my suffering.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-23 11:37:45	Id rather drink myself into a stupor than have to see her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-23 11:28:41	I am toxic, and I even know it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-23 11:28:17	It is completely irrelevant if I am #bipolar or #bpd or just a fucking #addict
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-22 09:18:50	Now I lay me down to sleep And pray the Lord my soul to keep If I should wake before I die I shall hang my head and cry
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-22 09:10:41	If it makes me happy, could y'all forgive me?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-22 09:09:56	@oldandskinny thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-22 08:48:46	@oldandskinny no
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-22 08:26:30	My wife... https:// twitter.com/angelsnest777/ status/601539339097546752 …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-22 08:15:42	I'm sorry that I rarely ever post anything positive. When i feel better, I shouldn't disappear
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-22 08:10:31	It's working. I still feel no desire to live, but I don't care too much.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-22 07:57:26	@tweety123pie three or four years
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-22 07:36:49	Do old xanax still work?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-22 07:25:37	Gonna steal the wife's Xanax and go away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-21 06:31:23	@ThinnerSpinster feel better. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-20 08:41:24	@ThinnerSpinster I hope so too. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-20 08:39:03	@ThinnerSpinster I'm sorry. What an awful day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-20 08:38:42	@LePetiteNYC calories are calories. Sure there are better ones, but fake it till you make it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-20 08:37:01	@LePetiteNYC chocolate?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-20 08:36:19	@ThinnerSpinster that is awful. I'm surprised they released you like that. If you still feel like this tomorrow, you should go back.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-20 08:32:54	@ThinnerSpinster nos = not otherwise specified
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-20 08:25:38	@36Shades_Of_Me ur funny...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-20 08:02:30	@36Shades_Of_Me oh that is what my wife does to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-19 08:43:14	@bipolarchick too many ppl here write books about bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-19 08:42:46	@36Shades_Of_Me why did you add her if she is moving out?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-18 05:12:05	@LePetiteNYC unless you are a republican. :p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-18 03:33:37	So my crazy mind is trying to decide whether to leave my wife or buy a ultra hd tv. #mania
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-17 10:11:51	@Jennka1 thank you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-17 10:08:34	@LePetiteNYC you look plastered! ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-17 08:42:06	@Jennka1 ready and actually ending it are different, but thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-17 07:03:50	@LePetiteNYC if it were me, i'd do you one better: macaroni grill!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-17 07:01:37	@LePetiteNYC yeah, guy ought to take you somewhere a little more classy, like Wendy's
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-17 06:18:30	@36Shades_Of_Me it's not for me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-17 06:04:13	@LePetiteNYC oooh, hot date
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-17 05:48:57	I am actually ready to end my marriage.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-17 02:22:32	@LePetiteNYC if there are eggs in them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-16 15:44:08	Came home after playing poker for ten hours. It's almost 4 am, yet I still need something to fall asleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-15 11:49:43	Been exhausted all week. Went to bed early. That was two hours ago.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-15 10:01:30	Something good finally happened to me and there is absolutely no one to share it with.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-15 09:57:38	Don't get her. She knows this is a big deal to me and she doesn't say a word.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-14 07:17:37	@36Shades_Of_Me of course it isn't, well unless it is. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-14 06:55:35	@36Shades_Of_Me I'm sorry
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-14 00:15:07	@36Shades_Of_Me :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-13 20:55:03	Funny how something stupid can ruin your whole day, and that can ruin a life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-12 11:26:46	Can't see straight I'm so tired, but definitely can't sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-12 11:23:04	Every word.... Daylight Fading, by Counting Crows: http://www. lyricsfreak.com/c/counting+cro ws/daylight+fading_20033507.html …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-11 10:14:53	I think my wife cleans to avoid me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-11 10:11:35	I am starting to think people are afraid of having fun. Like it's immoral. God forbids it, or there are people suffering, so how could I?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-11 09:26:17	@ThinnerSpinster your kids? Wow. That is great. Are things better with the son?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-11 05:57:18	My kids won't even listen to their mom on mother's day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-11 02:15:55	@LePetiteNYC some things are genetic. It's not your fault.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-11 00:28:04	@oldandskinny at least one kid, or you really don't know what it means. It's ignorant to say otherwise.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-10 23:52:35	Women with pets are not mother's. Sorry. Don't disrespect the real moms.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-10 08:59:11	@leah_michal is 25 years awhile?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-10 08:54:45	Just pathetic. I won't ever grow up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-10 08:54:20	@leah_michal it's more than a distraction
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-10 08:53:51	Even when in relatively happy, it's still so much work being me, and then I have a household of 7 people and pets to care and provide for
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-10 08:52:40	I am so overstimulated
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-10 08:51:54	@leah_michal doesnt matter. Manic or not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-10 08:51:29	I have the mentality of a teenage boy even though I got 25 more years than that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-10 08:50:54	I only want to gamble, drink, have sex.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-10 08:50:34	Wtf is wrong with me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-09 23:52:00	Wife never looks at me when I'm naked.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-09 20:53:19	Crush wants me to go with her to NYC for the weekend to visit her friends and family...platonically. Doesn't sound like the best idea.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-08 09:51:38	@LePetiteNYC drink a lot of water right before the appointment just to make sure you don't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-07 07:36:36	@36Shades_Of_Me as long as there is no one else. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-07 07:12:14	@36Shades_Of_Me you have somewhere for me to go?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-07 07:06:15	@36Shades_Of_Me I am getting four weeks starting next month, just two right now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-06 09:29:38	pic.twitter.com/qwMhgJ9jn2
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-06 08:25:51	@nejireta_ki you get a lot of vacation then in oz, we are lucky to get two weeks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-05 23:04:34	@DailyBipolar there are other ways to get protein: cheese, tofu, eggs
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-05 18:08:29	@DailyBipolar I can avoid it, I tend to have more energy when I eat less sugar and mute protein. I exercise a lot for what it's worth.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-05 08:27:18	@Jennka1 all of mine get scared. Even.the cats.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-05 08:24:17	@Jennka1 don't your kids get scared?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-04 08:14:14	@36Shades_Of_Me you are being sarcastic....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-04 08:05:24	@36Shades_Of_Me yeah I suppose I don't hate her that much...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-04 08:01:05	@36Shades_Of_Me lol. Cute
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-04 07:59:01	@36Shades_Of_Me they are old enough for me to want to put them back
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-04 07:54:45	@36Shades_Of_Me this is so dumb
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-04 07:50:30	As if my day wasn't bad enough, I am now watching the Lego movie.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-04 06:08:08	I love my kids, but I really hate taking them places. I must be a really bad parent because they are so badly behaved.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 22:55:04	@36Shades_Of_Me I don't know. Baseball bores me to tears, I have barely watched in over ten years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 09:02:59	@Jennka1 thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 08:31:01	@36Shades_Of_Me I'm warm
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 08:28:30	@36Shades_Of_Me oops. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 08:26:58	@36Shades_Of_Me lol, I meant that drink you mentioned. Haha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 08:26:36	@36Shades_Of_Me enjoy a rum orgasm for me!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 08:25:17	@36Shades_Of_Me it's ok, you can check in, but there are a few people coming over.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 08:24:12	@36Shades_Of_Me yup
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 08:20:41	It's fight night!!! Woo hoo.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 08:20:23	@36Shades_Of_Me I suppose you dont mean that in the good way. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 08:19:02	@36Shades_Of_Me oh, he really sucks then
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 07:52:43	@36Shades_Of_Me just noticed I do too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 07:51:10	@36Shades_Of_Me buy him one of those massaging foot baths.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 07:27:38	@ThinnerSpinster just the best!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 00:49:46	So the rest of my day is watching my sons soccer team lose and not getting to see the fight of the century. Sigh....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 00:20:23	@MyNocturnalSoul Twitter!!!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 00:15:48	@MyNocturnalSoul it's gonna take hours, cause I am sore and tired. Just not gonna think about it. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 00:08:45	@MyNocturnalSoul I'm very very slowly pushing through mine. At least you were able to finish.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-03 00:02:54	Always weirdly overstimulated after playing poker all night.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-02 23:40:49	@36Shades_Of_Me go blue! ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-02 23:07:17	@LePetiteNYC someone hurts you, so you get mad, don't know what to do with it, so you punish yourself?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-02 23:06:05	@LePetiteNYC it's all random anyways, gotta create your own advantages, and minimize sabotaging yourself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-02 23:04:06	@LePetiteNYC conscience is a symptom of over thinking. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-02 22:59:36	@LePetiteNYC only if it is the only way you remember who not to trust and thus avoid repeating mistakes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-02 22:11:19	@Lib_fallenangel if they are truly putting you down, you should block them. They have a problem, not you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-05-01 09:19:34	Isn't it disappointing when you feel better all day, but then you deflate right before bed?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-30 23:35:13	@36Shades_Of_Me where you going
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-30 23:35:10	@36Shades_Of_Me awesome!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-30 08:42:45	Need a new Nick for the "crush", cause I am way over it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-29 09:24:08	What the hell do I ever do to deserve the way I am treated. Fuck you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-28 07:59:29	It's turning back to anger. All of it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-28 07:53:35	I'm shaking
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 10:19:25	@oldandskinny easy a cuke. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 10:18:47	@PAPAkeePARI @Anonynay it also doesn't mean they won't be. If you are the cider of your problems and don't change, the problems will stay.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 07:53:01	@36Shades_Of_Me I think you are flirting. :P. I prefer pancakes!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 07:50:16	@36Shades_Of_Me and I thought you liked me... ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 07:43:08	@36Shades_Of_Me I HATE that episode. Every time it comes on, all 3 chant it all day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 04:52:44	@BipolarSanity cause if I dont get rid of her, I am gonna get rid of me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 04:50:54	Everyone is gong to hate me, but I am used to that. This marriage is gonna be OVER.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 04:46:15	@36Shades_Of_Me hell yeah
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 02:46:34	@oldandskinny it'd only make it worse
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 02:00:51	@oldandskinny good for you. I'm glad you are doing something!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 01:23:43	Wow, kids are listening to mmm bop. Sigh, thought I'd taught them better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 00:59:04	It's harder to cope when you have people always around. And it's hard to feel better when you are alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 00:23:05	I have done the distraction thing well for so long that I was surprised to notice things hadn't actually changed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-27 00:19:23	The right to control your own body includes the right to end your life. #suicideisliberty
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 10:13:35	@ThinnerSpinster @burrohazard so stupid too. Makes the real protestors lose credibility.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 10:11:36	@burrohazard @ThinnerSpinster rioting and looting
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 10:07:38	@ThinnerSpinster for some reason, not on my feed. It's weird cause I always hear about all other protests
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 10:04:06	@Numbaholic well you are one tough girl. That's a lot of vodka for someone your size
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 10:02:20	@ThinnerSpinster I have a friend who lives in the middle of it all
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 10:01:24	@ThinnerSpinster apparently they imported protesters from Ferguson and NYC
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 09:58:04	No one is talking about B'more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 09:57:12	@Numbaholic feel better tomorrow. :)

500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 08:54:43	So cranky, and the crush is coming over soon with her bf
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 08:18:33	Don't be confused and think I am a nice person.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 08:05:56	I'm miserable alone, I'm miserable with my family. I'm just a miserable sob. Just let me be gone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 07:54:31	She emasculates me for sport
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 07:53:20	I need to get out
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 06:39:22	@36Shades_Of_Me which one
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 01:52:11	A boy's birthday party is not for the faint of heart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 01:23:52	@36Shades_Of_Me I like little things
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 01:08:43	@36Shades_Of_Me I guess I am just too easy...lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 00:50:59	@36Shades_Of_Me now you are turning me on. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-26 00:44:35	@36Shades_Of_Me awww. But you are fierce!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 20:24:17	@36Shades_Of_Me :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 20:22:37	@36Shades_Of_Me uh oh. Then I'm in trouble. :D
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 20:05:51	@36Shades_Of_Me soccer only sucks because the birthday boy is probably the worst player on a really bad team.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 20:03:19	@36Shades_Of_Me you might be too little to give a true bear hug. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 19:38:24	@36Shades_Of_Me coach soccer, throw birthday party, and crush with bf coming to watch boxing to top it off for me

500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 09:55:26	@oldandskinny and la vie sucks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 09:55:13	@oldandskinny cest la vie
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 09:40:16	@oldandskinny I'm sorry. Choices, even with the best intentions, can bite you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 09:35:22	@oldandskinny it wasn't a good place back then
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 09:34:53	@oldandskinny cool. I grew up with many poles. I did some research with a guy in warsaw.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 09:31:22	@oldandskinny I used to date a girl from Budapest amd another from Odessa
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 09:28:44	@oldandskinny the American "dream"
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 09:28:25	@oldandskinny where from?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 09:20:02	So cranky. I'm not in sync with anyone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 08:45:46	@LePetiteNYC cause you are in a NYC bar?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 08:38:18	@oldandskinny self esteem movement
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 08:31:51	Ditto https:// twitter.com/oldandskinny/s tatus/591758832528855040 …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 05:56:07	@oldandskinny yes better than then, at least for now
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 05:19:41	@oldandskinny ok i guess
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 04:49:35	Still have tons of xanax, but it's expired. I should be good and seek out a new prescription.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-25 04:48:05	@ThinnerSpinster of course I do. But grooving with s pict is a much deeper reference.

500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-24 09:26:23	Winning a grappling match does wonders for ones desire to live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-24 01:41:04	@SageSilk aye that's the rub...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 20:08:25	@36Shades_Of_Me thanks. I don't think I can though. Nothing is giving even a little, so it's gonna end up being me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 11:30:30	I basically told her I'm sorry I'm such an asshole. Cause she already thinks it anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 11:29:27	Tomorrow will be a better day. Mostly cause it would be really hard for it to be worse. Except mom is coming....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 11:16:40	@36Shades_Of_Me @burrohazard @ThinnerSpinster @LePetiteNYC @oldandskinny pic.twitter.com/uayvaJw6kr
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 10:41:34	@36Shades_Of_Me at least someone truly does.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 10:03:44	@oldandskinny thank you. I do appreciate it. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 09:52:24	@oldandskinny thanks. I'm going to bed soon. Hopefully tomorrow will be better
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 09:47:42	@oldandskinny no. I can go.see a dr but not a hospital
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 09:47:13	@burrohazard absolutely a life saver...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 09:45:11	@oldandskinny this job can't. Long story. In patient is just not an option.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 09:42:13	@burrohazard no, they are very affectionate, they want love
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 09:36:40	At least my cats won't leave me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 08:45:40	@LePetiteNYC you can try but I can't promise it'll help
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 08:44:25	@LePetiteNYC bad
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 08:43:50	I need to collect the right tools. Not for tonight though. Too weak.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 07:14:05	@el_guerito_loco then I don't exist
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 05:34:39	@burrohazard that isn't why. More complicated than that. Let's just say I'll lose my job.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 05:31:07	@burrohazard I'd love to go, but I don't think it's an option.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-23 05:25:16	I'm very sick now and probably dying. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-22 22:03:30	God I felt happy with her yesterday, and now she is gone. I am not strong enough to try again, and I should know I'm not allowed to be happy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-22 22:01:06	And I just push everyone away and don't really know why. But it's probably easier anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-22 21:59:36	I'm not strong enough to love or be loved. I'm not strong enough to just live. But I just might be strong enough to die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-22 14:30:18	In the car just now, I put a bullet through my head. It was very real, except for the gun and the bullet. Now I am living on borrowed time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-22 14:11:15	Passenger, "Let Her Go" #bipolarsong https:// youtu.be/RBumgq5yVrA
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-22 13:59:35	I don't want to be any more of a fool than I have already been.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-22 13:39:20	The thought of dying doesn't scare me anymore, I am ready.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-21 08:51:39	I'm just a bad person. I would rather not be around my kids
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-21 08:48:12	Being proactive. Drinking before I get upset.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-21 05:13:31	@36Shades_Of_Me I get this kind of shit from my wife too. It's like they don't realize whose side they are on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 08:27:58	@36Shades_Of_Me me too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 07:24:20	@36Shades_Of_Me that is today you do
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 07:24:02	@36Shades_Of_Me you actually seem a lot better than usual lately
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 04:05:08	@36Shades_Of_Me why enjoy something you can't have
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 04:01:03	If I don't drift away, and actually come back to reality, I need to do something really stupid. Really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 03:56:53	Apparently I am dissociating. I'm nauseous also.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 03:46:57	Is it worse to never have something or to have a small taste knowing you can't have more?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 03:46:07	@36Shades_Of_Me or maybe we are thinking the same...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 03:45:42	@36Shades_Of_Me that isn't what I was thinking. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 03:09:57	@LePetiteNYC you look very nice. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 02:23:25	@ThinnerSpinster well bpd doesnt seem unlilely for me. I panic at the idea of loss.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 02:20:44	@ThinnerSpinster I don't feel bad. I just don't know what to make of it. Have you had this?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 02:19:21	@ThinnerSpinster this is so very weird. My body clearly is fine, but my head isnt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 02:11:43	I hope I'm drifting away
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 02:10:36	Seriously numb, can't even do simple math
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 02:02:27	@ThinnerSpinster head feels a little numb, but I think it's breaking
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 02:00:52	@ThinnerSpinster idk. Its really weird. And I'm in the gym. Gotta say I am lifting well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:53:04	@36Shades_Of_Me bwahahaha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:52:14	Everything just got very surreal. I am watching myself through my eyes but I don't feel quite connected.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:19:20	@ThinnerSpinster I want mute than just having an important job, I want to be successful and be promoted. But I always quit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:17:46	@ThinnerSpinster career something
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:17:16	There is no love in this house, and I have very very few others who care at all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:16:06	I need to stop thinking. Rational has left the state.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:15:14	I could send them all to Georgia and be alone, or I could quit my job and give up trying to be something.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:12:59	@36Shades_Of_Me almost got a smile out of me...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:12:34	I really don't want be in the gym. It's hard enough to muster the energy to just be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:08:02	Can't hide in my room forever (unfortunately)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:07:41	@oldandskinny just something I guess.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:02:19	@oldandskinny just a moment
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 01:02:12	@weswroten nothing happened, just felt that way
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 00:47:24	I think it's time to quit. I'm not sure what that means, but it feels right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-20 00:46:13	For a moment yesterday, all the world was right. But for now, it just fades away to dark.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-19 23:56:53	@36Shades_Of_Me I knew women were evil... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-19 22:13:40	@36Shades_Of_Me good luck. Stay strong!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-19 08:41:44	I'm feeling lonely
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-19 08:39:47	Feeling good never ever lasts long.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-18 22:04:39	@Anonynay all things considered, still my condolences
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-18 09:38:42	A few things went right, so a few more have to go wrong.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-18 02:20:28	@runningrewired stigma is a fact, and should exist, and I am not interested in someone's PR.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-18 02:19:44	@runningrewired I can only generalize in 140 chars, but those are indicators of people with an agenda I dont agree with.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-17 11:31:20	The klonopin sucked all the joy out of my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-17 11:23:45	@Numbaholic been there done that
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-17 11:19:46	@ThinnerSpinster nope
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-17 05:19:04	@LePetiteNYC I don't have any money, so you should go out with ME! ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-16 08:35:11	@36Shades_Of_Me we love you too. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-14 10:42:20	@burrohazard and fry on the bacon grease, then serve with the bacon crumbled on top. Be sure to season the cornmeal, maybe with cayenne
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-14 10:41:34	@burrohazard you are so much more gourmet than I. I was thinking southern. Fry up the bacon till crisp, add some cormeal crusted tofu....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-14 10:20:36	@burrohazard I love fried tofu and what better than bacon grease to fry something in. I need to figure out a recipe now...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-14 10:17:08	@burrohazard that actually sounds yummy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-14 08:57:25	@burrohazard haha. Me too. Lmfao
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-14 08:45:13	@burrohazard I don't follow back if the word stigma or author is in their profile.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-14 08:43:06	Are you judgmental of judgmental people?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 10:37:23	@36Shades_Of_Me ahhh that would be nice. Well I am gonna try to sleep. I'll fall I'm sure but from there, who knows...gnite :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 10:31:36	@36Shades_Of_Me yuck. Between that and the nightmares every night, I am a wreck. Took benadryl tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 10:29:53	@36Shades_Of_Me spooky. Weird psychic connection... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 10:29:25	@36Shades_Of_Me that is exactly what is happening to me for the last month
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 10:26:36	@36Shades_Of_Me I should sleep on the couch. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 10:25:28	@LivinwithBATman so if both parents are ill and cannot control themselves, should the kids be put into foster care?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 10:23:47	Do you get mini panic attacks when you go to bed?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 06:08:49	Even I can't stand listening to me whine and complain but I can't stop either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 06:08:10	I am so upset that I am physically sick. It's been a dozen years since I've been like this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 06:05:31	I don't want to die right now. I just want things out of life that I can't have. This seems worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 06:02:16	I'm so stupid about things sometimes
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 02:39:05	@36Shades_Of_Me thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 02:24:22	@36Shades_Of_Me and making normal stuff a problem in my mind. Just kinda tired of things not going my way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 02:23:22	@36Shades_Of_Me I am really talented at making problems that didn't exist come to life full grown.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 02:08:03	@36Shades_Of_Me I am probably going to make it worse by dwelling on stuff that shouldn't matter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-13 02:03:42	Sigh...I thought the day was going well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 21:10:21	@TheRealSupermum when your partner is happy. If you are worried that it will hurt the relationship, then your relationship isn't very strong
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 21:09:36	@TheRealSupermum most couples can't handle swinging. They just don't trust each other enough. After twenty years, you should be happy...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 11:58:53	I'm kinda in the process of "breaking up" with the woman that got me to stop feeling so lousy about myself. Thus isn't going well at all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 11:56:27	I don't usually get triggered, but don't watch birdman.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 11:28:41	@36Shades_Of_Me think about 1 during 2 to make love last...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 06:39:53	@bipolar_ptsd dems are richer than reps. The rich people I know are all liberals. So I wouldn't stereotype like that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 05:48:41	@36Shades_Of_Me that sounds about the level of effort that planet fitness requires. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 04:45:51	@36Shades_Of_Me yup
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 04:39:10	@36Shades_Of_Me I'm just happy if my boys have clean clothes that aren't ripped, torn, or eaten.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 03:51:14	@36Shades_Of_Me today? No wonder you are stressed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 03:27:05	So very very cranky
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 01:51:52	@36Shades_Of_Me since you are the mom of the house, is this a lover's spat??? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 00:45:46	I'm pushing too hard to distract myself. Need to just stay home and rest, even if it means being miserable and depressed all day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 00:27:33	@1toZen hahaha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 00:22:02	@1toZen the fave is for the pizza.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 00:21:14	@ThinnerSpinster lol. A burrito weighs at least two pounds. At least half didn't stick! Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 00:19:44	@bipolar_ptsd not all of us feel that way, just the Christians.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 00:18:49	@1toZen want
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 00:18:35	@1toZen I think I'm the customer guy, I wasn't an intelligent argument. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-12 00:17:59	@1toZen yes, yes you did. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-11 22:47:53	@1toZen yes I do! And you have to do more than contradict me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-11 22:46:22	@1toZen I love that skit
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-11 22:33:44	@_disenchanted_x none, I have very little tolerance for side effects. Still it's a struggle at times, especially lately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-11 22:32:22	Seems Im in a bad mood and trying to start fights. Funny thing is I feel ok, almost cheerful. Guess I'm only happy when Im making others mad
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-11 11:48:38	@36Shades_Of_Me :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 12:13:35	Still sitting here miserable and unable to sleep or die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 12:02:26	I don't get joy out of anything, just varying degrees of distraction.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 12:01:18	I'm so angry. She uses me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 12:00:10	Not even closer to tired. Fuck
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 11:15:49	Depressed AND insomniac. Who did I kill in my last life to deserve this?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 11:13:18	@36Shades_Of_Me love me some ankle...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 10:13:38	@36Shades_Of_Me lol. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 10:08:11	@36Shades_Of_Me didn't see it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 10:06:00	@36Shades_Of_Me what's that?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 10:04:12	I feel so impotent.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 10:04:01	@36Shades_Of_Me that is a saying, it doesn't make it true. But thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 09:44:44	@36Shades_Of_Me not a little. Completely.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 09:32:25	I'm broken.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 05:08:53	@36Shades_Of_Me that is depressing. Turning forty isn't the end!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 05:06:52	@1toZen welcome back. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-10 05:05:16	Reminding myself a breakup is like withdrawal. It feels really awful but eventually goes away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 09:51:50	I have all these photos of me as a child. I am not smiling in any of them. Have I always been this sad???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 08:45:18	@bmazzsyd you don't have to be perfect, just responsible and not overdo it. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 08:38:45	@bmazzsyd lots of protein is much more filling than carbs. Good choice of diet. The states are full of carbs and sweets though. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 08:20:43	@bmazzsyd great food! That's why we are all so fat. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 08:12:13	@bmazzsyd I'd love to visit your country one day, preferably in summer I think though. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 08:08:39	I need a vacation. From everyone and everything. Too bad I have to take myself with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 00:40:17	@36Shades_Of_Me I've been like this for years
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 00:33:51	@36Shades_Of_Me yeah basically. I can't escape our distract myself
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 00:27:39	There really aren't rules, just rewards and consequences.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 00:26:39	@36Shades_Of_Me I feel caged
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 00:17:14	@36Shades_Of_Me at least I'd be flying
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-09 00:11:51	@36Shades_Of_Me yeah so does mine...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 23:55:54	@36Shades_Of_Me I probably do the same, but within limits. I really want to do something dramatic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 23:44:44	@36Shades_Of_Me except I don't have the freedom to act out... :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 23:43:18	I still feel like a rebellious teenager inside.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 23:41:01	If #depression has to set in again, the least it could do is let me sleep better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 23:37:19	I do what I am supposed to do, not because it helps--it doesn't--but because if I don't, things just get worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 21:37:56	You know it's going to be a bad day when you wake up and realize you are still alive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 12:40:48	My heat breaks over and over.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 12:22:42	I got involved with the crush because the wife made me feel worthless. Now she is doing the same. I guess I am worthless.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 12:13:50	Something has to change soon. I won't live like this. I don't want to hurt anyone, but the only other choice is hurting myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 04:56:04	@36Shades_Of_Me too little for what? I the average woman is like 5'4".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 04:45:42	@36Shades_Of_Me at the risk of sounding patronizing, it's kinda cute when you babble. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 04:45:10	@36Shades_Of_Me I know. I read some of it earlier. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-08 03:58:39	@36Shades_Of_Me yes we do. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-07 08:22:43	@oldandskinny thanks. Same to you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-02 08:38:01	Tired of trying to do things right and being disappointed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-01 09:26:40	@FatterSpinster @el_guerito_loco still can't see why he'd just block the 3 of us like that. I seem blocked also. Have to wait and see
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-01 09:22:37	@FatterSpinster @el_guerito_loco I can see his profile by searching for him. Maybe his account got locked.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-01 09:20:23	@FatterSpinster @el_guerito_loco he wouldn't have blocked all of us. Maybe me cause of my rant the other day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-04-01 09:08:33	@FatterSpinster @el_guerito_loco I see the account but the tweets are blocked.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-31 10:03:14	@36Shades_Of_Me for now. Wife and kids are all away. I am truly alone, and it is strangely relaxing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-31 09:54:32	@36Shades_Of_Me physical illness often makes the mental stuff go away, at least for me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-31 09:47:07	@36Shades_Of_Me feel better. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-31 08:16:32	@FatterSpinster I am sorry...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-30 05:25:12	@FatterSpinster be treated with respect and have rights
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-30 05:24:55	@FatterSpinster competing interests, not just the ones one side agrees with. I don't agree with xtians, but they are entitled to ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-30 05:23:45	@FatterSpinster us bipolars have lots of opinions but dont in genera see the big picture. Policy has to http:// take.care of so many...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-30 05:22:25	@FatterSpinster and they are assholes too when they do that
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-30 05:19:29	@FatterSpinster I can't stand people insulting each other over politics. Esp from the left. Getting so mad over intolerance. Dam hypocrites
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-30 05:13:38	@BipolarSanity or xtians. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-30 05:13:05	Yes, if you dislike conservatives our Christians because of their beliefs and viewpoints, YOU are intolerant.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-30 05:12:04	I am so sick of ideological intolerance. I don't agree with liberals, but I don't think they are stupid.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-30 05:07:07	In other words, I'm probably a lot smarter than you, and I am most definitely not misled, and I vote right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-30 05:05:06	I have 3 advanced degrees, incl a Ph.D in math. I tend to vote conservative. Please unfollow if you think only stupid ppl vote conservative.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 08:03:36	@bmazzsyd you don't know that
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 08:03:22	@oldandskinny no
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 07:56:50	Yup. No one wants me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 07:54:11	The crush got rid of me. Let's see of I can get the wife to do the same.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 07:52:40	@oldandskinny I am no good for them like this. They are falling apart too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 07:25:31	i may not drink tonight. I just end up feeling more sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 07:23:26	nothing in the interim was worth having to suffer the last three years. Please don't tell me to hold on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 07:22:49	3 yrs ago, i really wanted to die. I held on hoping things would improve. Now I feel just as bad again, and ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 06:35:03	And the dagger is being tossed aside by the person who hurts you because really you hurt them
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 06:05:01	Those I need hurt me the most. I must be so awful that it would be mercy on the world if I were dead.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 06:03:32	If I had a gun I'd use it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 06:01:41	@BipolarSanity treated like shit
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 06:01:00	Please shoot me like the dog I am
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 06:00:45	I get treated like shot and I beg for forgiveness
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 05:57:04	I hate myself. I can't leave well enough alone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 05:30:16	I don't have the strength
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 04:17:14	I am so sick of being treated this way. It never ends and it doesn't get better. Where is my euthanasia?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 04:16:13	I hate women, and I hate myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-26 04:08:11	I really can't stand it. I don't understand. But I am going to explode from the inside.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:49:27	@FatterSpinster sounds like everyone I know too. I'm sorry
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:41:49	@36Shades_Of_Me I wish she would just get it over with
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:40:31	@36Shades_Of_Me she isn't even replying to what I wrote. God I hate her
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:38:15	@36Shades_Of_Me Fuck science
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:35:53	@36Shades_Of_Me I'll cry myself to sleep tonight
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:35:31	@36Shades_Of_Me you won't. I just told the crush that we can't be friends if she can't apologize, which she won't
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:33:34	@36Shades_Of_Me I can't stand it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:31:51	@36Shades_Of_Me that's awful
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:31:26	@36Shades_Of_Me I am afraid Wife was right. That no one will put up with me. The crush is proving it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:30:18	@36Shades_Of_Me I would rather die
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:28:17	I want to move back south. My job is boring, and my whole family is miserable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:26:35	@36Shades_Of_Me I've been telling myself that for years and years and years. At some point you realize it won't get better
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:24:21	@36Shades_Of_Me I'm trying
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:16:11	@36Shades_Of_Me :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:15:48	@36Shades_Of_Me I won't miss me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:15:11	@36Shades_Of_Me thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:13:17	@36Shades_Of_Me I wish I could but I can't. I've tried
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:11:33	@36Shades_Of_Me my prayer
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:10:36	@36Shades_Of_Me no I can't. Or the day after. If I could, I'd be single, but now I have two who live off my suffering
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:09:24	@36Shades_Of_Me if I should wake before I die, pray the lord to once more try
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:07:50	@36Shades_Of_Me I can't do this
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:06:19	I am so sick right now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:05:48	Maybe next week while everyone is gone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:05:24	Now I lay me down to sleep and pray the lord my soul to take...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 10:03:48	New she is mocking me. And yet I am still talking to her
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:59:07	@36Shades_Of_Me priceless. Just don't spit it out from laughing...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:56:29	@36Shades_Of_Me bingo!!!!!!! ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:53:00	@36Shades_Of_Me I am working on the same. I am bipolar, so I tend to think sex first. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:47:06	Why can't I end this....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:40:37	@36Shades_Of_Me I'm no gentleman
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:37:02	@36Shades_Of_Me if that is s compliment, it doesn't help
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:34:55	Wife is right. I can't do better. Or even find anyone else. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:33:14	@36Shades_Of_Me that it's what I mean by win
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:32:54	I may need to take a mental health day tomorrow. I can't face her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:28:56	@36Shades_Of_Me I don't even want to try
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:28:50	@36Shades_Of_Me this is a nightmare. She made me feel better when my wife didn't want me, but she is worse. I can't win with women.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:20:58	@36Shades_Of_Me we haven't done anything other than kissed really
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:20:15	@36Shades_Of_Me worse, lonely but not really interested in me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:16:47	@36Shades_Of_Me not at all. And I haven't been able to get rid of her
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:15:11	@36Shades_Of_Me more damage
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:15:00	@36Shades_Of_Me she has done mute damage than any benefit
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:14:32	@36Shades_Of_Me she is so hurtful and then blamed me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:12:39	@36Shades_Of_Me awful
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 09:06:35	Well my wife is starting to look like a saint after this day with the crush-er
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 08:46:29	@36Shades_Of_Me that doesn't sound like balance, but I'll take your word for it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 08:36:47	@36Shades_Of_Me he can learn, but it may be challenging to teach him
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 08:36:09	Having a huge argument with the crush. I am not letting her off the hook. An apology or she can go to hell.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 08:35:14	@36Shades_Of_Me you make sense, but he isn't tiuned to the right channel
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 08:21:22	@36Shades_Of_Me that really sucks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 07:53:10	@36Shades_Of_Me hang in there. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 07:35:44	@nejireta_ki thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 07:24:03	@nejireta_ki that is what I want, but my anxieties get in the way
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 07:20:20	@nejireta_ki I panic almost immediately
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 07:19:04	@nejireta_ki step? I don't understand
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 07:18:36	@oldandskinny thanks. Wish I had time to do that. Gotta take care of the boys tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 05:33:18	So much for staying strong. Dammit
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 03:29:16	@FatterSpinster sure, but I actually have an immediate situation too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 03:00:35	@FatterSpinster how do I keep my strength up to not go back after I just ended something? It sounds like your saying I can't without a tdoc
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 02:58:15	@FatterSpinster ok, but what about in the meantime?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 02:53:37	@BipolarSanity actual question. I need help..
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-25 02:46:46	If you are #bpd , and thus have abandonment issues, how can you get out of a bad relationship???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 11:01:17	@oldandskinny okay. I will. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:59:54	Goodnight moon. Thanks for watching over me once again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:59:23	@oldandskinny thanks for chatting. I really needed friends tonight. I am kinda passing out though from the wine
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:58:43	@oldandskinny Im at the point where I figure it cant be good for my boys to watch us fight so much. Itll be good for him to see you happier.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:55:16	@oldandskinny lol. Great minds think alike... haha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:54:37	@oldandskinny he ought to be able to respect that if he loves you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:51:19	@BipolarLawyer speak for yourself...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:50:48	What is the point of always doing the best thing for the future if you are always unhappy in the present?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:49:24	@oldandskinny I hope they do for your sake
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:49:02	@oldandskinny it'd be a lot easier nut to need others. I am a very disciplined person, for all the good it does me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:44:46	@oldandskinny there always seems to be something... :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:43:23	@oldandskinny I envy that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:42:15	@oldandskinny I finally get the financial part. We were about to split, then she lost her job.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:41:38	@oldandskinny I know. I'm just really bad alone. I desperately need someone it seems at times, even if they make me feel bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:39:44	@36Shades_Of_Me I hope it is. Goodnight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:37:02	@36Shades_Of_Me thanks. I could use the hug. :) #virtualhug
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:36:26	@36Shades_Of_Me almost surely
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:36:15	@36Shades_Of_Me the rest will afloat surely put your child in therapy.;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:35:31	@36Shades_Of_Me the only thing a parent can always do right is to love and respect their child as a human being
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:34:26	@36Shades_Of_Me I heard it in your words. I do the same sometimes. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:32:16	@36Shades_Of_Me goodnight. Me too. Thanks for listening as well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:31:55	@36Shades_Of_Me but don't punish yourself for making mistakes
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:31:30	@36Shades_Of_Me if you decide at sine point you went too far, apologize. She will respect you for respecting her
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:30:58	@36Shades_Of_Me my parents made so many mistakes. But I can never forgive them that they always had to be right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:29:44	@36Shades_Of_Me it is far too complex a relationship to make sense of. Just let it go
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:27:56	@36Shades_Of_Me a parent is both a friend and a teacher and a boss and an opponent
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:27:11	@36Shades_Of_Me then stick by it and trust she will understand you love her
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:26:47	@36Shades_Of_Me don't blame yourself for her actions, and don't expect perfection from yourself. Make the best decision you can...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:22:21	Crush kinda accused me of drinking too much. But she doesn't even know... Fuck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:21:01	@36Shades_Of_Me I know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:20:37	@oldandskinny she is slightly better new she is in treatment, but I don't think so. I'm just so sad and would rather stay w the devil I know
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:19:12	I kinda feel like a lost little boy who needs his mama, except that she and every other woman has let me down.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:16:58	@36Shades_Of_Me crazy how we can rely on people we only know online...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:13:54	@36Shades_Of_Me I suspect your family might not agree...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:10:36	@36Shades_Of_Me I crave excitement, and most normal people end up boring me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:09:41	@36Shades_Of_Me lol. Troubled souls find me, but I am actively looking for then as well
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:07:26	@36Shades_Of_Me definitely the latter, probably the former also
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:04:39	@36Shades_Of_Me apparently I am still doing that, and I am older. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:03:55	I don't want a divorce. I don't need any more crazy women in my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 10:02:15	@36Shades_Of_Me haha. Not unless you liked much older guys...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 09:58:23	@36Shades_Of_Me it's like high school, only interested when the other isn't
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 09:46:33	I am so sick of being rejected by people who say they love me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-24 09:41:02	I hate women. The more interest I show or attention I give, the more they pull away. If Im cold, distant, or even mean, they can't stay away
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:57:30	@36Shades_Of_Me goodnight. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:54:24	@36Shades_Of_Me thanks for taking tonight. I was feeling a bit lonely. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:48:45	@36Shades_Of_Me I don't think I'll ever be unburdenef
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:47:10	@36Shades_Of_Mwe all have to deal with unpleasant people
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:44:57	@36Shades_Of_Me I know how many people have stopped talking to me...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:43:02	@36Shades_Of_Me I'm sorry, for both of you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:41:55	@36Shades_Of_Me ur sweet. Not sure ur right, but sweet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:40:24	@36Shades_Of_Me Is your son his too?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:39:30	@36Shades_Of_Me and she is seeing what she is losing
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:35:48	@36Shades_Of_Me well I guess she can always stop talking to him when she graduates
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:35:06	@36Shades_Of_Me getting along
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:34:58	@36Shades_Of_Me I have started having my own life. Going out a lot. We are getting asking a lot better this way
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:33:24	@36Shades_Of_Me we aren't doing anything yet. We can't afford to split
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:32:06	@36Shades_Of_Me does she stick up for herself?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:31:24	@36Shades_Of_Me in what way?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:30:49	@36Shades_Of_Me damn. To his daughter? That is beyond arrogant...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:29:09	@36Shades_Of_Me oh of course. That isn't a good situation
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:26:22	@36Shades_Of_Me sounds like quite the household you've got they're
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:23:35	@36Shades_Of_Me he is cruel... Good luck with that
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:21:59	@36Shades_Of_Me pom poms and a pantsuit. It's a look...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:21:28	@36Shades_Of_Me my wife yells at them constantly and they don't listen to her at all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:20:03	@36Shades_Of_Me haha. I'll resist the what are your wearing comment... Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:16:47	@36Shades_Of_Me psychiatrists suck in general
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:16:21	@36Shades_Of_Me mine is rebellious. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:14:44	@36Shades_Of_Me omg. Way too much stuff. All those drugs will make you crazy on it's own.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:11:44	@36Shades_Of_Me haha. You certainly have more parental experience. My oldest is only 13.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:10:58	@36Shades_Of_Me don't blame you. I was on way too much. My dr over prescribed me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:10:15	@36Shades_Of_Me you are a baby. Haha. I thought we were the same age. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:09:32	@36Shades_Of_Me become hooked
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:09:22	@36Shades_Of_Me I'll before hooked on booze before I go back on those. I went cold turkey off benzos.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:07:52	@36Shades_Of_Me how many years ago was that, if you don't mind me asking
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:03:51	@36Shades_Of_Me you were okay before the divorce?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 10:01:03	Wine may take away the anxiety, but I don't think it's gonna cheer me up tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 09:58:01	I am such a fool sometimes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 09:55:47	Yum. Tastes better than water.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 09:53:39	@1toZen yeah, I don't think I'm gonna bother trying to resist
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 09:53:18	@36Shades_Of_Me I take it that is autobiographical
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 09:45:21	I'd just skip the alcohol and go to bed, but I'll just have an anxiety attack.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 07:04:12	Do I have to wait until the kids go to bed to start drinking...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 07:02:55	I am bipolar, wife is bipolar, at least one of our kids is too. I am the only one who cannot find any joy in life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 06:55:12	I'm too depressed to make dinner. I suspect this won't help me feel better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 06:15:29	@1toZen saw that one also, and once more after that. One of my all time fave bands. Incredibly talented.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 06:10:19	@1toZen they were my first concert ten years before that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-23 06:09:03	Feeling terribly empty
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 21:19:33	I see all those memes and quotes about what a man is supposed to be. I am all those things. But it's apparently not really what women want.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 11:06:04	@DailyBipolar she breathes funny when she is asleep. And I can't sleep if we are touching.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 11:03:44	@DailyBipolar I have never been in sync with my wife.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:47:13	Wife away. Crush with her bf. Even the cats are asleep. #alone #lonely
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:34:14	@Jennka1 thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:33:07	@Jennka1 very. I thought with this job I just took, we could finally start to get ahead. Start going out and enjoying life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:32:25	@Jennka1 I've learned to work in areas that aren't stressful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:31:41	@Jennka1 she seems to hold a job about 8 months on average
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:30:11	@Jennka1 yeah you can. She can't hold a job so apparently it's possible.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:28:13	@Jennka1 he has a good reason. Mine wad given a bp diagnosis and seems headed towards disability.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:26:10	@Jennka1 that sucks. My wife is out off work so we are very very tight now
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:25:04	@Jennka1 here too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:24:01	@Jennka1 gonna need to buy more cabernet, so I dont start in on the vodka
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:22:43	@Jennka1 she is actually closer to you. In CT
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:22:06	@Jennka1 I'll probably drink too much while she is gone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:21:49	@Jennka1 I wanted her gone for a bit, so it's good. I'm just not always good alone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:20:24	@BipolarTweets I do it too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:08:12	@DailyBipolar all the time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:07:23	@LePetiteNYC oops, meant take more...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:07:08	@LePetiteNYC great pic. Take me. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-22 10:05:32	Wife is gone, remaining children are in bed. Sitting here all alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-21 22:37:28	Wife just left for two weeks. Guess I'll find out soon if I really want to be single.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-18 04:18:54	@36Shades_Of_Me thank you. Bad stiff keeps happening every time I get my head on straight. I'm okay for now I think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-16 10:11:52	@1toZen don't forget walking on the moon...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-16 10:05:04	Bedtime. And once again, I am having an anxiety attack once my head hits the pillow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-15 09:41:02	@weswroten nothing tonight. Usually red wine
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-15 08:13:18	@36Shades_Of_Me I don't know. Drinking is helping a little.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-15 08:08:24	@FatterSpinster I'm not sleeping much
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-15 08:08:13	@FatterSpinster I know, which is why I haven't. But the daily suffering is increasing. I have physically painful anxiety all week, and ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-15 08:02:58	None of my distractions work anymore. May end up turning to booze and pills. Don't knew what else to do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-15 07:29:22	I am not a coward for wanting to die. I am a coward for being afraid to carry it out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-15 07:28:27	That they need to keep working on a bad relationship with themselves. #suicideisliberty
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-15 07:27:44	We tell people that they shouldn't dishonor themselves by staying in a bad relationship, while we tell others...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-14 22:13:11	It's worse to be manic when things go wrong. I can't get away from myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-14 14:46:25	@36Shades_Of_Me just saw this. I'm so sorry. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-14 14:45:57	I am so fucked up in the head. Can't think rationally.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-12 11:19:07	@36Shades_Of_Me you've been changing your name a bit, so I was a little concerned
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-12 09:36:46	@36Shades_Of_Me and I'm sorry too that you are having such a hard time also.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-12 09:36:10	@36Shades_Of_Me that is the best thing anyone ever said. Thank you for knowing and understanding me. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-12 07:04:38	I dont get depressed. When I am not manic, I just notice how crappy my life is and genuinely feel bad about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-12 04:52:05	@36Shades_Of_Me thanks, not really. Just trying to ignore that I can't stop being miserable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-10 11:13:18	@BipolarSanity I feel much better
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-10 11:13:00	@FatterSpinster goodnight moon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-10 11:12:36	Wine IS the answer!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-10 09:25:08	@FatterSpinster thank you for car ing about me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-10 09:24:39	@FatterSpinster I am venting, and not talking about my Twitter friends. Y'all are the only ones that do listen.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-10 09:13:47	NOBODY pays any attention to what I say. I may nut be invisible anymore, but I am ignored. Fuck everyone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-10 07:44:32	I am not rational. I am about to burst into tears, and I never ever cry, even when I want to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-10 07:41:14	I am done
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-09 10:03:54	And the little smacks in the face keep coming tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-09 09:59:16	@36Shades_Of_Me haha. Want talking about me. Really. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-09 09:43:08	@36Shades_Of_Me women have the power now...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-09 07:12:15	Someone has to be the one to be more unlucky, but it sucks being that person. Really really really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-09 07:11:29	The worst is there is no one to be mad at. It's just how things work out. It's just that once again it works out against me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-09 07:10:32	No one is at fault. And it's not really bad. But it still ready upsetting to me. Each and every stupid little thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-09 07:09:35	Waiting for my son to finish cleaning so I can be alone in the shower is slow torture. I need to process this day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-09 06:39:57	Nevermind. I got there anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-09 06:18:47	On the bright side, I am not suicidally depressed, which is a miracle after the day I have had. Let's see what other hammers fall...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-09 06:10:20	I breathe her kisses...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-09 02:27:12	Doing something for any other reason than you want to is not genuine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-08 00:10:46	@tweety123pie that was three years ago, but I don't think so. I have never quite been the same.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-08 00:02:30	@tweety123pie I didn't abuse them. One day I stopped taking them and couldn't stop shaking for two months.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-07 23:57:57	@tweety123pie everyone who takes them is addicted. It's like caffeine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-07 23:54:46	@tweety123pie benzos are awful drugs. I can't take them. Physical addiction.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-07 23:45:33	It's the weekend! Time to lie in bed hating my life and fantasize about suicide.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-06 05:23:28	And now my son is having a breakdown. That makes the out of five people in this house who aren't functioning.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-04 10:04:51	@Jennka1 haha. Don't keep more than one beer on the house at a time. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-04 10:03:45	@Jennka1 thank you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-04 10:03:20	@Jennka1 fear isn't a bad thing, it often brings out the best in us.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-04 10:02:46	@Jennka1 which is why you will. Because it's important to you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-04 10:01:24	@Jennka1 I understand completely, but you'll rise to the occasion. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-04 04:40:35	It is so upsetting to see attractive single women
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-04 04:25:47	The kill me now feeling just isn't going away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 09:47:24	Well, weekend about over and I'm not dead.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 06:53:44	Most of the time my desire to die is very rational. Not today. It just came on very very strongly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 06:42:45	I suppose no one would say how much xanax and alcohol is fatal, and how uncomfortable it is to go that way?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 06:37:24	@oldandskinny lol. I can think of mute exciting things...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 06:35:50	@BipolarSanity and the "heat" is blowing cold air
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 06:35:09	@oldandskinny what a pair we'd make... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 06:32:41	And dinner just fell on the floor
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 06:30:46	Weekend is nearly over and I spent most of it in bed depressed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 06:08:02	@1toZen don't know the ref
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 06:05:13	If you had what you dream of, would you be happy, or would you still feel the same and wonder what went wrong...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 06:02:34	How much longer...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 05:50:23	That overwhelming feeling is back...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 05:42:28	She thought I was in the bathroom. Didn't notice I was lying on bed depressed for four hours.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 03:44:10	Everyone is out enjoying their life. I'm under the covers hiding from mine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 03:11:28	@oldandskinny esp in the book when her last thoughts are described...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 02:50:31	The overweening desire to die had passed for the moment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 02:35:34	That moment of regret between the time Anna threw herself in front of the train and when it hit her. That is why I am afraid to kill myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 02:30:42	So I'm entitled to happiness but not entitled to take my own life if I can't find happiness. Do I have that right?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 02:10:04	Omg my mood is speaking out of control.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 02:05:34	@FatterSpinster I wouldn't do it, but I understand why some people kill their families and themselves.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 01:59:16	My oldest son is do unhappy. What have I done. It was selfish to have children. He will suffer for years and years like me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 01:56:44	My misery is making me nauseous.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 01:03:44	We've been getting along this week, but I have to remember it won't last.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 00:37:19	People telling their friends how pretty or hot they look on Facebook...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-02 00:33:16	Oftentimes, trying to be helpful is not helpful. It's patronizing and condescending.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-01 22:08:49	Wife will prolly be cranky today. It's her sunday mood. #ihateweekendsnow
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-01 22:07:26	Only plan for next nine hours was to go to the gym, but got very little sleep and woke up very very sore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-01 22:06:04	Lying in bed, once again not having slept enough. Why bother getting up. I have nothing to do today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-01 10:26:33	@Anonynay I was there last week. Sorry you feel so awful. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-01 06:55:54	@oldandskinny all my addictions are on MWF, kids on the weekend too. maybe I should drink on Sat? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-01 06:47:37	Wed and Fri are my rush days. Doesn't give me much reason to look forward to the weekend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-01 06:02:27	#bipolar is a large part of who I am. many of my interests and activities follow as my coping with the disease.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-01 04:33:19	Benadryl isn't a sleeping pill, it's a make me useless for the day pill.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-01 03:15:16	@NealEngelking why is it wrung?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-03-01 00:46:52	@NealEngelking so what?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-27 09:52:58	@FatterSpinster I like it. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-27 04:24:16	When I was a kid I was taught to ignore/tolerate things I don't like. Now people are taught to change/protest. #notprogressive
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-27 04:21:05	@ybnormal622 thank you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-26 07:41:55	I wish I did know many of you better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-26 07:40:53	Amazing how safe I feel opening up to people I've never seen on person. Thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-26 07:14:12	I'm probably being paranoid
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-26 07:10:54	Supposed to go see the crush soon. Have a bad feeling.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-26 06:02:30	@LePetiteNYC thank you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-26 06:02:21	@LePetiteNYC I am not doing anything. But it is liberating to open my mind to thoughts that others see as taboo.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-26 05:58:20	@LePetiteNYC why?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-26 05:57:47	@LePetiteNYC no. Some mixed symptoms.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-26 05:56:41	I don't feel unloved. I am unhappy anyway and am tired of suffering. I am not irrationally suicidal. I see it as my choice as a free person.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-25 08:45:31	@FatterSpinster I really meant it when I said that I truly appreciate your concern.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-25 08:43:57	@FatterSpinster cancer patients get tired of being sick and getting better and sometimes choose not to recover.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-25 08:42:51	@FatterSpinster maybe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-25 08:42:39	@FatterSpinster I've only been falling apart the last two weeks. Was pretty rational and stable. Then I fell off the tracks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-25 08:41:49	@FatterSpinster WITH doc approval
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-25 08:41:23	@FatterSpinster been off for a year and a half
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-25 08:39:05	@FatterSpinster well then I'm lucky nut to have a doc. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-25 08:35:08	Been suicidal. Getting a little paranoid. So fellow bipolars, what awful symptom should I brace for next?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-25 07:43:43	Wonder how low I'll sink tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 11:27:43	@1toZen @LePetiteNYC well she did say Fuck me. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 11:25:17	Okay. Think I am tired now. Thanks for listening. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 11:24:52	@FatterSpinster that is really sweet. Thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 11:24:29	@LePetiteNYC @1toZen misery loves company.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 10:55:57	@1toZen it already is. Heard it on the way how from work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 10:53:21	@FatterSpinster I'm posting not acting. It wouldn't work now anyways, everyone is home.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 10:50:46	If you really cared, you wouldn't ask me to suffer any longer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 10:48:27	Pills vodka hot bath sharp knife. Might not even suffer much.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 09:56:20	When they tell you to hold on one more day...don't they know that you've done that for at least a thousand days...When can I let go?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 09:54:44	When you don't want to do the things you know will make you smile...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 09:53:21	When there is nothing you can do...When you know doing anything will maker it worse...When you do something nevertheless...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 09:51:33	When you work so hard to make things better...and they get worse....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 09:50:44	That sinking feeling...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 09:41:33	@FatterSpinster thank you. I'd be content to being more stable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 09:39:07	Sometimes when you feel really bad, your cat tells you she loves you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 09:37:48	@FatterSpinster just concerned that a lot of my Twitter friends seem upset. How you'll be okay. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 09:32:18	Twitter is trigger happy tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 05:23:20	@oldandskinny we are going to separate once she finds a job. In the meantime, she will visit family from time to time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 05:05:04	Crush doesn't understand why I am unhappy about separation when I had wanted it in the first place. #maybesheistooyoungforme
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-24 05:03:06	Which is better, frequent sex, or infrequent good sex?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 12:28:40	@FatterSpinster I keep saying take them out our out them away!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 11:14:59	@ybnormal622 I know better with the crush. Wife is gonna go away to her parents for a week. Can't wait.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 10:28:12	@ybnormal622 yes it does. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 10:00:10	I think I am more upset with the crush than the wife. #fml #kmn
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 07:40:45	Fought with the wife all weekend. Crush hasn't talked to me in three days. #fml #aloneforever
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 03:24:30	I don't want to deal with this. When I feel this bad about my own life, I can't stand to see other people happy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 02:44:56	@LePetiteNYC to bad it's not the other way around! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 02:43:24	@jenl54361 just share, be open, try not to be defensive, and don't take offense if someone doesn't respond to your reply.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 02:40:27	@jenl54361 as
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 02:40:15	@jenl54361 think of #twitterpsychward a group therapy...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 02:38:16	@jenl54361 just sending a comment here and there. It can take time. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 00:26:33	They say you need a support system to leave a bad relationship. I think it's true. I would leave if I had that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 00:24:52	Looking at dating site profiles make me sad. Everyone seems so much more awesome than the people in my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-23 00:08:52	Apparently I seem to still be falling apart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 09:57:15	@ybnormal622 I said that a few times to her. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 09:27:22	Fuck my life. No, wait. Fuck me. It's been awhile.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 09:19:11	@FatterSpinster food or sex and drugs? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 09:11:59	I need to remember that dating sucks, even if it seems better than my marriage.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 08:29:05	@oldandskinny we could get rid of each others? Oh wait, isn't that a movie or something? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 08:24:19	@1toZen don't you live in the Pacific northwest? At least on the east coast we get sunshine. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 07:51:33	Kids came home. Had to shut up mid fight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 04:27:44	The kids are all going out. That is the good news. I am left alone with the wife. That is the bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 03:17:16	No matter what you women think, guys just want to be loved also. Don't assume you know what we are thinking.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 02:44:04	On the bright side, she apologized after she yells at me today. I wonder how many apologies I'll get before this day is over.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 02:21:11	She just yells all the time
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-22 02:17:02	Could stop yesterday. Can't start today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-21 23:29:07	@LePetiteNYC I need a woman that thinks like that!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-21 23:11:23	I have to be snowed in with her today, and she yells at me before breakfast. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-21 11:52:05	@ybnormal622 yup. Sounds similar. :( sorry to hear
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-21 11:46:39	@ybnormal622 just dont even want it anymore sometimes
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-21 06:48:23	After spending years being mean to me, I can't stand it when she tries to be nice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-21 04:00:53	Sleep me...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-20 09:34:58	My wife is really good at one thing. Throwing my mood off a cliff.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-20 08:54:55	@oldandskinny I wasn't able to until we moved. I hope you find a way someone soon. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-20 08:47:03	@oldandskinny I'm sorry. You need an outlet. I've felt a lot better because I've found some.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-20 08:46:22	I really hope she was serious about moving back south (without me)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-20 08:38:26	@oldandskinny better. Thanks. I completely lost control of my emotions last week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-20 08:31:43	@oldandskinny just take some time out for yourself once a week. Go out. Make new friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-20 07:59:30	@oldandskinny just because you can't leave doesn't mean you can't have your own life...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 10:21:26	@Jennka1 is that an innuendo? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 10:16:22	@Jennka1 confusing. She is either half in love our just wants to be friends
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:49:31	I can't anyways tell the difference between tired and sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:41:15	@ybnormal622 thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:41:02	@ybnormal622 exactly
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:25:24	@BipolarSanity since I was young... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:25:02	@Jennka1 you won't get much argument here. :( I am trying really hard to find fun things to do if I gotta stick around.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:24:13	@ybnormal622 that is kinda why I was so upset last week. I hadn't been like that in awhile, and then it happened twice in a week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:23:32	@ybnormal622 I don't feel guilty, just angry...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:23:01	@Jennka1 sorry to hear that. Mine just snore and miss their mommy in the middle of the night. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:22:08	I am noticing that for the first time since I was going, I have more female friends. Must be coming out of my shell a little. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:21:01	@ybnormal622 whatever it takes. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:20:28	@Jennka1 oh that's what I wanted. A drink. It's been helping me sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:19:29	@ybnormal622 I lose my temper and wonder why everyone is gone...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:18:36	@Jennka1 getting my emotions back under control somewhat
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:17:49	@Jennka1 up and down. Every so slightly hopeful, at least sometimes
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:16:56	@FatterSpinster I like you anyways. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:12:30	@Jennka1 it's bedtime when the battery dies...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:03:06	@ybnormal622 haha. You sound like my wife
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 09:02:31	@ybnormal622 haha. Thanks. I'm to unstable for long term friendships. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 08:57:02	@ybnormal622 all bipolars live carbs. Really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 08:56:38	@ybnormal622 yes of course
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 08:51:30	@ybnormal622 my advice still holds though. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 08:51:11	@ybnormal622 haha. That's okay. I can't afford protein right now, so I am eating runs of carbs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 08:50:31	@ybnormal622 I'm borderline willing to live. I need to meet new and interesting people, but I feel sad they probably won't want to meet me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-19 08:47:37	People are so judgmental of others, and it is so tiring.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-18 01:43:41	@FatterSpinster I can change instantly for no reason. I don't even need a trigger.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-18 01:40:54	@FatterSpinster lol. Been suicidal and grandiose in the same day hundreds of times.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-17 21:50:24	Look at all that snow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-17 21:45:49	People without information can always do things better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-17 01:11:01	@ybnormal622 for now. We may separate. Mixed feelings.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-16 23:51:54	@ybnormal622 lol.Maybe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-16 23:45:17	@ybnormal622 well I used to make a little money at poker, so I am trying to again. Mute fun than other options.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-16 23:43:41	@ybnormal622 haha. My habits are controlled, I've given up the destructive ones. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-16 23:32:23	My old standbys of sex and gambling still give a rush, but not the same pleasure. I'm at a loss of what to do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-16 11:24:30	@ybnormal622 I keep meeting them without trying
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-16 04:41:07	@1toZen we will sell or rent the house. And then it will be a lot easier.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-16 04:40:34	@1toZen it'll be separate but together for awhile. We both need time apart to let go of anger. If we decide to make it more permanent...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-16 04:00:49	We are talking separation very seriously. She may move back south.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 23:20:06	Killing yourself with booze and pills looks so easy on television.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 22:54:24	@BipolarSanity she is also apparently
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 22:47:39	@weswroten I just asked her to stop yelling at me. She didn't really, although the volume lessened a little eventually
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 22:41:46	I don't want to stay married, don't want to be divorced,, and I really don't want whatever the middle part is. #fml #kmn
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 22:39:04	First things she said this morning was if there was anyway we could get past this. I wonder if I chickened out by avoiding saying no.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 22:23:47	Worst Valentine's ever. We weren't connecting so wife just started yelling at me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 09:27:49	Happy VD!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 08:38:38	@1toZen we used to have a woodpecker that "went off" at the sane time every morn. I understand completely.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 08:35:47	@1toZen "birds go off" haha :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 08:31:09	@1toZen eat plus used to make my heart start racing for some reason. Been meaning to try again but keep forgetting. Tks for the reminder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 08:23:01	@1toZen I wish it was just racing thoughts. It's the wife and kids that wake me up all night.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 08:07:15	@1toZen it's the only kind I ever get
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 08:03:15	@1toZen if you sleep off and on for 8 hours but wake up at least once an hour, how many hours of sleep is that really?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 07:52:00	I'd like to be anywhere but here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-15 06:36:26	I swear I hate my family. I haven't slept in months.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-14 12:06:40	Dis bipolar attract bipolar? Serious question.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-14 12:04:52	I need a vacation. And one alone. And cheap.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-14 09:25:12	That said, I understand what happened and realize why. I'm still not in a good place but I am coping better. Day by day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-14 09:22:37	For those who saw my compete meltdown the other day, I am a bit better. The rest the week went much better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-14 09:19:46	@LePetiteNYC baby steps. You sound a little better. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-13 05:47:55	@LePetiteNYC thanks. I've been very moody lately artery being stable for a long time. Are you doing better since you came home again?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-13 04:43:35	@LePetiteNYC better than the other day
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-11 10:52:55	I would say I'm not sad, but the truth is probably that I'm so used to being sad, I don't realize it's sadness.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-11 10:51:20	I'm still the nail sometimes, and I have yet to be the hammer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-11 10:26:49	I'm just not willing to accept another setback. Enough is enough is enough is enough. I am allowed to quit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-11 10:24:31	@ybnormal622 yeah. Thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-11 10:21:54	@ybnormal622 thanks. You kinda hit it on the nose before. I really need some time away and alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-11 10:16:58	@ybnormal622 yeah. But it isn't going to happen.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-11 10:10:57	Hope has died. I'm done.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-11 10:09:23	@ybnormal622 life is fine. I'm just tired of it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-11 10:08:54	You can get through this. It'll be better on the other side. Yeah except it isn't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-11 09:35:38	Usually my excuse for not killing myself is fear of suffering. Don't have that right now. #kmn
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-11 09:34:23	Some days it's good I don't own a gun. On the other hand, not sure why it's good...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-09 11:20:35	On the outside I like calm and sleepy. On the inside, there are explosions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-09 11:18:55	I started this account to be brutally honest about what I feel, but there are still tweets I delete before posting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-09 10:40:06	@Anonynay I crack myself up sometimes, had to share that one. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-09 10:34:47	@Anonynay guess the D had gone out of DH. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-09 10:25:25	That's just it. I found things that I wanted to be alive to experience. It had been years upon years. Makes the pain worthwhile.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-09 10:23:21	Still rather have super highs and lows than just a long crappy life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-09 10:21:46	I fell in love with a girl even crazier than me. Why should I be surprised she broke my heart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-09 10:20:34	I'm not afraid of death anymore, just the pain of dying. Scared alive I guess.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-09 10:13:16	@Anonynay yuck
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-08 13:28:28	@Anonynay total or in a row?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-08 10:58:31	No matter how I try to be the hammer, I always end up the nail.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-08 00:20:24	@oldandskinny I'm sorry. Being the responsible one doesn't pay off
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-08 00:15:27	@oldandskinny I was a lot happier when I was one of therm
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-08 00:03:54	I can't believe I feel this bad this quick
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 23:54:12	I've been doing all the right things, but I don't even get an occasional pleasure. Everything is bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 23:53:38	I have nothing to distract me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 23:51:39	Have that awful physical feeling. Instead of it being about something is just about being alive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 22:51:14	I haven't really wanted my life for a long time, but I haven't felt this repelled by it either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 22:48:39	Actions speak louder than words. I am doing whatever I can to ruin things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 22:22:48	You only get one death, what do you want yours to be like...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 22:14:02	Don't ever tell me things get better
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 22:13:42	Terrible awful no good week
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 05:46:35	@ybnormal622 there you go. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 05:17:17	@ybnormal622 certain people like that feature, but it's never appropriate at work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 05:16:30	@ybnormal622 holy shit. That IS sexual harassment. Completely illegal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-07 04:55:21	@ybnormal622 maybe it was a good thing? Hate to tell you that spot work doesn't work. But compound lower body exercises will work best
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-06 19:09:55	@bipolarxplorer no I am saying that science isn't fact, contrary to popular belief. It is merely out best understanding of reality.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-06 09:35:01	@bipolarxplorer science is not absolute. Read up on the scientific method.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-06 08:29:18	@ybnormal622 no worries. Job is good, marriage still is not. Mood is rapid, but I'm keeping it together.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-05 05:58:16	@ybnormal622 where do I send my bill? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-05 05:52:31	@ybnormal622 body needs fuel to build muscle
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-05 05:16:29	@ybnormal622 keep track of calories so you don't go overboard, but after a few days you will find you will get full easier.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-05 05:15:42	@ybnormal622 eat steak, bitter olive oil, eggs. Those are fine and filling. No bread out pasta. You will only want more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-05 05:14:47	@ybnormal622 not rabbit foods. Eat meat and vegetable. No bread. Carbs will make you hungry. Protein and good fats will fill you up
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-05 04:21:54	@ybnormal622 eat smarter. Cut back on carbs, especially processed and sugars. Eat a lot more protein. Fat is okay in moderation.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 05:20:57	@oldandskinny I am but the wife isn't. And we may actually separate if she ever did find work, in which case I'll be bleeding cash.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 05:18:46	@oldandskinny me too, and likely about to get much poorer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 05:17:42	@oldandskinny haha. I'm sure. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 05:14:04	@oldandskinny not to have a lot of sex, or gamble or drink?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 05:13:46	@oldandskinny then why do people always tell you not to take your own life?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 05:12:32	Maybe that should be my plan...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 05:11:46	I could live out the rest of my life watching Netflix
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 04:57:18	@oldandskinny they try to impose a code of morality
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 04:48:57	And then who would be left to do all the crappy jobs...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 04:48:02	If suicide stopped being immoral, a large percentage of the population would exercise their freedom.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 04:37:49	@g3reth you ate programmed then. Suicide is the last frontier of freedom.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 04:32:18	Tired of being dysfunctional. It's my life and I don't want it. I'm not being irrational or ill. I just don't care.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 04:28:38	Things are better, but I'm still not interested in continuing on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-02-02 02:47:39	Feeling sad again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-31 21:10:37	While you might mean well, it is pure arrogance to tell others what to think and believe. I am taking to you progressives.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-31 10:18:51	I actually think I could be happy, or at least willing to live, if I had the right person
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-31 10:18:25	Why is everything so difficult
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-31 10:02:41	I wish I had just one person I could talk to and not worry about what I said
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-31 10:01:20	I want to be alone and have someone to talk to at the sane time
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-31 10:00:52	Two women in my life and they both are crazier than me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-31 10:00:22	I feel terrible
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-31 10:00:06	Another mood cliff
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-26 06:29:56	Invited people over. Really wish I didn't now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-26 02:33:52	We're fighting again. Can't stand this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-25 10:44:46	@Lib_fallenangel well I hope you sleep really well!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-25 10:43:36	@Lib_fallenangel confirmation is always good! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-25 10:42:00	@Lib_fallenangel understandable. You sound fatigued by it all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-25 10:39:37	@Lib_fallenangel that is awful. Cold is not a trait that someone who treats mental illness should ever have.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-25 10:36:57	@Lib_fallenangel it's hard to get past depression when life gives you good reasons to be unhappy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-25 10:36:05	@Lib_fallenangel yw. I could relate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-25 10:35:34	@Lib_fallenangel I have seen pdocs since I was six. Most make fast judgments in the little time they spend with you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-25 10:34:23	@Lib_fallenangel bad treatment sucks. Imho most treatment is bad. Learn what you need to help yourself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-25 10:30:11	@Lib_fallenangel very honest. Dont worry about labels, they are merely meant to treat. The more you know yourself the better you will be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-24 09:41:13	I am such a fool...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-24 09:40:19	You gotta dance with the monster that brought you to the party...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-22 08:03:08	@1toZen @BipolarLawyer that was a very crazy crazy game. Their defense did a great job keeping them in the game.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-22 07:14:42	@el_guerito_loco wish you were right... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-22 07:11:44	@BipolarLawyer @1toZen better beat the cheatriots.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-22 07:10:50	@el_guerito_loco thanks, but that isn't really correct. Just meant I have more than a crush...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-22 05:55:38	It's officially more than a crush...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-21 08:17:31	@el_guerito_loco uhh oh. You must be having a very exciting time... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-21 08:14:53	@el_guerito_loco mine is a little more intense than me... Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-21 06:22:28	After years of wanting one, I finally have a bipolar buddy to get in trouble with. Got what I asked for...sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-21 06:19:40	@leah_michal because my rational and highly intelligent mind tried to comprehend humanity.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-21 06:17:43	@FatterSpinster your dog and my 4 year old... sigh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-18 09:25:46	@LePetiteNYC awesome!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-17 10:29:21	@LePetiteNYC good luck. It'll be really hard but it can be done and done right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-13 11:27:01	@1toZen I have those too!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-12 02:40:24	@leah_michal lol. Sarcasm.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-12 02:38:44	She decided that she knew best what medicines she should be on. Boy is she charming today...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-11 08:06:16	@1toZen me too. We are prolly getting rex from my other team. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-11 08:03:52	@1toZen yes it would. Since I usually root for the falcons, I am definitely rooting for your team tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-11 07:57:51	@1toZen or Hawks... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-11 04:48:26	She Skype me last night and I can't stop thinking about her today. Not sure what to do about her. It's not good when you like her more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-10 13:28:43	Crush Skyped me from her business trip. That was good. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-10 11:26:53	Things continue to Not go well
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-09 09:39:00	@FatterSpinster yeah. I am kinda confused, but I don't really care much what we are, she cheers me up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-09 09:37:07	@FatterSpinster crush. But you'd have to ask her, she acts like we are a couple, even though she has a pretty serious boyfriend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-09 09:34:10	Supposed to see the crush today, but then I got sick. She had been away for 3 weeks and just went away again for 1 more. Sigh...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-09 03:37:21	Her therapist labeled her bipolar 2, and she just loves labels. Now she thinks she knows more about this than I do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-07 08:52:25	@1toZen me too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-07 08:40:33	@1toZen I can't understand how she is so convinced that she wants this when she acts the opposite.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-07 08:38:36	19th wedding anniversary and she is anxious and irritable. Bodes well, doesn't it?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 22:40:44	I keep complaining about the wife. I really haven't forgiven her I guess. #ToughChoice
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 22:38:59	Friend of a friend posted a suicide note on FB last nite. She was upset at leaving people she loved. She isn't ready. She still has friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:55:06	@Jennka1 haha. I like the finishes! Thanks!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:50:57	@Jennka1 not tonight though. Wife promised to drink cheap beer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:50:39	@Jennka1 we used to split it with friends, but lately we've bought a few. We end up spending nearly as much it seems at a bar. ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:43:25	@Jennka1 no shit. Even when I have money.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:42:51	@Jennka1 a couple of bud lights is cheaper
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:42:15	@Jennka1 it's like 62 now for HD PPV
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:41:00	@Jennka1 yeah. Would buy it at home, but can't afford it right now, so we'll just buy a few cheap beers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:39:48	@Jennka1 we are going out in an hour to watch a big light heavy weight title fight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:38:39	@Jennka1 do you watch fights? MMA or boxing?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:38:05	@Jennka1 yes we are, and proud of it. When you are the best, proclaim it loud and proud! Hehe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:37:35	@Jennka1 I suppose that is a good excuse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:30:43	@Jennka1 I know. Thank you! #CurseOfTheBambino
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:30:03	@Jennka1 yeah. The Boston tea party. Didn't Yaz play there? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:27:33	@Jennka1 you of course have no choice but to suffer those bahstahn trends. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:26:28	@Jennka1 I am from there. But there is more history, more legends than anywhere else in baseball. More than the rest put together.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:23:45	@Jennka1 omg. That is even worse. #NYYforever
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:22:09	@Jennka1 but you are probably a Pats.fan, so I have no sympathy for you. #BradyIsTheDevil
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:21:29	@Jennka1 haha. Oh the irony. You found a man not into football.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 09:03:07	@Jennka1 how can anyone not appreciate a woman that likes football? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 04:16:48	It feels like I've completely "run out of gas".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 01:52:30	I never understood why life has to beat on me so much. Other people have successes and good fortune.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 01:48:05	Lousy new year. Hurt my back pretty bad. Job problems. Wife laid off. Definite manic killer. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 01:35:46	Too much chaos in my house. I just want to be alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 01:26:54	Definitely depressed again
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-04 01:13:24	@Lib_fallenangel been there for years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-03 07:06:29	@oldandskinny yeah. We've been getting along our this would've been the death knell. Still might be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2015-01-03 06:15:58	And my wife lost her job AGAIN. ugh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-31 09:15:30	Twitter is not a cheerful place tonight. My well wishes to all of you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 10:26:41	@Anonynay gnite. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 10:25:12	@Anonynay haha. Okay.sure.:-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 10:21:51	@Anonynay if you are like me, it's the first time you've been sick in years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 10:16:43	@Anonynay here is to a healthy and strong 2015! May we stay healthy enough to have the opportunity to work hard to achieve our goals.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 10:14:39	@Anonynay I was sick for a week. Got back in the gym for like 4 days when I got injured. Bad month! :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 10:13:29	@Jennka1 having it even one day is better than having it no days.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 10:09:01	@Jennka1 that is awesome!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 10:08:46	@Anonynay I hurt my back and can't workout for at least two weeks. I am going crazy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 08:40:38	@1toZen awesome. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 08:00:52	@1toZen just be thankful the falcon didn't make the playoffs, or they would've beaten the hawks. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 07:59:08	@LePetiteNYC no, we never will be, but we can be happier.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 07:51:32	@LePetiteNYC you'll be fine, even if it is New Jersey. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 07:48:36	@1toZen ah well, then I guess they are just gonna have to lose. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-30 07:47:54	@SageSilk You are in treatment, which makes you a much better catch than the millions of crazy girls out there who think they are just fine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-29 11:49:21	The next ten days are going to suck so much.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-29 11:48:39	She talks about her bad days like her good days are something special.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-29 11:45:28	I want out...now
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-29 07:38:29	@loveleadsway cool. It's your body to decorate and enjoy!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-29 06:55:22	I don't have the mental fortitude to make this work. I can't be there for her when she has setbacks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-29 06:07:46	@loveleadsway do you have a pic of the tat?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-26 10:10:10	@Jennka1 yuck. Lol. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-26 09:39:15	Bought my son a ring for xmas. Two hours later he lost it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-26 09:18:07	@LePetiteNYC hospital food isn't the easiest way to learn to eat more. Best of luck. Are you there now?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-26 09:13:50	@LePetiteNYC I went to a few inpatient in Westchester.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-26 09:09:37	@LePetiteNYC save some for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-26 09:09:22	@BlessedByHim71 its okay. Hope your holiday went okay.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-26 09:08:52	Merry Christmas from this non-xtian to you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-25 23:58:42	Whether you celebrate our not, whether religious or secular, today is xmas. Why would you want to ruin it for others?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-25 23:54:53	Twitter is a very angry place on xmas apparently.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-25 23:52:26	@neiltyson You are starting to sound angry and bitter. That disappoints me. An academic shouldn't feel the need to be so political.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-22 05:48:58	@1toZen lmao. priceless. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-22 05:48:09	I don't mind being told I shouldn't have an opinion because I am "privileged" as much as I mind the whole "white guilt" going on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-22 05:46:19	@1toZen lol. you are kinda doing it too, aren't you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-18 11:09:15	Right when things were going well, I get really sick for the first time in three years. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-13 10:57:42	@BipolarCursed didn't un follow you. Sorry you are so mad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-13 10:18:35	@BipolarCursed manic me seems to be fighting back!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-12 09:19:32	@BipolarCursed I am. Just had a fight again. Left. Going to dinner with the crush.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-12 08:42:47	@BipolarCursed no fail. I got it. Used to teach and get all sorts of comments... lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-12 08:05:18	@BipolarCursed yeah...okay...;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-12 07:37:09	@BipolarCursed used to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-12 07:34:14	@BipolarCursed lol. I'll take the handsome. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-12 07:27:55	@BipolarCursed yeah I know. It won't last. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-12 04:35:01	Life and death, mania and depression. More similar than different.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-12 04:17:37	@BipolarCursed that is awful. I'm sorry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 10:57:01	@BipolarCursed thanks. I am also just really tired this week. Not sleeping well at all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 10:54:41	@BipolarCursed yes
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 10:52:54	Goodnight cow jumping over the moon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 10:28:05	I hate when the mania skips away...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 10:25:03	@BipolarCursed pretty cool. It's that sex drive that always does it, doesn't it?.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 10:24:28	@teenwithbipolar agree that it didn't have to. For me it does anyways. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 10:07:51	@teenwithbipolar if you've been bipolar since birth, like me, it's a part of you and inseparable from you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 10:06:15	@BipolarCursed r u musical too?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 10:03:53	Sigh....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 10:03:43	Sick of wife. Not sure what crush feels/wants. Kinda back to hating being me. Yet things are better than they were, which isn't saying much
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 07:16:36	@BipolarCursed ok. Thanks.:-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-11 02:57:07	@BipolarCursed thanks, but how do you know I'm not fat and ugly?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-10 05:40:55	@BipolarCursed idk
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-10 05:28:47	@BipolarCursed very. And I was having a huge fight with the wife, and then she lost it. I wanted to hospitalize her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-10 05:26:48	@BipolarCursed they are changing by the hour today
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-10 05:25:26	@BipolarCursed was I cranky last night? Don't recall. My moods are up and down the last few days.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-10 05:23:04	@BipolarCursed more so in my opinion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-10 05:22:23	@BipolarCursed don't apologize. I am always in a playful mood.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-10 05:21:44	@BipolarCursed she wouldn't let me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-10 05:18:34	@BipolarCursed it was nice. Very intimate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-10 05:18:16	@BipolarCursed it's rated R, I was hoping. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-10 05:17:17	@BipolarCursed there was a little but not on the mouth, just on the head and neck, and only very lightly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-10 05:16:32	@BipolarCursed is there sex and nudity? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 11:11:00	@1toZen thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 11:10:51	I'm staying up to wallow in self pity...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 11:06:37	@1toZen don't have that. We can't afford to live separately. Too expensive around here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 10:54:43	@1toZen we can't afford to separate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 10:20:14	The weather is cold and rainy. My wife is more crazy than I am, and the marriage is falling apart. #fml #fml #fml #kmn please
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 10:06:47	Another night I just have to suck it up and realize nothing can make me stop feeling really awful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 10:05:08	@1toZen ???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 09:59:34	@ThinnerSpinster she might be. She is more concerned about me leaving than why I might.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 09:49:45	What do I have to do to make things better now???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 09:27:59	Hiding.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 09:01:15	@weswroten wife. She prob should go to a hospital but she won't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 08:58:39	@ThinnerSpinster sounds like me and my wife.wish I had even a slightly helpful suggestion. I empathize.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 08:57:44	And she is having a complete and total meltdown.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 08:18:54	How can she not remember that we fought all weekend?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 08:04:29	@BipolarCursed the cuddles were better than sex, but I wasn't as turned on as I thought I'd be.

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 07:53:11	@BipolarCursed I don't really feel much down there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 05:34:27	Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. What congress after fool my a hundred times?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 05:32:09	Don't want wife. Can't really have crush. So my body had decided to make me sexually numb.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 05:30:04	I hate coming home.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-09 04:59:40	I keep reminding myself that I am just gonna feel like shit and there ain't nothing I can do about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 10:46:09	@ThinnerSpinster haha. When I was younger I got lucky a lot. Hope I'm not out of it... :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 10:45:15	@ThinnerSpinster I hope I can remember to try. Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 10:44:36	@ThinnerSpinster I hope so. Things have been so good after I was down for so long. I am a little scared.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 10:43:53	@ThinnerSpinster I am starting to get to full of myself. Not controlling what I say our do. Just a matter of time b4 I make s big mistake.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 10:40:25	I have an awful feeling that the manic run is gonna hit the brick wall. Something bad is coming.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 10:35:57	@ThinnerSpinster please don't... :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 10:34:27	@ThinnerSpinster haha. My app keeps freezing on me...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 10:32:51	My twitter is going crazy...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 09:53:31	@tweety123pie is it going to be a display piece?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 09:47:05	Tried to type "whatever", phone gave me "wet bartender".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 09:44:58	@tweety123pie I am more of a traditional wood grain guy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 09:32:29	@BipolarBlessed she had been like this for years. She is very committed to the marriage, just not me as a person.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 09:25:21	@tweety123pie no. They are too addictive
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 09:24:43	@BipolarBlessed idk. Being herself. Being married to me. Having kids. Who the hell knows.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 09:24:07	@BipolarBlessed no
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 09:18:36	@tweety123pie even when I fall asleep, I sleep very badly. Mind doesn't turn off.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 09:11:29	@BipolarBlessed I would be happy if the wife wouldn't be so angry
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 09:11:08	@BipolarBlessed maybe but she is with the bf
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 09:10:51	@tweety123pie mostly pay. Not sleeping well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 08:01:08	I've been getting a lot of attention lately, but I could use a little now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-08 05:33:14	I have no friends on snapchat
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-07 11:56:04	@BipolarBlessed not after that fourth down gamble
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-07 11:27:02	@BipolarBlessed our defense is useless
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-07 08:57:18	@Jennka1 haha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-07 08:55:44	@Jennka1 it gets buggy if you try to send pics that are less than rated R
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-07 05:57:50	@BipolarBlessed haha no
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-07 05:52:15	@BipolarBlessed SEC and ACC championships, then UFC
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-07 02:40:16	@BipolarBlessed you are better than you think you are! :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-06 12:51:38	@BipolarBlessed do you need a #smileoftheday
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-04 11:19:44	@Anonynay night night. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-04 11:14:01	@Anonynay thanks. It'll be fine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-04 10:52:27	@Anonynay oh but she may just like me too...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-04 10:33:51	@Anonynay but she is much younger, had a boyfriend, and then there is my wife...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-04 10:33:23	@Anonynay it's a really big place where we work. She works in a different office in a whole different building.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-04 10:04:07	@Anonynay good and bad. Hypomanic. Crush on girl at work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-04 10:00:40	@Anonynay yoga news favorites this. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-04 07:54:13	@BipolarSanity sporting events
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-04 06:15:59	There are 2 spring events on at the same time on Saturday that I really must watch. Solution: buy $2500 TV.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-03 04:20:37	@BipolarBlessed that have me an even bigger smile than usual. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-02 10:44:52	@ShaunKing the witness who said his hands were up is known to have lied. The president is s black role model, but Mike Brown is a criminal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-02 10:43:23	@ShaunKing there is definitely issues with poverty and police brutality in this country, but is Mike Brown really the best poster buy?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-02 09:50:53	People with mental illness shouldn't be stigmatizing anyone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-02 09:50:11	@BipolarSanity and I'm taking to liberals who hate conservatives. You are a bunch of hypocrites.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-02 09:44:08	I need to stop following people who are intellectually intolerant. It's not acceptable to call people evil because of their political party.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-02 08:59:03	@BipolarBlessed you need to think about things different.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-02 08:34:14	@BipolarBlessed pardigm shift. You've always had it, so it's part of who you are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-02 08:29:21	@LePetiteNYC meow meoowwww. {{{Feel better in cat}}} :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-02 07:12:56	@spicuzzza from the sound of it, dating sounds like a sport to you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-02 07:08:20	@BipolarBlessed happy happy birthday!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-02 04:42:25	@BipolarBlessed thanks!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 10:52:53	@36Shades_Of_Me the world probably doesn't disappoint her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 10:51:52	I have sunk into the abyss. Maybe I just need sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 09:51:40	I always seem to run out of gas sorry of the finish line. #useless
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 09:45:04	@BipolarBlessed thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 09:42:21	@BipolarBlessed rather be at work anyway
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 09:42:03	@weswroten no specific reason. But out had been a rough weekend
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 09:32:53	Sadness sinking in. Barely care enough to finish this tweet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 09:00:44	@Jennka1 haha. Me too. Need to be careful what I say!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:56:48	@Jennka1 that sucks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:56:25	@Jennka1 girls are often better than boys at math when they aren't discouraged from it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:54:24	@Jennka1 common core is how we think about math. Before common core it was thought people were to stupid to learn it right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:53:43	@Jennka1 parents say I'm no good at math, so kids think it's okay to slack on it. Parents shrug it off cause they didn't like math either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:52:38	@Jennka1 if she wants help and you can't, tell her how proud you are that she already knows more than you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:50:29	@Jennka1 don't tell your daughter that. Kids model their parents when it comes to math.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:49:29	@Jennka1 math
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:45:39	@Jennka1 not anymore. Govt worker.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:13:12	@Jennka1 haha. I'm sure it will!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:12:49	@Jennka1 and she deserves it, but that is a long story
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:12:36	@Jennka1 some people it isn't worth trying with. I don't like him and he doesn't like me, so why bother. My mom is the only one who suffers
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:11:42	@Jennka1 ouch. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:10:44	@Jennka1 lol. That is how I usually feel. I don't talk to my step dad. Isn't worth it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:09:25	@Jennka1 wow. Yeah. I'm sorry. I have no siblings, just nasty step sisters
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 08:06:24	@Jennka1 I empathize. My family is usually crappy to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:58:38	@Jennka1 that is sad. I thought maybe your husband and daughter left you which would've been awful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:56:12	@Jennka1 with in laws and fought with wife. But my college teams all won and I ate at my old high school hangout, so there were some pluses
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:55:02	@Jennka1 your daughter too???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:53:12	@Jennka1 so how was your holiday? Was it tolerable? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:52:32	@Jennka1 and few friends. I need a bipolar buddy around here. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:49:47	@Jennka1 is not that much fun when you are stuck in the house.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:48:02	@Jennka1 been a long weekend. But okay I guess. Helps being on the manic side.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:47:31	@Jennka1 hahaha. Jets fan. Now they suck right now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:43:29	@Jennka1 go Pack! ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:32:00	@BipolarBlessed well it's only one pill and we haven't been having sex anyways
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:27:42	@BipolarBlessed 25 mg is the lowest dose. And she only took it once,.at her request.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:25:39	@BipolarBlessed not a single 25 mg pill.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 07:24:34	@BipolarBlessed yes. She prolly is bipolar. And I thought we were about to split and now ..
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 05:21:52	@ThinnerSpinster 25 mg, min starting dose only. and just once.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 05:16:39	Gave wife a lamotragine to see if it worked, and she became the calm and rational one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 04:50:07	@BipolarBlessed 20 min. come back. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 01:56:42	She asked what I was thinking...And I answered honestly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 01:34:11	@ThinnerSpinster thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 01:33:58	If I wasn't somewhat manic right now, my decision would be made. But I know better than to make decisions like this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 01:32:26	@ThinnerSpinster literally
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 01:32:19	@ThinnerSpinster there have been at least two dozen great reasons why I should give her another chance. I have almost killed myself waiting
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 01:30:51	It's it so much to ask that she try to make me happy? Just sometimes?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 01:29:09	I only have enough energy to take care of myself. I don't think I care enough anymore about her to make this work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 01:04:13	@BipolarBlessed yes. We are stubborn and highly functional.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 00:27:07	@ThinnerSpinster oh cool...never thought of that...=P
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 00:19:53	can anyone point me to links about marriages where BOTH spouses are bipolar?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 00:13:48	@ThinnerSpinster @oldandskinny lots of anger, irritability, racing thoughts, and a lot of depression. bipolar 2 is supposed to be 40-1 down.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 00:13:07	@ThinnerSpinster @oldandskinny well, there is the maybe...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-12-01 00:05:33	@ThinnerSpinster @oldandskinny umm...bipolar...maybe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-30 23:48:58	@ThinnerSpinster haha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-30 23:30:27	So my wife thinks she had adult ADD, and depression meds dont seem to work for her. I think we all know what could be wrong...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-30 23:29:17	@g3reth thank you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-30 23:16:02	I really feel sick about how my life has come to this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-30 23:00:29	I am also starting to realize that I have been waiting years for her to consent to divorce. And I don't really need her consent.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-30 22:57:25	I can't help but feel pathetic and a fraud around women.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-30 22:56:48	I am very bad at being a sex addict. I am too afraid of rejection to act on my addiction.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-30 12:13:24	@BipolarBlessed haha. Been in the car. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 22:04:39	#WhenIWasYourAge we couldn't rewind the television.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 20:59:29	It's rivalry weekend! Yay!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 10:33:14	@nejireta_ki but I can't have lesbian sex... ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 10:32:46	@nejireta_ki of course. All sex counts!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 10:31:38	@nejireta_ki making babies???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 10:20:44	And my crush is texting me right now. Even though she is with her boyfriend. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 10:10:01	@DailyBipolar no. I stayed inside and warm
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 08:56:45	@DailyBipolar did yesterday
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 08:39:13	Sorry to everyone who lives here, but CT is boring.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 07:52:58	@HenriettaMRoss ready to go hide again
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 07:51:01	How long do appearances have to last?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 07:44:08	And I should prob come out of hiding.make an appearance at least
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 07:37:40	@DailyBipolar I am finding process online about the same for what I am looking for anyways
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 07:36:12	@DailyBipolar yeah. Would never go out in that
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 07:35:16	@DailyBipolar lol.. Yes it had. Although I was looking in the stores last weekend
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 07:34:01	@DailyBipolar I've been window shopping. Haven't bought that 75 in tv yet...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 07:26:05	I am now bored out of my mind
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 07:00:43	@nejireta_ki babies are more fun than divorce. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 06:24:02	@weswroten @LePetiteNYC not around here he didn't! :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 06:19:47	@LePetiteNYC I wish. Staying with very religious in-laws.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 04:29:33	@bipolarblessed not really. It would cost a lot of money
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 04:27:16	@weswroten kind of irrelevant here
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 04:26:11	Want to ruin away. Screw up everything. I can't stand it. I just spend my energy distracting myself so I don't think about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 04:13:50	So we talked briefly the other day about divorce. Turns out we can't afford it. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 01:46:40	@bipolarblessed very
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 01:45:13	@bipolarblessed I know. She is unhappy, angry, but loves me and wants to make it work
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 01:38:33	@bipolarblessed no she doesn't at all
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 01:36:15	@bipolarblessed wife keeps reminding why I am being foolish giving her so many chances
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 01:35:46	@bipolarblessed it's butt likely to happen right now
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 01:25:57	@bipolarblessed I'd have to go elsewhere
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 01:18:47	@bipolarblessed oh and the in-laws don't believe in heat
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 01:17:36	Nearly time to hide.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 01:15:26	@bipolarblessed drive took twice add long. Baby had thrown up six times. And I hate my wife
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 01:05:38	And it's gonna get worse
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-29 01:05:26	Worst.thanksgiving.ever
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 22:59:38	Stop telling me to be thankful. I don't feel thankful for anything.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 20:56:48	@Soozmc123 awesome!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 12:12:48	Just one more unsatisfying day down. I hate how I go gently into my bad nights.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 11:00:17	@1toZen some people actually like to. Really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:55:55	@Jennka1 goodnight. Thanks for chatting. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:37:09	@Jennka1 ambien is apparently similar to benzos, which are awful and highly addictive and dangerous drugs
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:34:37	@Jennka1 I got addicted to benzos and ambien
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:32:42	@Jennka1 I try to limit my worrying to bedtime. Lol :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:32:00	@Jennka1 haha. Let me introduce you to my little friends... lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:29:28	@Jennka1 from having kids, I learned to pick my battles. I try to apply that to my problems, have no time to worry about everything
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:26:03	@Jennka1 I knew that sounds trite, but it's kinda true.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:25:31	@Jennka1 done and past. No use dwelling. And if some one judges you, at least you know who not to be friends with.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:15:17	@Jennka1 I'm sure it's a terrible memory, but I hope you aren't ashamed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:06:05	@Jennka1 yeah but they are a sign of living. Can't really live without battle wounds. And every scar had a story
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:03:11	@Jennka1 although scars are kinda cool
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:02:51	@Jennka1 yikes. Somehow I am not sure I want to. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 10:00:20	@Jennka1 lol. Literally it made you drill a wire through your cheek?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:56:08	@Jennka1 no I don't know it. Not generally the music I listen to. Mostly I like country and hard rock/metal
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:53:41	@Jennka1 I have my faves. Different songs for different moods and different shades of mood.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:51:46	@Jennka1 I know
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:51:37	@Jennka1 found it. Very slow song. I'll have to listen when I am alone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:48:53	@Jennka1 yeah. Kids were taking a bath and now water is pouring into my kitchen through one of the light sockets
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:47:49	@Jennka1 thought you said blue October?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:47:32	@Jennka1 supposed to go to CT tom, but my house just flooded
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:44:59	@Jennka1 deep south for a long time until this past summer when we moved to the mid Atlantic
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:44:27	@Soozmc123 I haven't work one in years, but I wanted a bowtie, just to be different
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:43:58	@Jennka1 okay. You are quite the salesperson
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:42:42	@Jennka1 in-laws are in CT.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:37:34	@Jennka1 never heard of the band. So you probably followed me and I followed back. cause of the bipolar.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:36:44	@Jennka1 I used to run out every xmas night and go to Mohegan Sun
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:33:38	I want to drink and party with my tweeps. Instead I am gonna spend TG with my xtian in-laws. #PartyProbz
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:32:26	@Jennka1 well it is good that she brought me down a notch anyways. Maybe not this far.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:27:58	@Jennka1 I used to be somewhat narcissistic, but she made me realize how truly worthless I am, so that is good. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:27:18	@Jennka1 that's good. Being in a bad marriage has changed me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:26:19	@Jennka1 I only really know im hypo manic when I go home and feel really embarrassed the next day
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:25:29	@Jennka1 yeah. We lose the best parts.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:24:58	@Jennka1 I may be, who knows. I hide it now
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:24:05	@Jennka1 as you age.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:23:57	@Jennka1 that is not unusual for 2, as I understand. The highs get fewer as you she
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:22:10	@Jennka1 I'm prolly 2, but I may have been 1 when I was young
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:21:41	@Jennka1 bipolar nos. Basically not a full diagnosis
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:19:32	@Jennka1 oops. Typo. Meant makes for. Although this was a good answer too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:18:43	@Jennka1 hehehe.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:18:15	@Jennka1 yeah. Don't drink cheap booze. Naked for a lousy party. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:17:17	@Jennka1 ahh yes. I keep flooding with going back to that. I really don't like dining alone and have very few friends. So I don't drink much
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:15:55	@Jennka1 wanna switch? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:14:07	@Jennka1 may I ask what it is now?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:13:02	@Jennka1 but it's very hard to be a parent. I have three
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:12:34	@Jennka1 gym is one of my addictions
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:11:25	@Jennka1 ditto.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:11:00	Oh twitter
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:08:26	@Jennka1 I can't even make dinner when I'm tired from the gym and really hungry. When I'm depressed, Its an accomplishment getting to work
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:06:45	Of course, if the right opportunity miraculously presented itself, I would grind through the pain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:06:03	@Jennka1 it's near impossible to when you are down it seems. Change takes energy that you don't have.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:05:02	Sad thing is I am so sore from all the gym sessions lately that I'm not sure I could actually have sex without being in pain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:03:44	@Jennka1 I was like that. Then we moved and everything changed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 09:01:39	Definitely hypersexual, I am reading into all your tweets tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 08:57:49	Crushing hard on this woman at work. She is with her bf, and I'm w my wife. Happy thanksgiving. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 06:17:33	@Soozmc123 same reason some women have very short hair. they like it that way and think it looks good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 04:32:03	@oldandskinny my father in law gets on my nerves but otherwise they ate fine
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 04:27:58	@oldandskinny no stress. Not at the in-laws yet.... :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 04:27:33	@weswroten I meant is not unusual for me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 04:27:07	@weswroten yeah that's it. Odd but that unusual for me. Kings the world in the morn, ready to die at night. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 04:17:21	moods going between high and low in the same day. Frustrating.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-27 02:22:52	Going to get some NY pizza this weekend!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 12:25:28	I feel so very alone. But I guess we all do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 12:24:42	@idcwhateverok it's not really about this case. It's a power struggle, and those without are fighting back there only way they know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 11:32:28	@MariesVoicexoxo in this country, they usually do when they are unhappy. It's a sad history. Whites do not usually. At least not in the USA.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 11:30:46	@MariesVoicexoxo the African American community isn't helping itself by acting violently.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 11:30:09	@MariesVoicexoxo as an attorney myself, I disagree with the lack of indictment, but it doesn't excuse the reaction.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 11:18:04	When white people think they've been treated unfairly, the don't loot and riot.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 10:34:16	@idcwhateverok making a point.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 10:31:41	Its a conspiracy!!! No justice. Screw the facts, kill the police!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 09:53:32	@weswroten cause a white guy sitting a black guy is always a racist pig and should be put to death anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:45:38	Someone is always mad at me around here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:42:48	I have a vision of how this all works out. Family should never have followed me north, they might need to go south again without me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:41:18	@LePetiteNYC prefect is boring
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:41:08	@LePetiteNYC really? Tell em to.fuck.off
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:36:13	I am going to work out after dinner. If that doesn't work, wine will help me sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:35:02	And I was just talking about how "up" I'd been the last few weeks. #bipolar #mania #anxiety #depression #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:33:01	@leeelor I will never be convinced that liberty includes the right to die. Including for mental illness.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:31:29	@LePetiteNYC sounds like you would eat if you could bring yourself to. My heart is with you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:30:39	Everyone should've let me die when I wanted to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:30:15	Been having a mild anxiety attack for the last three to four hours. Cannot face what my life is coming to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:28:33	@LePetiteNYC okay. What about treats? A little extra chocolate? Maybe decaf coffee to slow your metabolism?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:26:49	Wife I is so severely depressed she can't remember to turn on her headlights. And she is gonna get fired again. I can't do this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 08:26:02	@LePetiteNYC @oldandskinny just keep trying to be healthy, even if that means you gain more than you want to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-25 06:56:21	And the mood is flipping again. Feeling angry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 10:18:49	@1toZen I saw a pic.pretty incredible. Although the Tyree helmet catch was spectacular also
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 10:13:11	@1toZen I'll have to go track down the highlight
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 10:09:11	@1toZen better than nyg vs ne pat in.sb?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 05:20:50	@idcwhateverok could ruin a friendship. Need friends more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 05:00:29	@idcwhateverok I don't like hearing no, so I don't always ask. Makes it hard to get a yes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 04:50:52	@idcwhateverok maybe, but I can be. I'm really kinda shy with women.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 04:16:09	@idcwhateverok I may be dense, but I am really good at innuendos.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 03:57:26	@idcwhateverok lmao. Just dive right in.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 03:47:24	@idcwhateverok I tend to like women who are very direct, I can never tell.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 03:44:30	@idcwhateverok haha. I'm kinda dense. Lol. And yes really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 03:42:13	@idcwhateverok my wife keeps saying that women get "touched out" from their kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 03:40:34	@idcwhateverok is that you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 02:13:01	@LePetiteNYC come visit. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-24 02:12:27	@idcwhateverok never heard of that one
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-23 23:01:26	@idcwhateverok haha. Yes, that too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-23 12:50:10	@oldandskinny mid Atlantic
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-23 12:40:38	@oldandskinny we had a little snow last week
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-23 12:40:13	@beccaBPD heard there was actually snow in places
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-23 12:12:07	@beccaBPD that's what I keep telling myself
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-23 12:11:37	@1toZen just moved to the northeast. It's soooo expensive and cold here
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-23 11:49:30	I miss rhe south. It's cold where I now live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 22:06:34	@LePetiteNYC where is the concrete growing?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 22:06:09	@LePetiteNYC deer are so unnatural
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 09:51:03	All this sugar I keep eating can't be helping. #bipolar #mania
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 08:48:31	@idcwhateverok no you are right. I'll want more
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 08:33:28	@idcwhateverok yeah. But she is really sweet, and if I slept with her just a couple times... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 08:27:08	@idcwhateverok and she is in a relationship and I'm in a bad marriage, so it's complicated
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 08:26:40	@idcwhateverok oh I identify heavily with addictive personality
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 08:26:19	@idcwhateverok haha. Can't tell with her. I think she wants me, but I may be projecting my own feelings
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 08:16:44	@idcwhateverok I guess I am not worried about my safety. But women aren't really friendly I find.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 08:09:13	@idcwhateverok I would be happy to have a woman to drink and flirty with
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 08:07:29	@idcwhateverok it's prolly a lot easier for women.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 08:03:18	@idcwhateverok a date is something totally different
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 07:56:42	@idcwhateverok being initially shy isn't. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 07:42:37	I just need to distract myself tonight. Prolly just drink. Have nowhere to go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 07:21:31	I've never been able to talk to a girl who doesn't talk to me first. Then I'm a charmer
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 07:16:28	So I just assume I am reading it wrong. Aren't I not supposed to care when I am like this?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 07:15:47	Then again I think everyone is as sexual as I am.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 07:15:00	I kinda suck at being manic. I can't read a fuck me sign six inches away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-22 05:25:49	Okay, I'm still going up. If it goes much more, it won't be fun. In the meantime, I think the bar and the casino are my friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-21 08:40:44	@Lib_fallenangel I question the person who takes the time to write this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-21 07:51:04	Pretty sure she is chasing me, albeit slowly. But if I'm wrong...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-21 07:45:35	And I'm falling for this girl at work. Uh oh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-21 05:53:58	That natural high...makes you a little crazy sometimes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-17 11:28:21	Maybe I'm to tired to want to be happy. I feel like I'm over life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-17 11:27:46	She won't change. And only I can make myself happy. Still at a loss as to what I want.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-14 08:40:50	@MariesVoicexoxo yup. me too. hug something furry. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-12 06:11:47	@idcwhateverok yes
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-12 05:38:29	@idcwhateverok hehe. It was more disturbing than sexy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-12 04:40:00	You can't be something you're not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-12 03:44:49	Watching the second part off the nymphomaniac movie. Decent into hell.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-11 10:29:25	I am really good at identifying my moods. Not that it helps. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-11 10:28:25	Okay. I am now back to the I need a friend to misbehave with mood. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-10 07:34:03	A picture should refer to a photograph, not a meme. All y'all who post pics, please be clear what you are actually posting. #petpeeve
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-09 11:01:38	Found out s friend of mine is divorced. Kinda jealous.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-08 09:37:51	That surreal feeling when everything is very different than it should be...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 11:10:14	Want to do bad things to people. Pass along all the bad things done to me. Karma works that way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 11:08:17	Run away or die trying.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 10:44:16	I think I need some cheese to go with all my whine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 10:35:27	Got hurt in bjj last night. Couldn't go to the gym. Have no other release. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 10:34:32	I looked up from my phone and noticed I was still alive and still me. How sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 09:45:08	Sometimes I complain here about feeling invisible, yet sometimes when I'm around people I wish I was.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 09:44:03	I've felt so bad for so long that I don't even want to deal with a little emotional discomfort.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 09:42:56	I don't even bother to complain outside of twitter. Nobody cares or listens.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 09:40:01	I don't really care about being in pain. Don't mind my body getting beat up. Just wish I had mental toughness.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 09:39:14	Maybe I'll go buy the tools. I'll bet I get scared then.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 08:29:13	At this very moment I could actually do it. I am not scared. But don't worry, I don't have the tools.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 08:24:44	I've done alcoholic, gambleholic, and sexaholic. Maybe I should try workaholic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 08:20:54	I have the right to make myself happy. Or at least to make myself not unhappy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 08:20:11	I don't even want things to get better because it never lasts. I just want to disappear.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 08:17:56	@oldandskinny ditto. I'm so sorry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-06 07:51:05	Depressed and unproductive. Is this better than irritable and angry. Why do I get out of bed?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-05 12:12:27	@ybnormal622 I don't drink often. It prob won't work tom
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-05 12:07:24	This was a truly awful day. And there are too many days like this. Yet the glasses of wine and I don't care.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-05 07:25:38	I feel so bad that I feel sick. I just want to hide under the covers. I wish it would all go away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-05 07:14:50	I just feel awful today. Just awful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-04 10:21:15	@oldandskinny thanks

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-04 10:00:50	And now I'm horny.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-04 09:56:52	In one of those "it's my life to give up if I want to" moods.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-04 09:43:35	Doesn't matter what I say out do. #invisible
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-04 09:18:12	Alright, my mood is about to go of the cliff.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-04 08:40:40	Too much sugar and carbs can't be good for my mood.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-04 08:35:21	but it seems all the people i know have calmed down, and I don't know how to meet others like me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-04 08:34:51	and I get along best with other people who similarly need the rush.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-04 08:34:04	I need the rush, and it is probably the only part of me that I cannot control. #bipolar #hypersexuality
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-02 04:44:33	@oxymoronic82 I'm sorry. Don't know why I thought you said microwave.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-02 04:33:26	@oxymoronic82 shouldn't.mixrowave. doesnt heat evenly and can burn the little ones" mouth.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-01 09:34:24	@MariesVoicexoxo alcohol doesn't want you to be happy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-01 09:33:59	@MariesVoicexoxo it makes you forget your problems and feel good for a little while. Of course you're hooked. Just remember...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-01 09:10:42	@MariesVoicexoxo you'll get there. You are a good and very determined person. Just be patient.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-01 06:06:44	Halloween makes me horny too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-11-01 06:04:57	My cat is lusting after his sister.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-30 09:46:36	@oldandskinny in 20 years?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-27 07:15:41	I feel whiny. Which is very umanly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-27 06:35:01	Power is out and I'm getting sick for the first time in years. Yay.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 23:50:32	@tweety123pie if you think things are good, you won't try to improve them. Positivity discourages personal responsibility.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 23:19:26	The problem with positive thinking. http:// mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/opi nion/sunday/the-problem-with-positive-thinking.html?referrer= …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 09:09:30	@tweety123pie not a stupid question, the last time we went to therapy was 7 years ago. Therapist was pro women and still said I was right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 09:03:39	@tweety123pie well she says so. She is.on her twenty something-ish chance
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:59:15	@tweety123pie wish she did. She only wants in. She is so miserable but refuses to quit. Her anger is too much for me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:53:08	@tweety123pie we are 18 married 24 total. Last 8 have not been good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:48:36	@tweety123pie rationally things are improving, but emotionally I am sabotaging myself. And I don't know what to do about my marriage.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:47:08	@tweety123pie my emotions are getting the better of me. I am kinda over life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:46:21	@tweety123pie bad marriage. Virtually no friends of my own. 3 kids w their own probs. But new job is good, cept that im so new im.useless.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:40:38	@tweety123pie haha. Yes. Your rebellious child.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:39:53	@tweety123pie sounds like you are in a rough pace right now. Don't let them discount your opinion. You may be stronger than you realize.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:37:23	@tweety123pie AP? Sorry I dont know some of these abbreviations
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:32:24	@tweety123pie they don't know how to really help. Affirmations cause more damage than help.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:31:45	@tweety123pie HTT?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:31:18	@tweety123pie you might have perfectly rational reason to be the way you are. If your suffering isnt irrational, it isnt mental illness.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:30:05	The standard advice about mental illness is wrong If it worked, people would actually get better. Don't blame the patient anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:27:54	@tweety123pie telling them to go to a therapist is treating them like children.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:26:36	@tweety123pie believing isn't enough. They need concrete relief from suffering. Saying it'll be okay is patronizing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:25:48	@tweety123pie they mean well. But there area lot of people suffering very badly and telling them to have hope isn't productive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:16:09	@tweety123pie real. But here too. I don't talk with any of the "helpers" who like to follow the #twitterpsychward
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:13:56	@tweety123pie truth. I don't like how people patronize you like you can't control yourself or you're a moron.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:09:13	@tweety123pie no one knows I am bipolar. I am highly functional on the outside. Miserable and semi suicidal on the inside.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:05:25	@tweety123pie really really tired. Very emotional. Anti-social. Objectively it was a good week though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 08:01:53	@tweety123pie sometimes that is necessary
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 07:59:37	@tweety123pie ain't that true for all of us
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 07:59:19	@tweety123pie wow. Careful with the benzos. They are highly addictive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 07:55:41	@tweety123pie good question
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 07:51:32	Wine for dinner???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 07:20:44	@LePetiteNYC everything is better in bed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 07:19:38	@LePetiteNYC wrap up and then go out. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 05:19:00	If you tell us everything will be alright, and then it isn't, we'll be more depressed and anxious than we were before.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 05:18:07	Reality not positivity is what us mentally ill people need.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 04:04:16	@unsuicide sorry if you misunderstood.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 01:37:57	@unsuicide of course I cannot control you, but I do point out that individual experience should not be taken as representative.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 01:34:42	@unsuicide judgment doesn't hurt me at all, but it its overseeing how you attack now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 01:32:58	@unsuicide debate is healthy and good for developing solid rational points of view.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 01:31:50	@unsuicide I'm not censoring you at all. But I do judge. And I can't invalidate anyone who doesn't already doubt themselves.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 01:26:52	@unsuicide without acceptance of reality, hope is rarely found. And unfulfilled how is soul crushing. Be careful with your over positivity.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 01:23:17	@unsuicide a very large swath of people never find a "cocktail" that works. Do you advocate acceptance of a reduced quality of life?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 01:18:41	Why is it okay for people in physical pain to end their lives but not those in emotional pain?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 01:15:53	@unsuicide show me the stats. And be sure to read carefully.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 01:15:23	@unsuicide statistics do not say that it is common for people to have no negative side effects. In fact side effects are common for all meds
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 01:12:59	@unsuicide you hit the jackpot, and its clouding your judgment. Your good fortune is a rarity. It is not an accurate view of reality.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-26 00:32:40	@unsuicide certainly sounds good for public consumption. If true, gives wrong impression and is discouraging when others have less pos exp
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 21:36:44	Don't believe everything you read people. It's the surest sign that you can't think for yourself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 13:10:25	@DailyBipolar self esteem culture. People expect more.out of life than life has to offer
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:50:26	If you believe that you are entitled to happiness, it is inevitable to react poorly if it does not occur.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:48:54	The rate of increase of mental illness parallels the rise of liberalism.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:37:08	@oldandskinny why don't you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:36:53	@oldandskinny I usually only get it at work. Got to make the most of it. Alcohol helps. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:35:54	@oldandskinny even if he admitted it, it wouldn't make you feel better probably. It is just a crappy situation
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:34:41	@oldandskinny an emotional wreck. But at least mine is off the anger train, At least for now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:33:48	truth isn't pretty. But it's still truth.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:30:49	The happiest people are those with simple dreams and not high hopes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:30:21	Don't have high expectations. Really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:29:41	Doctors lie. They have no idea how psych meds work, and most people have side effects. Oh and the meds only work for a little while.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:28:06	@unsuicide you lie.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:25:19	@ybnormal622 that's a really big hamster.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:24:31	@LePetiteNYC don't mind me. Alcohol makes me loose lipped.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:23:51	@LePetiteNYC can I wish for you? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 12:23:15	@oldandskinny I liked your pic before. You looked sweet. You don't deserve what you ate going through.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-25 11:11:17	I like alcohol.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 10:35:42	She had never made me feel loved in twenty years. But she has been my best friend. What a disaster this is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 10:32:02	Terribly moody lately. New job, new dojo. Not good at anything if for no other reason than I'm new. Still would like to feel some competence
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 10:29:58	@ThinnerSpinster overthought
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 10:29:41	@ThinnerSpinster oh okay. Yeah. Overbought that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 10:28:42	@ThinnerSpinster ???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 10:26:39	@ThinnerSpinster guess no one is honest.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 10:26:08	@ThinnerSpinster I don't know how to meet women. Before marriage, they all met me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 10:25:29	@ThinnerSpinster in my experience, women aren't honest. Guys will tell you what they really think, even if you don't like it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 10:23:39	@ThinnerSpinster idk. Don't date men. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 10:21:24	I've been fantasizing about going on dates with other women. Not sex, just dates.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 09:34:13	@oldandskinny I'm so sorry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-24 08:48:44	@Jennka1 she is so cute!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-23 04:01:06	And she is working from home today. Yay I get to see me of her. Think I'll take a nap.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-22 09:54:42	Our should I just go to bed and get a good night's sleep?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-22 09:54:01	How long should I give her before I confront her? She ambushed me on my way out and now she is just sitting watching tv.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-22 09:49:14	Like she told me, I'll never find anyone else to put up with me. So I guess I'm stuck with however she wants to treat me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-22 09:47:02	Okay. I was wrong.She its pretending like nothing happened. This might be worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-22 09:29:39	And she wants to talk about why I am now being so cold. Oh boy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-20 10:30:44	@MariesVoicexoxo haha. Then that is a problem. Hit something.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-20 10:29:13	@MariesVoicexoxo that's not a normal day? You must be a morning person. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-20 10:25:48	It's not that I don't love her, but I am not in love with the person she had become.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-20 10:24:35	@A_Bipolar_Life neither. Haven't you ever had the world disappear except for you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-20 09:46:49	@ThinnerSpinster thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-20 09:37:41	I am lost inside myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-20 09:37:19	Bipolar has taken me over
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-20 09:12:33	Wtf is wrong with me? Wait...Don't answer that. Rhetorical question.

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-19 08:24:58	Not the most exciting birthday weekend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-19 05:18:12	I shouldnt exercise so much. Between #bipolar and the gym, I can't ever get out of bed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-19 03:21:58	Bipolar On. Emotions On. Brain Off.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-18 20:28:06	@ThinnerSpinster parents shouldn't get a free pass on how they treat their kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-18 11:03:12	@ThinnerSpinster I always feel that way when mine visits.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-18 11:02:38	Kiss me!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-17 09:17:12	@oldandskinny well she may not be that good a teacher, or she its just really busy?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-17 09:15:01	@oldandskinny I am tougher on students that I expect more from.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-17 08:58:38	@oldandskinny I was a teacher, we don't like those people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-16 11:12:09	A little tipsy from some really good Bordeaux.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-16 11:11:48	I can dream about you...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-16 11:05:45	@LePetiteNYC you're my kinda girl!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 09:23:41	@oldandskinny anything. Make a few propositions. Gamble a little. Shake things up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 08:16:39	@nejireta_ki ugh. hope you have at least a tolerable day and can get back to sleep soon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 08:15:14	@nejireta_ki I am humming you a virtual lullaby. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 08:01:43	my birthday is coming up. its never any good. i think i am gonna take some risks this year. can't make it any worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 07:58:33	its never enough
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 07:56:01	@ybnormal622 better to vent your negativity here than in the rest of your life. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 05:58:30	@DailyBipolar no matter how bad it gets, don't forget it will end. It may not feel like it, but it will.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 03:48:27	Twitter: Place to put snarky responses to posts on Facebook.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 03:47:38	Crowdsourcing: Getting someone else to do your job for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 03:44:45	@princessofcrazi you are right. The victim.is alone.and the attacker doesnt suffer. We live in a bad.world
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 03:42:50	@DailyBipolar yuck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-15 03:42:23	@DailyBipolar I went cold turkey. Not intentionally though. It was awful. Hope it gets better soon for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-14 12:11:18	But I'm really not complaining. It was a good weekend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-14 12:10:44	Pretty good 3 day weekend. Shouldnt have ended it by eating the extra frosting from the cake I made. Now I'm not going to be able to sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-14 12:08:05	@nejireta_ki take care of.yourself. its just a matter of time now. You've the power to choose to not let him hurt you anymore. You're strong
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-14 12:03:17	@princessofcrazi it's something you'll never forget. Learn to cope and forgive yourself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-14 12:02:09	@DailyBipolar been there. How high a dose were you once up to? I was at 2.0 plus some xanax.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-13 00:08:27	A pill won't make me feel better. My problems will still exist. I am not irrationally sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-13 00:00:15	@oldandskinny I get it here too sometimes. Just because we.have mental illness doesnt mean we don't have to comport with societal norms.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-12 23:58:38	@BipolarSanity suck it up. Not sick it up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-12 23:58:12	I was always told to sick it up. For the most part I have (twitter is my vent). Excuse me for feeling that others should too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-12 23:55:48	I get so tired of hearing how we ate supposed to be sympathetic for the feelings of different groups. No one ever cares about mine
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-12 23:52:52	I have no desire to put in the work to start over.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-12 23:13:11	@MyNocturnalSoul no apologies necessary.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-12 22:47:56	@MyNocturnalSoul agreed. you have the right to be unhealthy and unattractive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-12 21:43:30	We talked and acted like everything was getting better. It was very businesslike.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-12 11:29:02	Sometimes it's as plain as the noise on my face.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-11 11:51:21	I am always so out of sync.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-11 09:41:00	@LePetiteNYC a bad kitty
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-11 09:31:51	@LePetiteNYC can see how that could get interesting
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-11 09:30:25	@LePetiteNYC what's going on?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-11 09:30:14	@oldandskinny I am so sorry for you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-11 09:01:39	@nejireta_ki it's a start. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-11 07:57:59	I think I made a friend today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-11 07:19:27	I dont want to kill myself today. Score!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-11 05:06:51	@bip0larschiz0 sometimes those are worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-10 07:55:09	@AimeeHinds you state these as absolutes. It's be great for all those suffering if that was true.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-10 07:54:16	@AimeeHinds haha. I suppose I am being argumentative. I know you are trying to help.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-10 07:51:28	@AimeeHinds I am not using excuses. I know my situation. I could say that you ought to stop using cliches and empty platitudes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-10 07:48:20	@AimeeHinds I am living with poor choices and while I am far better mentally, the consequences are very bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-10 07:47:16	@AimeeHinds things don't work out just because you want them to. And following standard advice doesn't always give a positive result either
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-10 07:45:34	@AimeeHinds not so much for me. I am somewhat of a unique case.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-10 07:42:24	@AimeeHinds wish it worked like that, but thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-10 06:45:52	I don't know what I want to do. I don't understand my feelings, and I am afraid of the future.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-10 04:38:53	Another bad day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 18:14:28	@ClearlySZ no it.doesnt. not for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 18:13:32	@nejireta_ki none of the above.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 09:52:12	@nejireta_ki how about two out of three?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 09:46:08	I just wish someone would tell me what to doso I stop feeling like this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 09:45:30	If you are mentally ill, like me, sometimes other people really do know what's best for you. Even if you don't like it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 06:20:07	My life is a nightmare and I just can't wake myself up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 06:03:14	Just as well. I will be just as miserable alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 06:02:31	Want to just end the marriage now,.but its a family birthday.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 05:02:18	@Daphne_Writes every one has different cooing skills.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 04:14:21	I moved 4.5 months ago and not a single person has told me they missed me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 04:10:24	@ybnormal622 no. i am miserable because my life sucks. a pill won't change that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 04:08:24	Yes, things could be worse, but that would just be even crueler.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 03:56:53	@Jennka1 I am not really looking for a reason to live I guess.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 03:48:44	If I trusted her to take good care off the kids, I probably would kill myself on my birthday next week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 03:47:08	She told me I'll never find anyone who will put up with me. I think she is wrong. Its worse. I'll never find someone to even goout with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 03:45:37	This dramatic downturn started slowly after a monsterous argument a month ago. It may be that this steep decline is my realizing its over.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-09 03:02:40	And now work isn't so great either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-08 11:30:56	Mood crash.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-08 11:30:44	@ybnormal622 I ama mess. Took 2 years to climb out of a crushing depression. And when I finally start feeling just okay again...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-08 11:30:12	@ybnormal622 in a matter of weeks I fall nearly all the way back.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-08 11:17:32	Was so up a few weeks ago. Then a little down. But now I'm crashing very fast. It's kind of scary. Who knows what the next week will being.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-08 11:09:20	Another bad day. But.things will.get better. Right? And.angels are watching over me and.taking care of me too...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-07 10:05:04	Goodnight. Not that its been one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-07 09:56:16	It's so rare that someone says something nice about me that I don't actually believe them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-07 09:49:00	I am so sick of feeling this way. Where is it written that I must go on?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-07 08:51:09	@LePetiteNYC me too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-07 08:50:50	I really felt so good today. And then I came home. And then she wanted to talk.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-07 06:41:07	Ditto. "@MariesVoicexoxo: At no point in my life should I be allowed to lie in silence and think "
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-07 05:31:06	I think I am just about done with her. The world be damned but I hate the way she makes me feel.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-07 05:30:31	And I was feeling so good about myself after work today...and then i talked to her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-07 04:36:53	I didn't want to come home from work. And now I know why.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-06 10:55:56	I wish it wasn't so hard just to be me. Just to be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-06 10:17:08	@princessofcrazi thank you. I needed to hear that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-06 10:05:47	Time for bed. Maybe my nightmares will be better than my.daymare is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-06 10:03:54	I dont care if everyone hates me. I dont care what anyone thinks of me. But I really want at least someone to know me and love me for it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-06 10:01:25	I have my health, food, clothing, and shelter. I still dont want my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-06 10:00:13	I know I wont get anything I.think I need.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-06 09:55:23	And now I'm behaving like her. So I'm a complete hypocrite and can no longer complain. I quit. kmn
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-05 10:53:52	A good day despite her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-05 10:52:21	@MyNocturnalSoul my alcohol infusion is well started.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-05 08:56:08	@LePetiteNYC vietnamese, thai, or korean BBQ tom?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-05 07:16:22	@Daphne_Writes that is why ppl believe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-05 05:14:19	Productive day. May not have friends but at least I am not useless.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 22:44:28	@loveleadsway I dont think so. The patient has to work.at it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 20:53:24	I used to see Potential in days and nights, now I see Uncertainty.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 13:04:25	goodnight stars...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 12:41:08	@princessofcrazi as she should. too bad mine wasn't sleeping with her brother, they are doubly cute together.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 12:39:28	@loveleadsway she is on meds and goes to a therapist. has for years. she has gotten worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 12:35:37	@loveleadsway I just wish mine would stip being so angry. I am pretty sure she hates us but won't admit it to herself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 12:33:30	@loveleadsway I'm sorry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 12:31:40	@loveleadsway was he mean to.you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 12:30:57	@princessofcrazi NOT
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 12:27:10	@loveleadsway it worked out accepting him not changing?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 12:17:34	@loveleadsway I take it you are being sarcastic?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 11:59:05	I feel.so whiny and needy and craving attention. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 11:58:06	@oldandskinny I haven't told anyone outside of twitter, although I don't have any friends to tell
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 11:48:19	I want the weekend over so I can go back to work. I don't want to be around her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 11:45:52	I know she won't change. Can I just live with her and stop asking her to try?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 11:42:51	I am as close to.divorce as I've ever been. I'll probably chicken out anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 11:27:27	@princessofcrazi thirsty wont go away. Nausea is "supposed" to in time
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 10:09:09	@ThinnerSpinster I am sorry. Its.that time of year. World is getting colder.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 09:57:09	@ThinnerSpinster I didn't mean anything. I am just down.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 09:44:19	@ThinnerSpinster maybe. I havent had.a rant in.awhile.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 09:40:16	@ThinnerSpinster you are one of a select few.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 09:39:13	@ThinnerSpinster thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 09:08:47	I think I hate everyone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 09:05:12	I hate you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 08:48:21	Falling #bipolardown
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 08:38:24	@SuicideStops I agree fully but that isnt why I would rather not be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 08:24:38	Fm n fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 08:17:48	I may be too depressed to go out and cheer myself up. #irony #bipolardown
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 05:12:02	The fact that others have it worse than me doesn't make me ungrateful, it makes me wonder why the human race exists.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 05:06:46	Things don't always get better. Its not an acute problem. My life is chronic. And I don't want it anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 05:04:42	The fact that I've chosen to live is about as positive a statement I can make.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 05:03:56	Don't tell me to be positive. If you lived my life, you'd be even more negative than me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 05:03:09	Every little thing gonna be all wrong.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 04:37:14	@princessofcrazi I had to stop taking it because of side effects. They didn't go away for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 04:36:01	I would rather stay at work than be at home.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-04 04:35:25	I've said it before, but I have to say it again. I don't fit in anywhere. I keep relearning this lesson.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 11:11:12	Goodnight light and the red balloon...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 10:26:46	@danyell_bipolar but only by the fiftieth or sixtieth time.:-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 10:17:53	I am so sick of how sweet she gets only when she knows I am fed up with her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 09:01:52	@oldandskinny then there is prob little you can do. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 09:01:06	@tweety123pie awesome. Any reccs for a nice one?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 08:38:08	@tweety123pie just learning to play. just have a cheap one, but I will buy a nicer one
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 08:33:52	@tweety123pie playing my pennywhistle
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 08:32:22	music soothes the saddened beast.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 08:12:32	Still #bipolardown and falling.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 08:12:11	@oldandskinny that is a lot to change. He sounds like the one with the MH problem.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 07:58:44	@oldandskinny that isn't fair either. mine doesn't either. she says she will when i am really upset, and it lasts 2 weeks. rinse wash repeat
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 07:36:21	@oldandskinny yeah, not much i can do about it. i take full responsibility, but I was like 20.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 07:33:56	@oldandskinny she hasn't forgiven me for stupid stuff I did before we were married. she can't explain though why she still married me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 07:28:57	@oldandskinny 18 years. its been 8 years maybe since we got along and were close.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 07:23:05	@oldandskinny unfortunately. I am sorry for you too. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 07:01:11	@oldandskinny her for the most part.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 06:17:29	@oldandskinny been there. I expect a rough night if I had a good day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 05:17:56	@oldandskinny if I.knew I would leave in a fixed time, I would.leave now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 04:44:34	@oldandskinny unfortunately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 04:43:47	@nejireta_ki I know. You keep telling me and I keep not listening. :) its a lot harder with kids to just leave. I am glad you are happier.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 04:42:01	@MainaSkarner yeah. That was pretty mean.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 04:41:43	@princessofcrazi thank you. Really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-03 04:41:21	@oldandskinny 3 boys
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-02 10:13:35	As I have no friends, it is pretty easy to tell I'll be alone if I leave her. She even told me so.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-02 09:48:29	I am so sick of my wife. She.just doesnt ever keep her end of the bargain. How many broken promises is enough? 10? 20? 50?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-02 06:19:29	@hczzz is the word cancer offensive?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-02 06:05:02	Gonna get out my aggressions tonight. Its fight night.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:49:07	@princessofcrazi agreed. I don't think ive ever put up a pic of me here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:46:42	@princessofcrazi you should send that stuff dm. More private if that is a concern.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:45:15	@princessofcrazi very pretty. Nice eyes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:44:18	@princessofcrazi looking creates a look of desperation that drives people away. Confidence is a big attractor.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:42:47	@princessofcrazi what? People don't lie on the internet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:42:07	@princessofcrazi I'm sure you will. When you aren't looking, he will just appear.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:24:14	@princessofcrazi good! its better than sick of yourself. its my loss that you are young and beautiful and I am old and married. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:20:50	@princessofcrazi everyone is difficult and damaged, just some better fit societal definitions of normal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:19:30	@princessofcrazi awww. Oh well. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:13:32	@princessofcrazi you won't if you don't try. The time is gonna pass anyways, best to give it all you got.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:12:27	@princessofcrazi you have to learn.to control it to have a successful relationship with a good person.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 10:10:50	@BipolarLawyer @princessofcrazi good for.you. being a lawyer just made me a better debater, a skill I could not resist using.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 09:53:30	@princessofcrazi I still default to arguing. part of that is being a lawyer for almost 10 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 09:53:09	@princessofcrazi can I ask how old you are? It took me until I was 40 to start to get over that. I don't need to be right anymore, but
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 09:51:58	@princessofcrazi are you hitting on me? lol. Yes, been married for 18 years to a girl also from CT.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 09:46:21	@princessofcrazi haha. me too. its a good trait to demand success of yourself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 09:45:07	@princessofcrazi so I went back and got a ph.d. Now what I do is better suited to my personality/bipolar (and probably more).
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 09:44:27	@princessofcrazi I like school, so school went well. my problem was working as a lawyer. those personality traits didn't help my career.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 09:40:27	@princessofcrazi @BipolarLawyer it's definitely a hindrance, but people with mental illness are the most stubborn people I know. don't quit
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 09:32:56	@princessofcrazi @BipolarLawyer you sound so surprised! mental illness doesn't stop one from being successful. I have a law degree and a phd
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 06:39:15	@MainaSkarner that still doesn't mean that I put her feelings ahead of mine when it comes to my mental health.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 06:38:29	@MainaSkarner like my physical health is my responsibility. If I don't take that responsibility, then my SO has every right to be upset
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 06:37:44	@MainaSkarner then I should be on meds. If I am on meds, I need more or different meds to allow me to properly function. My mental health,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 06:37:09	@MainaSkarner well, I don't know about we can't help it. I am still responsible for my actions, and I need to control myself. If I can't,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 04:15:33	@MainaSkarner no one lives in your skin all day everyday. No one is stuck with your problems but you. Your beat interests differ from others
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 04:09:59	@MainaSkarner I guess I am selfish. I only consider how it makes me feel.I have to live with it more than those around me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 03:48:51	@MainaSkarner better than the pit in your stomach feeling with depression. I dont worry.what ppl think of me. Its usually bad no matter what
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-10-01 03:28:50	@MainaSkarner I dont like the insomnia but yes I love feeling that good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-30 11:36:21	Mania mania, wherefore art thou mania. Mania you are a passionate misunderstood beauty. My love mania.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-30 11:34:38	I'd do anything for #bipolarup again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-30 11:32:48	Not anxious and depressed about anything. Completely anxious and depressed and miserable about nothing. #bipolardown
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-30 09:22:26	@LePetiteNYC roller.coaster. been high for.awhile. now I am more down but most days I'm both. Moved recently so I could be more stable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-30 09:13:54	I hate seeing pics of people I grew up with who have not aged well. Makes me sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-30 09:04:24	@LePetiteNYC I'm jealous. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-30 09:03:13	@LePetiteNYC haha. Like the new pic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-30 08:22:01	@LePetiteNYC good for you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-30 08:20:46	@LePetiteNYC wow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 08:08:21	I may be highly functional on the outside but dont think I suffer less on the inside. In fact I suffer more to maintain the facade.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 07:32:50	@LePetiteNYC I like high maintenance.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 07:32:34	@LePetiteNYC how about vodka red bull?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 07:31:30	@tweety123pie it didnt. No worries.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 07:31:06	@LePetiteNYC picky picky. Here I buy you a drink. Oh well. More for me. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 07:27:10	@LePetiteNYC me too. Here's a vodka sour for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 07:23:38	@tweety123pie is it bad taste to.joke about the word.choice of hang??? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 07:14:44	I think I am about to cry for no reason.I don't cry even for the best reasons. #bipolardown
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 07:00:52	I want to run away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 06:34:34	My life has become everything I didn't want it to be. My favorite part off the day is work, and not because I am so in love with my work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 06:33:35	If my life is gonna suck, why put much effort in.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 06:32:21	Instead of building storage shelves, I am hiding in my room and laying in bed. #biploardown
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 06:25:21	@LePetiteNYC focus on the things you like.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 06:24:16	@LePetiteNYC doesn't matter if your feelings are rational or not, you still feel them. Avoid what feels bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 06:23:10	@LePetiteNYC so dont. Get rid of them if you need to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 06:22:16	@LePetiteNYC I am so sorry you are feeling this bad though. I know it's been hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 06:21:16	@LePetiteNYC the same opinion. I am not saying you will feel better about yourself but you need to try and cope in the meantime.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 06:20:21	@LePetiteNYC it's best to try not to think about it. Wear what you feel most comfortable in and rely on the idea that others don't have the
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 06:17:36	@LePetiteNYC been.there, and I am a boy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-28 06:16:41	If I can't be happy, can I at least be left alone?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-27 10:19:02	I am tired of being hypersexual and overly frustrated.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-27 10:18:00	I am tired of not having friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-27 10:17:39	Some.days I am more sick of this mood thing than others.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 10:21:06	Need to find a bipolar meetup.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 10:07:47	So does sex.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 10:07:28	Ice cream makes me happy, even if it's only for a few minutes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 09:12:24	I need somewhere to run away to. Maybe I should start playing poker again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 09:05:12	each day when the sadness comes around, it bites a little harder.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 08:58:41	no one has ever nominated me for the positivity challenge. they all know me too well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 08:46:42	wild ride this week. rapid cycling is very adventurous.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 07:18:51	@LivinwithBATman "When your partner is manic, you are no longer talking to the person. You are addressing the #bipolar ." I disagree.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 07:17:02	@LivinwithBATman he isnt being the part of him you love. But he is still being part of who he is. It doesn't sound like you love all of him.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 07:15:49	@LivinwithBATman then you dont understand how he feels. Would you treat a cancer patient the same way?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 07:09:43	@LivinwithBATman and without condescension.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 07:09:30	@LivinwithBATman changes with those priorities. If you are close with the person, try to understand and help all those personalities.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 07:08:49	@LivinwithBATman you are always talking to the same person. its just that our priorities and values may change with our mood. Reasonable...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 07:06:02	@LivinwithBATman that really isn't fair to depersonalize a human being. I understand why you do it, but it is cruel and hurtful to us.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 07:01:04	@MariesVoicexoxo maybe it'll be contagious. I could use a little optimism. I am quite pessimistic myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 06:59:26	@MariesVoicexoxo I hope you are right. It's good to be an optimist!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 06:57:51	@MariesVoicexoxo arent you lucky! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 06:10:46	@LePetiteNYC there is a new horseshoe casino in Baltimore,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 06:08:24	@LePetiteNYC now I just need to find my casino cards, and figure out which ones are still open.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 06:05:55	@LePetiteNYC we could meet in Atlantic City. They have casinos...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 06:04:19	@LePetiteNYC awesome, I am 10 hours closer than I used to be to you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 06:03:19	every time someone talks to me, I want to scream "Hey lets go drinking"... I am truly weird...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-26 06:01:23	I am back to the NEED EXCITEMENT stage...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-21 10:59:56	@ybnormal622 so.it seems today
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-21 08:44:20	@ybnormal622 college football season. Yay. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-21 08:42:25	@leah_michal wow. I am so.sorry. It is sad when.people.you.love lose touch with reality.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-21 06:34:14	I am out of place.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-21 02:48:44	@BipolarDuder but I like the analogy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-21 02:48:18	@BipolarDuder the reward at the end is slow deterioration and death. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-21 02:33:40	Why can't everything go right once in awhile?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-20 22:19:10	@Lib_fallenangel glad to hear.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-20 08:52:50	While lots of geniuses and highly creative people are #bipolar , having bipolar disorder doesn't make you smart or creative.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-20 08:32:58	You wanna pet me? Pet me in the next room. Oh wait let's go back to the first room. Almost...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-20 08:01:24	@Lib_fallenangel sorry you are so upset and angry. Hope it passes sooner rather than later.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-20 07:58:11	Russian observers claimed irregularities in Scottish vote. They would know all about voting irregularities.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-20 07:53:58	Whenever one party loses an election, immediately the claims of cheating come out. Every country every party.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-13 22:19:30	If you are not going to listen to me, I am just going to do my own thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-13 05:31:57	I never wanted my life to be all about responsibility. Adults are so damn boring.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-13 05:29:49	Yay. Another weekend to be miserable. Lucky me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-13 05:29:22	If you are one of those people who believe that most people are dumb, then how can you believe in democracy, where the majority decides?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-11 10:40:06	The whole world can go fuck itself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-11 10:36:58	Things were bad enough before she was depressed. Now how am I supposed to be sympathetic? I am just feeling more angry and alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-11 10:35:36	Of course I'm the bad guy. I am always the bad guy. It's always my fault.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-10 07:25:32	What defines a winner is how quickly they recover from adversity.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-10 07:14:30	@oxymoronic82 best wishes and a speedy recovery!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-10 05:11:34	So frustrated all the time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-09 09:55:12	found out that she is suicidal. that explains a lot.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-09 07:01:13	@Anonynay you are obsessed. At least it's a healthy obsession. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-07 10:47:45	@loveleadsway haha. Let them be more rainbows than otherwise... ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-07 10:39:22	@loveleadsway it has whatever you can imagine. And then some. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-07 10:38:51	@ybnormal622 that is awful. I hate jobs like that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-07 10:14:29	@ybnormal622 good idea. Don't let it consume you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-07 10:12:44	@loveleadsway welcome to #twitterpsychward thanks for the follow. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-07 10:11:20	@ybnormal622 well hello there stranger! Haven't heard from you on awhile. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-07 08:21:49	I went to high school with an anorexic girl. I thought she was hot. Now as an adult, she has recovered. She is now a gorgeous women.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-07 07:54:42	So stupid how easily I feel lonely. Esp since I usually don't like dealing with other people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-07 01:00:26	Social media gives a voice to the uninformed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 22:41:22	@LePetiteNYC good for you! I'll bet you look great.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 21:37:46	@LivinwithBATman @Lib_fallenangel thank you. They really are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 21:37:05	@Lib_fallenangel thank you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 21:18:33	@Lib_fallenangel thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 20:37:09	@Lib_fallenangel if I get upset with her, and I don't give in, she yells at me. It is a bad cycle.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 20:30:41	She was so vile to me last night. The outbursts are getting worse. #whydoIstay
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 12:07:37	Damn. Trouble is avoiding me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 11:24:52	To start trouble or not to start trouble. That is not a hard question.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 08:49:26	@Lib_fallenangel oh and yes. Yes yes yes ... ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 08:48:12	@Lib_fallenangel another selfie! Sigh...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 08:24:48	Saving my mental energies.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 08:03:32	Tonight is another drink and party night. Praying I remember all the fun I have tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 07:57:11	@Lib_fallenangel ok. Didn't look at the time stamp on the Timberlake postings.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 07:56:32	@Lib_fallenangel @YouTube oh so all those cool pics you post are selfies!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 07:54:11	@Lib_fallenangel is this why you are watching sexy vids??? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 07:52:54	@Lib_fallenangel @YouTube at least you are honest!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 07:44:22	@Lib_fallenangel @YouTube is it the song or the boy that is getting you all riled up? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-06 07:42:18	Crazy Chester followed me...won't you feed him when you can?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 09:48:55	@Anonynay on my own...hehehe. ;) lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 09:35:51	@Anonynay sex at work. Always wanted to do that!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 09:32:00	@Anonynay hahahaha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 09:23:52	@Anonynay at the risk of being rude, I can't multiple orgasm either though. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 09:16:08	@Anonynay haha. Exactly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 09:05:04	@Anonynay a lot of bruises. My left arm is usually throbbing. Bruised my knee once and sat out a few weeks. Love it though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 09:03:18	@Anonynay ouch. You are a good friend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 08:44:16	@Anonynay don't know much about pilates. Yoga is hard though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 08:43:23	@Anonynay late night party's are always hard as we get older. We are going dancing tomorrow and it will wipe me out for days.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 08:26:36	@Anonynay yoga is great for flexibility. Definitely lift weights. My wife started last year and it did wonders for her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 08:25:31	@Anonynay I think I saw that pic awhile ago. That is very cool. Music is awesone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 08:24:22	@Anonynay only twice a week. It's 90 min of pain. I lift weights 3 days a week also.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 08:20:27	@Anonynay Gig? Are you a musician?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 08:20:07	@Anonynay Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. My school is closed this weekend to move to a new location. Our lives are in parallel suffering. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 08:17:48	@Lib_fallenangel you are very welcome. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 08:16:04	@Lib_fallenangel you post the coolest pics!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 08:15:25	@Anonynay I understand. I have been very cranky cause I couldn't go to my BJJ class because my son had a dr appt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 07:49:34	@Anonynay me too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 04:39:21	i have spent my life chasing the rush. When it wears out, I find another. Running out of rushes...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 03:45:10	@BipolarDuder haha. Nothing is screwed up. People are people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-05 03:43:58	@BipolarDuder it sounds like you have enough pride left to be ashamed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-09-01 04:47:53	@thinkdepression I drink to be less boring.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 12:48:21	@oxymoronic82 all mom's have anxiety. you live your baby. That is the most important thing. I hope you get some sleep before your labor. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 12:43:18	@oxymoronic82 I hope.ypur baby doesn't keep you awake at night as long as mine did (4 years!). BTW congrats on the upcoming blessing!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 12:37:42	@oxymoronic82 just wait. Soon it'll be an actual baby screaming and keeping you up. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 10:56:58	@Jennka1 to believe. I have gone through so much with my inlaws. I really do empathize.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 10:56:18	@Jennka1 she will see what is good and right on her own. She will notice that you let her decide for herself while others tell her what...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 10:53:53	@Jennka1 did you have a communion? Was it a bad thing?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 10:52:49	@Jennka1 I guess it's like being in the closet?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 10:52:21	@Jennka1 will he be offended if you talk to your kids about god when he isn't around? Will he know?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 10:51:36	@Jennka1 they agree with me. And still live both of us.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 10:51:16	@Jennka1 my in laws are fundamentalists. I let my kids be alone with them and talk with them about god and why I reject those beliefs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 10:50:32	@Jennka1 kids are smart. Talk to her as a full person and she will see why you are right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 10:48:57	@DailyBipolar no
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 10:45:25	@Jennka1 first you decide if there is a need to hurt him like that. If there is, you say, "I don't believe in God."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 10:44:15	Mania really is a reason to live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 08:09:54	What the hell is wrong with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 08:01:53	@BipolarSanity my younger self would find this terribly depressing. I suppose I agree.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-31 08:01:01	My greatest pleasure in life is a steak dinner. Ribeye, steak fries, cabernet, and ice cream. My 2nd greatest is probably also food.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 12:09:21	@oldandskinny thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 12:02:49	Really hate being me. Even on good days.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 10:05:48	I hate feeling this moody. But I get so insecure when I am rejected.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 10:02:32	@DailyBipolar girls are rude because they think every guy is hitting on them. Then they complain guys judge only on looks, but they do it 2
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 09:53:45	@DailyBipolar Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 09:53:22	@DailyBipolar it happens a lot. I really think it's my phone app. Doesn't seem to happen on the computer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 09:52:34	@DailyBipolar I like to but usually nowhere to go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 09:51:44	@DailyBipolar oh men can be horrible. But what women don't realize is its.mostly bluster. We don't mean half of it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 09:35:28	It drives me crazy how women judge men. The arrogance. And then they complain about the men they date...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 09:26:37	Sigh. I am wallowing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 09:26:28	Everyone is out but me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 08:46:02	It sucks wanting to even just be friends with people who don't like you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 08:41:44	I am hoping it's an app glitch, but whenever I tweet, my feed goes instantly quiet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 08:22:14	@LePetiteNYC and yet you only said 6. :p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 05:43:10	@jewels_rare I'm in the gym. Trying not to fall asleep with big barbells on top of me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 05:42:00	Need ... attention.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 05:11:20	the latest "burst" seems to be over and it makes me sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 01:10:36	And i don't mean real addictions. I mean the needs of the bipolar mind.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 01:09:52	Starving the cravings will only make you unhappy. Find a balance you can maintain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 01:09:19	Feed me Seymour. It won't stop until you do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-30 00:26:33	I just don't do social interactions appropriately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-29 09:00:24	@LePetiteNYC haha. I can't talk. I lived in Queens and Brooklyn when I lived there. Manhattan was too noisy for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-29 08:58:00	@LePetiteNYC I am really gone come.up in the next few months. You gotta at least have a drink with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-29 08:57:20	@LePetiteNYC you don't live in the city. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-29 08:53:46	I want to visit NYC and party all night. Anyone got a couch I can sleep on???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-28 11:11:53	@nejireta_ki maybe you need to find a way to see more of her? I don't know your situation, but you seem so happy when she is around often.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-28 11:10:50	@BipolarDuder good for you for being patient and seeing it through. I can never do that with meds.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-28 11:08:10	@BipolarDuder these psych meds are so unpredictable. If you can't stop then you need less lamotrogine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-28 11:07:15	@BipolarDuder people who dismiss mental illness are not people to take advice from. Recognize limitations. Strive to overcome.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-28 11:04:40	A mediocre workout and I am just miserable. Have to work on not letting my ego control hold my emotions hostage.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-28 11:01:39	@BipolarDuder I found that more lamotragine made me anxious and insomniac. I would sometimes have wine at night to help me sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-28 10:59:46	@nejireta_ki if you didn't exist, ypu couldn't see bree. And then she would be sad. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-28 10:58:26	@BipolarDuder lack of insight is why you are mentally ill. If you rationally understood your limitations. ..
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-27 23:48:23	@BipolarDuder thank you. May your ups be controlled and last longer than your downs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-26 10:46:46	I was told that I had sex friday night. I just can't feel good about it because I can't remember any of it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-26 10:44:51	I humble myself everyday. And if I haven't then I didn't push myself hard enough.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-26 09:42:57	Hi #bipolar world.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-23 11:39:10	Love me. Love me. Let's us live. Let us feeeeeeeel....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-23 11:38:32	I am THERE!!! I you are #bipolar , you know...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-23 05:11:27	@LePetiteNYC way too easy...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-21 05:36:10	Oftentimes when someone tries to fix something they break something bigger.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-21 05:35:42	Just because someone is suffering somewhere doesn't mean someone did anything wrong.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-21 05:23:19	@sarahljaffe not sure what white people did. Maybe on cops? White people didn't riot. Lose the white guilt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-21 05:18:28	@nw_nicholas @pixiestik_ yeah its a terrible thing to win a war. How evil to strike back and win.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-19 07:33:43	Left work feeling awful and very discouraged. Then a co-worker saw me walking out and joined me. Its the little things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-18 07:51:25	okay i am going to work at not criticizing or being negative. at least not when other people can hear me (or on FB). twitter excepted.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-17 10:50:45	@Jennka1 hehehe. It's one way to break a mood.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-17 10:46:53	A little drunk here. Best I have felt in ages.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-17 06:20:18	@sam_stone152 isn't that the definition of fishing?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-17 04:26:20	Is it mental illness if you feel worthless because everyone really does hate you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 23:14:15	give my liberty then give me death
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 21:04:10	This damn phone is my life line to human contact. At least those who don't want to yell at me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 21:01:33	I kinda miss the point as to why most people want to live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 19:33:19	@DailyBipolar thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:56:35	@Jennka1 it sux. I was that person the first 5 years and now I am getting 10 years of payback.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:51:05	@Jennka1 it doesn't do any good when only one person is trying.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:50:24	@DailyBipolar it's just so much work to separate and start again. Our lives are so intertwined.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:48:38	@DailyBipolar I've seen it for yeats. Don't do a thing. Just give more chances. And she thinks I just want to leave her. God. I wish I did.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:46:18	@Jennka1 I do what she asks. She doesn't do what I ask. I won't go anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:45:46	@DailyBipolar she is so passive aggressive. I never know what to think. I just want to be left alone I think
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:42:34	@Jennka1 yeah he told her I was right. I was dumbfounded.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:40:48	Sad thing is that I want to give her a chance but she doesn't act interested despite telling me she wants to make it work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:23:52	I need to follow more people. I don't come on sometimes for awhile, so if I didn't follow back, say hi sometime.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:22:12	@nejireta_ki it's taken me a lot of years to get there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:12:38	I honestly can't figure out what it wrong with me. Why I do so poor socially.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:12:02	Don't say I'll meet someone. I haven't made a new friend in 7 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:11:33	I am actually starting to believe I would be happier alone. Even if.it is forever.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:10:47	I am smart successful in shape pretty good looking. But my personality is either too boring or too toxic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:09:52	Well chatted with one but I bored her away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 11:09:13	Chatting online with women while my wife watches tv. Yeah it getting to be over.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 10:48:15	Fuck me. No. I guess I will just go fuck myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 08:47:08	@MaryRachelleC yes that would be accurate. Except for a few months oh hypomanja, I have been numb for the last 2 years since I was suicidal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 08:32:38	@MaryRachelleC I do too. It's weird that it doesn't upset me anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 07:59:25	I am so used to being ignored that it doesn't bother me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 07:49:39	Where to drink. What to drink.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 07:43:55	Conundrum.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 07:43:45	I need to go drink. I hate drinking alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 05:30:29	Moments like these are why I gave up shooting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 04:42:16	I fall in love with any reasonably attractive person who is merely nice to me. God help me if they found out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 04:39:20	The story of my life concluded a few years ago. Yet I am not dead.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 04:14:25	The more people don't want to be around me the worse my life gets.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 04:14:06	The angrier I get the more people don't want to be around me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 04:13:49	The worse my life gets the angrier I get.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 04:07:46	I DON'T WANT TO START OVER. I WOULD RATHER "RETIRE",
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 03:58:14	Can't help but be angry at everyone and jealous of everything.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 03:57:42	When your parents and your spouse have always treated you poorly, how do ever learn to have positive relationships.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-16 03:56:43	Feeling absolutely nauseated. Feelings are starting to overwhelm me. Can't seem to keep them buried.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-15 09:09:05	@LePetiteNYC I still have half a giant undercooked sugar cookie but you have to come get it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-14 10:08:52	I left work today wondering why I was in such a rush to go. At least there I am productive and distracted.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-14 10:04:13	No one else cares to check in on me except the one person who treats me bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-12 09:52:45	Maybe we are not mentally ill. We don't ignore the harsh realities and allow ourselves to be upset about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-12 09:22:00	My life is falling off a cliff...and yet all I can think about is Robin Williams. I never mourn people I don't know, but this is a shock.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-12 08:38:24	@ThinnerSpinster it's what made him so talented.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-12 08:00:10	There is nothing wrong with being sad. Being ashamed and burying emotions is unhealthy. Grieve if you want to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-12 07:57:04	Goodnight Vietnam...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-12 04:28:55	OTP cust svc "I am inside your account." That's what she said...hehehe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-12 04:27:51	It makes no sense but the fact that no one would care if I left keeps me around.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 09:48:58	Not looking forward to waking up tomorrow. Or the next day. Or any day after that. Ever.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 05:45:29	@weswroten a white pizza and a pepperoni pizza. Nothing fancy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 05:42:13	On a positive note, the depression cut off my spending spree early.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 05:41:02	I used to be very hypersexual. She has made me forget all about it now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 05:39:35	@weswroten pizza is on the way. My soul responds much better to pizza
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 05:37:58	Have I told you lately how much I hate you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 05:37:12	So sick and upset that I didn't eat. Now more sick and upset from lack of food.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 05:07:31	It's not that I want to die. I just have no interest in continuing to live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 01:42:51	I wonder if I posed as a girl on here if I would get different reactions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 01:22:56	I actually don't understand why anyone could be happy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 01:21:21	I just realized that I would be willing to shoot myself in the head but not eat a lot of junk food and get fat and ruin my health. Hmmm.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 01:13:56	I have a lot of time to kill. Maybe 40 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 01:13:24	Maybe I should take up booze. self induced unconsciousness seems like a good skill to develop.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 01:11:49	I'm not even interested in wallowing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 00:37:48	My relationship s have made me an introvert.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 00:19:42	I don't look forward to anything. That seems odd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 00:17:52	2.5 years after being hopelessly suicidal things aren't better but I have learned to ignore my feelings.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-11 00:04:00	i am so unhappy and hopeless that I find comfort in other people being unhappy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-10 21:37:00	I am really kind of tired complaining about her though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-10 21:29:14	I really have nowhere else to complain, and no one to listen to it anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-07 04:18:34	and I guess nothing is more pathetic than a needy guy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-07 04:11:54	finally settling into new home and new job.it just means that the excitement will wear off and I will have to fight the demons again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-06 05:21:22	@Libertasbpd that's what I do. You'll be fine!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-06 03:57:11	@Libertasbpd try it all out and see what works.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-06 03:55:38	@Libertasbpd so what. and if they are mean, block them. be whoever you need to be on here. you can be a whore one day and a saint the next.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-06 03:54:51	@Libertasbpd go ahead. i was really trying to say that if this is an anon account, it should be therapy related. if someone doesn't like it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-05 08:18:20	@ThinnerSpinster what's a bob? Is that a person? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-05 08:15:55	@ThinnerSpinster I've been trying hard not to go on a spending spree. Really hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-05 08:05:09	@ThinnerSpinster gotta have that BI in #bipolar .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-05 07:42:56	@ThinnerSpinster I am so glad to hear that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-05 07:42:37	@Libertasbpd #twitterpsychward is about you being honest about yourself. others feelings are irrelevant here. period. that is the point.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-03 21:10:15	@Libertasbpd no wonder you are sad. I need to make a run to the liquor superstore (really) as I am very low.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-03 12:36:50	I need ________. Actually I just need.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-03 12:28:24	And wife is passed out again. Starting to like her better this way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-03 12:10:35	@Libertasbpd haha. I just drink wine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-03 10:53:39	@Libertasbpd I like the things you retweet, but I like even better hearing what you have to say. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-03 10:51:49	@nejireta_ki glad to hear you finally did it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-03 10:49:35	Melancholy is the best way to describe it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-02 22:52:44	@MyBipolarBrain @oxymoronic82 it's actually not good for your skin and hair to be washed every day. So you are being healthy!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-02 08:58:57	I am so fucking tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-02 07:08:18	@MariesVoicexoxo I've seen you struggle being by yourself the last few years. Let people in, just not all the way. They need to earn trust.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-02 06:59:59	@MariesVoicexoxo or don't care and be all alone and hurt worse. Can't avoid pain but you can learn to cope once you pick your poison.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-08-02 06:57:41	I'm lonely.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 21:42:03	People on Facebook are so damn sensitive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 21:41:42	You cannot really understand the meaning behind only 140 characters.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 21:40:52	For all those opposed to today's beauty standard, ask yourself whether you swoon at a fit person?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 10:56:42	I can't even do mentally ill right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 10:56:03	Being sad and depressed gets you sympathy, but when your illness comes through in anger, people just hate you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 10:51:13	Since I am on a roll, let's piss off people here. I just want to say that I am sick of dogs. People on social media are obsessed with dogs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 10:49:19	@Anonynay it might be fun to try. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 10:48:25	I've said it many times before, but I am really really good. ... at making people dislike me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 06:45:24	I've been so absent from here that it seems like nearly everyone but a couple people are gone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 06:43:28	I am really really talented at getting people to not like me. I don't even have to try.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 05:41:09	@LePetiteNYC so I tell myself. Haha.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-31 05:40:11	@LePetiteNYC never heard of this before, but you can be my only #wcw . ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-30 10:10:21	No balance. Either too sad or too crazy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-30 10:06:02	OMG. 90% of my feed are retweets. Have something original to say!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-30 10:03:50	@katykansasrose depends on how much better you want it to be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-28 04:45:27	Nerd is a four letter word.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-28 04:43:04	I may not be able to do anything about it, but I won't forget either. And if the chance comes to return the "favor", I won't disappoint.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-26 13:18:43	@LePetiteNYC I am only a few hours away. I will soon!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-26 12:52:57	@LePetiteNYC I am hanging with some NYC people! I think I need to visit! !!!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-26 12:06:56	I only seem to tweet lately when I am out at this club!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-26 12:06:34	Who else wants to drink and fuck???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-14 04:44:38	@nejireta_ki I think one of the people I was with last night is also bipolar. He "outshined" me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-14 04:38:32	@nejireta_ki not really unfortunately. Apparently people like me much more when I am "up". Oh well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-14 00:09:35	Wife always goes back to selfishness.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-13 13:34:01	Some nights you fucking lose. Godamnit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-13 13:33:34	Some night you lose.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-13 13:24:53	Not fair that i have an off night and it potentially ruins it all. But what does fairness matter anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-13 13:04:18	The .monster came out instead. #fml l
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-13 12:39:11	At a club. People are dancing and naked somewhat. Usually I am energized. Tonight I feel invisible and cannot shake it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-13 12:32:34	@nejireta_ki omg. Yes it is. Been a long time since I've done that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-13 12:31:51	@nejireta_ki and yet the alcohol is not having the usual effect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-13 12:29:40	@nejireta_ki I am so trying. Ahhhhh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-13 12:12:29	How do I turn ON that switch? I need to be the Life of the Party NOW!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-13 08:59:35	Off to the club tonight. Let's see what happens. Last time was fun. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-12 10:59:43	@CityPanicked you will survive and be stronger. And you will find someone worthier to love.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-12 10:59:07	@CityPanicked of course. Don't blame yourself and try not to punish yourself. No one deserves that kind of betrayal. He is the bad one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-12 10:52:40	@CityPanicked I feel sick for you. I am so sorry to hear that
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-12 10:51:38	Working full time for the first time in a lot of years. Not sure how long it will take to overwhelm me, but I am tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-12 10:49:50	Not been very active here lately since I moved north, but I don't recognize my twitter stream...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-10 07:45:22	Sometimes the world is unpleasant to you and you just don't deserve it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-07-08 06:06:59	Hi everyone! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-28 06:40:19	@LePetiteNYC where is the rest of the body?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-28 06:39:44	Getting more wound up as job start date nears. Sleeping less. Lot more fun than depression but I am gonna crash.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-26 22:18:07	@Anonynay That is my life right now exactly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-26 09:16:54	@MariesVoicexoxo well at least you know what you like better than I did.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-26 09:07:10	@MariesVoicexoxo I couldn't ever decide on a career path or anything because picking one thing meant I couldn't do anything else. very hard
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-26 09:03:51	@MariesVoicexoxo if you are anything like I was, you want all sorts of different contradictory things at the same time.... hard to decide...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-26 09:02:24	affordable housing is nonexistent here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-26 09:01:09	I finally live near casinos again but havent yet had the chance to indulge.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-26 09:00:36	Moving bites, and good housing is very hard to find where we ended up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-26 09:00:14	This last month has been one of the most stressful in years and years. Thank goodness I have had a touch of mania throughout.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-25 12:22:17	And the anxiety is making me nauseous. I do not handle lack of control very well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-25 05:35:27	Took a risk. Lost. #SOML
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-21 09:39:03	Party time. Let's get nekkid!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-21 06:41:32	Club again tonight. No gym tomorrow so I can drink all I want!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-19 01:03:53	There are casinos here. Ooooh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-19 00:06:09	Physical pain is an excellent anxiety remover for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-19 00:04:27	Pretty major life decisions to be made possibly in the next few days. Pretty calm about it because my back hurts.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-19 00:02:57	@LePetiteNYC that is the real question. Haha.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-16 03:00:13	She is mean to me but it's my fault of course.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-15 12:03:07	At a club and feeling awkward. Blech.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-13 17:25:29	@nejireta_ki right now I have insomnia. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-13 04:01:18	What if I am not really bipolar. Then i have no excuse for my behavior.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-11 11:22:40	Always told to stop preparing for the worst. That time that I don't ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-11 11:21:48	And after today, I feel even stronger that I should not have moved.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-10 11:33:40	Haven't gotten a good nights sleep since I got here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-10 11:32:27	"@LePetiteNYC: You can look but don't touch" awwww....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-10 11:28:31	Panicking a little. Feel like I never should have moved.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-07 22:25:02	@bip0larschiz0 had fun, but not as much as I would have once upon a time. Drank less because I knew I had stuff to do today. Ha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-07 14:31:44	Lesson; recovery for a #bipolar means accepting that life will not be as intensely exciting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-07 07:53:24	Going to a dance club. This should be interesting. ...or not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-04 18:45:27	@xChasing_Carsx cause when I was on meds they just kept me up. Now I am only left with the old man excuse. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-04 06:00:46	@xChasing_Carsx I wish I had the meds excuse. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-04 04:13:25	Me too @xChasing_Carsx: I have actually now got into a routine of having a late afternoon nap
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-03 19:39:52	@Libertasbpd I am always glad to listen. I have issues of my own. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-03 10:18:43	My mind won't let it go until my body just drops off.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-03 10:15:48	@Libertasbpd just say what you want. you'd be very surprised at what people can relate to. what you might think is shocking isn't to others
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-03 10:09:55	Feeling sick but can't get myself off this damn phone to go to bed. Sometimes it is pretty obvious there is something wrong with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-02 10:31:16	Don't start my new job for 4 weeks. Arghhhhj.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-02 10:30:17	Maybe it's because I am no longer a southerner. Living this close to NYC makes me nervous. Lol.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-06-02 10:29:37	Took a selfie and looked so damn tired. So why can't I sleep?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-25 01:53:50	So I guess I am passing the test. Haven't really lost it at all and so far this is hellish. However it isn't close to over.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-24 11:23:21	Someone cheer me up. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-24 11:23:06	I am so tired. All my energy is being directed at NOT yelling at my movers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-20 22:42:13	And the movers are here packing all my stuff. Moving north. Well north of here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-19 10:00:41	@weswroten I have not had those kinds before.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-19 09:58:07	Years of depression. A month of hypomania. Now the downward spiral. I need someone to save me cause I don't know how I can do it myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-19 09:56:07	I am having cravings.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-19 09:55:17	@weswroten @LePetiteNYC it's not that long a drive and there is plenty of parking on the weekend, just avoid the tourist sections.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-19 09:53:51	And i threw another temper tantrum. I can't help it when I am feeling ignored.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-18 04:44:57	Hilarious NYC Survival Guide I Wish Every Tourist Would Read via @bigappledny while thinking of @LePetiteNYC
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-18 04:39:07	#bipolar isn't as much about highs and lows as it is about unstable emotions and the struggle for control nearly all the time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-18 04:38:01	Supposedly people are coming at 7. I will be drunk by then. And dinner burnt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-18 04:32:16	At least I can drink my sangria on the patio.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-18 04:25:32	And no one came to my goodbye party. ..
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-18 03:39:37	I am not hypomanic anymore. And I'm afraid it isn't coming back. At least not today. And I really needed to be sociable tonight. Damn.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-18 03:30:02	Sometimes I feel that it's not that people don't like me but that they actively dislike me. Wish it was paranoia but it's not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-18 00:56:39	Been riding high for weeks. Now, when we are throwing a goodbye party before we move, my mood is plummeting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-16 21:22:37	@sam_stone152 it is also possible to drink a gallon of milk all at once, as well as a spoonful of cinnamon.but then why??? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-16 21:09:16	@sam_stone152 except it isn't true. thin enough paper can, and has been, folded 12 times even.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-16 05:16:08	@nejireta_ki that is sweet. Then how about I wish I had a LOT more. Like you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-16 05:03:31	@nejireta_ki Very nice. I do not have an artistic bone in my body.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-15 23:27:58	Moving North in 8 days. Wow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-15 23:27:11	@nejireta_ki sounds exciting! may I ask what you do?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-09 00:54:47	@ybnormal622 better than i have been in awhile.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-08 22:22:53	crazy times. moving in 2 weeks. and now may need to buy a car too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-07 23:53:28	@fightingfalling start by dropping the guilt. You have a problem. It won't get better if you blame yourself when you stumble.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-07 22:59:23	I have more than 2 weeks to kill and not enough to do. Then all hell breaks loose.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-07 22:58:13	@nejireta_ki which is why the 2 of you belong apart. your partner needs to make you stronger.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-07 22:57:29	@nejireta_ki didn't end well for me. kept wanting more, can't recall what more I wanted now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-07 22:56:47	@nejireta_ki its a symptom I think. I did that for a year, living off some money I inherited and some I won at the casino.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-03 06:04:17	I need to stop trying. " @NoFibro : Quote: “It is impossible to defeat an ignorant man in an argument.” William G. McAdoo"
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-02 04:37:09	There really are never enough parties.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-02 00:34:36	so long and thanks for all the fish...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-02 00:01:43	Okay. Have nothing to do. Tdoc told me not to buy any boats.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-01 22:08:02	@nejireta_ki thank you!!!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-01 22:07:07	The joy rush just hit me. I am ready to go take care of business!!!!!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-01 21:49:47	@nejireta_ki thanks! If nothing else, I will be less bored. New stuff to do. New job. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-01 21:47:51	@nejireta_ki yes it is. I've been quite UP since the house went on the market.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-01 21:47:11	@nejireta_ki yes. I have gotten a few concessions from her. And they ought to work. If not she concedes its over.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-01 21:43:37	@nejireta_ki yup. Hopefully under contract soon. Excited for the change. Badly needed change. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-01 20:52:14	@ms_molly_vog I just got called "honey" by a woman I work with. Should I be insulted.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-01 10:31:21	Moving north really soon. Hypomania triggered.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-05-01 10:26:26	I don't feel guilty for having good things that others do not have. They don't feel guilty that they don't suffer from #bipolar like I do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-29 20:31:24	Oh twitter. Sometime you make facebook look entertaining.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-29 10:56:52	@SageSilk I say what I people expect me to say on facebook. I say what I really think on twitter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-29 10:52:32	Laying in bed. In case anyone wants to say goodnight. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-29 10:51:57	Fell asleep last night despite rapid finger tapping. Feel a little more relaxed tonight so prolly will have insomnia. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-29 04:42:35	@ms_molly_vog I work for female lawyers that bill $600/ hr.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-29 04:40:56	@ms_molly_vog I do pay attention. But I won't tweet if you only want positive reaffirmation of your opinion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-29 04:39:53	@ms_molly_vog we live in different worlds. Women have loads of power in mine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-29 04:02:21	@ms_molly_vog it's easy to only see the negative if that is what you expect to see.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-29 01:21:56	@ms_molly_vog men use diminutives always with each other and not necessarily to be derogatory.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-28 22:02:33	Son stopped seeing the little green aliens after his zoloft was increased. Odd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-28 03:28:57	People fall into 3 categories. Those who take advantage, their victims, and those who believe that people are inherently good. Think on that
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-27 21:08:32	@Were_Horse but even so, if symptoms are dramatic, meds are useful to get past that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-27 21:07:59	@Were_Horse okay. Sorry. Some of your blog posts lately gave me the impression that you had been in recently..
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-27 21:07:23	@Were_Horse don't be afraid to say you are sick. I never wanted the label but it makes it easier to stop blaming myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-27 21:05:32	@Were_Horse following a hospitalization, then yes. If you want to come off, back off dosage so you can see the effect without losing control
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-27 21:04:19	@Were_Horse the benefits compensate for the effect is always a good question. In the short term, when the problem is acute, such as
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-27 21:03:32	@Were_Horse why aren't yoy?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-27 21:03:25	@Were_Horse if you can't control your behavior, then"illness" is as good a model as any. If you think you can control yourself, then ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-27 20:53:13	@Were_Horse it doesn't have to be forever but it sounds like they are important now. You would take them for a physical illness.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-27 09:09:25	That feeling when you are hypomanic and waiting until it is time to go out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-27 09:06:56	Every piece of advice ever given is going to be wrong to at least someone. That is why you should only try to help people you know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-26 22:56:32	Ever notice how the people that complain the most about other people usually have even more issues than those they complain about?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-26 02:49:11	@Were_Horse my house is the same and i always hated that. I like your way of thinking about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-25 23:50:31	@nejireta_ki you just have all the luck. :p lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-25 11:37:11	Same complaints as before ... If anyone is keeping track.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-25 07:33:41	@nejireta_ki I suppose. But I don't make friends and I don't have any to help me make new ones. It's just an awful place to start from.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-25 06:34:15	@nejireta_ki I have been pretty convinced that I will be more unhappy alone and away from my kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-25 06:33:33	@nejireta_ki true
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-24 23:16:25	@ybnormal622 my son says he does it because he is hungry, maybe this is the real reason. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-24 21:28:18	@nejireta_ki this has been in very slow descent for lime 10 years. Ugh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-24 21:27:05	@nejireta_ki lol. This is private.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-24 09:57:51	@teenwithbipolar it changes quite a bit with age. Easier to control.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-24 04:52:16	When I am depressed I don't care how she treats me, and when I am hypomanic, I don't trust my judgment. #dilemma
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 22:01:12	According to Facebook, science is a religion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 10:44:58	Nobody listens to me. My wife and my parents respond to me with things that have nothing to do with what I said. Wow I feel like shit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 10:42:54	@ReallyGoodIdea @ThinnerSpinster constant forgiveness eventually becomes life as a doormat.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 10:38:43	If we don't stand up for ourselves, women say we are unmanly. When we do, they say we are abusive. Women are evil.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 10:17:32	@ybnormal622 what if I am already dead inside?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 08:41:47	The Discover bar never fails to enlighten. Apparently it's #NationalSendYourManNudesDay . Who knew? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 08:36:52	@LePetiteNYC have a spoonful. Its good for you in moderation.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 08:32:35	@ThinnerSpinster I am not going to do anything stupid. The worst that could happen is I end my marriage. That might be good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 08:31:55	@ThinnerSpinster it's just a phase. It'll pass soon enough. Just want to keep self aware so I don't take things too seriously.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 08:30:03	@ThinnerSpinster no. Why?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 08:29:11	@ThinnerSpinster been depressed for so long until recently I don't recall much else.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 08:13:19	I am getting a little paranoid. It's been awhile. Can anyone remind me what symptoms come next?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 07:54:24	@ThinnerSpinster thanks. But I really am just looking for a fight. I need to get it out. It's like a poison.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 07:52:17	@ThinnerSpinster not when I am this angry. I am shaking and feeling sick from it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 07:17:38	Even the cats are avoiding me. I must be mad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 07:16:58	Life is throwing the damn lemons at me today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 07:10:01	@ThinnerSpinster thanks. Nevertheless I should hide my phone from myself. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 06:35:20	I should not be allowed on the Internet when I am in as bad a mood as I am now. I lose so called friends by the dozen.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 05:08:23	@ybnormal622 i feel like leaving would be the same
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 03:01:59	How do you know when it's really the end of your marriage?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 02:53:18	Example of problem: I compliment her. She gets mad thinking it's an insult.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 02:52:20	Very trite dilemma I know but I only have 140 chars to explain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 02:51:29	Dilemma: stay and be miserable or leave and be alone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 02:40:54	I don't have the energy or desire to make it work. She has lost her mind and I am the enemy again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-23 01:46:59	I quit
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-22 22:18:25	@LePetiteNYC it's a god start. If you put on some muscle you might like the way you look even if the scale #makes you uncomfortable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-22 21:21:18	@LePetiteNYC it's good to join. Gaining weight should include muscle. She probably has you eating a lot of protein too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-22 21:04:43	@LePetiteNYC lol. Did nutritionist recommend any workouts?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-22 20:58:46	@LePetiteNYC treadmill won't build muscle. You should lift weights. Real weights. And no cardiovascular then.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-22 20:54:47	@LePetiteNYC treadmill is always borring. Lift weights, take a dance class, do yoga.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-22 06:22:17	@LePetiteNYC can those count towards your nutrition plan???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-22 06:21:19	@Anonynay pretty sprightly 93 yo for all the trouble she gives you. Try to at least enjoy the food. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-22 06:08:31	@Anonynay its okay, my wife complains when I don't make dinner, as she works longer hours than me. fair complaint i think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-22 06:03:58	@Anonynay you sound like a guy. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 11:13:03	I guess some people get what they deserve.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 10:46:49	Cats and music and being alone are the best ways for me to calm down.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 10:32:23	I haven't hurt anyone In years. Of course no one wants to be close to me anymore. So that helps.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 10:26:37	I am simmering.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 10:01:02	The world really does keep telling me it doesn't care. I am stubborn and keep asking but it turns it's back a little more each time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 10:00:20	I really just want anyone to give a damn. And whenever I reach out I get a response that makes me feel worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 09:58:08	So I don't care how I feel either. I can't make it better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 09:57:39	No one gives a shit how the guy feels. Guys don't have any right? And we are always the abusers. Not the sweet little girl. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 09:56:55	Don't care enough about myself to stand up for myself. Won't make it better anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 09:55:13	I'm sleepy tired. But what's the difference. I am not looking forward to anything.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 09:27:13	Death that is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 09:27:00	So weird how one day I can dread it and another crave it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 09:26:04	Two people would feel bad for more than a few days if I died.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 09:23:33	I know I should say no. But it's hard when she's ready to go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 08:57:55	If she says anything else, this could be it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-21 08:18:12	I am so used to being hurt that I don't notice it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-20 12:40:49	@LePetiteNYC what would you prefer to be played with?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-20 12:39:34	Is it possible for bipolar to go away as you get older?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-20 01:56:05	@LePetiteNYC run until you have no energy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-19 12:53:37	Face reality and make the most of what you do have. If it isn't enough, maybe it's time to move on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-19 12:52:41	Don't live a miserable existence expecting it will get better one day. A day which never comes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-19 12:52:00	It's not politically correct to say this and it will upset some of you. But I believe in honesty not empty affirmations.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-19 12:51:05	Unless you are young, the possibility of significant positive change is minimal. Can only lower expectations.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-19 12:49:30	I don't understand why some people keep going at all. Life is so miserable to most. There really is no positive spin.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-19 12:48:30	The effort existence takes isn't worth it. Even when I am not depressed. Only irrational hope keeps me going.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-19 12:42:42	If your ex is mean to you, maybe you mistreated him first. Us guys have feelings too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-19 10:19:18	Worst headache in years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-19 00:08:29	Can't remember the last time I had had a headache at work. Long day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-19 00:02:20	@Libertasbpd my wife says that the mothers brain cells are taken by the fetus.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-18 20:46:09	There are people I have known my whole life that no matter how I try, I still hate them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-18 09:37:04	@LePetiteNYC don't mind at all. It's very cute
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-18 09:35:49	@LePetiteNYC its NY, do you have to ask? or do you really want to know?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-18 09:32:58	@LePetiteNYC trying to decide on an exercise program, but its not like there is a big difference in the choices.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-18 09:32:16	@LePetiteNYC hahahaha. i only have white and black socks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-18 09:24:07	like not even important enough to be a first world problem. More like a me problem.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-18 09:23:39	did I mention that the thing I am worrying about isn't important?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-18 09:23:09	not so good things happened today also, but I barely remember them cause I am not thinking about that again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-18 09:22:21	Instead of doing work, I spent the whole day worrying about something that I decided not to change. I think I decided. Ugh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-18 09:17:04	@ybnormal622 my wife does that. helped her headaches and all the noise she would make while sleeping.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-18 02:23:22	My mind is racing so much I hadn't noticed until now what a bad day this has been.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-17 09:19:45	My 12 yo son says he is hearing voices and seeing little green aliens. I have no psychoses, so I am not sure what to think or do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-16 10:07:39	I remember being in AA and being told that I wasn't an alcoholic. I now understand that the things I said weren't genuine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-15 11:36:51	@LePetiteNYC perfect is boring.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-14 09:57:48	@weswroten if it did feel right, that would probably feel wrong?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-14 09:52:54	Nothing feels right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-14 09:25:23	@neiltyson That's it. You go watch yourself on TV. That isn't the least bit narcissistic. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-14 04:28:38	@MariesVoicexoxo reinstall. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-14 04:28:08	When reaching a conclusion, people make a lot of unjustified assumptions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-14 03:13:09	Mental illness is not caused by a virus or bacteria. It is a collection of symptoms that have been given a label by a big book.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-14 03:11:31	Why do we personify our mental illness? #twitterpsychward
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-13 06:41:40	@Health_Shmi and then take it down with cool judo moves and break it's arm with an armbar.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-13 06:23:52	@LePetiteNYC it once took me over 30 minutes to drive around the block in midtown.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-13 06:22:09	I really do not enjoy my father's visits.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-13 05:56:22	When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Then throw it in life's face.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-13 02:02:36	Extremely agitated. No reason of course.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-13 01:25:13	@ThinnerSpinster thank you. I appreciate it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-13 01:24:59	@ThinnerSpinster the comment about getting out of bed was actually me being a wiseass.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-13 01:23:47	@ThinnerSpinster miserable is new. I felt fine an hour ago. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-13 01:17:02	I am truly crazy. Locked in my room feeling miserable and alone while avoiding friends downstairs for no good reason.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 23:41:19	@ThinnerSpinster I'm sorry
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 23:35:53	@ThinnerSpinster ex husband?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 23:06:40	@ThinnerSpinster lol. Feel fine. Just hate everyone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 22:50:09	It's really not a major accomplisment just getting out of bed, so why bother.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 22:47:56	@LePetiteNYC yes. Lol.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 09:40:44	Sometimes a cat is all the reason you need to live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 09:38:11	@LePetiteNYC if we were smart we'd just all stay in bed. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 09:37:47	@LePetiteNYC everything is fueled by idiocy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 09:36:00	@LePetiteNYC I wouldn't be surprised if some of these books were fueled by mania.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 09:33:44	Hate is the word that comes to mind. Undirected hate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 09:32:10	Stop writing books about how you survived bipolar. The only one you are helping is yourself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 08:58:21	The floor fell out under me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 08:49:16	It's my lot in life to be the one who is always shit upon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-12 01:01:09	Is it too early to drink sangria
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-11 09:41:50	@ybnormal622 BS in or BS is? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 21:59:36	@ybnormal622 then be you not who you are supposed to be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 10:30:45	really hate people, and hate is a strong word.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 10:30:22	feeling bitter and alone...even if reality doesn't comport with my feelings.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 10:23:22	bad bad bad mood
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 09:06:15	Please
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 09:06:07	Fuck me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 08:55:05	If only it was real...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 08:25:21	Pithy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 07:26:34	@LePetiteNYC I am moving to the mid - Atlantic. If I ever make it to NY, you got it!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 07:24:40	Who will go to the bars with me? I'm buying!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 07:24:11	Eating the alcoholic fruit...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 07:21:46	Of course I want to be f'ed too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 07:21:08	I want to be cherished. Does she even remember that part?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 05:32:01	@ybnormal622 start with the longer dark hair. if you want to change an outward image, there aren't a lot of piercings that will show.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-10 04:50:48	@ybnormal622 grow your hair and dye it black. Wear black nail polish and black clothes. Get an evil tattoo.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-09 09:49:49	@ThinnerSpinster could be a panic attack. Sometimes too many carbs can do that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-09 09:48:31	@bipolarvoice hi I'm bisexual and bipolar. Nice to meet you. Bi bi. :( People are jerks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-09 09:40:05	@bipolarvoice don't try to convince them. Believe what you say. If they are prejudiced, then they aren't for you. To hell with hypocrites!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-09 09:35:58	@bipolarvoice tell em you don't pick a side, you pick a person.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-09 09:28:23	@bipolarvoice bisexuals have it the worst. Their is prejudice from straights gays and lesbians.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-08 10:23:50	@ThinnerSpinster just don't allow her to hurt you. Accept that the relationship may have to be casual but keep in touch.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-08 09:01:15	@LePetiteNYC I used to knock umbrellas out of people's hands. NYers are so obnoxious with umbrellas.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-08 09:00:02	@LePetiteNYC build habits to last a lifetime.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-08 08:59:52	@LePetiteNYC as with any nutrition plan, it takes time. Work at improving a day at a time. Baby steps are fine. You are trying to...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-07 22:05:31	Mood could go either way today. Coping well with negatives outside my control but a few more could be too much.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-07 06:05:40	@DailyBipolar haha. Good luck!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-07 05:20:34	@DailyBipolar not mine. I can only hope they move out before I die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-07 04:53:39	@ThinnerSpinster just started using voice recognition to tweet
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-07 04:51:33	oooo voice tweeting
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-07 04:50:54	What do I want for dinner tonight
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-07 04:50:17	I need more mania just to keep up with my kids. Children are certainly a species of energy vampire.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 20:10:07	Kids leaving today for for a week. Considering their behavior the last 24 hours, I am not that sad anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 06:26:21	@ThinnerSpinster probably. That is like him. He has blown off his friends now that we are moving. He is being bad now that he is leaving.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 06:23:12	@ThinnerSpinster cant. He is being punished and stay in his room. He has already blown through about 5 extra chances.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 06:21:27	@ThinnerSpinster yeah. But I still feel lousy. I wanted to have a good day with them and it has been anything but that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 06:17:18	@ThinnerSpinster I just don't want him going while mad at me. I've never been apart from him this long.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 06:15:48	@ThinnerSpinster almost 10. Going with his 12 yo brother.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 06:15:06	@ThinnerSpinster awful stories about bad things in planes. And me not being with them
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 06:14:32	@ThinnerSpinster doesn't want to do his chores. Lied about them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 06:13:01	@ThinnerSpinster on a plane to visit my dad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 06:08:28	My son is being so difficult. And he is going away tomorrow. And I am telling myself awful stories...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 06:07:19	@ThinnerSpinster you didnt. I really want to say something useful. But I can't think of a anything.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-06 03:25:39	@ThinnerSpinster I don't know what to say to everything you are posting. I feel so bad seeing how hard a time you are having. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-05 21:24:43	@ThinnerSpinster no not okay. But I usually like to understand at least.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-05 21:23:58	@pinguinokx @rockyhorrorau nice. I haven't seen the play in 20 years. Last time meatloaf was a special performer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-05 12:53:54	@ThinnerSpinster the girl he ignored you for? At least it explains some that a little?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-05 12:52:43	@pinguinokx @rockyhorrorau movie or play?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-05 12:51:59	A bit drunk. Fun night. Some lady I barely knew kissed me. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-05 05:25:48	@oxymoronic82 agreed. More honesty please. We are not idiots.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-04 22:10:42	Is this retweet friday? I had better avoid twitter today
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-04 09:45:35	@weswroten the Mother apparently. As I said I don't watch the show.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-04 09:30:39	@weswroten lol. Tracy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-04 09:25:38	@weswroten oh yeah. Grading exams earlier. Omg.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-04 09:19:31	@LePetiteNYC i'll gladly take the coaster. been down so long, and i'd only been "up" maybe a week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-04 09:18:49	@weswroten i think it was watching the series finale of HYIMYM, a show I never watched except for a few episodes when I was sick 2 years ago
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-04 09:10:42	@LePetiteNYC i was doing so well...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-04 09:09:04	Mood crash.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-04 09:07:15	@ThinnerSpinster be careful. Talk to your doctor about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-04 08:24:39	@ThinnerSpinster when I went off it, I became suicidal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-03 09:50:52	@LePetiteNYC then you should be at least 10 degrees further south.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 23:44:10	@ThinnerSpinster crossed! Happy birthday!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 23:41:22	@bipolarmedfree depends what you define as a full time job. Could be anywhere between 1 and 6 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 11:55:18	@nejireta_ki gather it up and stick it on his pillow. Then see if he notices it. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 11:51:25	Goodnight moon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 11:51:04	@nejireta_ki oh well. So much for that theory. I matured a bit at 40. But I agree that dust is bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 11:46:00	@nejireta_ki men don't grow up until 40.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 11:40:40	@ThinnerSpinster well i do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 11:40:29	@ThinnerSpinster that is just mean.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 11:39:56	@ThinnerSpinster has anyone said that? I find people often don't respond when I am at my most miserable. They may just not know what to say.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 11:30:34	@ThinnerSpinster try to focus on the good parts of the trip.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 11:08:36	@ThinnerSpinster not at all. Mom's are people too. Kids need to respect their parents. You'd think thinks soldier would know respect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 11:05:40	@LePetiteNYC me too. Whatever I choose it is wrong.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 10:22:42	@nejireta_ki all the women dance. Wish I was a dancer. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 06:45:45	@ybnormal622 I'll buy you a little laser to chase. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 05:23:37	@ybnormal622 literally run in circles? Like a cat chasing it's tail? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 05:22:48	@LePetiteNYC that I understand!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 04:23:37	@LePetiteNYC I knew I could never understand women. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 04:13:14	That was a serious question.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-04-01 04:13:00	What do you do in a manic phase if you have nothing to do?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-31 20:43:19	@LePetiteNYC it was freezing overnight here, and will reach 75. What the hell do I wear?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-31 07:40:00	I am so tired. Not ready for work. The commute is painful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-31 05:13:42	@ThinnerSpinster yay! I am glad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 12:41:45	Goodnight noises everywhere...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 12:34:21	Saturday night used to be the time when the world proved to me how awesome I was. I guess it does doesn't think of me that way anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 12:22:58	Moving will either save me or be my ultimate destruction. Just as long as it's not more of the same...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 12:21:32	@LePetiteNYC what if I piss you off??? ;p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 12:14:13	I am actually looking forward to moving back north. It's been such a long time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 10:12:02	@BipolarSanity it was fantastic!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 09:23:44	2 inch thick ribeye, over 22 oz. Homemade thick steak fries. Cabernet. It's what's for dinner. Yum!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 07:52:32	@MariesVoicexoxo and they are good for lazy people like me :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 07:51:36	@ThinnerSpinster he is a kid. Sorry he is being such a jerk.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 07:45:18	@ThinnerSpinster and he loves you whether he is willing to show it or not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 07:41:54	@ThinnerSpinster I am sorry. Relationships between parents and kids are so tough.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 07:41:04	What do normal people do with their time. I have to much of It and nothing I want to do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 07:37:16	@MariesVoicexoxo you are completely right, except it's spelled C-A-T-S. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 06:23:01	i hate people who have an excuse for everything, and i hate them worse when they have a good excuse for everything.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-30 03:20:25	@ThinnerSpinster oh that sounds awful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 21:20:46	@LePetiteNYC water is taking too long to boil for my tea. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:47:59	@Fairlyodddannie that's tegretol right? Was on that once years ago. Don't remember much. Dr took me off after 8 mos.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:42:57	@Fairlyodddannie I am crazy sensitive to meds. So I am not sure I want to try anything else now that I am stable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:42:08	@Fairlyodddannie lithium worked great for about 6 months and then i got awful effects after taking 1 ritalin. Q knocks me out cold.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:36:15	@Fairlyodddannie I've never been like this. Always manic more than depressed. Guess it's payback time. Haha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:34:46	@Fairlyodddannie I was on lamictal but it made me very anxious. I am med free and stable, just on the down side unfortunately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:30:25	@Fairlyodddannie manic can be a lot of fun. But it's been so long I prolly forget the bad stuff.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:29:56	@Fairlyodddannie I have been trying to go manic for a year. Been low for much too long. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:27:56	@Fairlyodddannie lol. Not supposed to get high from the legal meds. :) my Dr gets med when I tell him I stay up on ambien.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:24:12	@Fairlyodddannie haha. My wife had those on effexor I think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:16:30	@Fairlyodddannie and when the withdrawal hit I didn't know what was wrong with me for another week. By then I just went cold turkey. Ugh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:15:20	@Fairlyodddannie that is great! my doc put on a high dose and didn't tell me anything. After maybe 1.5 years, I didn't take it for a week...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:06:05	@Fairlyodddannie it's calming without drugging but it's extremely addictive. Withdrawal is awful. Take as little as possible.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 07:03:12	@Fairlyodddannie lithium is good of it works for you. Too bad you need both. Q is better than xanax though. Latter is too addictive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 06:56:33	@Fairlyodddannie don't blame you for taking a drug holiday.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 06:56:19	@Fairlyodddannie oh I feel for you. Being medicated/drugged and having to really take care of others is very hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 06:51:26	@Fairlyodddannie 7 years? Wow. I was on mellaril when I was younger for 5 years. Was in a haze the whole time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 06:29:43	I am spent.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 06:25:36	What do I want for dinner?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 06:24:54	@oxymoronic82 me. Just pay my way to you and I'll carry you 2 anywhere you want!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 06:23:50	@Fairlyodddannie really? Lol. That stuff is such a sedative to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 06:21:59	I have become quite Vulcan at times but I cope better with my emotions than I ever have.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 06:20:30	Caught up on all my recorded shows. Feeling accomplished but sad as well. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 05:50:36	@ThinnerSpinster I don't know the funeral part is a lie. But it is part of the whole story which is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 05:44:54	@ThinnerSpinster attendance and a funeral.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 05:44:40	@ThinnerSpinster it wasn't the subject matter but the sneaky way she went about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 05:19:00	I am so aggravated now. Dam little shit. And it's always the girls who lie like this too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-29 04:41:21	Eh I baited a student. Knew she was lying but played dumb and let her bury herself deeper. I should be nicer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-28 22:09:56	@bipolarvoice you are correct that you are the only one who knows how you feel and they try to diagnose in 1 session which is absurd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-28 22:09:20	@bipolarvoice good luck. I've been there. It's hard to know if you or they are right. Mental illness makes it hard to be rational, but...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-28 21:03:45	Sick and tired of being sick and tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-28 10:16:16	@ThinnerSpinster goodnight air
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-28 09:01:57	Damn auto correct on my phone. I should turn it off but I am such a lazy fuck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-28 08:51:17	I do my give a shit about dogs, or cancer, or working moms. I care about getting my shit straight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-28 08:49:30	Just stop preaching. Everyone is a fucking preacher on a soapbox. Fix the shit in your house and stop complaining about everyone else.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-28 08:12:42	Oh the self righteous bull that is all over fb. Posting this shit doesn't make up for being a selfish bastard all day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-28 07:57:45	Way too many dogs on my Facebook page.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-28 06:04:03	@ThinnerSpinster buy clothes there or just wear the same thing the whole time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-27 09:25:53	@ThinnerSpinster sorry i was driving. math job with a big agency.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-27 08:59:56	@ThinnerSpinster very cool. I have a pretty decent government job lined up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-27 08:58:38	@ThinnerSpinster awesome. It's a turn on for me when I am for someone else. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-27 08:57:57	@ThinnerSpinster lol. I do better at school than work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-27 08:56:56	@ThinnerSpinster juris doctor. It's a law degree. I was a lawyer before I got my phd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-27 06:48:52	@ThinnerSpinster he isn't me. ;p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-27 04:21:06	I will never believe people who complain about income disparity aren't just jealous.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 21:05:01	@LePetiteNYC enjoy! Wish I could!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 20:49:48	@LePetiteNYC dread going back to work the next day? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 20:37:12	@ybnormal622 lol. Yeah. Mine are all finally past the age where you wonder if they are still breathing. Quiet usually means computer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 08:06:29	@ThinnerSpinster so lonh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 08:05:13	@ThinnerSpinster lol. Have fun. I used to watch American Idol but it stopped being fun when Simon left.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 08:02:31	@ThinnerSpinster so what. He knows how to shoot to kill. What can a little weed do?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 08:01:33	@ThinnerSpinster his friends told him...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 07:57:53	@ThinnerSpinster mom the hippie...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 07:56:32	@ThinnerSpinster never? Wow. I hear there are serious lines. Haha.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 07:50:09	@ThinnerSpinster I'll survive. Motivate me to go out more. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 07:44:32	@ThinnerSpinster ugh. Not for me. Woke up with a sore throat. Came down to make lunch and got nauseous.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 07:42:29	@ThinnerSpinster inside of my house is being painted.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 07:26:43	@ThinnerSpinster haha. I am sick off of paint fumes today!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-26 04:42:09	@ybnormal622 you left out kids, they make noise. even when they aren't making noise.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-25 10:36:32	Felt normal today. Weird. Guess my episode didn't last long enough to be an episode. I just need a little push and I'll be back there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-25 04:43:56	It's cool nowadays to be an introvert. I say make it cool to be negative.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-25 04:35:34	@ybnormal622 that was the word I was looking for. I hate perky.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-25 04:35:00	@ybnormal622 is that one of those hairy northern guys?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-25 04:33:19	@ybnormal622 idk but I am gonna start practicing...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-25 04:16:08	I get annoyed by such petty things...like people being positive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-25 04:14:27	@ybnormal622 thought I read that it was thought to be of some advantage to hunters once upon a time?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-24 10:21:28	Goodnight moon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-24 05:58:03	@ThinnerSpinster huh? I didn't see your blog. I was talking about Facebook and how people say things that they think make them look good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-24 05:13:14	@ThinnerSpinster anything I can do for you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-24 04:28:42	This is not a drill this time. The train has left the station. The pressure is building up. Mania is really coming.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-24 04:27:31	Depression is why I can't make new friends. Mania is why I can't keep the friends I have.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-24 03:44:03	Of course I am not giving her attention. Once I do, she stops being nice. I've played this game a lot.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-24 01:41:24	@ThinnerSpinster public relations
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 23:54:00	People are so full of shit. We are living in the PR generation.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 23:52:26	@ybnormal622 that doesn't sound like a lie.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 22:40:00	@Jennka1 isn't it just awful when your friends and family want to see you. Stay away!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 22:37:41	What lies do you tell yourself to get through the workday? How much you love helping people?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 22:15:09	Wonder how long I can fake being asleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 21:40:36	I am truly not blessed. Goddammit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 15:48:43	@LePetiteNYC i hope so. Otherwise no room for actual food today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 15:47:15	Nearly 4am. Touch of actual mania tonight. Long time gone. And a strong desire to confess.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 14:07:49	@outfromthedark i suppose the perspective for men and women are different.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 14:05:42	@ThinnerSpinster you know I love you. ;P
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 10:17:02	@ThinnerSpinster I am not even sure who sings it but I really relate to the lyrics.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 09:47:51	@ThinnerSpinster yes..... ?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 09:47:31	@ThinnerSpinster careful or my next adventure will be to drive to you! Then you won't be a stranger. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 09:46:36	@ThinnerSpinster yes. I'll be satisfied if I just don't get shy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 09:45:44	@ThinnerSpinster only kinda... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 09:44:49	@ThinnerSpinster haha. You said stamina... hehehe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 09:44:24	@ThinnerSpinster and if that goes well. Anything goes. Let my manic fly!!!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 09:43:55	@ThinnerSpinster and I intend to talk to strangers. At least that is the plan.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 09:43:27	@ThinnerSpinster well i am gonna go out tonight at 11 despite being tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 09:41:55	I am going to do things I otherwise wouldnt. Well things I would once but not lately. That is my resolution.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 09:04:58	I may go out after all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 08:38:31	@ThinnerSpinster I don't mean anything by it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 08:26:18	@ThinnerSpinster I am particular to cats. I can't help but feel for them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 08:22:17	@ThinnerSpinster maybe? But being physically sick is way beyond your control.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 08:21:13	@ThinnerSpinster too bad. For both of you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 08:19:59	@ThinnerSpinster mine would not be happy at all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 08:15:30	At least I have my cats. ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 08:13:55	I think I give up. As usual.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 08:04:03	@ThinnerSpinster maybe. I am just frozen so to speak. Afraid to do anything because I am certain to make a mistake.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 08:03:13	The usual weekend problem. Feel like I HAVE to go somewhere buy nowhere to go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 08:01:43	@ThinnerSpinster sounds about right. Except I don't function on lonely. At all. Never have.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:56:47	@ThinnerSpinster coming home is sucking the charm out of me it feels like.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:53:36	My house (and spouse) is a black hole. An emotional vampire so to speak.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:48:30	@ThinnerSpinster yes. But I have my kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:46:03	@ThinnerSpinster no but I will be alone. I don't do alone well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:44:58	@ThinnerSpinster yeah I am too much of a coward to leave her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:43:42	@ThinnerSpinster that is why I would be jealous. Get rid of my Bitchy wife and I'd steal you away...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:41:42	@ThinnerSpinster ohh. Now I am gonna have to be jealous of this pof guy, if you are gonna be that nice to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:28:01	I so wish I had a party to go to. I am in just the perfect mood. I would be stellar!!!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:26:41	@ThinnerSpinster oh then you'll never make it to nekkid. Unless he is into corpses.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:23:13	@ThinnerSpinster what are you gonna do when he wants to meet? And when he wants to kiss you...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:19:50	@bipolarvoice sounds like my relationship with my wife. I am sorry to hear you are going through this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:13:30	@ThinnerSpinster there is so much of me to love.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:10:21	@ThinnerSpinster sigh. Have I told you I have long hair?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:07:42	@ThinnerSpinster haha. I really was kidding. Not that I'm not sexy. I should shaddup now...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:05:12	@ThinnerSpinster shorty or Mr genius? Hmmm. How bout sexy? Lol. J/k
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:02:48	@ThinnerSpinster but not as tall as you...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:02:37	@ThinnerSpinster and handsome and smart. But loud... ;p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:01:41	@ThinnerSpinster it's not that complicated. Guys just like having someone to talk to. We can be lonely too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 07:00:30	@ThinnerSpinster then you definitely wouldn't like me. I talk loud. And being bipolar I get upset.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:57:58	@ThinnerSpinster didn't know that is what it took to "catch" a woman.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:56:18	@ThinnerSpinster it seems like a weird thing to put in a profile.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:55:50	@ThinnerSpinster haha. You mean on pof or here?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:54:48	@ThinnerSpinster how do you know he never yells in person?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:51:04	@ThinnerSpinster haha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:50:01	@ThinnerSpinster do you like this guy or do you just want him to like you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:48:40	@ThinnerSpinster of course it is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:48:13	@ThinnerSpinster stop being so self conscious. If you assume you are failing then you will. Self fulfilling prophecy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:46:17	@ThinnerSpinster well you are being cute to me. "Nopers" "shaddup" etc
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:40:39	@ThinnerSpinster not wrong at all. Quite cute.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:39:27	@ThinnerSpinster you are very amusing tonight. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:38:26	@ThinnerSpinster okay. Looked it up. Never heard it before. And not my fave nickname btw...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:36:52	@ThinnerSpinster not sure what that means but it sounds funny.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:35:22	@ThinnerSpinster not sure how that would be taken. Isn't plenty of fish a xtian site?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 06:33:29	@ThinnerSpinster if you are smart, it'll make me scream! ;p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 05:29:55	@outfromthedark haha. Maybe I'll make pina coladas instead tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 05:29:14	@outfromthedark ah to be a woman... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 04:54:05	@outfromthedark if you have to start over, best to pick a place you want to be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 04:53:07	@outfromthedark but do you feel more peaceful?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 04:49:16	@outfromthedark sounds nice to be near the ocean.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 04:46:21	@outfromthedark nice vacay!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 04:42:11	@outfromthedark i need a nicer deck. That sounds great.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 04:40:54	It's not even 5 and I am already resigned to being bored until midnight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 04:38:48	@outfromthedark maybe I should drink more then?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 04:17:00	Where I live is so boring.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 02:47:47	I am finding things much funnier than usual lately. Hope this is a good sign.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-23 02:33:57	women fight using the principle of attrition. they don't have to be right, but you will give in before they do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 23:37:47	@ybnormal622 80 degrees huh?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 23:32:57	@ybnormal622 haha. You mean it gets warm up there?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 12:04:43	@LePetiteNYC party animal will have to be more literal tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 10:22:48	@nejireta_ki but it's done. Don't punish yourself any worse than you already have.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 10:13:29	@nejireta_ki don't blame yourself. I doubt everyone else was an innocent party. You were hurt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 09:44:46	@ybnormal622 yeah. Not the same from a bottle. Not real sangria. Michigan is way too white. Other colors are fun. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 09:42:48	@ybnormal622 i only drink wine and vodka.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 09:42:26	@ybnormal622 red wine, ginger ale, cut up fruit, a little sugar, and a shot of rum. At least that is how I make it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 09:39:45	@ybnormal622 lmao. No. I cut the fruit up first. It's sangria!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 09:34:29	@ybnormal622 i am eating the wine soaked apple. Yum.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 09:22:18	Okay I made a pitcher of sangria. Time to forget my problems.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 08:36:53	@ThinnerSpinster I sound handsome!!! Whatever that means.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 08:34:32	@ThinnerSpinster I am not bad looking either. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 08:31:58	@ThinnerSpinster I think one of these days you need to tell me more about this...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 08:31:27	@ThinnerSpinster hahaha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 08:28:36	@ThinnerSpinster or did you want me to whisper sweet math equations in your ear. ;) lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 08:28:08	@ThinnerSpinster don't start with that again...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 08:27:45	@ThinnerSpinster oh no. But with all those meds you won't last long.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 07:48:37	@ThinnerSpinster good night cinderalla...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 07:40:25	@ThinnerSpinster what is zyrtec?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 07:38:38	@ThinnerSpinster so you prolly won't be very chatty tonight?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 07:05:40	@ThinnerSpinster as good an excuse as any...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 07:03:56	@ThinnerSpinster haha. Don't make me jealous!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 04:49:10	The most unnatural thing is stasis, the failure to change.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 04:47:58	Somebody have a good strong drink for me tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-22 04:27:29	@nejireta_ki that is so awful. My heart goes out to you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:17:51	@ThinnerSpinster well sweet dreams then...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:15:52	@ThinnerSpinster well you can dream of me telling you math jokes or something, just let me know how I do...heheh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:13:31	@ThinnerSpinster my mind is totally mixing up these images. Sexy Buddhists reaching enlightenment, or at least infinity and beyond....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:10:15	@ThinnerSpinster I usually only do math during sex to last longer, but if it helps...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:08:52	@ThinnerSpinster do Buddhists have a heaven?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:08:14	@ThinnerSpinster with lots of weird math signs floating around the room!!!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:06:47	@ThinnerSpinster now I lay me down to sleep and pray to my crazy math friend my soul to keep...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:05:32	@ThinnerSpinster now I have to think of a prayer for you to say to me. Haha.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:05:01	@ThinnerSpinster It's a very laid back job and I am thankful for it because I can do it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:04:11	@ThinnerSpinster fine. I am a genius. I accept your worship. :p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:03:14	@ThinnerSpinster teaching college is not a job. And I only taught part time for most of that like 1 class a semester
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:02:35	@ThinnerSpinster and I am not one of those socially inept funny looking math guys either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:02:09	@ThinnerSpinster kind of irrelevant. I can do calculus but I can't keep a friend much less make one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 10:00:51	@ThinnerSpinster hope so. I've been teaching it for the last 9 years
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 09:59:36	@ThinnerSpinster haha. Callc is freshman year undergrad. I am ten years worth of math beyond that :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 09:57:44	@ThinnerSpinster no. I am a crazy bipolar who can't hold down a job so he spent most of his adult life in school.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 09:54:54	@ThinnerSpinster or I am dense and don't get the joke.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 09:53:32	@ThinnerSpinster yeah. A lot of talking. That is what the tongue is for.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 09:51:55	@ThinnerSpinster there is that tongue again. A part of you may remember sex after all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 09:50:39	@ThinnerSpinster yeah it did. Lol.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 09:48:22	@ThinnerSpinster it's when the stork delivers a present 9 months after you held hands with a boy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 09:24:23	@ybnormal622 hahahaha. Sorry, couldn't help it. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 09:23:31	According to twitter, humans are the root of all evil but inherently good and beautiful all at the same time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 09:05:49	How do I know when it's time for bed? The batteries in my phone die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 07:44:15	And now I just sit here and wait until I can go to bed. Then I can sit there and wait for morning.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 06:17:54	@LePetiteNYC that is the best you can do?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 05:56:11	I really can't control my cursing, and I don't make much effort anymore. Judge me...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 05:55:36	@LePetiteNYC if that is your current view, then you are laying down on the sidewalk on a major NYC street, which is quite the image. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 03:28:47	@ybnormal622 super walmart has everything here. Even super target doesn't have enough variety.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 01:22:34	@ybnormal622 normal people shop at Walmart here. Everyone shops at Walmart here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 01:00:57	@ybnormal622 if you saw how fat people are here, you wouldn't laugh. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 00:35:19	@ybnormal622 i guess you northerners are more health conscious than us!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-21 00:06:27	@ybnormal622 yes. They are everywhere down here. Not so many vitamin stores. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-20 23:36:50	@ybnormal622 i just like the original when it comes out of the oven hot.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-20 23:07:24	@ybnormal622 that is a huge sacrifice. Didn't know they sold them so far north. They are a Southern delicacy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-20 22:45:56	@ybnormal622 good for you! What is your nutrition plan?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-20 22:45:29	@ybnormal622 try it at least.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-20 22:45:18	@ybnormal622 yes. Swing, plank, rest, repeat.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-20 11:34:58	@ybnormal622 superset your swings with the planks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-20 11:31:06	Been nearly a month since I last took ambien. Insomnia is in hyperdrive. Think I am even having withdrawal symptoms.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-20 10:37:29	@ybnormal622 haha. Building up that core!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-20 04:39:02	@sam_stone152 my wife is much more moody than my cats. And my cats are far more affectionate. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-20 04:03:20	@ybnormal622 like you care. Actually I tend to bet against teams with rabid followings. The betting lines are skewed
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-20 01:18:01	I see the day coming. Backlash for all the hypocrisy on Facebook and the internet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-19 23:38:13	@BipolarJobbie eat alone then no one will talk to you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-19 23:23:20	@ybnormal622 lol. Sorry. Ask me about football. I am usually pretty good with that. Have made some money betting college.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-19 23:16:10	@ybnormal622 haha. Except I don't pay much attention to basketball when my team sucks, which they do this year. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-19 10:31:41	@ThinnerSpinster I doubt it. Our military has shrunk dramatically. We don't have the troop strength to engage a massive Russian army.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-19 10:29:03	@ThinnerSpinster and I'm not even depressed... :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-19 10:27:14	My narcissistic side is dead. Mania will never be the same.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-19 09:14:53	I am so sick of Netflix and stupid app games. I have no life. And worse I can't seem to get interested in getting one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-19 03:04:02	@ybnormal622 hang in there!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-18 04:28:00	Any other fellow bipolarites have their heart beat speed up when they lie down to rest?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-17 03:45:52	@ThinnerSpinster tell me about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-17 03:44:42	@ThinnerSpinster not worth it. She knows what she is doing. She admits that much. Just can't help it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-17 03:44:11	And considering my state of mind I will not make friends. And I am really bad alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-17 03:43:03	So what the hell I am supposed to do. The only thing that gives me any joy is my kids. So I am stuck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-17 03:35:32	I suppose I love her but I definitely don't like her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-16 23:46:48	@ThinnerSpinster I suppose. More anxiety too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-16 23:05:06	and work starts again tomorrow...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-16 22:56:49	@ThinnerSpinster you never know. And you talk to us enough anyways
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-16 22:49:58	@ThinnerSpinster we are still people. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-16 22:46:37	@ThinnerSpinster still being read. and its very open.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-16 22:34:01	@ThinnerSpinster wow. If you can write that, you are not so guarded. That is good. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-16 22:26:45	2 drinks and a splitting headache. I have become such a lightweight. Ugh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 23:11:02	@LePetiteNYC purrrr. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 23:04:33	I love the smell of cat. Burying my face in a cat and breathing deeply is so relaxing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 22:59:37	@nejireta_ki true.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 22:59:09	@nejireta_ki today will be better. Get to go to the gym and watch the fights now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 22:58:30	@nejireta_ki easier for a woman. But yeah.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 22:54:37	@nejireta_ki should ve gone out alone. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 22:54:03	@nejireta_ki morning now. Just took me into a fight with her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 11:31:28	She used to be able to be nice for a few days at a time. Now she can't make it a few hours.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 10:24:57	@MariesVoice_MG be happy you have people to ask and who are willing to give.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 09:07:51	@ThinnerSpinster it was awful. But on the other side, I am getting better and can do it without drugs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 09:07:11	@ThinnerSpinster I survived. I live day by day still.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 09:06:17	@ThinnerSpinster I'd heard addicts took 10 mg so I thought I was okay. But you can be addicted at any dose.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 09:05:27	@ThinnerSpinster it's really ruined me in a lot of ways. I had no idea how high a dose I was on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 09:04:16	@ThinnerSpinster still fighting it a bit 2 years later.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 09:03:59	@ThinnerSpinster a month or two. Then I became suicidal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 09:03:14	@ThinnerSpinster wow
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 09:02:56	@ThinnerSpinster damn. I have a bunch too that I couldn't bear to throw out. Never relapsed though. The withdrawal was god awful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 09:02:08	@ThinnerSpinster it has its pros and cons. But I am very sensitive to meds and get a lot of side effects.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 09:00:38	@ThinnerSpinster lol. You know your stash might go for quite a bit on the black market...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:59:32	@ThinnerSpinster druggie. Heheh. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:59:12	@ThinnerSpinster wow. Came off lamictal in sept. I'm clean now. Pdoc is ok w that. Tdoc thinks it's a mistake but she is wrong.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:54:12	@ThinnerSpinster it was awful. But I was taking the equivalent of 3 to 4 mg of xanax a day. And that was in addition to prozac and abilify.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:52:13	@ThinnerSpinster I know. I think it's why I was addicted
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:50:45	@ThinnerSpinster I didn't either when my Dr gave me 2 mg klonopin.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:49:43	@ThinnerSpinster that is the equivalent of 2 mg xanax. Heavy dosage. Can't you take half a pill?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:48:25	@ThinnerSpinster what dosage do you take?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:18:58	@ThinnerSpinster that's good...because I might like it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:17:37	@ThinnerSpinster are you flirting again? ;P
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:17:18	@ThinnerSpinster virtual hug is good. Just don't sneak up on me in this mood. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:14:43	@ThinnerSpinster yes....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 08:13:05	Cycling...now I am angry again and want to hit someone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 07:02:12	i want to feed the disease...have energy and nothing to do with it...worst feeling
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 06:45:14	want to go drink and sing and dance and party and...but i have no friends. f me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 06:44:37	bored bored bored...so fucking bored
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-15 06:16:06	@ThinnerSpinster have it on mp3. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 22:18:40	@Boudi oh no apologies needed. I am usually the first to say what you did.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 22:16:00	@Boudi lol. But we berate ourselves so well! ;) it's really just perspective. Trying to remind myself how good I do have it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 22:11:27	@Boudi lots of things are problems. One may not minimize the other, but I doubt someone starving to death cares about our anxiety.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 21:48:38	@HopeLoveF8th first world doesn't mean the USA and it could also mean wealthier cities in poor countries as well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 21:42:41	@HopeLoveF8th didn't quite think about it that way, but now I think I want to look up some statistics. Wouldn't surprise me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 21:39:31	I suffer from it, and I will freely admit that #bipolar is a #firstworldproblem .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 21:27:21	@ThinnerSpinster haha. Thank you. If you didn't tell me, I wouldn't know!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 13:11:40	@nejireta_ki i think i am gonna try sleep. the rush of anger made me tired. hope you have a better day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 13:10:42	@nejireta_ki both my parents, and my wife do that to me. and if i complain, well, then i am the evil awful mean angry bad person, of course
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 12:43:54	it has been upsetting me lately seeing friends talk positively about their parents. i really don't like mine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 12:42:57	@nejireta_ki same here, except we don't talk about it in terms of bipolar. no one gives me credit for it anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 12:38:39	@nejireta_ki and you can't even express it because no one understands, and when you do, it makes everything that much worse
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 12:37:47	@nejireta_ki me neither. but i think its because i am angry at so much that its all one big ball of string, so to speak
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 12:36:11	@4apieceofmymind I have 5 playlists, each w a dozen or more songs. depends on my particular mood. was listening to tangled up in blue today
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 12:32:44	I am too old to be letting my parents upset me. but really its that they don't anymore. i don't want to make up. that makes me sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 12:06:22	anger courses through me, it is the only emotion i feel. others make no more than brief passing appearances. ever.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 09:44:22	I get no appreciation at home or at work, and even if I do, I think that its a lie--just being said to be nice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 09:43:02	absolutely positively hate my life. no friends and a wife whose favorite thing to do is be mad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 08:35:44	Sometimes I think it is cruel trying to prevent suicide. You are making people suffer, and most really won't ever be happy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 08:16:29	I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 07:08:57	@LePetiteNYC you want honesty in a relationship? Now that is just so demanding of you... :p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 07:05:02	If you only tweet positive statements, I don't believe you are mentally ill. In the very least you are not sharing very openly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 05:31:13	@LePetiteNYC I miss the days when I would have a craving and then go chase it down... now it all seems like too much work. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 05:28:22	Its hard to want to recover when my life was better before I went back into treatment...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 05:22:07	Grading puts me in the worst mood ever.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 05:21:25	And I go back to work on monday...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 05:10:22	@ybnormal622 lol.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 03:54:14	@ybnormal622 I would, if I had britches. they stopped making those 100 years ago. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 03:53:37	@MariesVoicexoxo it the prison is self made, they self make the key. another point of view, everything is a prison if that is how you see it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 03:40:45	@ybnormal622 lmao. Who pays? Not them. Parents or financial aid (which they don't realize they have to pay back).
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 03:07:30	@ybnormal622 I'd actually go with stupid. They can't follow directions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 02:54:13	Grading papers makes me nauseous. Either kids don't care or are stupid.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-14 00:06:53	@ybnormal622 hahaha, slip vodka in the water bowl... ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-13 23:01:49	@Polarbear3127 don't mean anything mean by it. but its your kids. is your cause going to hurt them or help them?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-13 22:35:46	@Polarbear3127 2. if it really will, then you are putting yourself and your "fight against stigma" ahead of your kids. Selfish.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-13 22:35:16	@Polarbear3127 2 ways of looking at this. 1. you are being arrogant thinking that your announcement will have such a dramatic effect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-13 07:26:05	@LePetiteNYC everyone is selfish and lie about it. Be selfish and take care of your needs. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-13 02:04:09	I am so oooo tired today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 20:49:59	Didn't mind being woken up by the phone for good news.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 11:11:56	@ThinnerSpinster night night. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 11:10:09	@ThinnerSpinster lol. I just can't sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 11:07:20	And while I hate strip clubs, I am debating going to find one. Just to get out of here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:48:19	I act like a puppy when it's person comes home whenever someone deigns to talk to me. #pathetic
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:44:31	@ThinnerSpinster sorry you got a virus or whatever. Computers are a pain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:43:36	@ThinnerSpinster hehe. Always. Just hide It better sometimes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:43:10	@DailyBipolar don't think I am In the mood to fight tonight though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:42:31	@DailyBipolar I get yelled at when I am nice. She only listens when I am mean. Healthy, isn't it? :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:41:47	@ThinnerSpinster so this isn't you trying to fuck yourself? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:38:21	Or just be equally cold and distant in return because I have learned finally it's not worth trying with her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:33:47	Okay. I think I am gonna start a fight. Well I am gonna say how I feel. Same difference.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:32:20	Even when we get along, she isn't pleasant to me. No matter what she says, I know she doesn't like me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:14:47	The world has gotten so complicated that most people aren't intelligent enough to function in it. How hard is it too fill a script?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:08:13	@bipolarvoice so how do you fight stigma when those of us with mental illness do it too? #dilemma
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 10:02:29	No casino no beach. Not even a strip bar (and they suck anyways). NEED DISTRACTION!!!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 09:31:43	@MariesVoicexoxo coco for coco puffs. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 09:11:16	@MariesVoicexoxo carbs. Better to have protein.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 08:49:08	@ThinnerSpinster awww Thank you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 08:44:04	@ThinnerSpinster thanks. Just Just a precaution. Prolly just an ear infection.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 08:28:46	So I am so desperate to break routine that I was happy to run out late at night to bring my son to urgent care
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 08:28:01	@bipolarvoice exactly. I mean I try. I am not mean at all. But I prolly do that silence thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 05:42:03	I need a rush. Anything. Please...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 05:27:01	No idea how I feel right now. Maybe detached.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-12 05:08:38	@kstrecker1701 @ybnormal622 still funny, but it was created in a time before everyone was so PC and oversensitive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 23:47:14	@bipolarvoice i don't handle being around adults w severe disabilities, or severe schizophrenia. was in a halfway house i didn't belong in
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 23:46:04	@bipolarvoice a looooong time unfortunately. and i know better, but some things make me uncomfortable too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 23:40:00	@bipolarvoice there is "stigma" about a lot of things. people will always be uncomfortable about certain things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 23:26:59	with my karate test out of the way, i am back in the weight room. damn everything is heavy...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:54:27	@ThinnerSpinster boot. yuck. Just taped mine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:43:32	@ThinnerSpinster i broke the pinky toe. needed a cane for like a month to walk.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:34:08	@ThinnerSpinster have you ever had a broken toe? ;p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:31:18	@ThinnerSpinster lol. then you would walk funny. more important to walk than know calculus. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:30:26	@Hippychick1987 hope that is a good thing. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:28:01	Now, I am stable but everything is changing. Moving to a new part of the country, big new job. oh boy, here we gooooo.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:27:03	lived in the same house for 10 years. big changes were having a 3rd kid and getting phd. Graduating sent me into a downward spiral.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:26:24	used to be a person who would change everything to "kickstart" my life, but haven't had many major changes lately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:25:01	@ybnormal622 that has been my year. better to have some "pretty good" though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:24:29	@ThinnerSpinster thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:23:26	lurking under the surface though, I can feel it. sleeping is worse than ever, but i am fine without it. tv shows seem to be slow, want fast
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:21:58	as I have said before, I haven't really been manic or hypomanic in years, kinda living in a mixed state.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:20:46	Of course, I can never decide if I prefer my misery to have a rational basis or be completely irrational. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 21:20:03	and now I feel utterly crappy for the usual reason...which is no reason at all. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 09:01:38	I am so unstable today. Every mood imaginable has cycled through me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-11 06:46:00	You know, I don't help people nit because I am selfish but because people are ungrateful. And they don't like hearing the truth
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:57:02	@ybnormal622 haha.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:31:19	@ThinnerSpinster maybe you are just too smart and its for the average american?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:30:08	@ThinnerSpinster I believe you. Things are never as good as they look.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:29:42	@Daphne_Writes or at least it feels like it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:29:28	@Daphne_Writes soup is is a natural antidepressant. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:16:12	@ThinnerSpinster too bad. Commercial looked good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:15:23	@Daphne_Writes we are making the kids eat less carbs and more protein too! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:10:01	@ybnormal622 me too bro! ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:09:36	@Daphne_Writes the motivation for me is how it's easier to eat less and healthier because I am so much less hungry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:08:58	@Daphne_Writes I never thought about how diet affected my mood until I changed my diet for other reasons. Now I can really tell.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:04:44	@Daphne_Writes oatmeal in morning. Soup for lunch. Fish or chicken for dinner. Almonds for a snack. She weight lifts for strength now too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:01:44	@Daphne_Writes I have a sugar addiction. It's very hard for me but I am a lot less hungry and have more energy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 09:01:04	@Daphne_Writes my wife can't get enough bread and pasta. She cut down and got depressed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:57:53	@Daphne_Writes you may have an addiction.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:57:40	@Daphne_Writes carbs are not good for those with MH issues. A high dose can give me a panic attack. If you are depressed without them ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:53:22	@Daphne_Writes between 200 g of carbs max and as many as I want? Of course.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:25:46	@ybnormal622 quite possibly. You might get on with her better than I do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:23:21	@ybnormal622 haha.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:23:04	@ybnormal622 you should go with my wife. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:22:41	@ybnormal622 my wife likes all those. Again not me. I like easy shows with good characters.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:22:01	@ybnormal622 so I heard. The bits I saw were creepy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:21:35	@ybnormal622 i like dumb action movies too. They are an escape. They're fun.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:21:13	@ybnormal622 i am not a fanatic about this stuff. Just like the stories. Have no interest in conventions or any geeky stuff.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:19:30	@ybnormal622 i watched a lot.of them when it was originally on. May watch it again. Haven't decided yet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:18:54	@ybnormal622 i tell myself enough horror stories so I try to avoid feeding myself ammo.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:18:20	@ybnormal622 watched all the stargate series on dvd! Wife watched dexter and American horror story without me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:15:47	My week of carbs is over. Back to low carb tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 08:14:57	@ybnormal622 watched faracape, original battlestar galactica, star trek tos and tng. Now watching enterprise.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 07:56:55	@ybnormal622 a lot of Sci Fi and Cheers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 07:02:55	@ybnormal622 i like that one too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 05:03:53	@LePetiteNYC if you like your balls without any meat. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 02:33:02	What the hell is wrong with people today???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-10 01:05:30	@ybnormal622 aha! Knew you had to like some sport. And call it what you like, it's still Canada. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 12:04:31	Not sober. Good ending to a very intense day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 11:08:15	@ybnormal622 i used to play golf so watching isn't bad. Bowling I agree. Don you like hockey? You do live in Canada.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 11:06:56	@outfromthedark no. I am not a good sharer. ; ) haha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 10:59:53	Good twitter friends, steak, fries, and wine. MUCH better mood.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 10:59:05	@ybnormal622 hahaha. Mma? NBA playoffs? I draw the line at baseball. BORING!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 10:58:23	@outfromthedark yes. I need a circle of friends that I can take off the mask around.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 09:34:19	@ybnormal622 oh don't start. My wife used to call me the girl for ages. How about we watch some college football. Or boxing is on tonight...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 09:33:06	@outfromthedark i know. It's good we all have each other here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 09:30:50	@outfromthedark then we are both very successful. Sorry to hear...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 09:30:21	@ybnormal622 i just pay attention and remember things you say.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 09:01:11	@ybnormal622 i already know how you really feel.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:53:32	@ybnormal622 and my stepsister was as big Blue fan as you are....her husband's mom lived there at the time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:49:55	@ybnormal622 educated guess. My stepsister used to live in Ann Arbor. Besides why would a Mexican move effectively to Canada? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:47:20	@ThinnerSpinster can't get black belt without being willing to take a little pain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:46:21	@ybnormal622 you should try it. Although you might have to leave the super white part of Michigan. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:45:25	@ThinnerSpinster yes. Blister isn't too bad fortunately. Will go away in a day or two.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:43:13	@ybnormal622 cuban food
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:43:05	@ybnormal622 "Arriba arriba" can you cook cuban? I love Cuba food.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:42:08	@ThinnerSpinster me too. It was kinda depressing how misersble I was getting even after I passed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:40:57	@ybnormal622 no problem...said like a little Spanish cartoon character.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:40:00	@ThinnerSpinster nah nah nah nah nah...lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:39:11	@ybnormal622 you are my sunshine my only sunshine...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:38:42	@ThinnerSpinster good. Very good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:38:14	@ThinnerSpinster now your being the brat. Ha.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:37:55	@ybnormal622 thank you. I hope to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:37:28	@ThinnerSpinster ouch. And I thought you liked me. ;p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:37:02	@ybnormal622 i could argue the point as to who is more negative, but that seems kinda sad... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:35:29	@ybnormal622 all out. But I have a ribeye, potato, and a good bottle of bordeaux waiting for me to celebrate my win today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:34:35	@ThinnerSpinster lmao. Haha. aren't I too old to be a brat? I haven't been called that in 30 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:33:49	@ybnormal622 exactly. My therapist said I was the most negative person she ever met.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:32:56	@ThinnerSpinster yay. I forced more words out of you. :) it's okay. I am just playing. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:31:55	@ybnormal622 haha. Yeah right. They don't gotta and they usually dont.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:31:17	@ThinnerSpinster yeah not sure lol can be counted as a second word. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:30:49	@ybnormal622 and they say that you are just being negative if you suggest that?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:30:08	@ThinnerSpinster you are the queen of the 1 word response. ;P
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:28:49	@ybnormal622 i don't think I look scary at all. But when the real temper comes out...apparently I am.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:27:49	@ybnormal622 no one in my non virtual life even close to understands. I have learned to mask it all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:26:09	@ThinnerSpinster it's a sucky way to live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:25:40	@ybnormal622 you were so right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:23:53	@ybnormal622 i do think it's http:// good.to.let.it out
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:23:39	@ybnormal622 not to say I am proud of this is any way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:23:13	@ybnormal622 it's taken worse since I'm a guy. And I am surprisingly scary when mad too. Family trait.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:20:33	I used to be so much fun. Now I am depressed bitter and angry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:18:54	People are so freaked by my anger but I just don't bury it like they all do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 08:05:42	I want to rage and throw and break things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 07:40:47	@ybnormal622 probably. Thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 07:16:50	Now I have to figure out how to spend my vacation week. Need something to do besides netflixing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 07:14:26	Is it still paranoia if It all comes true?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 07:10:06	@ThinnerSpinster thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 07:10:00	@ThinnerSpinster yeah. Just hiding away
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 06:57:40	Despite getting my 2nd dan, TKD just isn't my thing. My technique on my kicks is awful. Time to move on. Jiu jitsu next.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 06:33:29	I am in quite a bad mood for some one who passed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 06:32:53	Did the whole damn test with a blister.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 06:26:41	Damn cat won't let me sleep. Decided that I will be his scratching post if I close my eyes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 05:59:47	Fucking exhausted. There was no reason we needed to just sit on the hard floor for an hour.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 02:58:40	Testing done. Judging next but I passed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-09 00:01:39	@LePetiteNYC thank you!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 23:57:58	Finished the workout. Lunch then the actual test begins.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 23:16:27	First in my group in the fitness test. 518/300
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 22:33:45	Aced written test I think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 22:00:42	Finished the run. 3 miles 33 min
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 19:37:46	@LePetiteNYC this would be diner time for me if I were up all night in nyc. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 19:34:18	@LePetiteNYC hahaha. Hopefully a fun night not a sleepless one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 19:23:26	Up bright and early. Here is to what I hope will be bea great day!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 10:17:31	@ybnormal622 i love cats so much so I doubt it. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 09:47:46	So tired ... until I go to bed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:42:08	@ybnormal622 why? Don't need to be decorative.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:31:13	@ybnormal622 hahaha. Would love it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:30:37	@ThinnerSpinster I also have two bags at home. One for punching and one for kicking.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:28:47	@ybnormal622 pecan pie is EASY. follow the Karo corn syrup label.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:28:12	@ThinnerSpinster thanks. It is very therapeutic. Hitting things helps alleviate my anger.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:27:29	@ybnormal622 lmao. How bout make me a pecan pie???? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:27:06	@ybnormal622 lol. My side kick doesn't reach to Michigan.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:26:30	@ThinnerSpinster thanks. Been training about 6 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:25:16	@ybnormal622 don't like chocolate but maybe I will buy almond milk this weekend to try it. I get vanilla soy milk but only use it in oatmeal
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:24:03	@ybnormal622 2nd degree black belt test
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:23:44	@ThinnerSpinster 2nd degree black belt test in taekwondo
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:23:18	@ybnormal622 i haven't tried it. Maybe I will. I am not crazy about soy milk. Almond milk doesn't have much protein though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:21:57	@ybnormal622 i can't drink milk other than soy milk but ice cream doesn't affect me. Maybe it's cause I used to drink a ton of milk.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:19:20	@ybnormal622 just breyers natural vanilla. My blue bell pralines and cream has freezer burn.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:18:39	@ThinnerSpinster im ok. Busy day tomorow. You had the ect yesterday. It must be knocking you out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:17:43	@ybnormal622 oh good. I am eating ice cream as we speak.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:16:11	@ybnormal622 ice cream and pie.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:14:59	@ybnormal622 with a recipe. But I don't like cake.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:11:05	@ThinnerSpinster hey there! How are you tonight?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:10:37	@ybnormal622 i am adorable. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:08:08	@ybnormal622 hehehe. Interesting Is good. Although to be fair, white wine won't make the cat sick while vodka might.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:06:48	@ybnormal622 he wants some. Put some vodka in his water bowl
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:05:38	@ybnormal622 party with a pussy. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 08:03:10	I am italian by nurture. Made my homemade pasta and sauce. Yum.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 05:28:04	@ybnormal622 thank you!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 05:19:08	@ybnormal622 tomorrow
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 02:20:04	Gonna cook up a storm tonight. Go to bed early and get some sleep (don't expect much) and get up early for my big day. #anxiety
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 02:16:36	Keeping myself and my mind occupied as best as possible.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-08 00:03:58	@ybnormal622 we will see. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 21:43:47	@ybnormal622 Always. Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 11:10:42	@thelilradish out of necessity. It will haunt you for 20 years if you don't
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 11:09:14	Tried to pay someone to be my friend but they refused the job.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 10:43:19	Well maybe not random. But because they just wanted to say hi.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 10:42:20	I want a life where I get random calls from people not related to me or wanting to sell me viagra.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 09:55:01	@nejireta_ki I was an 80s metalhead.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 09:41:23	@nejireta_ki kajagoogoo?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 09:35:35	@nejireta_ki haha. Love it. Any particular stuff? I recall you like Depeche Mode.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 09:34:53	@nejireta_ki yeah. Unless you are adhd in which case it's a downer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 08:45:06	Breathing depressing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 07:57:29	I really want a milkshake, but the ice cream here has freezer burn and I am too down to go out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 07:55:40	sigh...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 05:21:33	@nejireta_ki well, hitting things and yelling works for me, but that may be a guy thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 05:19:06	okay, found my intensity...just got to hold on to it for 2 more days.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 02:18:24	No you cannot be anything you want to be. Discover your abilities.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 01:37:58	For that matters I have days weeks and even years to endure with nothing I am looking forward to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-07 01:36:24	Have hours upon hours to kill and nothing I want to do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 23:33:53	@ritalongtweets no, but without confidence, i won't do my best. usually intensity is not an issue for me, but this week it is getting bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 22:45:57	I always fuck up up a good thing. Now that I am older, I do it even faster.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 20:37:33	@ritalongtweets full day of martial arts testing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 20:36:21	@nejireta_ki and the effect didn't go away for weeks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 20:36:04	@nejireta_ki The only trick I know is to take a ritalin. At least that worked for me in the past. Made me more anxious than anything though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 12:48:20	Need to induce hypomania. Have a big day Saturday and cannot function the way I am. Any ideas? #bipolar #mania
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 10:29:03	@nejireta_ki @bipolarvoice let's all run away!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 10:21:49	@ThinnerSpinster to massage your back...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 10:21:08	I REALLY need to get my confidence back before Saturday or I will fail for sure.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 08:08:25	@LePetiteNYC okay. I will remember that here we gooooo. :P
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 08:03:11	@LePetiteNYC I think I may leave early and drive slow and listen to tunes. You've inspired me. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 08:02:35	@LePetiteNYC awesome!!! Better than not getting an appt and running out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 07:53:43	@LePetiteNYC you have been very entertaining lately. In a good way with all the singing and dancing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 07:52:48	@LePetiteNYC anxious and bored. I have something to do in 30 minutes but now just pacing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 06:51:12	Always nice to find more family on facebook and realize they have been on awhile.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-06 02:18:32	@LePetiteNYC so much for the dance freak on the train this morn. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 10:41:03	@ThinnerSpinster there is an innuendo in there somewhere. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 10:39:56	@ThinnerSpinster heheh. glad you feel better. Just giving you a hard time. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 10:38:16	@ThinnerSpinster thought you were sick?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 10:36:08	Goodnight moon. May tomorrow be better for us all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 10:11:12	Feel baaaaaaaad
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 09:29:38	@ybnormal622 really? Able to leap tall snow drifts in a single bound?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 09:27:31	@ybnormal622 you are stuck in snow and can never catch me!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 09:24:50	@ybnormal622 tag. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 08:32:29	@DailyBipolar I wish. I am not allowed to leave the room. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 08:14:42	@bipolarvoice hahaha. I would so want to rub that in her face.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 08:11:04	@bipolarvoice that Is nasty. Write her and say her posts haven't been very interesting. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 08:07:40	Inlaws. Now I have 3 people like my wife in my house. Happy happy joy joy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 08:07:40	@nejireta_ki I think I am whiny and overreact. I don't trust my judgment and she is nicer lately than i have been giving her credit for.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 08:07:18	Not thankful to be me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 06:57:44	I am honest with myself. As a result I have been told I am the most negative person. My opinion? Positive people are liars.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 06:39:53	@ThinnerSpinster yeah. I don't think i could be in a bad mood there. Even if I went alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 06:35:44	Need to go away. Too bad mardi gras was this week and I am off next.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 06:30:48	Tired. Just tired. Just want something fun in my life. It should not be this difficult.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 06:29:14	Fa la la la la la la la la
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 06:24:22	@ThinnerSpinster good. Very good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 06:21:19	@ThinnerSpinster are you mad at me about it?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 05:36:09	@ThinnerSpinster told you I am not that nice. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 05:35:54	@ThinnerSpinster I did? I think you misunderstood. I was in a bad mood. But I didn't mean that. Sorry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 05:34:22	@ThinnerSpinster talk to meeee. ;P
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 05:33:49	@ThinnerSpinster hahaha. I think I would.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 02:36:28	@ThinnerSpinster i really don't know enough about it. if you aren't having side effects, then it probably can't hurt, or so they say now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 02:35:55	@ThinnerSpinster i understand that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 02:30:42	@ThinnerSpinster ect. it seems barbaric to me to voluntarily electrocute yourself. are lobotomies coming back next?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-05 02:24:40	@ThinnerSpinster that is a serious procedure to undergo if it isn't helping. what does your doc say?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 21:04:54	I will bet 99 percent of people cannot say only nice things about others, including others you don't like. Be a 1 percenter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 20:32:29	@nejireta_ki a better one tomorrow that is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 20:31:48	@nejireta_ki I hope you have a better one. I am awake early. So I have a long day ahead.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 20:16:48	I feel displaced. This is one of those days everything seems wrong. Like if I put on my favorite station, I won't know the songs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 20:08:30	Want to take an alone vacation next week. Not sure there is anywhere I want to go though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 11:55:23	@nejireta_ki I need a life apart from her to be able to have something to compare against. Right now she is my only live human adult friend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 11:53:45	@nejireta_ki I have wanted to leave because she has made me feel so bad about myself. But that has subsided. Sort of.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 11:52:39	@nejireta_ki I think I am whiny and overreact. I don't trust my judgment and she is nicer lately than i have been giving her credit for.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 11:51:16	@nejireta_ki of course it's hard. But I think you will get past it sooner than you think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 11:50:27	@nejireta_ki I am glad for you. I remember a year ago reading your posts and wondering when you would.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 11:45:24	@nejireta_ki that's a country song! I guess it's better than settling down there. For me every decision makes things worse, so I'm frozen
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 11:42:36	@nejireta_ki hope it gets better. Don't apologize. I meant it teasingly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 11:38:47	@nejireta_ki you don't take a compliment too well. ;p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 11:36:50	@nejireta_ki well i am certainly gonna be jealous of your detemination!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 11:31:17	@nejireta_ki I am sorry. Me too. You seem so happy at times even if very upset at others.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 08:05:56	@nejireta_ki yeah but you are living. And experiencing. It may not all be good but you could be flat all the time which would be worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 07:57:04	@oxymoronic82 yes you are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 07:15:12	@ThinnerSpinster mad...just go away. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 07:13:29	Twitter is the place I say things I can't say on Facebook. I am starting to need a place for things I can't say on twitter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 06:56:29	Apologizes, wants to talk, doesn't like what I have to say, gets mad again. Waste of my life talking to her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 05:05:57	I had thought I would try to be nicer to her today. She decided to start a fight first though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 02:16:44	@ybnormal622 i only read it in the context of helping my 5 year old try to read it. It was the book that made him fall in love with books.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 01:13:40	Don't assume I am okay because I am calm and composed. I am not emotional because life has beaten me. What's the point of getting worked up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-04 01:07:01	I really hope I can get my shit together over vacation next week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 23:06:54	@nejireta_ki I am jealous a little that you have finally done this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 23:06:28	@nejireta_ki but you make friends. I do not. I have always been an outsider everywhere, even among people I thought were "my kind".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 11:31:16	If I was a normal person I would leave her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 10:28:07	@ThinnerSpinster lol. Ni apologies. So yeah the obvious is all that's left.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 10:26:42	@ThinnerSpinster I only have sons and don't talk much with my mother.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 10:25:51	I am In perfect physical health and yet I am in constant physical pain because of all the shit upstairs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 10:25:08	I am really really sick of feeling this bad. I need a quick fix of something just to keep me going.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 10:15:50	All she does is get angry it seems.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 10:13:07	@ThinnerSpinster and any personal sense of impending doom.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 05:56:49	Don't know if I care enough to lose sleep on order to stay up to watch Oscar and his band of over indulgent arrogant sociopaths.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 05:31:48	Seem to be having a low level anxiety attack for the last 7 days.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 03:32:36	I am on the sideline of life and am too injured to play.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 03:29:37	I have done absolutely nothing this weekend. Bleh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 03:10:33	@ThinnerSpinster that's good. Take what you can get.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 02:31:15	@ThinnerSpinster you sound in a better mood. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 00:28:44	Need to just get through this week. Saturday is my 2nd degree test and then a week of vacation.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-03 00:15:24	@ThinnerSpinster thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 13:11:12	Am I the only one still awake.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 12:50:55	I guess talking to myself is better than nothing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 12:45:43	@nejireta_ki it isn't such a bad label. Lots of people have it. I am employed with a lot of responsibility.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 12:41:58	Is there some reason why things always go so bad for me. Law of large numbers?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 12:38:35	Keeping it together. Well maybe. Well maybe not. Need another drink.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 12:31:06	Good drunk...soon bad drunk. ... ok...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 12:22:02	I never understood why guys like strippers but right now I would pay pay a girl for conversation. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 12:18:33	And I can't leave her cause she has shrunk my manhood so much that I'll never get laid again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 12:17:59	Let me correct that. No one wants to fuck me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 12:16:17	And i am left alonw. Fuck me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 12:03:55	Wife finds ways to ruin every good evening we have.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 11:58:25	@bullfrogr very true. no one wins in this. I empathize for you all and hope.my country doesn't get involved.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 11:16:55	Happy half drunk. Very yummy sangria.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 11:16:13	@BipolarJobbie good so far. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 10:58:12	Rack of lamb with wild mushroom risotto and and a pitcher of sangria. I am actually in a good mood!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 09:35:26	So what's everyone doing? Me, I am waiting for my sangria to "mature"...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 09:34:54	Sitting up here watching over lightning down below, the earth is turning, why does it go so slow...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 09:23:18	I very well could be in a not bad mood at the moment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 09:01:57	@kaycey55 well considering my mood lately that is quite possible too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 09:01:09	@kaycey55 lol. My boys would do the same if they got the idea.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 09:00:32	@ThinnerSpinster yeah. I make good sangria.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 08:45:37	@oxymoronic82 not just hello
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 08:43:20	@kaycey55 um...All of them?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 08:41:35	@ThinnerSpinster the way you have been lately, I'd agree. I made a pitcher of sangria.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 08:40:51	@kaycey55 hahaha. Probably. I might be entertaining. I have been told I am more fun when drunk.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 08:34:38	I am going to drink tonight. I rarely do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 06:03:57	A planned rest day is the only day I am guaranteed to not want to rest.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 05:03:08	I have no interest in anything. So I watch tv, read the same 3 or 5 Internet sites, and wallow in self misery.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 04:55:00	I should take a ritalin. Those are excellent mood swingers. Still, I may not sleep this month if I do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 04:54:03	Days when I have no work quickly turn into bad days. When given time to think, I brood.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 03:33:22	Venting on twitter isn't helping. I feel whiny.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-02 02:31:26	Feel crappy. Only reason I can think of is that I am breathing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 07:50:17	@ThinnerSpinster I am sorry. IM me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 07:33:19	And the Friday night headache is coming. ..
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 07:09:59	@ThinnerSpinster wow. super early. no bath? :P
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 06:56:11	@LePetiteNYC wow. now i am annoyed for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 06:53:55	@LePetiteNYC your family doesn't know you are vegan?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 06:53:14	@LePetiteNYC cold app and a salad? wouldn't be cooked in anything you can't eat.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 06:51:16	@LePetiteNYC I understand. Can you see the menu in advance, or call ahead to ask about options?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 06:48:29	@ThinnerSpinster isn't it supposed to be for fun?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 06:46:08	@LePetiteNYC i empathize. i try to hide as much as possible when my parents visit me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 06:45:29	@ThinnerSpinster of course they have video game versions as well...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 06:44:19	@ThinnerSpinster cartoons, adventure time is for preteen, teen, while bubble guppies is for the MUCH younger set.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 06:42:35	@ThinnerSpinster watch adventure time... or bubble guppies...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 06:39:30	@ThinnerSpinster I can't relate. Haven't played video games much in 20 years. Games now do look too intense and overly involved.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 06:08:54	@ThinnerSpinster friend of mine works in the gaming industry, he was passing out these codes. guess your weekend is locked up now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 05:37:55	i usually try to feel something before i tweet. think i am locking up those emotions again. it'll be nice to breathe again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 05:11:48	Finally the week is done. Now to sink into nothing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 02:25:50	@ThinnerSpinster lol. I like them. Maybe for different reasons. Just don't expect me to fit any pattern I guess. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 02:22:52	@ThinnerSpinster I am different from "bipolar guys" in a lot more than this way. I am an outlier in all circumstances.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 00:54:55	@ThinnerSpinster good thing I only have 2 more classes then.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-03-01 00:11:36	@ThinnerSpinster I am not even sure what that would mean, but it's definitely distracting. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 23:03:56	Since when is it called an estate sale when your house is a 150k ranch?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 11:14:50	@ThinnerSpinster you too. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 11:13:35	@ThinnerSpinster my pleasure.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 11:12:31	@ThinnerSpinster yeah I am gonna turn in very soon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 11:10:38	@ThinnerSpinster sorry. couldn't resist.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 11:07:59	@ThinnerSpinster so phone to phone and now bed. Where do we go from there?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:58:28	And with depression seems to always come chest pain. Like real pain not anxiety discomfort.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:56:09	@ThinnerSpinster thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:54:18	@ThinnerSpinster both depending on the day. I am just tired of how she makes me feel about myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:52:36	@ThinnerSpinster rough relationships do that to you...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:51:11	@ThinnerSpinster I have gotten seriously self conscious lately. I need to be romanced.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:47:59	@ThinnerSpinster stop pressuring me... ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:44:27	@ThinnerSpinster sorry. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:42:12	@ThinnerSpinster it would have to be. It wouldn't reach TN
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:40:30	@ThinnerSpinster yeah. Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:39:50	@ThinnerSpinster omg. Lol.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:38:36	@ThinnerSpinster ??? You are a friend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:31:16	@ThinnerSpinster you are
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:31:00	@ThinnerSpinster yeah the counselor said I was right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:23:08	@ThinnerSpinster I don't have any friends. But she is oblivious to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:16:28	@ThinnerSpinster don't strain anything... ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 10:07:42	@ThinnerSpinster anything else you need to know about me? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 09:59:56	@ThinnerSpinster nah. Just yell.at him there too. But I can get away with it cause guys always yell in the gym.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 09:59:14	So on the one hand I want to go to bed to turn off existence, but on the other I have to work tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 09:29:39	@ThinnerSpinster hahaha. yes well. 《《Blush》》
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 09:19:58	@ThinnerSpinster what does a not married guy sound like? Whiny like me?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 09:17:13	@ThinnerSpinster I do. Heheh ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 09:15:10	@ThinnerSpinster really? I complain about her constantly. Flirt away. No one else does.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 09:13:49	@ThinnerSpinster yes. I live with my kids. And a wife. Married 18 extremely long years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 09:13:18	@ThinnerSpinster sorry. Had to spot my oldest in the gym.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 08:57:47	@ThinnerSpinster 12, 9, and 3. Not really yelling at the 3 year old.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 08:51:26	@ThinnerSpinster tell that to my kids. I haven't stopped yelling at them since Sunday
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 08:49:03	@ThinnerSpinster you are much nicer than me. I don't apologize for my tantrums.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 07:37:11	@nejireta_ki good for you. I wish you the best.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 07:34:52	I could win an Oscar for my performance of the rational man.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 07:34:01	My emotions are the ocean, and I am but a single fish. It just looks like I am in control.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 07:33:22	perspective. my life makes me miserable. while others probably dream of it. for all i have, the demons are worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 06:59:12	I have been pretty much ignoring my kids for a week. Its better than yelling at them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-28 06:38:45	the only good thing I can say about this week is it is almost over.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 22:17:20	Just when I get through 1 day, another has to start.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 21:16:45	@nejireta_ki sure does seem like it. Chronic too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 12:41:21	@MariesVoicexoxo you should never trust someone until you get to know them, how else can you determine whether they deserve to be trusted?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 12:38:18	oh wait, I found something worse. songs from when I was 18.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 12:34:56	I feel 12 again, and that was never a good feeling.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 12:31:35	I listen to my music and I can feel the same pain I felt when I first heard it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 12:21:41	Can you grow out of being bipolar? I don't think I have had even a hypomanic episode in years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 11:56:00	@nejireta_ki home is where YOU make it. you'll be okay. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 11:14:16	@ThinnerSpinster goodnight!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 10:44:56	@ThinnerSpinster you are cute. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 10:40:23	@ThinnerSpinster are you flirting with me? Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 10:33:41	@ThinnerSpinster hahaha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 10:31:01	@ThinnerSpinster of course. Now we are phone to phone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 10:01:19	@ThinnerSpinster yeah. I have a Samsung note 3 so basically a phablet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 09:59:35	@ThinnerSpinster me too. But at this point I still do most things on my phone out of habit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 09:56:50	@ThinnerSpinster lol. It was worse before I got my new computer. Old one was so slow. Everything took 3 times as long. No exaggeration.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 09:53:57	@ThinnerSpinster just mwf. Prep grade etc the other days.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 09:52:42	@ThinnerSpinster funny thing is i wont. Don't have to get up early so I will stay up despite myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 09:51:51	@ThinnerSpinster lol. Good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 09:31:17	@ThinnerSpinster I like all kinds of ... hehe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 09:29:58	@ThinnerSpinster you are a wiseass...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 09:24:46	@ThinnerSpinster fair enough. I am here to listen if you ever want.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 09:03:57	@ThinnerSpinster not yet? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 08:54:03	@ThinnerSpinster lol. Well drooling is not particularly attractive either...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 08:49:13	@ThinnerSpinster lmao. It's you. Don't stop.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 08:48:41	@ThinnerSpinster okay. If you say so it must be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 08:46:54	@ThinnerSpinster you sure like that tongue emoticon. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 08:46:33	@ThinnerSpinster yet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 08:45:59	Headache now causing nausea. Of course my life is causing the headache causing the nausea.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 08:45:07	@ThinnerSpinster yes most ppl think I am . Heh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 08:43:48	@ThinnerSpinster understable. Well I can call your hair shorty. ;p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 08:42:47	@ThinnerSpinster how long is it now?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 08:35:11	@ThinnerSpinster how short? Just think of it as a change for the better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:35:16	@ThinnerSpinster they usually do. I just don't. Would rather drink gamble party watch or play sports. I do like debating though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:30:31	@ThinnerSpinster actually no. Always been this way. Being smart doesn't make you interested in being smart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:27:10	@ThinnerSpinster I have very little intellectual curiosity.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:26:40	@ThinnerSpinster smart is partly a function of knowledge. I am a very very limited smart myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:23:25	@ThinnerSpinster dummy is pretty strong. I doubt that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:19:31	@ThinnerSpinster agreed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:19:03	@ThinnerSpinster I was the opposite. Cs in english. Although in college I made up for it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:18:20	@ThinnerSpinster my gym only had a sauna. I'm not as crazy about those.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:17:35	@ThinnerSpinster well there is one thing we agree on. I like a good spinach salad. And mushrooms.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:16:56	@ThinnerSpinster calculus
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:16:36	@ThinnerSpinster usually there is a hot tub next to the pool.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:16:01	@ThinnerSpinster are those the ones with the leaves? If so, I like them with the right sauce.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:15:25	@ThinnerSpinster it's the German and Scandinavian breeding stock. NYers are irish polish and italian, all short.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:14:27	@ThinnerSpinster swim. When I was suicidal I actually looked forward to it. Just being in the water.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:13:32	@ThinnerSpinster I think our taste buds are very different...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:13:06	@ThinnerSpinster I feel it down here. Teach lots of kids taller than me. They sure know how to grow em here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:12:13	@ThinnerSpinster exercise is about the only thing I am very consistent about.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:11:38	@ThinnerSpinster grits? NY diners don't serve grits. Although I do love grits. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:08:59	@ThinnerSpinster pizza and diners.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:08:55	@ThinnerSpinster oh I wouldn't. I think women should build muscle not cut bodyweight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:07:42	@ThinnerSpinster hated it there, love it here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:07:09	@ThinnerSpinster and you don't want to be 105 at that height. That would not be attractive, much less healthy. It's not even possible.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:05:38	@ThinnerSpinster really? I hate it down here. Even the girls are trees. I am a yank. I am tall where I'm from.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:02:40	@ThinnerSpinster she was a kid. I was like 150, at about 5'11".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 07:01:09	@ThinnerSpinster she was like 17, no weight issues for her. She weighed like 105 I think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:59:39	@ThinnerSpinster then be overcome with guilt...and to make it worse, she would then vomit because her body wasn't used to meat.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:58:52	@ThinnerSpinster I dated a girl in college who was a vegan but LOVED hamburgers. So once every few months she would eat one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:57:41	@ThinnerSpinster lmao. Ouch.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:57:18	@ThinnerSpinster yes those are. However moderate amounts of red meat eggs and butter are okay.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:56:18	@ThinnerSpinster have you ever met a chicken? They have the personality that makes you want to eat them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:55:22	@ThinnerSpinster the fat we eat is digested first. Excess carbs are stored as fat. Of course eating too much fried food will do this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:54:03	@ThinnerSpinster apparently steak and butter aren't bad for you, in moderation. Neither are eggs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:53:10	@ThinnerSpinster actually, our bodies are better designed to process meat than bread. Fat is not what causes heart attacks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:49:44	@ThinnerSpinster well that makes more sense. I only eat meat. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:45:50	@ThinnerSpinster I will never be able to eat their bean burrito again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:45:25	@ThinnerSpinster no. It creeps by hour after hour. Just want that button that makes it bedtime.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:44:13	@ThinnerSpinster lol. It's yummy. Although there are much better junk food places.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 06:41:06	Why can't time just go away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 05:39:31	now down 21 - 0
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-27 02:16:06	Energy sucking vampires 7 me 0.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 10:38:02	@LePetiteNYC lol. I am actually not supposed to eat carbs. And I don't like many veggies. But I'll pretend for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 10:36:10	@LePetiteNYC just the smell of broccoli makes me extremely nauseous.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 10:34:12	@LePetiteNYC as much as I like you, I am afraid we can not be friends...allergic to vegetqbles. ;p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 10:21:04	@ThinnerSpinster state of mind?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 10:18:33	@LePetiteNYC thanks. I think I want it down on a soft pillow though. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 10:17:09	I suppose I am officially depressed again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 09:46:43	My emotions generally feel like the toddler who wandered too far into the ocean and the waves keep crashing over his head.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 09:46:00	If I don't use my mind to suppress my emotions, then I cannot control the behavior that may or may not accompany the emotions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 09:35:25	I don't hear voices but I could use the friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 08:52:41	I am done with being me. I don't ever want to be me again. Is there no one else I can be?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 08:51:45	Is it almost time to close my eyes and not be me for 8 hours?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 07:19:28	I am not real.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 07:19:12	I can't believe I have to get up and exist tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 05:56:41	I have only 1 symptom of depression. Nothing gives me joy. I would pick a different one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 05:50:46	people used to unfollow me all the time, now the only ones who do are those who used to actually talk to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 05:47:40	I am not suicidal, but if I were, its my life and my decision. Who are you to say I am not suffering enough for mercy?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 05:42:13	If I haven't offended, or bored, you yet, just wait...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 05:35:55	apparently, I have the emotional maturity of a toddler...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-26 05:35:32	my psych says i am fine without meds, my therapist thinks i need meds.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-25 06:17:35	People post so much crap on a social media about all these causes. Then they are mean to people they know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-25 05:19:03	@MariesVoice_MG take down the pics.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-25 05:17:12	If you don't work hard for something, it's hard to be proud of it. And yet it defines me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-25 00:54:23	People use the word unfair a lot. I don't think they know what it means.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 21:49:15	@nejireta_ki I am in a way. I am sick of "behaving myself".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 10:53:44	I am going to sleep. Prolly just drug myself. Too bad I will wake up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 10:22:41	I have given up. Let others take care of everything. ..including me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 09:47:35	I just kinda feel sick. Wondering why I skip the xanax. Ambien isn't much different I read.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 09:40:53	Is all this real. Wonder who I will be when I wake up. And who will hate me tomorrow for who I was today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 09:35:18	I have become completely unglued in a day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 06:26:46	It's why I don't drink anymore. I just feel sick. Not even a little happy while drinking.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 06:25:57	Nothing makes me feel good. Things only distract me from feeling bad. I wish I was exaggerating.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 06:14:41	Wanting it doesn't make it so.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 06:14:30	I am sick of putting on a brave face. Of being patient and expecting things to improve.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 06:13:43	Why did I have to be born. The joys don't out weigh the sorrows and the sufferings are constant now for years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 05:18:42	I was suicidal 2 years ago and people told me there were things worth living for. They left out when.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 04:14:40	The only way people listen to me is when I yell.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 04:14:18	I feel bullied by the world.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 02:59:50	It's hard to enjoy new things when you suck at them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 02:51:27	Ever wonder if people would be sad or relieved if you left?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 02:43:08	Anxious angry sad all rolled into 1 big ball of fun...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 02:40:53	'More people will like you if you aren't so selfish." LIES. I am selfish because people are more mean to me when I am not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 02:17:51	I always have to be doing something. Can't stand it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 02:17:19	I can't enjoy down time. Too anxious all the time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-24 01:15:48	So angry. Been yelling. Real yelling. Not the "don't yell at me" which is not even a voice raise but a tone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 13:08:20	chest pain, mouth dry, dizzy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 13:05:50	anxiety attack just getting worse...spiralilng...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 12:40:51	My heart is pounding. I need to get out of here. But I have nowhere to go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 12:40:00	What the hell is wrong with me...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 12:16:07	I feel sick. Really want that xanax. Never threw it away...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 12:14:07	But then again, crazy people don't like me either. Especially in person.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 12:12:02	I need like a meetup for only crazy people. I don't get regular people and they don't like me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 10:37:12	@ybnormal622 mine aren't that high...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 09:49:59	Everything I want to be, I am not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 09:40:55	I really hate being me this week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 09:29:03	@ybnormal622 I take 10 mg I think
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 09:18:27	@ybnormal622 thought my wife was a harem girl...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 09:13:19	@ybnormal622 lol. Sometimes I don't even realize what is happening (or who with).
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-22 08:54:31	Ambien is better than sex. I mean sex is better on ambien. I mean...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 10:59:58	@BigCityLilGirl mine is laced with anger. Took an ambien. Forced sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 09:36:30	This is my worst kinda of mood. The one where I don't want to let go until everything is better. Real productive...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 09:34:39	@bipolarvoice I un follow people who are just trying to advertise their book. Or who re tweet constantly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 09:23:09	@153Graces lol. Of course. But I angrily shove them away. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 09:12:17	@153Graces ok. Thanks. Not depressed. Upset and not coping well, so a bit angry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 09:07:42	@153Graces @AgainstSuicide ???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 09:03:19	I didn't even fit in at the mental hospital.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 09:02:29	Is there a point to trying to make yourself happy? Even when I don't sabotage myself, I fail. But I don't understand why so I feel helpless.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 08:58:35	@weswroten @ItsJackOk @Polarbear3127 @ukschizophrenic @BipolarBlogger @SchizophrenicGB my parents treated me like a kid, even when I was 40
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 08:57:11	@weswroten @ItsJackOk @Polarbear3127 @ukschizophrenic @BipolarBlogger @SchizophrenicGB no one knows about the mental illness. I act normal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 08:56:14	@thelilradish I believe. Just replaced my 10 year old desktop.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 08:39:00	That time you waited all year for this event. And when it happened, it suckes...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 08:38:03	I want to hit something. I did. Don't feel better. Fuck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 07:51:43	"If you work hard you can achieve anything" I call BS. What I have achieved, I don't work hard at. What I work hard at, I suck at.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 07:50:01	Fuck you all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-21 06:19:03	I suck. 7 years and I suck. Why don't people tell me these things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-20 11:41:59	I think people like to be miserable. Those who don't have problems of their own take on other people's issues.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-20 08:08:40	I am stuck in my head where no one can reach me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-20 07:56:25	I think the UP is breaking...at least I ought to sleep better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-20 05:57:26	I get so into these stories. I am genuinely upset now. Why do I do this?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-20 05:56:56	Oh and I keep asking the cop in the courtroom to just put a bullet in my head.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-20 05:56:32	It seems I am being tried for murdering the murderer, but I don't remember. And I seem to think I am being tried for the murder of my family
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-20 05:55:11	I am on trial. Apparently I watched my wife and kids murdered. Then I blacked out and woke up in prison.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-20 05:54:21	Telling myself those awful stories...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 21:54:15	An outlier amongst outliers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 21:53:51	Nothing. A day later and nothing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 10:12:56	@MariesVoice_MG saw you had a rough day. hope it gets better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 10:12:10	i would go to bed now, take the pill, and be out, but it is still so damn noisy here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 10:07:56	getting more and more angry...can't even tell why. should go to bed early, but this mood means i will go to bed late. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 09:52:56	just waiting to go to bed. i shouldn't complain that no one wants my company when i don't even want my company.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 09:49:33	and just when you thought things were looking up...they weren't
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 09:17:24	I have nothing to be unhappy about, but I am so damn tired that I am anyways. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 09:13:44	Maybe it's living, making us give in.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 09:12:43	We're getting older, the world's getting colder, for the life of me, I don't know the reason why.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 09:11:48	I really don't like that frozen fish from a bag. #firstworldproblems
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 09:10:37	It never gets easier as you get older. It's just hard in a different way. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 09:07:12	We're you violent as a child, the life of the party as a young adult, and riddled with anxiety as you got older? #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-19 08:14:58	its sad listening to people trying to make an intelligent argument.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-17 20:55:58	@ybnormal622 @153Graces humanity is resistant to change, so whatever the majority is is deemed "good" whether true or not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-17 20:55:12	@ybnormal622 @153Graces sure, but it just means a majority. If the majority were schizo, then rationality would be a deviation.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-17 10:47:53	I could rant all night but need to be up extra early. And too tired to want to stay up. Nite.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-17 10:46:32	@ybnormal622 @153Graces can cope just fine without that kind of health.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-17 10:46:15	@ybnormal622 @153Graces mental illness really just means deviation from societal norm. Healthy would then mean societal norm.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-17 10:16:34	@153Graces to heal implies it was once healthy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-17 10:09:36	Twitter is my vent. And my place where I admit things I won't tell my doctors.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-17 10:05:44	How should a 6 year old respond to being told over and over he is the smartest kid that this or that person has ever met. It's not helpful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-17 10:04:07	I may be arrogant about my strengths. But I admit my weaknesses. I am an absolute fucking genius. Other than that, I am a disaster.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-17 10:01:29	"Everyone could be gifted if they were taught correctly. " uh. No. Wishing it does not make it so. In fact most "gifted" kids aren't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-15 10:18:30	@MarieGibson05 I know. But knowing that helps control it. My pdoc didn't warn me how high a dose he gave me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-15 10:09:03	@ybnormal622 just staying home and eating...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-15 10:06:50	@ybnormal622 so sorry. Feel better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-15 10:05:37	@MarieGibson05 glad you feel better. I do so miss that stuff.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-15 10:04:41	@ybnormal622 isn't the drink "toddie"? Or were you talking about something else? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-15 09:56:39	I do make a very yummy sangria.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-14 10:06:03	My quads have been aching for 3 weeks. Hard to.be in a good mood. Maybe I should be a couch potato? I do like potatoes...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-14 10:02:28	The rewards of being a devoted gym rat...I am always sore. Ugh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-14 09:35:40	@MarieGibson05 no matter how down I am, I always turn on at bedtime. Good luck!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-14 09:26:04	Oh and for someone who will always see himself as too skinny, I look fat on video. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-14 09:25:32	I am not what I thought I was. Now I must try to be more than I am.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-14 09:24:34	I have turned mania into anxiety. I can screw up even the best of things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-13 23:10:24	@ybnormal622 mostly yeah. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-13 23:09:01	@ybnormal622 It's not that bad. Just stuck home with my kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-13 11:52:16	I have a hard enough time sleeping when my 3 year old doesn't cry and scream all night. I am almost afraid to go to bed tonight
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-13 06:10:10	I know life would be so much happier on xanax.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-13 06:09:32	Used to think I was addicted to alcohol but I drink socially now. Didn't drink as much as I took benzos but maybe?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-13 00:22:11	@nejireta_ki I always teased my wife for hiding in the closet when she is anxious. I get it now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-13 00:21:19	3 year old has been throwing a tantrum since 2 am. It's 11 am now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-12 02:04:57	I am hiding in the closet so my kids leave me alone
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-11 11:04:25	Or just thinks something sexual...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-11 11:04:00	That moment when you want to say something profound but your mind is blank...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-10 23:10:32	@ybnormal622 if they get hard it means you are pushing your limits and must only get stronger. It's a good sign.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-10 10:52:29	@ybnormal622 how are those planks coming along?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-10 05:49:47	It's so awful to realize over and over how people are happier without you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-10 05:48:25	Sick and tired of being sick and tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-10 04:56:47	Packing my house to move. Still having thoughts of not taking her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 13:18:03	@153Graces lol. You can do oooo it.....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 13:15:44	Break the cycle... Break the cycle... Dam it Break the cycle...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 13:14:11	I have to keep typing on twitter...so I DONT write any of this on facebook...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 13:13:06	Maybe it's the drink making me sad... dam #bipolar taking all the fun out of life. Expensive bottle of wine too...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 13:10:23	What is it about #bipolar that after a good day, I sit alone feeling miserable....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 13:09:48	Bed or another drink here alone...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 13:05:49	@153Graces haha. I am always like this. Maybe I am dramatic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 13:04:42	@BigCityLilGirl you look plastered. I'm jealous. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 13:02:33	@153Graces I could scream at the pain in some song lyrics and melodies.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 13:01:05	@153Graces eh. Don't get much of those. Enough to avoid the negative....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 13:00:18	It's been a long December and there's reason to believe maybe this year will be better than the last...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 12:58:00	@153Graces sounds intimate. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 12:56:55	@153Graces yeah always. Could be worse I guess...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 12:56:21	We couldn't all be cowboys, some of us are clowns...I light myself on fire and walk out on the wire once again....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 12:52:58	@153Graces hey margo... ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 12:52:22	Waiting for the moon to come and light me up inside...I am waiting for the telephone to tell.me I'm alive...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 12:51:42	Reaching out...is there anybody out there....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 04:20:07	Problem is I don't do alone well. And I would be alone. I don't get along well with others.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-09 04:19:09	Sick and tired of her. Wish she would just leave me alone. At these times I would rather be alone forever than with her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-08 11:43:30	If you don't like Russian politics, don't watch the olympics.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-08 10:29:51	I am in the worst mood. I hate people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-08 08:02:01	Well I stayed in bed all afternoon anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-08 05:20:28	Ambien quiets my mind but it's way too early for bed. #offswitch
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-08 05:18:47	Been a very long time since I craved xanax. Addicts suffer just as much when they are dry...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-07 10:28:51	Fuck me. I have listened to her for so long but when I am upset...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-05 03:30:21	@sam_stone152 when I sleep, I am the star of my own action movie. Not very restful. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-05 03:24:25	@MariesVoice_MG getting it out is different than telling that person. Telling them may cause you more stress depending on their reaction.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-05 03:23:23	I have been in the #twitterpsychward for 2 years now with no hope of release. There are worse places to be though. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-01 12:00:28	@ybnormal622 me too per my tdoc
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-01 08:34:30	@MadBikeWoman I know, right?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-01 07:34:25	I searched Google for how to get my son to do his chores without resorting to physical violence. I got one result: http://www. youcant.com
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-01 06:37:43	@teacathy nobody feels good for these reasons. They just lie to themselves. It causes more problems than it solves.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-01 06:36:58	@teacathy I think it is right on the money. My kids feel like crap getting participation awards. And the rest of it is pretty spot on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-01 06:26:19	@teacathy see my link
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-01 06:26:00	http:// m.huffpost.com/us/entry/46735 82 …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-01 06:25:06	@teacathy no. Why should I allow poor treatment?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-01 06:23:15	@teacathy no I wouldn't. I don't accept anyone's worst behavior. I tolerate it, expect improvement and an apology.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-01 06:14:55	@teacathy not at all. Why should you accept me at my worst? Is my best such a prize?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-02-01 05:29:58	If you won't accept me at my worst, then you deserve someone better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-31 23:08:28	It's good to have friends to give you perspective when you have lost it completely and utterly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-31 21:53:05	@MadBikeWoman I disagreed with someone about the death penalty
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-31 11:23:08	Death threat on facebook. Wow. Some people....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-31 03:02:16	@teacathy that is the best to hope for some days...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 03:31:24	@teacathy school is closed today and tomorrow while they clean up the roads.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 03:25:44	@teacathy yes. But it took him 7 hours to get home after school was dismissed early. 1st bus brought him back to school. 2nd got stuck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 03:15:39	@ybnormal622 @teacathy went around to the other end. 2 hours at least.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 03:15:13	@ybnormal622 @teacathy you don't know the half of it. My road was closed at one end. Quarter mile from my house.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 03:08:48	@ybnormal622 @teacathy haha. It'll be in the 60s this weekend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 03:05:19	@ybnormal622 @teacathy I was stuck for 4 hours just picking up my 3yo from daycare 3 or 4 miles away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 03:04:30	@153Graces @ybnormal622 @teacathy thanks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 03:04:12	@ybnormal622 @teacathy had to get my son when his bus got stuck. He was wearing a tshirt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 03:02:46	@ybnormal622 @teacathy after we were talking about snow the other day. Sure you want to come here in winter???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 02:53:34	@ybnormal622 @teacathy yeah but there are people and kids stuck on the roads for 24 hours. Out of gas. No heat. No food or water.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 02:47:58	@ybnormal622 @teacathy kids get today and tomorrow. I get today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 02:40:08	@ybnormal622 @teacathy point and laugh really hard. We deserve it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 02:39:46	@ybnormal622 @teacathy nah not the drivers. The roads are all ice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 02:39:14	@ybnormal622 @teacathy don't need a shovel. Not enough snow to bother. They didn't want to spend the money to pretreat the roads.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 02:36:05	@ybnormal622 @teacathy georgia. 2.6 inches of snow. National Guard just called in.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-30 02:32:01	@ybnormal622 @teacathy have you seen what is going on down here in my part of the country?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-28 22:03:14	@BipolarGirlLife you need to take a break from society. I have done that. Had to stop working for awhile because I couldn't function.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-28 22:02:28	@BipolarGirlLife if you are having sleep problems talk to your psychiatrist. If you can't function according to societies rules then ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-28 22:01:37	@BipolarGirlLife I am bipolar and a college prof. I wouldn't excuse you. Taking your meds late is not medical.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-28 00:05:14	@teacathy @153Graces @ybnormal622 yes fortunately. Trying to keep my mind properly focused today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 23:01:29	@153Graces @ybnormal622 thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 08:58:42	Anxiety subsided for awhile. Coming back again. Afraid even ambien won't help me sleep. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 07:03:54	@teacathy no. Wish I was
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 06:56:56	@BigCityLilGirl that is about all I am doing well. Thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 06:52:02	The hypomania broke on friday. The panic attack hit today. I am curled up on the floor of the nursery hiding from it all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 06:50:05	@ybnormal622 mentally
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 06:36:40	@BigCityLilGirl me too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 06:32:55	Do you know when you are lying to yourself?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 06:21:35	I'm too ill to take care of others who are ill.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 04:20:47	Trying not to throw things or put my fist through a wall.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 04:16:50	Hate hate hate hate my life
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 03:56:03	I don't believe in god. But something better grant me serenity really fucking quickly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-27 03:53:10	ANXIETY. I think I am making a big mistake. I do not handle stress well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 22:30:41	@BigCityLilGirl of course. Are coffee places open at 3 am? I remember just bars diners and groceries. Back then though we had freedom.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 22:28:18	@BigCityLilGirl wouldn't it be easier to buy soy milk in a corner grocery?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 13:02:08	Midnight. Pumpkin time. Goodnight moon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 12:58:43	@teacathy @ybnormal622 what me worry? HA
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 12:56:26	@ybnormal622 @teacathy lol. I told. He said don't tell him that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 12:55:26	@teacathy @ybnormal622 hey...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 12:55:04	@ybnormal622 @teacathy pdoc
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 12:54:53	@ybnormal622 @teacathy I drink with ambien for fun. My proc doesn't like that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 12:43:29	@ybnormal622 there is no such thing as too much fun. Trust me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 12:37:10	@ybnormal622 yes. Although it may hit you hard once you do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 12:22:30	@ritalongtweets I toast you! We be alone together.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 12:04:33	@ybnormal622 @teacathy batman
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:59:23	@ybnormal622 @teacathy lol. Okay. I like older women. My wife is 44.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:50:19	@Im_Batman_Son @ybnormal622 @teacathy careful. She may want to drink it all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:49:43	@teacathy @ybnormal622 i love you girls, even if you are babies. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:48:04	@teacathy @ybnormal622 my 9 year old likes vodka. All my kids like red wine, incl. the 3yo
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:45:53	@ybnormal622 @teacathy now that is a mom after my own heart. Has the 16 year old do a liquor run.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:43:20	@teacathy @ybnormal622 you and I will just have to keep the party going.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:40:54	@ybnormal622 @teacathy awwww. Come on. Don't be a wuss. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:38:19	@ybnormal622 @teacathy all the better. We should find a way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:37:40	@teacathy @ybnormal622 hey we are drinking. That is all that counts.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:37:16	@ybnormal622 @teacathy @Im_Batman_Son lol. She is pretty. Does she like younger men? I got an adorable 12 year old.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:33:41	@teacathy @ybnormal622 hehehe. That I am.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:33:09	@teacathy @ybnormal622 we are down to just over $3/gal
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:32:38	@ybnormal622 @teacathy ha. 30 anything is a beautiful babe.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:32:09	@ybnormal622 @teacathy you type drunk. Lol. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:31:34	@teacathy @ybnormal622 haha. I am from ny but have lived here for a dozen years. So I do a little.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:30:48	@teacathy @ybnormal622 I guess I am the old man here. 7th or 8th for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:30:05	@teacathy @ybnormal622 lmao. Nobody drives those cars here. All trucks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:29:30	@ybnormal622 @teacathy damn. You make me feel old.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:27:52	@ybnormal622 y ' all have more snow in a day than I have seen in 10 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:26:09	@teacathy @ybnormal622 hope you have a nice big truck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:23:23	@ybnormal622 lol. Well you have me. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:22:52	@ybnormal622 @teacathy yeah I live in the south. My kids school closed a few weeks ago because it was cold.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:21:41	@ybnormal622 don't you feel spoiled.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:21:12	@teacathy weather???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:16:36	@teacathy do you usually work?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:16:17	@teacathy I so wanted to go out. Nothing interesting to do so didn't bother.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 11:08:39	Anyone else home on Saturday night?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 09:21:36	@ybnormal622 that is tough. I didn't have my first until 30. My twenties were a blast. Miss them terribly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 09:14:06	@ybnormal622 I used to be very irresponsible. But now my kids are bigger and I don't want to be THAT dad. But tired is right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 09:05:02	I hate having to be responsible all the time. But If I am not then my already sad existence will suck even more. Dammed either way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 07:38:28	Clean and showered. Don't think the cat really cares though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 07:36:44	@BigCityLilGirl better late than ugly???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 03:12:13	@ybnormal622 shorts and t shirts in January. Nuff said.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 01:32:07	So I am moving to the DC area this summer. Yippee. At least I will be near casinos again. The south is nice but seriosusly uptight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 01:30:43	@BigCityLilGirl haha. I am not soft just cause i moved away. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 01:30:04	@BigCityLilGirl lol. and they say new yorkers aren't nice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 01:27:37	I don't lie to myself anymore. Maybe I would be happier if I did.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 01:25:21	Even "better", we don't meet people by accident, they cross over our path for for a reason. Wow. No wonder I can't relate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-26 01:21:38	Everything that happens happens for a reason. Really? When trying to figure out your twisted reasoning, start there. #peoplearedumb
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-25 07:17:53	I hate working but sometimes it is better than living.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-25 07:16:42	Every friday night I get a headache. and guess what it is now?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-25 07:15:45	@153Graces thanks but you misunderstood. I don't feel bad about feeling good. I feel like I acted foolish. Pretty common to do so if manic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-25 06:10:48	Talk about taking a dive off the mood cliff.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-25 05:55:13	And i had been in a pretty good mood all day. I feel rotten now. Like a fool for feeling good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-25 05:46:02	When I get this angry and upset I shake. And then I get impulsive and say things without thinking. Going to try and just hide for a little.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-25 05:45:01	@teacathy lmao. Not even close. Not real paranoia. More the colloquial sense.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-25 05:44:28	I probably am not In the right mood to grade right now...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-25 05:44:12	At the same time my wife is being harassed by her boss and coworker, both women. Bitches.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-25 05:43:20	My father is being paranoid and he doesn't listen
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-24 09:09:30	@BigCityLilGirl I don't have a face...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-24 05:05:09	@MariesVoice_MG i recently discovered the pleasure of hiding in the closet myself. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 23:11:41	@MariesVoice_MG you feel awful because you are reliving the PAST in your mind. Keep perspective. Just cry it out and sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 22:15:19	@ritalongtweets quite. Slept okay though. Now just have to get up. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 11:26:45	@ybnormal622 I wake up lately at 4 am and my mind is racing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 11:19:35	@ybnormal622 It's a thought. But I have to lift tomorrow and it makes me groggy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 11:17:58	@nejireta_ki lol. Coffee is the new beer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 11:17:30	@ybnormal622 I don't want to take ambien cause I will need it tomorrow. But gaaaahhh. I wake up when my head hits the pillow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 11:10:03	Don't feel bad. Just feel tired. Probably won't sleep. How do I know? Because tomorrow is a busy day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 11:05:15	@nejireta_ki i always overload the caffeine then hit the gym for some adrenaline. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 11:03:35	@nejireta_ki well you don't look it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 11:02:36	@nejireta_ki you have a pic posted of you with your girl. You both look 25.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 11:01:37	@nejireta_ki idk. We feel bad so often. It's the only good part.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 11:00:45	@nejireta_ki if that pic in the skirt is you, your a baby... :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 10:59:23	@nejireta_ki that is ridiculous. You have to wallow in depression sometimes and ride the highs a little. It's moderation that is important.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 10:57:49	@nejireta_ki that's me. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 10:55:32	@ybnormal622 yw. That is great for what 2 days? It should take a few weeks to get to three sets of a minute or more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 07:52:45	@weswroten not my fault my wife looks like a watermelom. J/k
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 07:51:50	I feel like annoying people. Which means I should do my best not to talk to anyone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 07:47:03	When I am most tired, I cannot sleep. Almost wish I was depressed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-23 07:21:40	I always scored very low on purity tests (done a lot of weird stuff I guess) but never sexted. I feel like I've missed out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-22 07:41:12	I once kissed this girl that looked like Kate Beckinsale. And I just saw her again. Sigh...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 22:59:50	@nejireta_ki thanks. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 22:43:20	@nejireta_ki lol. I've done that. Head wants it body doesnt. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 22:32:36	@nejireta_ki lol. Well enjoy it if you want to. And sleep tight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 22:01:19	@nejireta_ki you ought to sleep very well tonight. Drink some water to counteract the beer's dehydration.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 21:55:56	@nejireta_ki just remind yourself the mood swings are symptoms not your real feelings.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 21:54:42	@nejireta_ki yeah but you certainly needed it for now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 21:51:55	@nejireta_ki maybe that explains it all. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 21:51:39	@nejireta_ki I hope everything went well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 11:15:48	@ybnormal622 haha. It's my addiction. I have to rest so I train my wife and oldest son.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 11:14:59	@ybnormal622 good
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 11:13:52	@ybnormal622 yw. let me know how it goes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 11:12:02	@ybnormal622 you would be surprised what you can do. My wife has bad knees and I now have her squatting with 40 lbs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 11:11:04	@ybnormal622 yes. Of course. Just think happy thoughts when it gets hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 11:09:15	@ybnormal622 feet on a chair. You need to be doing regular pushup position (on hands not elbows).
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 11:08:02	@ybnormal622 it will strengthen your core. You can work up to 2 to 3 sets of 1 minute. You can make it more challenging by putting your
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 11:01:01	@ybnormal622 yes. That means you worked really hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 10:59:09	@ybnormal622 get into pushup position and hold your legs and back flat as a plank. Hold as long as possible. You can start on your elbows.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 10:57:36	@ybnormal622 more annoying is the 9 year old feeds the cats twice a day but never gives them fresh water.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 10:56:36	@ybnormal622 do you do planks?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 10:54:12	@ybnormal622 well the cheese was from the 3 year old. The 9 year old left cat food all over the bathroom floor.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 10:49:25	@ybnormal622 for real? Kettle bells are cool.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 10:48:20	@ybnormal622 found cheese from half eaten pizza on my blanket too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 10:28:52	Is there a kennel for kids?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 10:23:01	Omg I feel like my house is straight out of hoarders. Except that everything is always on the floor. #anxiety #triggering
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-21 10:20:22	@nejireta_ki best of luck. You would never know what the right decision is if you had remained indecisive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-20 10:44:35	@teacathy @ybnormal622 when you have kids, work is a vacation.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 12:46:26	@BigCityLilGirl that is why I take karate and lift weights. Gotta hit something.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 12:45:05	@BigCityLilGirl I hate people. Most are insensitive and very self centered. I want to be nice but I figure if I am I get taken advantage of
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 12:43:44	@BigCityLilGirl but it isn't any better anywhere else.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 12:43:20	@BigCityLilGirl it's ny. On time is early.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 12:39:01	@teacathy lol. I have been an adult as long as I can remember. I don't remember liking it much once I decided it was good to be responsible.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 12:34:25	@teacathy I am like a little kid that doesn't want to go to bed cause he might miss something.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 12:29:26	Hate going to bed when sad but too damn tired to stay up. Too to be angry about it too. I give up. Goodnight moon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 11:59:49	@ybnormal622 @teacathy thanks. I feel the same about you two.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 11:48:22	@ybnormal622 @teacathy that isn't even just a catchy thing to say. They are kinder.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 11:47:32	@ybnormal622 I just believe in taking care of your own. Anything you give to strangers you take away from your friends and family.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 11:46:08	@teacathy no. Never really alone. At least there are always people and cats around. Still alone anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 11:39:44	@teacathy nothing. Busted evening.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 11:31:22	Too tired to be too depressed so I guess that is a good thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 11:25:24	@ybnormal622 I don't help people I don't care about.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 10:53:35	Too tired to drink. How sad is that. What a depressing Saturday night.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 10:37:56	Too tired to go out and no one to go see. Fuck me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 09:59:58	@BigCityLilGirl best kind.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 09:58:05	@BigCityLilGirl saw some pics. Looked like a fun disaster?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 09:56:09	@BigCityLilGirl and I need to find more good wine like I had last night. Then I can be really annoying.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 09:52:32	@BigCityLilGirl stoned yet...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 09:27:16	@BigCityLilGirl It looks like I am going nowhere too so after dinner I will come annoy you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 08:45:59	@teacathy we are people. Even though we just look like trying on a screen next to an image.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 06:51:31	@Kfastlove too bad. A suntan is so much better than a scientific trip to the north.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 06:22:52	@Kfastlove also parents at least by me can always pull their kid from school and home school them. The polar trek would prolly fit that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 06:21:59	@Kfastlove well i would need more info but a polar trek sounds very educational and not easy to come by.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 06:04:29	@Kfastlove without a reason to skip school, we cannot excuse the absence. This isn't unfair treatment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 06:03:15	@Kfastlove the 1st teen had what would be considered an educational trip. Apparently the second teen just was going away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 05:59:35	@Kfastlove I am assuming by your post the 2nd teen wants to take a vacation when it isn't vacation time. What is the reason?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 05:58:56	@Kfastlove #conspiracy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 05:50:44	@Kfastlove so? I have taught disadvantaged youth. There is more to this than who has more money.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-19 04:10:16	@BigCityLilGirl go to texas...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 13:46:11	Goodnight all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 13:13:15	@ybnormal622 rain rain go away...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 13:08:02	@ybnormal622 maybe. I'd have to find it first.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 13:05:17	@ybnormal622 never really finished it. And hopefully i am not like that character
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 13:03:48	@ybnormal622 no. A name of a character in a story i wrote.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 13:01:49	@ybnormal622 goodnight sleep tight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:54:15	@ybnormal622 @teacathy agreed. Very very very much agreed. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:51:04	@ybnormal622 @teacathy that is how I always feel.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:47:21	@teacathy @ybnormal622 quite an evening.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:40:05	@ybnormal622 @teacathy depends on how much he understands your temper. I'm sure he'll like the attentions though
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:36:31	@ybnormal622 @teacathy you could lock the squirrel in there. Good reason not to do anything in there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:33:27	@ybnormal622 @teacathy I had a crawlspace in my house growing up. Used to go there all the time. My wife and I had sex there when dating.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:30:01	@teacathy haha. yeah.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:29:10	@ybnormal622 @teacathy I wouldn't talk to my wife for a week. But then again I have have a bit of a temper.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:27:05	@teacathy I'm a guy...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:26:49	@teacathy in a cemetery in the snow?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:26:13	@ybnormal622 @teacathy don't blame the squirrel...lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:22:29	@ybnormal622 @teacathy only a little more than half a bottle of wine. But I drank it fast.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:21:42	@ybnormal622 @teacathy me no. Married 18 years, not usually happily, with 3 kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:20:51	@teacathy no but 8 seconds is a lot of pressure...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:20:29	@teacathy oh we are now doing it on the table?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:19:58	@ybnormal622 @teacathy lmao. I am watching this weird rendition of Anna karenina
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:17:24	@teacathy me bashful? Never. Really. Try me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:15:57	@ybnormal622 @teacathy watching an awful movie
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 12:11:32	@teacathy you too or you agree that I am?

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 11:09:33	@ybnormal622 @teacathy can't let young girls have too much fun...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 11:08:16	@ybnormal622 it might be the messages only stay for a short time too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 11:08:00	@ybnormal622 I haven't used to. Sounds like it's quite racy

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 09:20:22	@BigCityLilGirl ahhhh. That explains. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 08:42:16	@ybnormal622 @teacathy I will leave the boy watching to you girls.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 08:39:25	@BigCityLilGirl yeah. At least sometimes. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 08:34:03	@teacathy @ybnormal622 no. And you wouldn't want us to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 08:33:40	@BigCityLilGirl you want advice. Girls shouldn't go to Brooklyn at night.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 06:57:56	@teacathy ahh if only...lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 06:52:17	@teacathy not likely with people half their age though
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 06:49:40	@teacathy yeah when she was a girl. She is 70 now and just got over a bout with cancer
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 06:40:28	@teacathy yeah don't want to score with her. She hasn't been particularly attractive for like 25 or 30 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 06:37:10	@teacathy lmfao. To cock block is to keep a guy from "scoring" with a girl.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 06:34:39	@teacathy lol. Never heard the expression?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-18 06:33:22	I am really good at cock blocking myself. Dammit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-16 23:58:00	@teacathy @ybnormal622 winter here I come. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-16 23:37:06	@teacathy @ybnormal622 my house is very very loud. Maybe I can just take shelter with you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-16 21:26:55	Nobody really likes honesty
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-16 21:25:55	I want to be perfect. Will accept just doing my best. Have a hard time doing the minimum.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-16 21:24:52	It is only perfect of everyone agrees but what is beautiful to 1 person is ugly to another. Hence we cannot be perfect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-16 11:48:27	@teacathy oh she is the sweetest person you would ever meet. Everyone loves her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-16 11:29:00	@teacathy lol. Right
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-16 11:27:43	@teacathy 5 days. It takes the whole time for me to warm up to her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-16 11:05:30	@teacathy thanks. I always hope to enjoy her company and I always just feel anger and resentment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-16 11:03:04	She has always just seen the worst in me. Was convinced I was abusing wife. Bitch.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-16 11:01:32	Mom comes to visit tomorrow. Wonder if I can try to enjoy seeing her now that she is having problems of her own and needs me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-13 05:31:44	Don't talk about things you don't know about.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-13 03:20:29	@MariesVoice_MG my wife said that but she now dead lifts her own bodyweight. Just need the right person to teach you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-13 03:03:53	@MariesVoice_MG learn to powerlift. You will be strong and feel great.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-12 12:51:19	@teacathy highest point on the food pyramid.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-12 12:04:26	And wine is a food group too....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-12 12:04:12	Yummy food celebration. Butter is a food group.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-12 09:23:47	@ybnormal622 you have very interesting animal experiences. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-12 08:46:53	@ybnormal622 could be worse. It could be a duck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-12 07:51:03	Bottle of Margaux. Couple of Lobsters.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-11 02:19:52	@BigCityLilGirl me too. We must give out a vibe. I tried more showers but It didn't help.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 22:04:45	@ybnormal622 been there. It just has to be the right home. It's time to move now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 22:03:58	@nejireta_ki went back into treatment 3 years ago. On my own terms
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 11:43:06	@nejireta_ki I was a teenager. I didn't see the doctors as trying to help me. They were the ones locking me up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 11:05:25	@nejireta_ki I am really good at acting sane. I am too smart for my own good. I knew what to tell doctors.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 07:03:16	@BigCityLilGirl biting is fine. But no bestiality.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 07:00:54	@BigCityLilGirl chihuahua. Bite my ankles. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 06:46:51	@BigCityLilGirl you can try to kick mine if you can.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 06:32:13	@BigCityLilGirl lol yup.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 06:24:48	But I don't have to be nice, this Is twitter...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 03:57:26	@ybnormal622 used to move every 1 or 2 years but it's been 10 now and I hate the house we live in. Still moving does suck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 03:24:42	@teacathy government job.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 02:45:57	@teacathy thank you!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 02:45:45	@BigCityLilGirl thank you. I have no idea how I stayed patient. Now we move.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-10 02:30:00	After more than a year and a half I finally got this job I have been aiming for. Yay

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 21:28:03	@nejireta_ki wife seemed normal back then. And to be honest I was never diagnosed with anything when I was hospitalized.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 12:06:07	@nejireta_ki yes. It's why I went back into treatment 3 years ago actually.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 12:01:58	I suppose I will try going to sleep. More like sit around thinking why I suck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:40:54	@nejireta_ki 3 kids. The oldest is on meds. Middle one has his problems but isn't "mentally ill". And 3 year olds are supposed to be crazy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:37:30	@nejireta_ki yeah. Depression, anxiety and panic attacks. And she doesn't accept responsibility very well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:33:50	@outfromthedark i will take a virtual one. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:33:10	@nejireta_ki I think he is bipolar. He has asked to increase the risperidone. He thinks it helps the most.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:32:35	@nejireta_ki the concerta makes his anxious and the zoloft makes him hyperactive. So he takes the riseperidone to calm it all down.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:31:36	@nejireta_ki he is only diagnosed with adhd and anxiety. He takes concerta for the adhd, zoloft for the anxiety.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:28:14	@nejireta_ki that's right. I think you told me that. My son is on that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:24:38	@nejireta_ki are you on any meds? Do you mind me asking these questions?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:18:11	@outfromthedark life sucks that way
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:12:33	@outfromthedark I agree but for me it is usually unpleasant.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:11:37	@nejireta_ki you went in for a day every 3 weeks? Are you in any therapy now?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:05:57	@outfromthedark I am gonna look that up. Songs always cue up with me too. They are life markers for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:04:45	@nejireta_ki better to be in treatment. I wasn't for 15 years. What was your longest stay?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 11:03:54	@outfromthedark I don't know that song. What is it? Who is he for that matter?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 10:49:15	@nejireta_ki making anything more than cereal is usually hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 10:44:12	@nejireta_ki 4 timed I think. But the last one was almost 20 years ago
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 10:43:13	@teacathy that song almost make me cry everytime.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 10:42:42	I am so fucking tired of being me. I don't have it bad, but I just am sick of myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 10:40:11	@nejireta_ki me too. Hope you feel bettet.

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-09 07:09:11	Yup it is always someone else's fault. Like politicians. Yeah them. Let's blame them for the dirty dishes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 10:18:53	To another FB friend that she was still very pretty as a comment to an old pic with both of them. Now I am her very good friend again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 10:17:59	Girls are funny. An old friend barely talks to me because she thinks I made fun of her on FB. Today I wrote...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 08:44:14	@nejireta_ki yeah pretty okay. Have fun. Ttyl.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 08:43:32	@nejireta_ki I didn't realize Melbourne was that far south. I am not completely ignorant. I've seen Priscilla Queen of the Desert. :)

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 08:41:22	@nejireta_ki pic for the ignorant yank? Lol. Actually it helps. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 08:36:06	@nejireta_ki cause he took you for granted before. Now you can make the decision...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 08:30:37	@nejireta_ki good for you. You finally did it!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 08:15:53	@nejireta_ki sounds like you are doing good right now?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 08:15:18	@nejireta_ki that is great for you. I wish so badly I could take them. I could be a massive addict if I let myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 08:11:25	@nejireta_ki I used to take the equivalent of that in klonopin to sleep. When I didn't take any for a week I went into withdrawal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 07:58:55	@nejireta_ki I didn't realize how much I was on. When you wrote 85 mg and we're not dead I had to look up the equivalents.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 07:57:58	@nejireta_ki I double checked valium is 10 times xanax. But I was on klonopin and valium is 20 times klonopin.

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 05:17:05	Just read that klonopin is twice as strong as xanax. That means my 2 mg klonopin pill that I used to take for sleep was like 4 mg of xanax
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-08 04:47:47	@nejireta_ki hope you're doing better. I never drank with benzos but I used to take up to 3+ mg/day of xanax which is like 60 mg of valium
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-07 23:12:43	@nejireta_ki is that like the medal they give my kids for just showing up?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-07 23:12:09	@nejireta_ki Or a head examination. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-07 12:31:12	I have had a few very yummy drinks. :)

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-07 11:46:06	@BigCityLilGirl does it count for anything that I look 10 years younger, even if I feel 10 years older sometimes.

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-06 09:31:02	@MariesVoice_MG crying is good for the soul. Being raised as a boy, I don't cry, but it's very cathartic when I can get choked up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-06 09:29:18	@MariesVoice_MG good. Better to smile than cry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-06 09:28:24	Not having a job is a trigger too. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-06 09:28:11	Having a job is one trigger.

500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-06 00:37:37	I ate yesterday like I was a garbage pail. Don't even want to look at food but I have to eat something before I go to the gym.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-05 00:11:01	@ybnormal622 it may have been the manic side of me that gave me the cpnfidence. I don't know. Still miss it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-04 13:21:05	@ybnormal622 I used to love them when I thought much higher of myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-04 12:50:43	@ybnormal622 it is at a party
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-04 12:37:14	@MariesVoice_MG if we can change for the better, there must be people changing for the worse
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-04 12:34:49	@pinguinokx head pats and soothing nooses. great effort.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-04 12:27:12	I am youthful and on great shape. But I am way too shy. Parties are not my forte.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-04 12:17:33	just hate these parties we go to, reminds me how desirable I used to be but don't seem to be any longer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-04 04:14:20	Boy did I just waste the day. 3 PM and I haven't started work yet
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 13:54:45	oh boy, shouldn't still be up. have work now. few more minutes. then nite nite twitworld.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 13:42:46	phone died, but i have lots of internet access.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 13:07:30	@ybnormal622 something good can often come of anything.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 13:04:32	@ybnormal622 that's too bad. Is he your kids' dad? Does he visit them?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 13:02:05	@ybnormal622 very nice. Why not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 12:59:31	@ybnormal622 sounds eventful
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 12:59:19	@ybnormal622 how sweet. He is good at getting you to let him stay up. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 12:57:16	@ybnormal622 aren't you central time? It's not that late yet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 12:50:46	@ybnormal622 just teasing you. I know you are not a fan. And only college is over on monday.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 12:46:53	@ybnormal622 you mean you aren't watching football??? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 12:15:45	Either no one I follow tweets or the app hates me. Fine I will talk to myself. So there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 12:14:56	Hate the twitter app. Hate my computer more. Bleh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 12:03:12	Anxious or depressed. Flip a coin. Winner winner.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 11:24:48	Not fair that only girls can fish for compliments.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 10:54:56	@nejireta_ki didn't know that. We have so much crap on TV here. Sorry to hear you have to see it too. How embarrassing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 10:52:10	@nejireta_ki i always thought it was strange how the rest of the world knew so much about us. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 10:32:11	@nejireta_ki now the cynical answer. Americans are just as ignorant about america.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 10:31:46	@nejireta_ki because we are proud of our country and because we have so much we like about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 10:30:31	People are arrogant. Only humans have this concept of human rights. Rights inherent because we are human.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 10:23:40	@nejireta_ki Americans know Europe. It's the Old Country for many of us. Very romanticized in the culture here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 10:10:15	@nejireta_ki wish I knew what that meant. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:54:20	@nejireta_ki don't judge us by california. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:52:07	@nejireta_ki I live now in the southeast. Moving near DC
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:51:26	@nejireta_ki the western desert in the us is supposed to be amazing. I have wanted to go for years since I saw Thelma and Louise
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:48:21	@nejireta_ki that is awful. I don't like humidity. A lot of that in NY. I live more inland now although I am moving north and to the coast.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:47:10	@nejireta_ki you live in Australia and you want to see our little desert. Ha. I lived in NY most of my life. Happy to be gone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:44:02	@nejireta_ki I am okay with heat though. Don't like wearing sweaters and heavy clothes. So prefer warm.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:42:16	@nejireta_ki what parts here? It's a very diverse place.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:39:36	@nejireta_ki I had wondered what your profile meant. I understand now. I understand. I always preferred night as it felt less oppressive
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:38:35	@nejireta_ki very jealous. I have been to 4, including my own.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:36:35	@nejireta_ki usually depression sufferers hate winter not summer. You are different. That can be good though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:35:48	@nejireta_ki there are worse places to be. I would love to see it but doubt I ever will. So far.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:34:07	@nejireta_ki good idea. Cancer runs in my family big time. Awful thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:32:39	@nejireta_ki do you have a permanent burn then?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:26:26	@nejireta_ki I thought Australia had 4 seasons just at different times. Shows what I know. You should see the snow mountains one day
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:23:52	@nejireta_ki really? Snow is pretty cool when you don't have to be amywhere. Isn't there mountains down there at all?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 09:22:06	@nejireta_ki it might snow here. You can have that if you like too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 07:22:38	Worked most of day. Result. Too tired to sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-03 03:29:31	It's cold and rainy. The worst kind of day. And to top it off, I am back to work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 23:58:36	@nejireta_ki @ybnormal622 technically a lot of life is pointless. Video games give me no rush and don't focus me personally.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 12:10:52	It's my New Year's Revolution to overthrow the old me. Welcome to 2014!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:53:44	@ybnormal622 and a very goodnight to you too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:39:20	@ybnormal622 sounds perfect. No apologies necessary.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:37:07	@ybnormal622 as a play toy for the women?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:33:33	@ybnormal622 hahaha. Me neither. So I I twit. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:29:11	@ybnormal622 eh. Video games are so pointless. I get no rush from them. My oldest son is addicted to them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:27:21	@ybnormal622 if by good you mean enjoyable. Otherwise just shades of not bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:23:09	@ybnormal622 looking more for something to feed my addictive personality.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:22:50	@ybnormal622 lol. You were serious. My mom taught me to knit once. Not the kind of distraction I had in mind.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:21:42	I have truly never cared if someone thought I was dumb. Used to try to seem dumb in high school to fit in better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:19:55	@ybnormal622 lmao. Yeah. That sounds very exciting. Maybe I could pearl too. Heheh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:18:32	When I see all the typos and lousy grammar in my tweets, I can't help but laugh. It's a good thing I have no complexes about my intelligence
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:15:52	@ybnormal622 my mom shut off the breaker to my room. I thought it was a black out and went to bed. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:13:53	I can't stand listening to people whine about #stigma . Put yourselves in the shoes of other people. I would act the same as them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:10:25	I only ate pizza and protein shakes today. Could've been worse. I just drank diet coke at McDonald's
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:08:48	@ybnormal622 don't argue. If he doesn't turn it off, take the plug.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 11:07:39	If I am not gonna drink or do drugs, then I need a gf or start gambling. Some sort of outlet ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 10:53:38	If my cursing offends you, you suffer from the extremely common disorder of over sensitivity. The only known cure is to get a life. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 10:51:38	Excuse me but fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck shit fuck fuck fuck. Et cetera. ..
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 10:51:06	Really don't feel well. Heart pounding through my chest. And my mouth is sore from sucking, a subtle way I have found to express my anxiety.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 10:48:18	Don't abuse the re tweet feature. Please
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 10:10:49	Well my 6 week vacation is done. Gotta work tomorrow. Fuck me. The anxiety has been building all day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 07:27:45	I am not responsible for the feelings of others. Mine own are difficult enough. If I offend you, suck it up. I have to every day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 07:17:37	@ybnormal622 @MariesVoice_MG with my wandering eye? Heheheh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 07:17:09	Better to be diagnosed bipolar and in treatment than to hide and not get treatment. Responsible employers.know this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 07:16:14	#Bipolar doesnt have to be career ending as long as you are upfront and stick with treatment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 07:10:13	@ybnormal622 @MariesVoice_MG hey I resemble that remark. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 07:02:42	@ybnormal622 overly creative.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 04:35:45	Think about it. What would life be like if the bullet you put in your head didn't kill you but took away all your speech and motor abilities
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 04:34:23	What used to keep me from suicide was the thought that I always screwed up. If I failed at suicide, I could be mangled for life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 03:37:48	@MariesVoice_MG yay! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 03:36:15	@MariesVoice_MG don't beat yourself up. Let go of the bad and remind yourself what you did good today it's impossible to be perfect. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 03:31:32	@MariesVoice_MG i avoid my family. I also realize now that they have those same bad habits I used to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 03:30:43	@MariesVoice_MG i know you have done that it's lonely. But it helps to allow yourself to be who you want to be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 03:29:56	@MariesVoice_MG I am glad. what helped me was to stop hanging out with people that wouldn't stop seeing me as who I used to be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 03:21:09	@MariesVoice_MG I don't know what you have done. But I used to think that. Now I realize I made myself out much worse than I was.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 03:20:02	@MariesVoice_MG you don't need to be a good person to forgive yourself. Nobody else is that good. Really. Don't put them on a pedestal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 02:27:42	@BigCityLilGirl idk. Read that bloomberg list you posted doesn't seem as much fun a place anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 02:26:31	@BigCityLilGirl haha. I am not moving out of the country. Actually moving about 8 hours closer to NY.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-02 02:24:14	Need to make a list of things to do before we move. Like visit this or that...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 13:43:11	@ybnormal622 I feel so adult. Next year I may be asleep before mkdnight. Ugh. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 13:42:48	@ybnormal622 I had 3 or 4 drinks over 5 or 6 hours. Not the usual bottle or two of wine. Very sober. But better than sick. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 13:38:09	@ybnormal622 or I just got old...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 13:26:44	I am the most sober on NYE since nineteen eighty something when I was eleven not sure if that is good or not. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 12:32:27	@ybnormal622 no hate here. None at all. Add gambling and exercising. Adrenaline stuff. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 12:29:17	@ybnormal622 music food and sex. My 3 favorite things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 11:40:18	@ybnormal622 10 year tawny port here
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 11:20:41	Happy new years everyone. May 2014 be everything you want it to be. And for those of you suffering, I love you all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 11:19:23	#peoplewhomademy2013 @nejireta_ki @ybnormal622 @BigCityLilGirl
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 08:27:07	@nejireta_ki I will. Happy new year. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 08:22:15	@nejireta_ki their lyrics are always so good and perceptive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 08:21:53	@nejireta_ki don't remember anything after the personal jesus album. I have always been more of a metalhead.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 08:05:04	@nejireta_ki wow. Haven't listened to them in 20 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 07:55:56	Enjoying a sangria appetizer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 07:53:30	The Napa Cabernet is decanted....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 07:49:07	It was a good day. Let's see if I can keep this happy mood into the New Year.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 07:48:09	@Wanting_freedom same time here. Just sitting here waiting too... happy early nye!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 07:36:07	@nejireta_ki nice. Who are they?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 04:43:22	my cousin is raving about broccoli and kidney bean ice cream. and now i know why i moved south.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 04:36:27	I think I would rather be last than be second.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 03:24:27	Now I just Deadlifted the equivalent of 300 lbs for the first time in 10 years. Next year going for 400.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 03:23:35	First I get confirmation that after a year and a half, I am actually gonna be hired for the job I really wanted
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 03:22:57	Okay. Year is ending on a serious high note.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 03:15:19	Must not drink that sangria until I have FINISHED lifting weights. Oh the very bad ideas I get sometimes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 01:50:17	@BigCityLilGirl point well made.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 01:48:29	@BigCityLilGirl eh. I lived in Queens for years. It just isn't as cool as the city that never sleeps, cause who likes to sleep?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 01:45:55	@BigCityLilGirl @HailoNYC queens isn't part of the city. don't you know that?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 00:32:21	Moving to Maryland this summer it appears. Woohoo?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 00:27:45	Omg. At least she got back to me immediately to confirm it was a typo.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 00:25:30	A typo can ruin your life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2014-01-01 00:06:20	@ybnormal622 thanks for sharing that with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 12:02:29	@ybnormal622 thanks. Not angry lately. Just very lonely and sad. No good reason. I appreciate your concern. I really do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 12:00:53	Why do I have such a hard time going to bed when I am depressed
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:59:43	@ybnormal622 thanks. Goodnight. And good luck with all the football the next few days. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:57:36	Why am I getting depressed again. When life is getting better I am falling apart again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:51:04	@ybnormal622 my 12 year old eats raw flour.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:48:52	@ybnormal622 but he cleaned up though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:48:26	@ybnormal622 my 9 year old made pancakes this morning. He preferred the batter to the pancakes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:45:07	@ybnormal622 I wish. More like pens and markers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:43:42	@ybnormal622 that sounds very entertaining. My kitchen is already painted by toddlers though
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:39:44	Of course not, nothing good ever happens to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:39:07	@ybnormal622 too funny. I used to work on my dissertation on ambien. It was amusing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:32:13	@ybnormal622 that is dream. which is kinda the same.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:31:49	@ybnormal622 yeah, i am gonna do the ambien again tonight. i don't want to think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:29:20	@ybnormal622 i got some on the counter, but I am not sure how to pass it through the computer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:28:30	people who have it so much worse than me choose to live every day. i don't get it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:25:05	@ybnormal622 what a cheery toast for the new year
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:16:49	eh fuck me. this is going to be a very bad year.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:07:58	I used to be the person I now wish I still was. You never appreciate yourself and then you fall apart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:07:12	@ybnormal622 i teach mostly freshmen, so that it probably true. i also teach a class everyone has to take but that everyone hates.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 11:04:16	@ybnormal622 i miss taking classes. teaching isn't the same. college kids are very whiny and overly entitled.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:56:15	@ybnormal622 I didn't always teach the same thing, but where I work now hired me to teach specific classes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:55:45	@ybnormal622 I have been teaching the same thing. It is a bit repetitive, but I don't have to prep, so it is like I work part time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:51:55	its amazing i can keep myself from getting fat. i love food so much. good thing I belong to the church of heavy lifting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:50:52	did I mention its a dry aged ribeye? yum yum yum yum, etc.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:50:15	Steak, its whats for New Years. Oh, and my famous steak fries, and a Napa Cab. Then the best pistacio gelato from italy. YUM
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:48:52	@ybnormal622 my son is bugging me to update his computer. we both dislike the windows 8 that came on it, but i don't want to wait for the dl
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:47:35	I am starting to feel whiny. I like the mad me better. Can't win for losing, or something like that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:46:59	@ybnormal622 yeah, i agree. the snow right after a big storm is very serene, almost mystical.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:41:43	@ybnormal622 sharing is fun, but you can keep all your snow. my son says he likes shoveling snow. i will send him your way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:37:25	@ybnormal622 fortunately for me, i live in the south, so no snow. i may move near dc this summer though. blech.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:33:31	@ybnormal622 I love having breaks as a college teacher but going back in January is depressing
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:32:32	@nejireta_ki of course. With them depressed. Without them anxious. The wonderful circle of bipolar.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:28:21	@nejireta_ki sounds like you are quite wound up. You needed those beers just to stay close to even.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:26:18	@nejireta_ki I took an ambien last night so I would sleep instead of adventure.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:22:19	Going back to work next week. Getting anxious and sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:15:02	@nejireta_ki they can be a lot more fun than being awake. But they aren't restful. Don't you feel.more tired when you wake?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:03:42	@nejireta_ki that is what the lamictal did to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 10:03:08	As usual I am sad for no good reason. If you told me I won the lottery I wouldn't even smile.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 05:37:49	Twitter authors. Stop trying to sell me your book. You aren't trying to help when you are trying to sell something.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 02:30:48	@BigCityLilGirl you dance. We'll watch. ;) lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-31 02:30:14	@brain_opera great article
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 13:08:05	@nejireta_ki but yeah. You sure see through me. I've noticed that before. Not used to that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 13:06:50	@nejireta_ki maybe sometime it'll be a happy talk for both of us. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 13:05:47	@nejireta_ki ha. That'll be the day. I am terrible at following good advice. Especially mine own.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 13:02:32	Goodnight to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 12:56:36	My life sucks bad enough without having to look in the mirror and see how I have aged.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 12:47:59	Okay sleep. Maybe. Or ambien. I don't want dreams. I don't like where mind goes when I sleep either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 12:41:31	And now I am hearing things. Oh joy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 12:40:58	My mind goes places when I get tired. I don't like those places usually. Really dont.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 12:19:25	@nejireta_ki and you may just feel relieved once it is done. Don't panic. Just take care of number 1.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 12:17:45	So sad to be bipolar and boring. Didn't even know that was possible.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 12:17:15	I don't even find myself fun. I bore myself. And of course.i am stuck with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 12:14:17	@nejireta_ki and I am not just saying this. It is hard to see the the opportunities when you are in a bad situation.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 12:12:54	@nejireta_ki you have nowhere to go right this moment. But once you realize you have to go somewhere you will find things you didn't see.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 12:07:20	@nejireta_ki I am sorry but it should reduce your anxiety in the long haul.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 11:37:19	#Bipolar . Pissed off or look at me and I'll kill you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 11:36:24	When life doesn't suck, it's boring.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 11:16:02	I think I have forgotten how to flirt. That or I am just too shy and afraid.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 10:39:46	@nejireta_ki ttyl
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 10:39:38	@nejireta_ki ok. Sounds very familiar to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 10:34:22	@nejireta_ki what is that?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 10:25:20	@nejireta_ki for some reason it is depressing to hear you say that. What is the joy of being bipolar otherwise.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 10:23:54	@nejireta_ki I get them briefly sometimes in the gym when the adrenaline really flows and the right music is on. No other time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 10:20:32	@nejireta_ki I really just want an upper. To be manic even but not anxious and irritable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 10:19:37	@nejireta_ki technically lamictal is. Also been on lithium and seroquel and abilify. All very bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 10:15:58	@nejireta_ki my son takes that along with zoloft and concerta. It is the only thing that keeps him calm.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 10:08:12	@nejireta_ki I took lamictal which is for bipolar depression. Terrible insomnia.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-30 03:50:20	Again I am having a good day and should feel happy but feel sad. Don't want to go back on meds cause they make me very anxious. #Bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:55:45	@ybnormal622 I always liked the ear grab.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:55:17	@nejireta_ki gotta go also now. Definitely we can chat more later
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:37:13	@nejireta_ki you can dm me if you like anytime.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:36:34	@nejireta_ki not at all. Although where I live now so many women are 6 ft.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:34:20	@nejireta_ki hmmmm....how tall are you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:33:13	@nejireta_ki glad we are friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:33:00	@nejireta_ki same here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:26:06	@nejireta_ki now purple eyes would be cool
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:23:06	@nejireta_ki it's not the worst thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:22:27	@nejireta_ki well I like to say they are blue. But they are blue gray nowadays very symbolic almost.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:19:11	@nejireta_ki usually. Unless it is only like 1 glass of wine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:17:03	@nejireta_ki yeah. They do. I have an exercise obsession now. Can't drink and exercise.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:15:19	@nejireta_ki then I have done good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:14:45	@nejireta_ki yeah. I usually get the irritable tyoe. But you have put me in a fun mood. So I am being obnoxious. It's what I do
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:13:20	@nejireta_ki I just like to be difficult. I thought girls like that. Ha.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:11:33	@nejireta_ki which theory. I have a lot of opinions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:10:55	@nejireta_ki I am cheap but I can afford that. I drink vodka. Russian vodka. And not that fancy sht. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:02:27	@nejireta_ki fuck you. Make me one. Scratch that. I like to make my own.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 10:01:30	@nejireta_ki don't know that one
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:59:07	@nejireta_ki they think I am bipolar 2 and not bpd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:58:40	@nejireta_ki lol. Maybe. But my doctors don't see the need and say it would take a lot of time and money.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:57:42	@nejireta_ki what do you take for migraines
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:56:56	@nejireta_ki yes dear...lol :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:55:47	@nejireta_ki that sounds awful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:55:16	@nejireta_ki I cannot type tonoght.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:55:04	@nejireta_ki lmao. Love itm
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:54:40	@nejireta_ki very true. As my father alwaysnsaid, I have "issues"
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:53:58	@nejireta_ki tmj? Had that once. I learned biorhythms in the hospital and it really helps.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:52:53	@nejireta_ki you wouldn't know by the anti spanking crowd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:51:51	@nejireta_ki I am now off meds. They do more than good for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:51:07	@nejireta_ki I was addicted to benzos while averaging only 1.5 mg a day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 09:29:53	I spank my children when they deserve it. There I said it. Bring it on haters.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-29 00:08:48	@nejireta_ki very sensitive to meds. Don't ever agree to the doctors.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-28 13:07:37	@nejireta_ki I am different even in my response to treatment so of what use is a label.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-28 13:07:09	@nejireta_ki no doctor of mine thought it worthwhile I agree. A diagnosis is only a categorization and a place to start treatment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-28 12:41:48	@nejireta_ki no diagnosis ever.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-28 11:28:10	@nejireta_ki nah. I am very highly functioning albeit apparently antisocial. Prolly a bit bpd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-28 11:17:31	@nejireta_ki no. But I do consider them possibilities to prepare for.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-28 04:28:15	i killed him with my bare hands. telling myself such stories is less common than it used to be, but WTF is wrong with me?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-28 04:27:36	saw a truck pass and that led to a story about how he was selling and wouldnt take no for an answer, then tried to rob me, and...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 23:45:39	@nejireta_ki yeah me neither I am not into false encouragement so they don't know what to say
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 11:44:46	@nejireta_ki everyone seems to be UK. Not many americans.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 11:28:05	@nejireta_ki southeast usa
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 11:26:26	@nejireta_ki I have gone out with some of them before. I was as bored with them as they were with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 11:25:15	@nejireta_ki I am good understanding signals even if I am not good with ppl.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 11:07:17	@ybnormal622 hope you mean that figuratively. Lol. If you don't stick up for yourself then no one will.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:52:22	@ybnormal622 I noticed that sometimes I don't have energy to breathe, but then my body starts hurting. So I start
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:49:03	@weswroten maybe. At least for the moment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:44:26	@weswroten cleaning makes me depressed. Good luck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:42:53	@nejireta_ki okay. So I downloaded tinder for kicks. It can't find anyone near me. Figures.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:39:06	@nejireta_ki apparently I cant. It's been 6 years and I can kick butt just not make a friend. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:37:05	@weswroten try not to think about it. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:35:32	@nejireta_ki never used what?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:25:58	@nejireta_ki no pub. Take martial arts regularly. Get along with people there but they aren't comfortable around me I am realizing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:24:40	@weswroten yeah I suppose. Glad you are doing reasonably. I have seen how hard it's been for you at times.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:21:15	@nejireta_ki I have no idea. I really dont. But they do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:17:45	Okay this sucks. Objectively this was a great day. Yet here I sit feeling awful. #fml #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:14:41	@nejireta_ki thanks. Really wish I could. People avoid me. I am getting a complex about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:12:20	@weswroten me? Don't know. Prolly 2 now, 1 when I was younger.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:11:45	@nejireta_ki doesn't work for me. I have tried.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 10:10:24	@nejireta_ki I don't have a friend...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 09:50:14	@weswroten makes a good story someday.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 09:47:00	@nejireta_ki married to the mom. She is a lot better lately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 09:46:20	@nejireta_ki sigh. I just am terribly lonely, and missing excitement of any kind.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 09:45:12	@nejireta_ki can't. 3 kids. It's no holiday if they come with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 09:42:12	@nejireta_ki yeah as I am not ever happy with much.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 09:39:41	@nejireta_ki my expectations must be too high I think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 09:21:16	Life is hard even when you are not depressed. It would seem quite rational to want to die and irrational to live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 09:19:38	I am tired. I am bored. Don't care enough to live but too hard to die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-27 09:18:34	Sometimes I just feel bad for no reason at all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-26 01:01:15	My kids can ruin anything. Even christmas.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-25 07:59:17	@ybnormal622 a very merry xmas to you as well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-25 06:41:03	I send my love to those who need it this evening.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-24 10:04:01	Apparently I forgot that I always screw things up. How do you forget something like that?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-24 07:11:13	@nejireta_ki always rather be asleep. my dreams are so much more interesting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-23 01:23:12	@nejireta_ki oh the irony.. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-23 01:21:06	@nejireta_ki I don't
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-23 00:15:32	@nejireta_ki can't take them. Addiction.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-22 14:53:46	@amanda_stand home not better
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-22 13:23:53	At a party and not dealing well with rejection. Having serious anxiety attack oh jesus christ help me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-21 12:04:05	And sometimes I am reminded that once a year is too much...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 12:23:11	@nejireta_ki thanks for talking and listening
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 12:23:01	@nejireta_ki i gotta go to bed. crashing and getting a headache. i am sure i will wake up when i get there, but gonna try anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 12:21:11	@nejireta_ki love my kids, and i understand all too well what it means to stay together for the kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 12:20:13	@nejireta_ki i have just seen them all drift away,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:51:07	@nejireta_ki 43
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:50:47	@nejireta_ki 3 kids, not so simple. besides, i don't meet people. don't make my own friends at all. another reason to stay though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:45:30	@nejireta_ki i am an only child, but i was a burden to my parents.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:41:24	@nejireta_ki it is awful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:40:55	@nejireta_ki because I will get weak and date the wrong someone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:39:52	@nejireta_ki i have always been alone. even when "with" people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:38:29	@nejireta_ki i always overestimate myself. being fairly realistic here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:37:43	@nejireta_ki the sad part is that while I sit around afraid to act, she eventually will figure out what I have known all along and leave.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:33:17	@ybnormal622 oh, i know that i am not strong when it comes to this. always been alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:31:28	for awhile, I've been "complaining" that she isn't interested in me. in a moment of unintended honesty, she said the things I like bore her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:10:58	@ybnormal622 the reality is would I rather be here or be alone. The latter is bad but getting better comparatively.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:06:46	@ybnormal622 I know what I would want to find. Meeting them is the problem.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 11:00:58	@ybnormal622 yeah okay.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 10:57:36	How badly I will do on the dating scene keeps me fixed in place.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 10:35:39	Alcohol doesn't make me forget. Neither does gambling. Have no working distractions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 10:34:37	I can't handle being alone, but I seem determined that this must end.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 10:31:26	I really am not letting this go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 10:27:10	It's for days like these that I deliberately don't keep a gun in the house.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 09:28:55	The anger and frustration and hatred. I just don't want to be me anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 08:10:02	@BigCityLilGirl the sad thing is that we are swingers. can't help.but conclude it's me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 08:06:17	@BigCityLilGirl my wife. Today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 08:03:09	"After having sex once I get tired of it."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 06:12:46	would you give your life to save someone you don't know...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 06:11:33	people who say they love me have a funny way of showing it...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-19 06:11:10	just so bitter...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-16 05:42:57	Can't quit cause I already did awhile ago...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-11 07:49:42	@alntylr yeah me too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-11 04:15:49	@alntylr no, but it isnt any less boring than the rest of my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-11 03:37:34	I really want someone to talk to but I really don't want to talk to anyone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-11 03:36:43	It's not okay to distract away my life, yet it's all I'm willing to do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-11 03:31:25	Which is worse, people who say stupid things or people who judge and condemn them for it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-07 02:27:15	@2BipolarChicks not offended but of the opinion that empty ministrations only benefit those giving them not those receiving.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-06 21:43:48	@2BipolarChicks I know you mean well, but you can't know that. I was told that 2 years ago. Dishonesty doesn't help.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-06 12:37:43	@nejireta_ki she may have been a cause to begin with but not necessarily anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-06 12:29:56	@nejireta_ki maybe but so does everything...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-06 12:15:41	Just so very tired of depression. For the most part of 2 years. I just want to be interested in something other than killing time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-06 12:04:23	Complimenting a bad job isn't doing anyone any favors.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-01 09:59:37	I would cry out or do something for attention except that no one would notice and that would make me feel so much worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-01 09:58:36	I look forward to nothing. Does that mean I have given up or given in?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-01 09:57:13	Most of the people I follow suffer from bipolar/bpd worse than I, but few are as isolated. And I don't understand why people don't like me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-01 09:18:51	@thelilradish it is your life to waste
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-12-01 09:18:17	It is so overwhelming to realize how much I hate my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-29 09:17:03	@nejireta_ki awful feeling :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-29 06:54:00	Can't quite sit still. What a mess I am.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-29 06:31:45	Hate everyone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-29 05:27:32	@ybnormal622 my favorite dish :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-29 01:14:39	All this false positivity is nauseating.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-29 00:37:16	@bipolarvoice people say what they think they are supposed to say
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-28 23:52:19	Not thankful to be me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-28 10:30:47	@BigCityLilGirl oui
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-28 10:29:09	@BigCityLilGirl never is...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-28 10:12:04	Med doc gave me a script. Took it once and stopped b/c now I have major Xanax cravings. WTF...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-25 13:20:29	the only reason i know i am not invisible is because people take the effort to be mean to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-23 07:07:57	I am toxic. Everyone knew it but me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-23 06:30:22	Black in the filaments and seeping through
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-23 06:20:55	Slipping...do you understand?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-23 06:20:06	I drink therefore I am....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-22 04:10:34	I am getting so many followers lately. I must not be tweeting enough...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-19 11:18:11	I think I have finally stopped caring what other people think. Its about time, as other people stopped caring what I thought when I was born
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-18 10:06:32	A little ambien high
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-17 09:00:01	@MariesVoice_MG its always right. there is a difference between being selfish and deliberately hurting and taking advantage of others.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-16 12:39:04	I can be exhausted and half drunk and still have four different conversations going in in my head.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-16 12:38:01	I don't even fit in with those few who are actually like me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-16 12:36:34	Someone flirt with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-16 12:36:03	Can't be good at drinking and stay in shape at the same time. Contradictory addictions. Spose I would rather look good nekkid. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-16 08:35:45	@BipolarTweets or everyone here is crazy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-16 08:22:06	@BipolarTweets read what I wrote. I said mental illness. And bipolar is 1 in 40 in America.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-16 06:45:10	why do i bother? i really could just stay home and play. the world doesn't need me, it has made that clear.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-16 06:40:01	i am not different because i am bipolar, 25 to 30 percent of americans have a mental illness. i am different because i am 1 in 1000.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-16 06:33:54	teaching is such a thankless job. you fail cause you don't study and you blame me. more like you are a stupid lazy ass.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-16 05:29:32	might have well been born deformed. i am different and people know it. at least its a good different, but different is still lonely.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-16 04:25:35	its friday, twitter time, and i am tirred.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-14 11:39:54	@mandabpd i feel that way often. people don't even know i am there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-11 05:48:59	Made a list of life goals. Achieved all but one. Starting the last. Then nothing left to do...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-11 03:10:01	@JayGlazer softball interview. You had a responsibility to challenge him and find the truth. You are a JOURNALIST.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-10 06:18:35	Went shopping and didn't buy anything. Now I am depressed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-10 02:39:08	for the first time in ages, somebody actually asked me to go do something. wish i liked them better, but what the hell...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-09 12:08:37	Is it really too much to ask?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-09 07:28:55	@BigCityLilGirl worse ways to spend it. Enjoy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-09 07:24:51	@BigCityLilGirl :). Happy Friday!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-09 07:20:40	Still need friends. Still don't relate to others.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-09 05:22:44	fuck it nap time
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-09 05:21:28	weekends are depressing when you know you are just gonna wait around for work again monday.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-09 05:21:07	little shit adds up. happy friday. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-07 04:17:00	@TheEllenShow I don't get the joke? 47 can't be a typo because there are 50 states.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-07 04:13:39	what some people call gifts are not always so.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-06 07:17:52	I need something. I really need to have something that makes me feel good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-05 11:14:37	I smiled today for no reason. Too bad I feel like shit now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-03 01:20:28	pretty sick of people who are offended by other people's viewpoints. everyone is entitled to think what they like.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-02 09:57:24	the crazy went away, but the desire to live hasn't come back. i just exist.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-02 09:44:39	twitter is a fun place to go to just say all those things you know you probably shouldn't
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-02 09:44:11	mental illness is like cancer, can go into remission, but its always back there. if you think ur cured, it prolly won't be long 'til ur not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-02 09:39:44	its not hard to accomplish certain goals, it just takes discipline. its a helluva lot harder to make constant excuses IMHO
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-02 09:37:12	please please don't label yourself and complain about stigma in the same tweet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-02 09:36:38	my wife won't leave me. i have spent years trying to figure out if this is bad or good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-11-02 09:34:50	i always get more followers when i don't tweet, but its the same kind:. fight stigma, read my blog, blah blah blah. bye bye new followers
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-31 09:17:15	despite being off meds, I am calmer, my mind is not talking to itself so actively. the silence is lonely though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-30 09:35:41	Having kids because you want them to be better than you is a depressing reason if they are not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-30 09:34:08	Tdoc spend an hour trying to figure out how my mother abused, ignored, or didn't care for me because that would be the only way I was BPD.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-30 09:31:21	I never know what to expect when I pull up my twitfeed. Tonight, apparently, it is sex.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-25 03:47:55	nothing in this life is easy, this life referring to mine in particular.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-24 22:04:53	@nejireta_ki just lamictal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-24 10:40:36	@BigCityLilGirl that is expensive stuff. wow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-24 10:38:47	@BigCityLilGirl lamictal. used to take a lot of xanax and klonopin, till i got hooked. went cold turkey and became suicical.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-24 10:35:03	@BigCityLilGirl i'm sorry. :) i didn't expect to feel better, but what i was on was making me anxious and sleeping very poorly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-24 10:28:37	been off meds for 6 weeks now. feel like i am waking up from a long sleep, and i was on uppers. weird.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-24 03:10:46	Feeling just a little angry and bitter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-19 04:54:00	in the book i am reading, one of the characters keeps saying "there are no happy endings". feels very apropos to my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-19 04:27:04	I am not a "go with the flow" kinda guy, but my major life choices seem to decide themselves.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-19 04:23:32	you are better than you think you are and not as good as you could be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-16 09:02:24	@nejireta_ki thanks. It was okay.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-16 06:04:06	I need to learn how to be an introvert. Birthdays would suck less.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-16 05:43:17	My wife gave me stickers for my birthday.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-15 21:48:20	@BigCityLilGirl lol. Perfect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-15 21:47:45	@ybnormal622 yes. And I will have ice cream for second desert. Yumm
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-15 21:47:03	@BigCityLilGirl thank you. That is sweet and I appreciate it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-15 21:46:35	@BigCityLilGirl no joke. I am old. Can barely read my phone. Gonna go buy Note 3 for the big screen. HA. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-15 21:40:46	@BigCityLilGirl :). Thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-15 21:38:02	@ybnormal622 don't like cake, but I was promised homemade custard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-15 21:26:52	Happy birthday to me. Let it not be a bad day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-15 04:53:21	Being too smart makes it hard to make friends that aren't as intelligent.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-15 04:50:23	Completely fell apart 2 years ago. Am as mentally sane As I have ever been, prolly more than some "normal" ppl. Now if only I could be happy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-12 08:23:52	@ybnormal622 never thought of it that way. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-12 07:14:45	Why is she only nice to me when I am not being so nice to her. I really don't understand.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-11 08:24:14	@BigCityLilGirl ohhh. That kind of mania. Yeah that is what I usually get. I prefer the adrenaline rushes for no reason.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-11 08:16:57	@BigCityLilGirl mania = high. I wouldn't mind some of that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-11 07:51:40	cheery people annoy me. acting that happy means you are faking it or you are high.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-11 02:25:28	Lose lose. Toss a coin.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-10 10:36:07	I've given up on her and she doesn't care. Why does this drag on?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 09:41:03	Being very smart only earns you resentment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 09:38:06	@ybnormal622 it took 10+ years to build, I am probably just seeing the tip of the iceberg.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 09:31:44	@ybnormal622 I did. Just very angry though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 09:30:49	I should just take my ambien and sleep. No good will come of this indulgence of anger.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 09:28:33	My dad always told me to be nicer. Yeah blend in don't be noticed he meant. #scream
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 09:27:32	Its actually not my fault, but I did let it happen.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 09:26:58	I hate the corner I am painted into.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 09:24:29	@ybnormal622 opinions are worthless. Judgment comes from experience.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 09:21:57	@ybnormal622 my sarcastic humor maybe. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 08:42:28	#fml #fuckme #fuckyou #sigh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 08:29:40	If I had real people to talk to, I wouldn't be tweeting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 08:05:51	Tdoc and I debated the difference between being depressed and being unhappy because your life really does suck. #notdepressed
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 06:30:02	My FB problem is that I usually assume people want to have a conversation, when they really want their ego stroked.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 06:26:54	Its probably not how it seems on the surface. Don't buy the hype. The one to blame often plays the martyr.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 06:26:11	Everyone who has never been through something has a goddamn opinion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 05:23:20	its my son's birthday, and i really need to "argue" with my wife.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 05:03:37	@ybnormal622 missed my whining and complaining? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 04:17:46	you don't even know who i am, you left me a long time ago, you don't even know who i am, so why do you care if i go?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 04:07:13	@BigCityLilGirl you are a mess today. i'd love to help, but i am in a bad place and a worse mood. i'll just try not to make you mad. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 03:40:32	@BigCityLilGirl nothing to decide. truth is truth.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 03:26:08	@BigCityLilGirl i finally put a name to it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-09 03:14:52	emotional abandonment
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-07 02:35:38	I am so sick of how I am treated. I am going back to bring selfish and self centered. I intend to earn the abuse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-07 00:43:13	Wife used to say I was paranoid but even she notices how poor I am treated now. Except she doesn't notice that she does it too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-07 00:17:10	I don't even get common courtesy from anyone. Its like I am wearing a kick me sign.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-06 08:17:37	I am no good alone and don't make friends. Leaving could be dangerous for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-06 08:16:28	How would in tell my kids I am leaving.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-06 08:09:59	She doesn't even give a damn when I am upset.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-06 06:57:48	She doesn't act like she is happy with me either, no matter what she says. But I doubt I would be happier alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 12:06:41	Drunk and bored
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 11:08:00	@my_fight_within awww. Well I give you a virtual kiss....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 10:04:20	@my_fight_within an I thought it was easier for girls. :p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 09:21:30	@my_fight_within and what makes it a problem? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 09:20:29	@BigCityLilGirl AWWWW. and i thought you were a dog person. Cats rule. Dogs drool. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 09:15:18	and i feel so much less angry too. vodka, i think i love you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 09:12:50	i knew that. why do i ever stop drinking vodka.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 09:12:33	oh wow. vodka makes me horny.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 09:09:29	yum, i am a damn good bartender
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 09:09:06	hey it passed, i am sober again. cool, down the hatch.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 09:06:09	wish i didn't have to be so damn anonymous.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 08:59:51	in fact, i never was a lightweight, could hold my vodka when i was 12. #russian #water
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 08:58:29	so, i have always been a good bartender, but i was never this much of a lightweight. #needtodrinkmoreoften
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-05 08:55:19	was too tired to go out, but a hot shower and a good drink has helped...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-04 09:23:36	been off meds for a month. on the + side, feeling more normal. on the - side, i was crying today for no reason. i never cry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-01 23:22:13	@nejireta_ki I have nowhere to go. Sometimes though I do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-10-01 23:11:04	@nejireta_ki 18 years and 3 kids. I just am not certain I would be happier gone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-29 09:04:13	you marry someone when you can't stand to be apart, and then eventually you can't stand to be together.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-29 09:01:39	I think anger will soon overcome me. It happens when boredom overwhelms me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-29 08:38:33	Just remembered that I forgot to call about that #dbt group. I suspect I will either know it, find it silly, or both. If I remember.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-29 06:53:35	And while the world is out having fun....I am used to being bored.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-29 06:47:18	So I used to be sick of my wife being passive aggressive. So she stopped being passive. #carefulwhatyouwishfor
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-29 06:38:36	Women only look sweet and innocent. They just dare us to do something stupid so everyone will blame us.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-29 06:26:18	Wife is so unpleasant. Would rather be married to the cat.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-27 00:04:27	@Black_Pandora I haven't been cheerful in two years, so I guess he is happy for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-26 08:42:22	pdoc approved me being off meds. didn't hurt that i was so hopped up on caffeine that i was bursting with good cheer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-23 09:31:05	even my therapist acknowledges i am different. i just wish i could embrace that and be empowered by it, instead of isolated by it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-23 09:29:47	but i really wish i felt like i wasn't so different than everyone else...even other mh sufferers...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-23 09:28:26	i wish i could sleep like a normal person...i wish i didn't feel like the rope in tug of war...i wish i could go somewhere very quiet...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-23 09:23:07	since coming off my mini meds, i am feeling angry and frustrated, but appreciating life a little more also. but angry a lot...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-23 09:12:39	@BigCityLilGirl I'll miss you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-23 09:10:25	apparently one of my students has been diagnosed with bipolar and has chosen to share with me...oh boy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:34:25	people are not nearly as capable as they keep being told.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:34:02	are you so sure the world needs saving? and why are you the one to do it?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:33:20	people are all so worried about doing right in the world, and can't do shit in their own life. #screweduppriorities
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:31:48	@LeStewpot Well, if it makes you feel better, I had not been following you to begin with. Responded to a retweet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:19:36	I have been "blocked" by a woman @LeStewpot that I disagreed with. It was a civil conversation. Interesting world.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:18:44	@LeStewpot for disagreeing with you? that seems very telling.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:17:55	@LeStewpot really? so adults are never punished?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:14:54	@LeStewpot of course, it isn't the mother's responsibility if the girl gets pregnant by being sexually irresponsible, so maybe u r right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:13:56	@LeStewpot well, this isn't a child for one, and punishing is parenting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:06:51	@BipolarSanity but of course, that is hypocritical of me to say...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:06:27	it truly annoys me when people complain about other people they have nothing to do with... MYOB is a line that should come back into favor
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:05:07	@LeStewpot the language is wrong, but selling the tickets is not. If you are a parent, you must be lucky to have good kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 05:03:55	Amazing how many things people find awful, abusive, hateful. And usually these come from those who have live sheltered lives...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-21 04:58:25	and everything is just going to hell. not even my fault this time. #cantwin
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-19 09:00:02	@BigCityLilGirl interesting
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-19 08:55:38	Whale to Tijuana
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-19 08:28:31	@BigCityLilGirl sorta like twitter. I should try it. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-19 08:23:19	@BigCityLilGirl you with the snap chat lately
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-19 06:01:06	mad + headache =
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-18 09:15:22	i'm losing followers again. honesty has its consequences. but i wonder why people follow me if they don't want to hear what i really think?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-17 11:31:23	Considering that I find "inspirational stories" to be insipid and pleas for attention, I really ought to avoid social media. #masochist
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-17 10:21:53	having a job is exhausting. and i only need about 30 hours/week to do my job. used to work 50-60.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-17 03:38:17	sometimes i look at a picture, or see a person across a room, and i feel an attachment, even though none exists.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-16 08:30:13	I don't want people who don't know me to say they care. But people I do know don't even call to say hello. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-16 08:27:02	Is it easier to show compassion for people you don't know? Cause that is pretty empty to do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-16 08:24:47	I am soooo cranky.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-16 07:37:17	"humanists" are the biggest hypocrites, and often the most ignorant, and always the most unwilling to hear a different opinion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-16 07:34:13	it is easy to criticize others, that is why we all do it, but it is harder to find out all the facts.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-15 10:01:04	Boxing!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-15 04:21:33	@BigCityLilGirl bet I'll piss you off long before you piss me off.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-15 03:08:45	@BigCityLilGirl I may have seen it but I am an 80s child.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-15 02:51:03	@BigCityLilGirl ??? Now my mind is in the gutter...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-15 02:40:41	Turn the page...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-14 10:12:57	Now that I am not suicidal, I still think I this a personal choice. The freedom to live OR die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-14 03:37:06	my job makes me soooo tired. don't even have the energy to go have fun...as if i knew how to anymore. blech
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-13 09:13:11	@BigCityLilGirl its okay. i know enough people who have.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-13 09:10:15	@BigCityLilGirl i am disappointed in me too. i am usually the first one into the deep gutter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-13 09:08:36	@BigCityLilGirl lmao. i hadn't even thought that far. i feel so tame.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-13 09:07:07	@BigCityLilGirl there are far worse things to do on the internet...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-12 08:41:44	so on my 90 minute commute, my audiobook turned very pornographic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-12 04:15:31	Oooh. I could be very happy doing that...I mean her...I mean...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-11 05:45:30	@BigCityLilGirl I am not even good at that. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-11 04:54:48	you are tri-polar huh? hahaha.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-10 10:16:49	Don't be afraid to hurt someone's feelings, they probably deserve it. Being sensitive is NOT a good thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-10 03:23:16	Is it better to have bad friends or no friends? #RhetoricalQuestion
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-09 08:49:21	Put me on a highway, show me a sign...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-09 08:14:44	Why has anger replaced (relatively) happy. Because I stopped taking my happy pills. That explains why something didn't feel right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-08 22:41:05	@BigCityLilGirl I went and passed out. Drinking wine makes me tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-08 12:24:38	@BigCityLilGirl fun fun
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-08 12:16:03	@BigCityLilGirl what are we doing?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-08 12:15:23	And I hurt my back today...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 10:22:02	No I am not mad at you. Why would I ever be mad at you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 10:17:59	@ybnormal622 enraged. Good word.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 09:11:11	Head fuzzy from wine. Must be careful not to post comments made for twitter on FB.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 09:07:11	@BigCityLilGirl spent $200 last week. Come south and share. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 09:01:11	Who needs food if you have wine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 08:51:25	I need someone to need me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 08:37:02	Did you ever want to tell innocent people off?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 08:19:33	@ybnormal622 at a HS game? I am actively avoiding my entire family. Will drive away I'd necessary.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 08:15:03	Soi much for the wine cheering me up. Now what? #angry
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 08:09:46	@Black_Pandora showing my age...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 07:56:34	R u gonna stay w the one who loves u or r u going back to the one u love?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 07:54:10	Jeez, I have a better social life online than in person. Wtf is wrong w me?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 07:48:14	Goddamnit
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 07:14:28	@BigCityLilGirl I only have a 100 lb bag. Bet you could give hell to a 50 lb bag
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 07:12:31	@BigCityLilGirl I don't know. Girls can be fierce. I think you are fierce.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 07:09:36	@BigCityLilGirl I make myself laugh at least.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 07:08:56	@BigCityLilGirl that is when I go in the gym and hit the heavy bag. Does that work foe girls?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 07:07:25	@BigCityLilGirl not into inanimate objects. Prefer spicy women.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 07:00:03	I am starting to mellow. Thank you Cabernet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 06:53:41	@BigCityLilGirl have 2 parties to goto this weekend and I just want to drink alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 06:43:44	I need a house in the woods miles from anyone...then I could relax.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 06:32:06	I am in THAT mood...the one where nothing will make me happy. I think I will try something different...alcohol.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 06:29:11	Feeling lonely...but I want to be left alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:53:02	@IamCarrieeeeee oh I know. I just felt I was defending the lack of it here more than I believed. And I agree. Now I must watch that move. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:44:03	@IamCarrieeeeee BTW, don't get me wrong, I am prolly too ethical. I quit practicing entirely cause of my conscience. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:42:01	@IamCarrieeeeee a proc dfs only appears to be an admission of guilt. I guess the jurors are not told about that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:40:35	@IamCarrieeeeee walks a fine line. There is a degree of looking the other way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:39:39	@IamCarrieeeeee they do it here too. Just not everyone. Most are guilty here. But they still have a right to a defense, so the defense
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:38:23	@IamCarrieeeeee what you say to your Atty here is privileged. So the atty can't tell the court what you said. A procedural defense is no dfs
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:35:35	@IamCarrieeeeee that the defendant privately said he was guilty.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:34:59	@IamCarrieeeeee if you don't excuse, you must defend. To fail to is misconduct.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:34:14	@IamCarrieeeeee most likely no one will know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:33:03	@IamCarrieeeeee American movies about lawyers are often very unrealistic. Don't think I've seen that one but I am sure that it occurs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:28:51	@IamCarrieeeeee although some lawyers are more ethical than others.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:27:59	@IamCarrieeeeee which is why you don't ask and they don't tell. Its all about appearance of misconduct.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:22:57	@IamCarrieeeeee thus a complete defense. If Atty is uncomfortable, may ask to be excused but judge need not grant it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:22:05	@IamCarrieeeeee not that simple. Techincally Atty not supposed to lie, but defendant still entitled to adequate representation...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:17:29	@IamCarrieeeeee that sounds like a dead giveaway. Can the prosecution point that out to the jury?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:16:38	@IamCarrieeeeee which is why you tell the client to be quiet unless he wants to plead guilty. Nobody admits anything here anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:11:43	Sometimes there is nothing more wonderful than a bed!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:09:58	@IamCarrieeeeee there is law practice in theory and law practice is reality. In the US the guilty are entitled to a defense.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-07 03:07:25	I was only on a minimum dose the last few months, but I am med free for five days and am finally sleeping restfully.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-06 08:51:46	@BigCityLilGirl that is awful. you may have to distract yourself for awhile. my sympathy...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-04 08:37:46	@BigCityLilGirl I get it. I am pretty self conscious of my appearance, which is unusual for a guy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-04 08:32:29	@BigCityLilGirl and you would be right except you express it as a fact, which it cannot be as others think different. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-04 08:29:26	@BigCityLilGirl you say from time to time your are ugly, but I've seen lots of pics and you are pretty, so therefore sometimes u r wrong.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-04 08:28:00	@BigCityLilGirl yes way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-04 08:27:06	@BigCityLilGirl because you are not always right. Sometimes you are wrong, so therefore you are wrong to say you are always right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-04 08:24:40	@BigCityLilGirl no, you are wrong, so you can't always be right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-04 08:22:47	I disagree. No matter what you say, I disagree.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 10:00:07	I don't know how to get there from here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:47:28	@MyBipolarBrain they won't. It sounds like you got a far bigger share of the estate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:45:57	@MyBipolarBrain that's too bad. Losing a parent is hard enough without money coming into it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:40:48	@MyBipolarBrain that is nothing. You live mortgage free. Just take a mortgage to pay it. The payment will be $100. That is a lot of equity.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:38:29	@MyBipolarBrain nice inheritance for you, unless the tax debt is that much.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:36:27	@MyBipolarBrain @BigCityLilGirl how much is the house worth?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:31:46	@MyBipolarBrain @BigCityLilGirl then the rest of the family has no reason to contribute. Can you refinance?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:29:59	@MyBipolarBrain @BigCityLilGirl then there is value in the estate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:29:07	@MyBipolarBrain @BigCityLilGirl tax lien on property?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:28:06	@MyBipolarBrain @BigCityLilGirl why does your attorney say you have to?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:24:02	@MyBipolarBrain @BigCityLilGirl if they don't, neither do you. The estate owes the money. Are they taking anything from the estate?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:20:08	@BigCityLilGirl @MyBipolarBrain you can sue your family members for contribution.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:17:55	@BigCityLilGirl pizza
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:08:41	@BigCityLilGirl drug tests
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 04:04:12	Migraine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 03:00:01	@sam_stone152 haven't quit the meds yet particularly because I am so tired. Maybe I should come off so I can sleep better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-03 02:18:48	No matter how much sleep I get, I am incredibly tired. Not depressed though. Just very sleepy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-02 22:58:34	@BigCityLilGirl I understand that. Do you exercise? Tighten up those parts you don't like.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-02 22:52:06	@BigCityLilGirl awesome. Rock on. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-02 05:20:02	@ybnormal622 I never want to punish myself, but usually end up doing so. Just took a nap, it helped, haven't slept well in a very long time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-02 02:47:56	I used to be incredibly competitive at everything. Then I started to lose all the time. Now I accept losing too well. 1 extreme to the other
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-02 02:26:29	I cannot remember the last time I felt this tired and for so long.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-02 00:45:06	hate, anger, and then some. must punish someone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 22:53:21	I have been looking for a fight all weekend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 22:22:35	I hate everyone today, even the cat.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 21:57:00	@BigCityLilGirl do one with a heavy metal sign for me. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 21:53:31	@BigCityLilGirl I know a guy who captains those night cruises sometimes. He says they are pretty cool.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 21:52:48	@BigCityLilGirl hmmm. Maybe I shoudnt have moved. There isn't a casino for nearly 4 hours from where I live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 21:49:05	@BigCityLilGirl casino boat?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 21:48:37	@BigCityLilGirl yeah that might be a little less weird. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 21:38:56	@BigCityLilGirl do you have any casinos there yet?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 21:38:39	@BigCityLilGirl until one day this stranger shows up on your doorstep and claims he knows you from twitter...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 21:36:51	Some bipolar everyone loves. Some drunks are mean. I am a drunk everyone loves but I am a damn mean bipolar.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 21:35:38	Should plan a casino getaway. Heck I should just get in the car and drive to one...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 21:33:48	I never wanted to run away as a child. Now I want to everyday.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 12:49:58	Sometimes guys have body image problems too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 12:48:19	Sometimes I think it would be easier if my whole life as it is fell apart. Then i wouldn't have to put in so much more effort to act normal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 06:17:56	@ybnormal622 lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 06:11:14	@ybnormal622 gotta love those tune up games.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 06:07:41	@ybnormal622 did they play? Haven't sewn anything about them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-09-01 02:58:39	college football!!! woo-hoo!!!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 09:17:24	@BigCityLilGirl I think ur not okay but awesome. this too shall pass. <<hug>>
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 09:09:23	@BigCityLilGirl hey there! How you doin'? Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 05:27:54	@Black_Pandora lmao. Ugh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 05:25:08	@Black_Pandora my tdoc told me I had empathy, I thought I hated everyone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 05:16:09	I wanted to drink....but this damn headache.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 05:09:40	I have this habit of building up people as things they are not. Good way to disappoint yourself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 05:00:11	@sam_stone152 and you aren't interfering at all. wouldn't post if i wasn't willing to talk. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 04:59:17	@sam_stone152 lol. not taking enough meds for it to matter. i have been coming off slowly for a year cause the pills make me anxious.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 04:55:56	i don't think i am particularly unhappy, but i still feel like complaining. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 04:51:08	getting a headache, don't think taking off the ponytail holder is gonna be enough
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 04:49:29	Coming off my meds without asking the doctor. Feel like such an adolescent, sneaking around. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-31 03:57:29	@BigCityLilGirl @Glass1ncision get that. i've been searching for one for ages. ur more like to find one in NY than i will in the south.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-30 03:21:36	everybody is always complaining. so what if the world isn't how you think it should be. it never will be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-29 07:36:40	Its okay not to know things. Its not okay to talk like you do when you don't. You have a responsibility to realize when you don't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-29 07:35:44	Facebook proves to me over and over again the lack of knowledge inherent in nearly everyone. But they think they know things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-28 05:27:28	@Black_Pandora everyrhing
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-28 04:55:53	Everything is marketing. You cannot trust any reviews anymore because usually a good review is bought and paid for.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-27 09:53:17	School gives people a false sense of intelligence.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-26 10:49:50	@nejireta_ki feel better. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-26 02:52:35	@hareofthefog mine will be too busy sleeping. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-26 01:47:11	@hypomaina yeah. Prolly. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-25 23:22:15	@Polarbear3127 @schizonomore @SchizophrenicGB I got it while on prozac and abilify.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-25 22:26:14	@hypomaina I like and hate to be around people. Being alone does not "recharge" me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-25 22:24:14	@hareofthefog lmao. No apologies. But there sure are a lot of you. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-25 12:17:27	It never ceases to amaze me how many of the people I follow are dog lovers. I am a cat person . I like them more than people...and dogs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-25 12:00:02	Apparently I am an extrovert. Can you hate people and still be an extrovert.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-25 02:16:28	Not putting on lotion for the pool. Just too damn lazy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-24 05:42:30	I am sure I would be lonely if I were alone. I am not. So I hide in order to be alone. Lol.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-24 05:38:35	@Black_Pandora pretty much. If I can hide from the kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-24 04:53:29	@Black_Pandora sir? Lol. Can't even get my kids to say that. I am okay mostly. Just exhausted since starting work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-24 04:51:23	@Black_Pandora is for horses? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-24 04:51:03	@nejireta_ki lol. i am just head fucked. period. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-24 04:01:20	God am I tired...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-23 10:08:08	@nejireta_ki I guess I am always more crazy than sane. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-23 07:43:16	It kills me when ignorant people start going off on how stupid people are. People in glass houses .... think its a manse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-23 06:26:14	Keep seeing ppl talk about their public vs private accts. I have a public acct, but I haven't used it. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-23 04:53:41	@hypomaina no problem, nice to see they are read and remembered. its hard to be clear in 140 characters or less.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-22 23:30:39	@hypomaina I do? I used to take xanax and klonopin, but I became addicted to them, and now I am off.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-22 20:29:25	@hypomaina very very little. 25 mg lamotragine. Its not the meds. I am just like this now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-22 08:59:11	@BigCityLilGirl oh god. If I still lived up there, I don't think I could be polite anymore. People get more annoying every year.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-21 08:46:09	Bullying is alive and well. Don't believe me? Try stating an unpopular opinion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 21:09:57	@ybnormal622 always glad to. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 18:23:59	@nejireta_ki no but I do drink a little.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 18:23:19	@ybnormal622 mean at times. I find my kids see both deeper and narrower. They seem fine as long as they know I love them and am trying.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 18:22:04	@ybnormal622 I am no judge of other peoples impressions at all. Doubt you are a mean person, since you care. Maybe ....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 09:59:21	@ybnormal622 I think I have finally stopped caring. I know I don't fit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 09:50:17	@ybnormal622 is it brain chemistry? There really is no such thing as a chemical imbalance.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 09:48:25	@nejireta_ki I just decided to go cold turkey. But then became suicidal and terribly depressed for a year.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 09:47:07	@nejireta_ki tremors, constant anxiety attacks. It was awful. Didnt know what it was until it was a out two weeks off. By then...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 09:21:03	No misery but no joy either. Life just is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 09:14:05	@nejireta_ki I didnt know I was addicted until I didn't take any for a.week and got withdrawal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 08:45:07	@nejireta_ki used to have a physical addiction. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-20 07:00:53	@nejireta_ki I have absolutely nothing as an escape.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 09:56:58	Damn ambien isn't working now. Fuxk.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 09:56:27	@nejireta_ki not every night. And they certainly are not restful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 09:15:17	@nejireta_ki no, but i have lots of adventures.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 09:08:09	@nejireta_ki dreamless would be so wonderful. Never have it. Love sleep but never get good sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 09:02:16	@nejireta_ki lol. I ought to have dreamless sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 08:48:20	@DailyBipolar eat right before bed? Are you supposed to eat with ambient?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 08:43:06	@BigCityLilGirl sounds reasonable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 08:42:39	@DailyBipolar I slept really late. So it was really fun for awhile. But the last few hours I have felt tired and a bit sick.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 08:38:43	@BigCityLilGirl really concerned I won't sleep and I have to be up early tomorrow. And have a long day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 08:37:26	Need Advice: accidentally took ambien when I got up instead of my usual pill. Do I take another at bedtime?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 02:50:33	resorting to the brute force method. if its in my way...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 01:58:33	A bit tired. Not gonna sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 00:51:51	@Black_Pandora haha even better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 00:50:17	I feel like I am underwater swimming through the world.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 00:46:53	@Black_Pandora there isn't much and its raining. But it would be funny to try and play mini golf.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 00:37:56	@BigCityLilGirl sangria sounds really good. Just bought a lot of.red wine and rum.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 00:36:57	@Black_Pandora mine did originally but now I want to go out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 00:36:10	@BigCityLilGirl rake an ambien like me. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 00:34:58	@Black_Pandora good luck w that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 00:33:46	@Black_Pandora thanks.I will try.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 00:29:10	@Black_Pandora I got 11 hrs last night, so not sleepy. This could be fun, but I certainly ain't driving anywhere. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 00:26:13	I figured it out, i too the wrong pill! Instead of my lamictal, i took ambien. This should be an interesting day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-19 00:09:25	I am hoping this is vertigo, because i shouldn't be drunk this morning.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-17 09:11:42	@BigCityLilGirl I can't watch much longer anyways. Kinda sick tonight. Prolly just anxiety after a busy week, but i am going to bed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-17 09:10:24	@BigCityLilGirl twitter isn't fun enough to live on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-17 09:08:40	@BigCityLilGirl now there is a lot more reason to check twitter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-17 09:05:41	@BigCityLilGirl if you tweeted about everything, twitter would be a lot more interesting. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-17 09:03:29	@BigCityLilGirl nothing in particular, just went on twitter wondering if you were there, and there you were.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-17 08:59:30	@BigCityLilGirl I was just thinking of you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-17 08:23:20	So the twitter app for android finally is well functional, but the web client still sucks. and yet i still use it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-17 08:01:02	I bond so much better with women, but in the conservative south, no women will be friends with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-16 08:36:54	We are the blind leading the blind.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-16 08:33:22	Been a tiring and busy week. No anxiety so far but I could really do without tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-15 07:11:38	@steveturner02 that is pretty awful to feel so sick for so long from MI that you can't tell the difference.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-15 07:05:12	just going to be me. not gonna worry if anyone likes me, and I am not gonna try to behave different so they do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-15 07:03:34	@steveturner02 lots of ppl don't diagnose cancer until too late. nice to know there is 1 mentally ill person who doesn't complain a lot. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-15 06:50:05	I suppose its the nature of the disease that people with mental illness complain more about their sickness than people with other illnesses.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-15 06:48:45	Cats should smell like cats. My cat smells like a dog.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-15 06:42:57	Been so busy with starting work this week that I have been too tired to think much. That turns out to be a really good thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-13 09:31:27	@BigCityLilGirl so sorry to hear that.from what you told me, im not surprised but you gotta take care of urself even if others don't like it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-13 09:28:50	@Black_Pandora when I say I need you, you say you'd better ....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-13 09:04:25	When I say I love you, you say you'd better...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-12 06:05:36	@BigCityLilGirl oh wow. Rough situation. Good luck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-12 05:16:53	@BigCityLilGirl at least it sounds like is done and you can get on with things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-12 05:15:11	@BigCityLilGirl she sounds bitter. No wonder it was bad working for her. well at least that was the last panic attack she will give you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 12:43:26	Its weird how I will do things i don't want to hoping it will turn out some way I do want. Not sure the logic in that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 12:42:22	Was really not in the mood to drink tonight. Bleh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 12:41:43	@Black_Pandora I am glad to hear it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 12:41:29	@Black_Pandora dinner must be stressful .:-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 09:24:14	@BigCityLilGirl good luck Monday. Out now. Can't DM on this phone. Don't know why.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 08:41:38	@Black_Pandora you are lucky. i have a friend whose mom died 2 years ago and she isn't even close. thank your lucky stars.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 08:40:58	@Black_Pandora its good to get a routine going. i don't work well with a routine, makes me too anxious.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 08:34:29	@ybnormal622 omg. that is awful. i am so sorry. tonight is a good night for an ambien or two, you don't want to lay in bed thinking.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 08:05:52	@Black_Pandora yeah, down here school starts in August. i teach college, so I am pretty much done by the end of November. What about you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 07:59:00	@Black_Pandora ME TOO!!! Classes start Monday for me bright and early.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 07:53:28	@Black_Pandora how are you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 07:53:22	@Black_Pandora relatively well, getting ready to go back to work monday.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 07:30:45	the denial in the #twitterpsychward is astronomical.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 05:08:07	@BigCityLilGirl ohhhh. Yeah i get that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 05:06:06	@BigCityLilGirl so I shouldn't talk to you then.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-11 00:38:53	@BigCityLilGirl I was expecting this. feel better. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 12:23:08	@BigCityLilGirl I am sure u r quite a sight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 12:20:22	@BigCityLilGirl or a helluva lot further gone than me. I'm just walking funny
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 12:17:38	@BigCityLilGirl don't let your dog know you said that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 10:51:17	I love all you girls.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 09:07:18	I want to say something nice about the football skills of @TimTebow but he isn't giving me much to work with so far tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 07:40:03	@BigCityLilGirl who doesn't love a good lollipop.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 07:34:30	@BigCityLilGirl lollipop, or fish
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 07:19:55	@BigCityLilGirl that could mean a lot of different things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 06:29:12	@BigCityLilGirl I am not old but I am definitely old at heart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 06:28:33	@BigCityLilGirl I didn't know anything about it until in just looked it up. I would never discount anything w my moods.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 06:23:34	@BigCityLilGirl I am not that old. :p
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 06:22:33	@BigCityLilGirl I guess. I get tired and cranky in the afternoon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 06:14:03	@BigCityLilGirl its that time of day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 06:09:51	@BigCityLilGirl I know. I suck. I lost all my adrenaline when I left the gym.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 06:09:11	okay, i think i realized the problem with my mood. i am craving alcohol. that is a problem i know how to solve.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 06:07:44	@BigCityLilGirl lmao, i was just thinking that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 06:02:33	It is so aggravating how people that are so annoying, irritating, and backstabbing can have so many friends. I am just honest. Bad policy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 05:58:59	The only hobby i have that doesn't require energy is watching tv.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 03:07:11	And summer vacation is officially over. Just a usual weekend and then back to school and another 150 snotty college kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 03:02:11	@BigCityLilGirl one word says it all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-10 00:48:18	It really sux trying to lift weights with an upset stomach.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 23:47:59	@BigCityLilGirl nice sunday drive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 23:45:45	@BigCityLilGirl lmao. Really wish I had the money for a last minute plane ticket. :-) all my money pays for the car.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 23:44:51	@BigCityLilGirl lol. I knew I liked you. #badinfluence
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 23:43:50	@BigCityLilGirl and if I did, where would you take me? All my rowdy friends have moved away and settled down.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 23:34:28	@BigCityLilGirl good point.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 23:27:54	@BigCityLilGirl what interest you charging? And where do I stay. Hehe.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 23:23:55	@BigCityLilGirl that would be very impulsive. Now to find the cash...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 23:21:54	@BigCityLilGirl told ya I was thinking about the place. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 23:13:00	and there is no casino close enough for a day trip.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 23:12:43	People are too damn religious here to do fun stupid things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 23:12:07	Need to act impulsively. That is what I miss most about NYC. There are no impulsive people down South. And nothing worth being impulsive for
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 11:17:56	temperamental as hell it seems. but not moody. what the fuck is wrong with me? #notbipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 03:46:48	I really am a judgmental SOB.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 03:42:13	If you are against #stigma , don't be a hypocrite. You need to be sympathetic to any and all angry responses.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 03:41:22	There is a lot more sympathy the mental illness of someone who is sad than someone who is angry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-09 03:38:20	Sometimes you just want to tell everyone to fuck off for absolutely no reason.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-08 21:47:03	@BigCityLilGirl sorry to hear that. Well its a big world. Lots of cool places to live. And most are a lot more animal friendly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-08 09:59:41	@BigCityLilGirl wow, a semi-negative nyc statement. lol. and i had been thinking today about what i liked about the place. weird day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-08 06:35:46	Maybe it was a #sharknado BBC News - Shark found on New York subway http:// bbc.in/19OgtxW
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-08 04:09:49	I really think I hate most people. And yes hate is a strong word.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 22:47:48	@BigCityLilGirl glad for you. Hopefully it'll be better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 22:47:14	@BigCityLilGirl I didn't mind long commutes in NY. I moved around. Could read. Sitting in one spot in a car sux.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 22:24:14	@BigCityLilGirl I have regrettably left several jobs over it. I now think a lot harder before taking a job.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 22:23:06	@BigCityLilGirl I quit my last job over it. This one is better but I drive over 90 minutes each way, which has become physically painful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 22:01:39	@BigCityLilGirl lol. No. That is why I was addicted to xanax. I just avoid all stress now. Except I chose to go back to work. Fuck me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 21:59:54	There are multiple self proclaimed MH writers around here that keep writing zanax. Don't quit your day job.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 21:58:27	Talk to tdoc about anxiety yesterday. Who would've guessed that my anxiety would get worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 21:56:00	Ohhhh-kay, no rain is causing that panic feeling.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 21:52:20	I am not so lonely that I want to be around certain people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 12:15:45	everything seems so weird again. i seem to be the only one on my twitter feed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 11:48:38	okay, every stupid little thing is making me feel panicky. christ, how do you think of nothing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 11:47:03	watching through my lenses, nobody actually looks happy. they all look like they are faking it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 11:44:55	it makes me ill watching people i know grow older and seeing how ugly their lives turn out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 11:42:06	addiction or not, i would take xanax now. but then i would have to kill myself, rather than go through withdrawal again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 11:40:20	@ybnormal622 my gut tells me i was wrong trying these last number of years trying to be the kind of person people tell me i should be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 11:39:07	#depression #panic think i made a very bad decision going back to work. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 11:38:16	bad day. bad day. bad day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 10:24:07	I keep trying to give people a chance. They don't want to give me one. Getting sick of the degradation. No point to be nice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 01:18:06	@PainIntoPeace wow. Be careful. Terrible drugs. Very addictive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-07 01:13:59	@PainIntoPeace do you mean 0.5 mg? 5 is a huge dose. You'd be an addict in a week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-05 06:16:40	@PainIntoPeace problems with mania anymore. Just hyperactivity and anxiety. So I might take them without a mood stabilizer. Cross fingers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-05 06:15:49	@PainIntoPeace I got addicted to xanax/klonopin. I may try antidepressants, but I have had bad side effects in the past. I don't have ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-05 06:05:22	@PainIntoPeace anxiety. My tdoc has suggested that I should take an antidepressant for anxiety, since I cannot take benzos.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-05 06:04:50	@PainIntoPeace mood stabilizers do not help anxiety really. I am on lamictal, not sure if it is a mood stabilizer, and it causes me ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-05 03:53:28	Started my workout an hour later and took an hour longer. What a wasted day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-05 00:18:50	@bipolarvoice and if seems more and more that all news is "news". :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-05 00:15:48	@bipolarvoice you can't take entertainment reporting seriously. The source is probably her publicist.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 12:24:32	@Owl615 thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 11:32:17	I talked to people I didn't know. Wow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 09:16:56	Made a big ass burger, had a drink, now going to a usually boring party. Let's make it fun!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 07:27:40	@BigCityLilGirl you just need to find some swingers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 07:15:05	@BigCityLilGirl girls and guys have different attitudes about it. And I just think everyone makes too big a deal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 07:02:58	staring randomly for an hour at the computer. should've just watched tv.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 06:51:21	I suppose I should just go to the party and have a drink or two. You never know...lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 06:35:28	@BigCityLilGirl not the same, at least for me. red light district in amsterdam is like a mcdonalds for sex. cheap and little effort required
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 06:31:06	@BigCityLilGirl only had a hooker once--in Amsterdam, but it is very controlled and safe there. Wasn't great, but it was cheap.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 06:30:03	@BigCityLilGirl I had never heard of those. Lucky dog!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 06:27:59	@BigCityLilGirl did she have to get checked in baggage?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 06:27:05	@BigCityLilGirl i didn't know they had those. that does sound stupid. :) i haven't been manic in years. i'll take a little.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 06:13:48	@BigCityLilGirl hmmm. could be dangerous. of course, that might be fun. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 06:12:08	I suppose it really doesn't matter what diagnosis the docs give me, I already know my true diagnosis is "fucked".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 06:10:30	@BigCityLilGirl so true. what did you finally do to get into that rave last week?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 05:57:53	If I go to this party I need to induce a big hypomanic attack or I will sit around and talk to no one because most of them bore or annoy me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 05:54:04	I can stay home tonight and feel stuck, or I can go to a get together that I never enjoy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 05:53:31	Tired, not cranky, at least not yet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-03 00:34:48	@ybnormal622 I mix in some diet lemonade mix. Yum.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-02 23:31:58	Best advice from my new tdoc. Switch to Tea instead of diet soda.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-02 23:22:30	You can't always get rid of your fear but you can go on despite it. That is real courage.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-02 21:27:26	@BigCityLilGirl living the good life. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-02 11:01:56	I just cannot describe this feeling.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-02 10:46:31	I think I am high. Haven't taken a thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-02 05:29:54	@ybnormal622 I am not sure Twitter is about having something good to say. More like saying anything you want or whatever comes to mind. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-02 01:29:48	@nejireta_ki rain makes me sad. Sun makes me tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-01 05:04:11	@oxymoronic82 @ybnormal622 oh I far from being thought of that nicely. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-01 04:44:16	@ybnormal622 @oxymoronic82 i am far more disturbed than anyone gives me "credit" for. They keep thinking I am bipolar when I am bpd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-01 04:42:23	@ybnormal622 cynical mW says they are like guys at the bar looking for distraught women to take advantage of. Pet me there. Purrrrrrrrr.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-01 04:11:56	How are cats so good at knowing when we are unhappy or sad?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-01 04:09:18	Even the psychiatrists read me wrong. I am so intelligent and articulate. Its a mask they can't see through.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-01 04:03:43	So much for not being angry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-01 02:26:37	@ybnormal622 i was charming yesterday. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-08-01 00:21:44	Despite the fact that it is raining, I am not moody ... yet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 09:50:42	@BigCityLilGirl lol. It just came out. I am not even sure what I mean.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 09:45:19	cereal tweets
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 09:44:59	i have not yet accepted the truth behind the curtain. i would have to acknowledge the curtain first.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 09:43:39	sweet tea addiction is the worst...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 07:45:34	since when does a tweet have to make any sense
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 07:45:09	did anger cause this headache or did this headache cause the anger. or is the anger just there all the time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 07:40:07	my semester schedule is now calendered. tomorrow i write syllabi.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 07:06:58	I am going to fill up your timeline with a long series of annoying and angry posts until either you unfollow me or my dinner is ready.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 07:05:55	absolutely positively have to get some work done tomorrow. #FML
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 07:01:16	i hate you. and you too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 06:54:00	on a completely different note, Windows 8 sucks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 06:41:54	god i hate facebook. but it might be easier to off myself than to go off facebook.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 06:38:43	i don't need friends, i need drinking buddies, and a good poker game.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 06:38:22	if i can't stand to listen to the friends i have, i don't think i stand much chance of making new ones.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 06:35:39	@Black_Pandora and cute and cuddly. and have far less flaws than people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 06:33:21	tdoc says i need to make new friends. decided afterwards that i hate people. maybe i will get more cats.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 06:32:50	tdoc says i need to make new friends. no shit. suggests meetups with my interests. none near me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 05:59:48	Why cant people admit when they are wrong? And if you offer concession to facilitate accord, why do they have to belittle?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 05:09:12	Fuck it. The addiction wins.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 04:24:57	went from being very tired to very irritated.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-31 04:12:02	I don't get enough appreciation from trying to help people to be worth the high risk of anger from the person who doesn't accept the advice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-30 00:10:45	At last, the final cut.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-29 20:51:57	Anxious because I am alive and awake.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-29 10:13:09	My DVR contains mma, boxing, muay thai, and star trek.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-29 10:11:53	Now of course this is all assuming I am currently in touch with reality. I think I am but I could be kidding myself. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-29 10:10:56	In further reality, my job doesn't have much supervision, so there is usually a very low stress level for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-29 10:10:09	In all reality, I have been a pretty good employee for the last 8 years. Only mark is quitting one job because it caused too much anxiety.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-29 10:08:49	I have bipolar but if I had a business I would never hire someone with bipolar. I mean I know my work history....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-29 10:05:09	I don't feel particularly mental today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-29 10:00:31	Time to start prepping for the new semester. I am so ready to fail people this semester
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-29 01:49:34	Heavy lifting. Heavy metal. Heavy adrenaline rush!!!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 10:45:22	My ear is clicking, Too much sweet tea.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 10:42:22	@BigCityLilGirl must be one hell of a rave if ur twitting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 07:03:58	So fucking tired
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 03:49:26	Wanted to be home asleep but instead I out. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 03:43:53	I just ran away but I have nowhere to go. Goddamnit. I really don't want to go home.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 02:46:00	@ybnormal622 sugar and caffeine. Heaven.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 02:45:34	@ybnormal622 I have always wanted to try. Never had a good opportunity.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 02:39:29	Still not too late to do something this weekend. But I won't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 02:35:21	Maybe I should take a nap.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 02:35:05	Energy draining fast. Its work to type. Sweet tea won't be ready in time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 02:22:59	In about 5 minutes I won't even want to cheer myself up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 02:22:31	I feel like their is a lid inside of me pushing down my mood.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 02:21:37	Here's hoping that sweet tea can change the direction of my mood.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 02:02:42	In that strange mood where I don't want to deal with other people but I don't want to be alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 02:00:01	What alcohol mixes well with sweet tea? Would rum or amaretto go well?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 01:58:14	What happens if you take another ambien after you wake up in the morning? Do you fall back asleep or are just little high?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 00:27:01	@hypomaina I was probably hypomanic or mixed for a long time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 00:19:25	@hypomaina overworked for a year.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-28 00:15:10	@hypomaina I'd never been that depressed nor for that long.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-27 23:53:23	Feeeeed me Seymour....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-27 23:31:17	Big Green Egg heating up. Ready to smoke some pig!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-27 13:06:04	up late again...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-27 11:00:38	i've been so down for so long, that not being unhappy feels manic. am prolly in more of a mixed state. who knows. who cares. doesn't matter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-27 10:58:37	but i like being hypomanic, and i was so horribly depressed for so long--nearly 2 years--that I deserve it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-27 10:50:24	Should think about wanting to go out BEFORE drinking at home.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-27 10:45:29	@BigCityLilGirl hope you did. Would make 1 of us. Having serious urges to make trouble. Need to live vicariously.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-27 05:36:00	@BigCityLilGirl so much for the heat wave.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-27 05:04:26	Go take a long walk off a short cliff. Call me when you are done.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-27 00:59:09	@BigCityLilGirl too much a/c at work?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-26 09:17:09	@DailyBipolar yeah and GWR everybody irritated at me in return.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-26 09:06:09	I traded anxiety for irritability today. Don't like either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-26 00:47:58	@ybnormal622 got woken up early today too. Figures.lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-25 12:18:50	Did manly things all day. Not feeling so manly now as I limp around like an old man all sore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-25 12:14:15	@DailyBipolar lol. I am being such little kid.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-25 12:08:17	I dont want to go to bed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-25 11:03:51	I so naive. I didn't realize the point of twitter as to anonymously insult people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-25 10:34:57	Anyone want to goto Vegas with me for a week?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-25 10:17:43	Lifted weights for over an hour and spent over five hours in the workshop building a bed. I am a little sore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-25 03:36:58	@sam_stone152 if they aren't serious enough foe hospitalization what do you do with them the other 23 hours of the say when not in therapy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-25 03:29:25	What do you do with a mentally Ill teenager when is hurting themselves and accuses you of being abusive when you try to help?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-25 01:20:49	If you are truly compassionate you will tell people the truth and not lie to make them feel temporarily good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 23:37:17	@bipolarlainey don't over think it. Unless you know the person, you cant interpret. Everyone talks differently.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 11:40:43	Arrogant me was a happier me, but my self esteem was a lot higher then too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 11:36:46	The needs of the one do not outweigh the needs of the many, unless the one is me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 11:24:03	Orange is the new black 50 is the new 20 and crazy is the new normal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 09:47:22	@ybnormal622 whenever I feel happy or normal, it not only goes away in a day or two, but it is often tempestuous.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 09:23:44	I am calm. There must be a bad storm coming. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 08:17:13	@ybnormal622 i am against meds.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 05:25:42	said i should get pdoc to prescribe antidepressants and a sleep stufy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 05:24:44	2nd: she agrees i have a sleep problem, but thinks its a much bigger deal than i do. she says a lack of restful sleep is very bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 05:23:59	1st: while i may be bipolar, anxiety may be a bigger problem, and the lamictal doesn't help. she says i need antidepressants.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 05:23:01	tdoc suggested that i have 2 problems now that i am not giving enough attention to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 04:37:48	tired and more.tired
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-24 00:16:06	When you have been waiting a very long time for something to happen and it does, it feels very anticlimactic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-23 10:25:32	@ybnormal622 lol. Have no idea what to do with it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-23 09:44:33	Having the urge to compete at something I am not good at and overcome. Completely not like me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-23 07:16:19	So tired. So very very cranky. #fuckoffandgoaway
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-23 07:15:55	@BigCityLilGirl i am so sorry. I've been there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-22 09:02:19	fuck 'em if they can't take a joke. i got a million of them anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-21 13:05:06	@BigCityLilGirl damn. You look so pretty.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-21 11:40:22	@BigCityLilGirl only 2. Don't know if I have it in me for more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-21 11:03:55	Oh what a night. Maybe 3?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-21 01:03:07	@amanda_stand ice cream is a goal in and of itself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 23:11:05	Being smart does not require one to sound smart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 23:10:16	@hypomaina as I understand it, lack of a filter can be a symptom of mania, but certainly lots of unintelligent ppl do that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 12:44:34	yeah yeah yeah. goodnight. <3 ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 12:11:14	I am such a lightweight now with alcohol. So pathetic. Good thing I am not a girl. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 11:41:33	@BigCityLilGirl like the flower.;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 11:29:17	Hypomania = I really don't give a shit. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 11:28:18	What could I say that would piss off the most people? Might as well assume I said it, cause I will eventually. #dontknowwhatiswrongwithme
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 10:35:35	I love you all. hehehe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 09:19:32	@TheZunigaGroup I am a professor, and that is the dirty little secret in education-what they dony tell you as they push you to go to college
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 09:10:04	have i mentioned i have an addictive personality, and i tend to substitute addictions? looking for a new one. any suggestions?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 09:07:41	@BigCityLilGirl I just like to encourage healthy, so i was agreeing with you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 09:04:55	@BigCityLilGirl @nypostbiz @nypost couldn't agree more, fat and thigh gap are both terrible extremes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 08:59:40	the smarter a person is, the more they realize how dumb they really are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 08:58:58	@hypomaina brilliant people don't fit in, they see the idiocy of most people's actions it can be depressing and hard to keep your mouth shut
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 08:56:11	the delusions people have to make themselves feel good about things they don't feel good about rather than work hard to change.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 01:24:26	@brain_opera my wife has trouble too. Exercises about 4-5 times a week and eats very little. Loses 1 lb a month if she is lucky.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 01:12:19	@ybnormal622 it will if you are superstitious. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 00:58:51	@PainIntoPeace I know I listen better when I am sleeping. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 00:56:12	@JustMarissa21 til you pass out?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-20 00:37:44	They see it right they see it well but they think this saves us from our hell ... just leave me alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 21:47:47	@Black_Pandora thanks. My mind was racing so hard I thought my head was gonna explode.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 10:37:10	I wish I could use the excuse that I forgot my meds when I act badly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 10:34:27	I am crazy, although a little less so than earlier tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 08:28:56	I really want to go spend all night in a casino.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 08:22:55	@weswroten I do t get it. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 08:19:48	@BigCityLilGirl crazy people have crazy pets. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 08:15:12	@BigCityLilGirl I guess the key is to try not to do it in public. Then its only the pet that stares.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 08:12:25	@BigCityLilGirl that sounds like a great idea. They are currently giving me a terrible headache.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 08:11:19	Not every clever tweet is clever.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 08:10:08	I am smarter than I am. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 08:09:17	Stop trying to fix me when you aren't all put together right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 08:07:12	Saying something over and over again will never make an unpleasant fact true. Some things can't change. #wisdom
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:56:29	I really wish the rational side of me would let go once on awhile.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:55:06	@bipolarlainey wasn't trying to change yours. You responded to me and I was trying to have an intellectual discussion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:54:20	My brain is vomiting. I can't keep my thoughts and feelings inside.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:52:20	I suppose though that I am unique in very real ways that have nothing to do with unrealistic opinions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:50:05	@bipolarlainey where did I say stigma isn't real? I said Santa Claus is real. Just as is Harry Potter and Mickey Mouse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:48:13	I truly believe that I am very unique, not in the humanist but the narcissistic way. With the exception. That my uniqueness isn't all good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:45:07	@bipolarvoice OK. Just wondering.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:44:16	@bipolarlainey you can't touch either. They are both concepts more people know what Santa is than stigma.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:39:48	@bipolarvoice it sounds like your telling me I shouldn't express an opposing opinion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:38:37	Can't have an intellectual discussion when emotions are on the table.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:36:18	@bipolarvoice might be worth it. Less complaining. We cause more of our own problems. Stop looking externally.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:35:06	@bipolarlainey Santa Claus is as real as stigma.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:27:17	@bipolarlainey there is stigma in everything. There are stereotypes and ignorance. So what?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:25:51	@bipolarlainey then you don't understand what I mean.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:23:48	Its moments like this when I understand what it means to be mentally ill. I feel sick but it is all in my head.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:21:48	It has become in to be compassionate. Just not nice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:20:33	I should unfollow anyone who uses the word stigma. We'll never fit in if we are so sensitive. #mental #crazy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:11:47	Sick and tired of being sick and tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:09:24	My cats still like me, but I get angry at them for nothing also.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 07:07:53	My first reaction is anger and/or disagreement...with everything. Example. Pass the salt. Its bad for you whaddya want it for.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 06:48:45	if i could just be somewhere alone where it is quiet, i wouldn't feel so anxious. then i could just feel sad and lonely. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 06:45:22	run run run away, and don't forget me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 06:39:23	@BipolarInBmore ill try
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 06:30:33	so tired. food isn't tasting right. shaking a little. probably overreacting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 06:26:05	@BigCityLilGirl I think I have heard this one before. Maybe its time to date men. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 01:04:14	I am offended by how over sensitive people are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 01:03:37	Everyday there are new reminders of how oversensitive people are. Makes me want to insult everyone I see.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 00:46:52	@ybnormal622 your damn straight!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 00:41:08	I think I lose followers every time I curse. Amazing how much power people give to these words.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 00:40:11	@ybnormal622 false alarm. I was looking at last semesters schedule. Feeling a bit foolish now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-19 00:02:32	Boss fucked up my work schedule. Prolly an innocent mistake but trying not to panic. Have to quit if not fixed. #anxiety #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 18:59:52	@ybnormal622 thanks. I should do more. Am very creative on that stuff. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 12:57:30	I don't want to be fixed I just want travelling companions along the broken road. I still have stories left untold.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 12:51:15	Ambien is too nice a high to be ruined by an argument. Need someone to male nice toe now. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 12:47:34	@BigCityLilGirl meant love YOUR smile. That's it. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 12:46:57	@BipolarInBmore lol. Come down south. We can pass on the highway.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 12:45:59	@BigCityLilGirl love our smile. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 12:45:36	@BipolarInBmore I may move up there in a year. You may have one yet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 12:42:12	@BipolarInBmoreu I wish I had.single friends.I could escape with.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 12:08:44	The closest I get I my student smiling at me while begging for a better grade.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 12:06:52	Wish I still got attentions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 12:06:02	I am not any harder than she is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 12:04:25	Fuck her.she seems happier away from me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 11:22:50	Vision going away.l
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 11:17:40	Hot shower and ambien. Very very relaxed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 11:16:34	Just a few Ambien tweets before I go. #csn #bipolar #insomnia
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 10:46:09	@ybnormal622 all at the same time, of course.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 09:41:39	@JustMarissa21 can't find it. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 09:36:38	@JustMarissa21 in android?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 09:24:42	@JustMarissa21 what is it called? Optimism?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 09:22:38	@ybnormal622 you caught up to me. Hang in there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 01:02:18	@ybnormal622 kids have been just terrible this week. I am hiding from them and letting them beat on each other.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-18 00:49:03	All energy has left my being. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 12:16:02	this venting is doing me good. was very anxious and revved up before, but now i am feeling very tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 12:08:03	i think i am calming down. not necessarily feeling better, but not so anxious about feeling bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 11:52:46	I very clearly have an addictive personality, and i have been substituting vices for years. http://www. askmen.com/money/body_and _mind_100/123b_better_living.html …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 11:51:26	i always wanted to say that last tweet on facebook. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 11:50:55	if my lack of proper grammar, punctuation, spelling, or capitalization bothers you, i will keep doing it because ur an azz.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 11:50:15	if you have an addiction, you stop the addictive behavior because it is damaging your life. what do you do with an addictive personality?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 11:41:54	i am feeling nasty. to anyone i like, i apologize in advance.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 11:41:15	@Black_Pandora since she is a friend of yours, I won't voice what comes to my mind about a statement like that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 11:36:02	i feel sick with my fundamental differences from humanity.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 11:34:43	of course high iq and #bipolar are linked. you are smart enough to see things others do and for that you do not fit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 11:32:50	humanism has become the bully religion
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 11:31:13	people don't care about knowing the truth, only that they are correct.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 11:29:41	i am so utterly alone because I am so terribly unique. A monkey in a room full of birds.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 10:30:55	@ybnormal622 I stopped at one. But yes. Mayfield Homemade Vanilla.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 10:00:36	I may have a second big bowl
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 09:31:01	@ybnormal622 my son thought the cat must be uncomfortable with its whiskers so long....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 09:26:11	i have come to the realization that I have a huge fear of failure, but it is justified as i tend to fail a lot.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 09:20:32	okay i need to get off my lazy ass and go downstairs and get some ice cream before it gets too late.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 09:09:55	@BigCityLilGirl hope your day is better...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 08:55:59	@BigCityLilGirl okay that felt a little better
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 08:55:41	@BigCityLilGirl arghhhhhhhhhh !@#$!@!@#%@#$^@#$^
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 08:54:54	@BigCityLilGirl ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 08:52:43	ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-17 04:49:41	In a lot of ways, I am spoiled. I have had so many pleasures that others don't have that life no longer lives up to raised expectations.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 23:04:03	@ybnormal622 beds are pretty easy to construct. Some plans completely over do. It.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 22:59:21	@ybnormal622 building a bed frame now then buying pillows toppers sheets and later a mattress.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 22:00:38	@ybnormal622 didn't buy anything. just looking. buying today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 22:00:14	@ybnormal622 I can't get that song out of my head sometimes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 21:59:23	@BigCityLilGirl so what, its over. congrats!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 15:37:50	I get so friendly on ambien, all my inhibitions drift off.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:56:42	misery loves company, but i suppose that company is about to be a pillow cause my light is going out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:55:37	@_psychgirl yeah, it just leaves me with the rest of my life to sort out. Its always something, ain't it? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:46:46	@_psychgirl it was real bad the first month, lots of shakes, and stayed awful for 4 months or so, then it tapered off.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:39:03	okay, i am hallucinating a little now. least i know its the meds. and it is fun.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:36:48	@_psychgirl smart to stay away from them. they dull out your senses too. I have been off entirely for over 18 mos, but i can still feel it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:33:38	@_psychgirl gave me 2mg klonopin for sleep, 0.5mg xanax as needed during the day for anxiety. Within six months, i had a physical addiction
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:29:12	@_psychgirl can you use xanax? i can't anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:28:36	@_psychgirl and freaking me out with ones i didn't know i had until i helped you find them for me. it'd be funny if it didn't make me cry
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:25:14	@_psychgirl is why I am here and not in my boudoir at this late/early hour.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:24:47	@_psychgirl well it is all in a nights work for me to find deep dark horrors and bring them to bear on the conscious mind nightly. That ....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:19:36	@_psychgirl is this you, and what are you going to do because really any girl causes all sorts of fun and sad anxieties in me. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 14:10:52	What about me, it isn't fair, I've had enough now I want my share! Moving Pictures : http:// youtu.be/OzQKECQgjW8 via @youtube

500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 13:58:29	body parts don't feel fully connected.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 13:48:07	@BipolarInBmore the 80s, when i was growing up in NY, and had family down there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 13:47:28	@BipolarInBmore not the same, but you can tell us stuff you prolly don't want to tell others, and the is something.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 13:46:21	This ambien is giving me some flashbacks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 13:44:58	@BipolarInBmore yeah. hey, i may be moving to your area next year. Can't say it woulda been my first choice, but i hear its a lot nicer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 13:43:40	@BipolarInBmore @AmazinMojoStarz it isn't the same, but you gotta take the time to get to know some of us
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 13:40:17	@BipolarInBmore 30 minutes ago, my mind was racing, right now it just feels pretty good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 13:37:57	@BipolarInBmore Hi there! how are you tonight!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 13:34:04	it hit hard, it hit QUICK. can't type right, or think quite fast. yeah. lets have an #ambienchat
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 13:30:50	okay, hard to figure out the keyboard on the #ambien . then we can tweet and shop. anyone want to say hi? #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 09:36:03	@Black_Pandora exactly. i don't count, but it seems like I wake up every 30 minutes. and very intense dreams.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-16 09:18:56	I can sleep while I am #hypomanic , but it is a very active sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-15 23:05:43	@BigCityLilGirl oh god no. James Bond. Live and let die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-15 08:37:06	@BigCityLilGirl just watched a movie where people kept getting killed by little snakes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-15 08:35:56	@BigCityLilGirl that too. There was a joke in there. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-15 05:52:03	@Black_Pandora thanks! :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-15 05:50:12	@Black_Pandora I dont think it ever bothered me. I won't learn to work well with others by forcing them to adapt to me. I am the sick one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-15 05:44:35	I am just not sensitive to what others consider insensitive statements about mental illness. Maybe I am crazy? #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 11:54:42	@nejireta_ki since that song came out!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 11:11:00	@kaycey55 there was. Found not guilty manslaughter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 10:46:11	@Beccas43 I have been trying to DM you my email for future questions with no success. I will try later.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 10:43:34	@Beccas43 yeah. Common mistake. You should have a list of exponent rules.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 10:42:29	@Beccas43 yes
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 10:27:27	@Beccas43 y^(6/2) is the square root. Yes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 10:17:47	@Beccas43 yes y^6 is a square. (y^3)^2 = y^(3×2) = y^6. Any even number is a square.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 10:12:30	@Beccas43 OK. That line is confusing. They pulled out the 2y because the rest are perfect squares. Does that make any sense?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 10:09:29	@Beccas43 square root on top and bottom is same as square root of fraction. That is a rule.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 10:08:38	@Beccas43 splitting up in what way?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 10:07:18	@Beccas43 lol. This is hard to do on twitter. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 10:05:06	@Beccas43 I like to do top and bottom first but this works.too. y to the 3/2 = y times square root of y.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 09:57:39	@Beccas43 square root is same as raising to 1/2 power. The rule is to multiply the powers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 09:56:23	@Beccas43 precalc. First the square root distributes. That is apply the square root to each term on top and bottom.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 09:46:26	@Beccas43 ask what you like. DM if u prefer. I teach college all levels.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 09:43:23	@Beccas43 for real? I haz a phd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 09:07:42	Women's MMA is awesome! #invictamma
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-14 07:24:21	@DailyBipolar no worries. I just saw a DM you sent awhile ago. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 12:10:55	@BigCityLilGirl I dont have a soul, do u? Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 12:07:55	@BigCityLilGirl I have paid back a bit and STILL owe 50,0000. Don't even practice law anymore. Very depressing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 12:06:02	@BigCityLilGirl you can probably get a loan for that, but you prolly already have enough student debt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 12:05:12	@BigCityLilGirl awwww. I guess that is payback. I need to go kiss my cat now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 12:04:29	@BigCityLilGirl lol. You mean men. I am not like this, but girls used to tell me I was too nice. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 12:03:21	@BigCityLilGirl bar prep was hundreds at least. Very cool. I will try not to talk abt eating animals. :-). I love cats.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 12:01:24	@BigCityLilGirl ??? My dancer friend was a girl. Grimey?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 11:59:36	@BigCityLilGirl vet?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 11:58:50	@BigCityLilGirl pretty girls never do. Maybe you should be one of their dancers. I has a friend who did that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 11:56:10	@BigCityLilGirl well that IS a good reason. That place is damn expensive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 11:52:51	@BigCityLilGirl you are the one living in NY. You wrote about Webster hall. I didnt think it opens til midnight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 11:50:20	@BigCityLilGirl five minutes is better than none.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 11:49:20	@BigCityLilGirl least ur feeling a little better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 11:32:02	@ybnormal622 oh I so want a boat. Moving next year so no go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 11:31:19	@ybnormal622 exactly! Cool huh?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 11:30:53	@BigCityLilGirl not a lot of ppl retweet me, so I paid attention. And I could relate sometimes, and you're a new yorker.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 09:25:10	@BigCityLilGirl you mentioned ED and I have picked up a little from your tweets.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 09:14:49	@BigCityLilGirl considering your history with food, I would think its really good for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 09:00:47	@BigCityLilGirl and I liked you so much. j/k. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 08:42:33	@BigCityLilGirl does that mean you are a vegetarian?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 08:30:23	@BigCityLilGirl haha.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 08:25:56	@BigCityLilGirl lol. Does that mean I should eat you? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 08:16:50	@BigCityLilGirl I will not leave over a single bite. I will eat even the fat. I will cherish the animal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 07:54:16	Nowadays it seems like you need to say "the real" in front of #bipolar , so that people understand.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 07:51:19	Bought a 23 oz. Rib eye and hand cut 1.5 lbs of french fries.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 07:20:15	Steak steak steak steak. And lots of fries. Homemade fries. Yum.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 06:22:36	I have such a sweet little girl. A cat always makes me feel a little better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 06:18:23	I suppose my only excitement will be rib eye, steak fries, and Cabernet. Lots of the cab I think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 05:19:54	@BigCityLilGirl I am sorry to hear that. I wish I could cheer you up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 05:05:56	@BigCityLilGirl cant argue with a woman about their looks. I'll just say I don't give fake compliments, and your face is very nice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 05:00:26	I am doing it again. Starting fights on Facebook, Need a better outlet. #hypomania
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 04:59:28	@BigCityLilGirl your face isn't fat, but you do make some funny faces in selfish.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 04:45:45	@BigCityLilGirl from skipping work today I assume? New ones come around. Maybe you weren't ready yet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 03:19:32	such a wasted day
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 03:15:10	and i feel it draining. the adrenaline doesn't seem to last long after a workout.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 02:16:38	@DailyBipolar oh I would be glad for that. I am kinda there. Just trying to feed it so I don't become depressed again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 02:01:16	Searching... seek and destroy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 01:57:57	@WickedTheodora I may not respond much but I read your tweets. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 01:47:38	@DailyBipolar seriously. Except it turns around when stifled. Cross fingers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 01:37:25	Need to find something exciting to do. Can't take sitting home this weekend. Feeling energetic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 01:24:53	@BigCityLilGirl I'll try to play nice. Its tough. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 01:20:34	@BigCityLilGirl a woman of many words. But very expressive. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 01:11:45	@BigCityLilGirl I am sure they deserved it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 01:04:57	@BigCityLilGirl in hindsight, it amazes me how I never got arrested. NYC cops are very forgiving of stupid shit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 01:01:07	@BigCityLilGirl wish i could help. hope you didn't hit anyone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 00:44:56	@BigCityLilGirl too many hours work as an attorney--too much anxiety. work maybe 30hrs/wk, 30 wks/yr teaching college.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 00:44:15	@BigCityLilGirl hoping you didn't ask. i have had 2 of the most unpopular professions. used to be an attorney, now a college math teacher
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 00:42:45	@BigCityLilGirl that could be fun, brain squishing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 00:36:36	@BigCityLilGirl that is pretty cool. don't think i could do that. too slimy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 00:29:50	@BigCityLilGirl researching anything interesting?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 00:27:41	@BigCityLilGirl apparently that is dangerous. the poop of some monkeys can be fatal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 00:24:06	@BigCityLilGirl zookeeper, medical facility? friend of mine is a researcher in immunology and worked with them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 00:17:19	@BigCityLilGirl http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=PsjZ_k RMhEQ&noredirect=1 …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-13 00:16:19	@BigCityLilGirl ha. we are back to that. lemme think about what I can do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 23:28:24	@BigCityLilGirl lol. I meant gl, or good luck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 23:23:33	@BigCityLilGirl rooftop beach, nice. Gl on the weather.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 23:17:37	@BigCityLilGirl women are lucky like that. Us guys need a break, even a little...at least sometimes. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 23:02:34	@BigCityLilGirl rest and recovery. Can't perform without some down time. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 22:51:07	@BigCityLilGirl I didn't. Exercise, don't get fat, and get a lot of sleep. Avoid sunburns. Take vitamins. I think the sleep is critical.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 22:38:14	@BigCityLilGirl most of them do. Most ppl so NOT age well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 22:18:52	@BigCityLilGirl she didn't look bad at all. Has a kid too. Been trying to find out what happened to her for 10 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 12:41:28	its a good thing the ambien is starting to hit hard. i would be haunted all night. that pic was a #GameChanger
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 12:40:35	@JustMarissa21 you look relaxed. if that is true, its a good start. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 12:26:05	what a mood changer. i just wasn't expecting to see a pic of her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 12:08:47	Loved only 2 women in my life. Haven't even seen a picture of one in 13 years, until tonight. Speechless. Just...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 11:19:02	Son do I go to bed tonight or stay up again?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 10:55:48	A student of mine once said I looked like Loki. Could be worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 10:54:08	Why are people so obsessed with solving the world's problems. Do they feel powerless in their own lives?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 10:03:30	@justinrmatheson been there. Still there. Look forward to hearing what you do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 09:59:36	probably taking a job near DC next year. and what am i most looking forward to? being near casinos. #mania
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 09:58:43	yay its almost the weekend. oh wait, i have nothing planned. so no difference really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 09:58:17	keeping the faith. just not sure in what.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 09:18:21	@BigCityLilGirl I can get sweet talked into a lot of things but dancing like a monkey and uploaded to the internet. nah. :0
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 09:08:40	@BigCityLilGirl that is good, because I would have felt really guilty not sending a vid back.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 09:04:06	@BigCityLilGirl you first. or do i sound like I am 9?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:55:11	@BigCityLilGirl no apologies, just making sure you aren't expecting some stupid video...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:52:17	@BigCityLilGirl I am not that bored yet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:50:31	@BigCityLilGirl well, i am no dancing monkey...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:49:13	@BigCityLilGirl spose that's a good reason.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:48:03	@BigCityLilGirl I am trying to entertain you. :( lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:47:03	@BigCityLilGirl don't know if I ever did those. Psychedelics were more my thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:42:02	@BigCityLilGirl I am a guy with a stupid fast metabolism. But food is a worse addiction. Drugs are better for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:39:42	@BigCityLilGirl me too. And eating french fries in some diner. Often the one under the Roosevelt island tram.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:37:14	@BigCityLilGirl 4 am was always my favorite time there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:35:37	@BigCityLilGirl I used to do that on the FDR at 4 am.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:34:59	@BigCityLilGirl lmao. I once tried to meet someone in AC and their car died on the way. Do I know you? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:33:48	@BigCityLilGirl in the south, I can drive around at 100 and still get passed. Can't do more than what 20 in NY? Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:31:52	@BigCityLilGirl okay, meet me in the middle, or Atlantic City. Car will be a little safer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:17:33	@BigCityLilGirl 25 years there was enough. I think I would rather go to Vegas. But I would do shots with you any day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:12:39	@BigCityLilGirl can I buy you a drink. :-) pic.twitter.com/7CGv9jpLAG
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:09:11	@BigCityLilGirl good assumption but I might as well be. Close enough
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:06:10	@BigCityLilGirl can't help it. Its like a reflex. Kind of annoying really. Like I see a fat guy and I think, who would sleep with you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:04:15	@BigCityLilGirl I judge everyone but not badly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:03:24	@BigCityLilGirl I don't look it but I am old. 42.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:02:41	@BigCityLilGirl i don't know if I wanr to answer that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:02:11	@BigCityLilGirl now you sound like an 80s girl. And I don't mean born then.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 08:00:51	Omg does this guy live in fantasyland? Oh wait he plays video games all the time and is 45. Answered my own question.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 07:43:45	@BigCityLilGirl lmao.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 07:40:54	@BigCityLilGirl you're in part why I am complaining. I can't reply to half the shit you say. just don't want to be that creepy guy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 07:36:06	A girl being sexual is hot, a guy being sexual is creepy. Not fair.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 07:17:01	@BigCityLilGirl well, you can call me out anytime, be brutally honest. its a favor to know what people really think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:59:05	@BigCityLilGirl a bitch protects her pups. i think its a compliment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:55:37	@BigCityLilGirl i suppose honesty shouldn't really be considered rude. so what do your friends make of your honesty?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:45:04	there is no mental health or illness, just societal norms.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:44:41	there is no cure, just different stages of delusion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:38:32	@BigCityLilGirl @Owl615 i could go on and on about that. fuck em. don't care. i try to be polite to those i know well though. still...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:37:22	@BigCityLilGirl narcissist huh? always good to meet another.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:34:47	@BigCityLilGirl @Owl615 I have the convo anyways and apparently offend all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:23:41	@BigCityLilGirl then again, you probably get stupid around stupid boys. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:23:18	@BigCityLilGirl you probably are, dumb ppl don't talk to me. lol. and of course, "issues" are a symptom of genius.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:16:46	@BigCityLilGirl I would have to disagree for us to argue. we can talk about how girls are stoopid too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:11:42	@BigCityLilGirl what do you want to fight about. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 06:06:25	Its really been a long time since I argued with anyone face to face. Only online. Maybe I should change that. heh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 05:59:06	I am much too easily annoyed sometimes...like now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 05:57:01	@PainIntoPeace You are entitled to take whatever you need for yourself and is available from anywhere. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 05:49:24	I suppose others aren't really that different from me. I know a lot of ppl think things that I go ahead and say.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 05:43:57	Humanists are bullies. I am a narcissist that loves a good fight. This means I really dont belong on Facebook.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 05:24:37	But then again I like talking to ppl and I do better when I don't expect much of a reasonable response.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 05:23:09	I wish I could unsay things. Not because I didn't mean it, but because it isn't worth the trouble of listening to the response.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 05:14:22	Its hard yo have much of a convo when someone completely agrees with you, but most ppl are offended if u disagree w them. Ugh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 01:31:38	@BigCityLilGirl that is great. Don't kill urself working too hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 00:35:52	@ybnormal622 friend here put their dog down, felt guilty til his gf reminded him what a wonderful life he gave thet dog. im sure you did too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 00:34:27	@ybnormal622 i hope it is easier for you, but i don't fault yourself if it takes awhile to be back to normal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 00:33:59	@ybnormal622 when they died a few years later, i was so crushed. i ended up losing my job, broke up with my wife (gf then), and so on. ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 00:33:06	@ybnormal622 when i met my wife, i told her that other than my parents and grandparents, i was closest to my cats (who were 15 then)....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 00:31:46	I hate when people talk about first world problems. How dare you discount anyone's problems.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-12 00:24:45	yay, we are buying a new bed, and all sorts of accessories. I get to spend money, how fun! and maybe get better sleep too. #mania #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 22:27:40	@ybnormal622 that is so sad. I am so sorry. I have lost many furry friends, usually living 15 or more years. I understand.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 22:10:58	@ybnormal622 of course not. Right and wrong are highly subjective and life has unlimited variables to consider.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 22:09:25	@ybnormal622 yeah. But I am such a little kid about not wanting to go to bed, even when I have nothing to do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 22:07:22	@Shawnie_0405 she kept comparing me to her son in law. It was weird.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 13:10:54	i am just gonna do it. just get in there. lay there all night. yeah, that is what i am gonna do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 12:52:29	Don't want sex or porn or drink or poker. Don't want to give up on the day yet either. #cagedmania
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 12:40:51	I am not letting go. I really need to just go to bed. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 11:52:22	Haunted and torturing myself with memories of exes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 11:43:26	My therapist asked if I get really frustrated with other people because I am so smart. Not sure what to make of that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 11:41:55	Dogs rule cats drool....bazinga
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 11:30:18	Could I get some love?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 11:12:09	Life is about the journey, but the pursuit of happiness has to be about reaching the goal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 11:02:48	Got that itch again. Very hard to scratch itches living in the bible belt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 11:00:46	@oxymoronic82 show offs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 10:58:10	@oxymoronic82 at least you didn't get in trouble for posting her butt in a thing earlier. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 10:27:15	I really love gambling, drinking, and naked women. I am not necessarily lacking in these but its never enough. #addtiction
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 10:09:57	@ybnormal622 I am furry and irresistible. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 09:24:23	Kiss me. I'm a cat.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 09:16:06	I am under stimulated. That is my biggest problem it seems. Seriously.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 06:59:18	@oxymoronic82 the ones who love you back break your heart the most.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 06:24:13	I can always find something in someone to fall in love with. And that is why everyone always breaks my heart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 06:20:51	I am only entitled to breathe if I am strong enough to keep my head above water.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-11 06:17:57	Low expectations are the secret. And honestly, why are we entitled to big ones? Mental illness is in part from our indulgent culture.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-10 10:53:10	@BigCityLilGirl u tell em. Love a manic woman. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-10 08:26:10	@Beccas43 Zoloft can cause weight gain and sexual side effects.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-10 07:59:55	Maybe I will start gambling again. I am so much happier when there is excitement in my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-10 07:57:41	Parties the last two weekends. Looks like this weekend will be boring though. Sigh...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-10 07:53:12	Don't feel bad at all. Don't really feel good either. Not sure I like having no feeling at all. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-09 09:10:12	@DailyBipolar thanks for sharing. You sound very motivated and in touch with your moods.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-09 09:04:29	@DailyBipolar took ambiem. Slept beautifully. Spent the day shopping. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 12:17:52	Ambien kicking in slow tonight
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 10:37:58	@kaycey55 self torture. Good description.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 10:16:33	@DailyBipolar loved one is an addict?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 09:46:54	@kaycey55 it sucks more when i start thinking about it as soon as I wake up. I have to remind myself I still have a whole day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 09:45:35	@DailyBipolar I have battled issues with alcohol gambling and sex though. Just not xanax. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 09:44:47	@DailyBipolar you should. I am actually not mentally addicted to xanax but I had a physical dependence. Go figure.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 09:43:15	@kaycey55 meds cause more problems for me than they fix. Take very little now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 09:25:03	@DailyBipolar ambien. Not addicted to that yet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 09:24:13	The better a day I have on Saturday, the worse I feel on Sunday, knowing it is almost Monday.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 09:23:23	@DailyBipolar lol. I woke up on it. I will go to sleep soon .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 09:18:59	Suffering from pre-anxiety. Worrying about feeling anxious tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 09:18:22	@kaycey55 thanks. Not able to distract myself right now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 09:09:30	Can't get past feeling lonely and sick, for no reason.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 08:44:48	Escape to virtual social life because of likely real one. Found that the internet imitates life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 05:16:28	Just bc you disagree doesn't make it wrong. 2 people can believe differently and both still be right. The world works in funny ways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 05:15:05	Learn to tolerate what you don't like before trying to change it. You will be a better person for it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-08 05:14:04	The world is usually not at fault.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-06 05:49:59	@BigCityLilGirl don't you live in queens? That ain't NYC. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-06 05:48:17	@BigCityLilGirl yeah but at least grass grows here, not concrete. And the air smells nice is summer... :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-06 05:02:59	I want to practice random acts of kissing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-04 00:36:19	@PainIntoPeace NOT the supermarket cheapies. find a good kitchen supply store. i love chicken--almost as much as steak. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-04 00:32:57	@PainIntoPeace spend money on a good meat thermometer. don't use it near the bone. pull the chicken at 165-170 in the middle. let it rest
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-04 00:31:01	5 people, 2 cats, conflict is inevitable, peace is rare.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 12:03:27	@Numbaholic need to invoke the music triggers again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 11:06:49	I should watch more baseball. Might help me cut back on the ambien.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 11:05:52	When the light goes out, my mind turns on, #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 10:19:35	@ybnormal622 let's say I can have very strong opinions. Fake is a lot more polite and goes over better in the south.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 10:15:54	@ybnormal622 I am not antisocial, people just don't like me. I choose not to censor myself. Honesty is not really a virtue.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 10:12:13	@BigCityLilGirl oh but I so hate the cattle cars. And the smell. But I do miss the Greek food, Italian food, diners. And the casinos nearby!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 10:08:39	@ybnormal622 I log to track, not really connections.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 10:08:04	@ybnormal622 I teach college, so I don't miss it at all. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 10:06:13	@ybnormal622 yes I suppose you have it worse, but it is too religious here for me, even if I am near a relatively big city.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 10:01:44	@ybnormal622 nah. But I love logging things. I have a log for food, exercise, gambling, sex. Why not mood. I ain't blogging. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 10:00:11	I may not ever want to live in NYC again, but damn this place is boring,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:55:58	@ybnormal622 smelling gross things is a guy thing. We are all boys here cept the wife and one cat. And u r nice paying, I just say do it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:45:11	@ybnormal622 smell test. Make my oldest smell things. When in doubt throw it out. Fridge space is too precious in this family.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:44:06	@ybnormal622 we can virtually howl together then when you need to! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:41:23	@Beccas43 lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:40:07	@Beccas43 I am more about donating my time and services...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:38:53	@ybnormal622 lmao. I organize the fridge everyday. I have four other people just throwing things in and out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:37:30	@ybnormal622 all my rowdy friends have settled down. I am not a lone wolf. May have to just bay at the moon!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:35:32	@ybnormal622 oh i do. They tremble and ignore me anyways. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:24:48	@kaycey55 for me, it's like a shelf being slowly pulled out and I am watching everything fall off and break.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:23:24	@Beccas43 lmao. I only get arrested when I am mad. Not mad now. Definitely not mad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:21:03	@Beccas43 bummer, prolly a good idea though. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:16:54	@Beccas43 hypo, but trying for more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:07:39	@hypomaina I wouldn't be able to sleep on that much.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 09:04:44	Hypo mania is best fueled by opportunity. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 08:58:39	So Twitter world, where should I go, what should I do?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 08:55:54	@BigCityLilGirl now I just need the ride to go with it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 08:52:08	@BigCityLilGirl wheeeeeee. :-) lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 08:51:23	I may actually be hypomanic. Finally. For the last two years I thought I lost my "bi"!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 08:50:35	Have desire to spend money.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 08:50:21	Can't read a book but have enough attention to read tweets.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 08:48:15	A little too "energetic" to read right now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 05:49:59	It don't take long til they ain't scared of that barking dog that doesn't bite.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 05:49:28	Keep forgetting to be mean to my kids. No wonder they ain't listening.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 00:13:57	I have Android. How about eMoods?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-03 00:05:05	Anyone use the Moody Me app? My new Tdoc wants me to journal or at least use the app. Anny comments appreciated.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-02 11:10:37	@ybnormal622 I was worse on multi meds. Developed an addiction to xanax klonopin only taking 2 mg.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-02 10:50:47	@ybnormal622 that other response was for you too but tagged you wrong. On 25 but been as high as 100.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-02 10:49:19	@MrsBipolarity @ybnormal22 I never took more than 100 but now am on 25. Keep dropping cause of anxiety and insomnia.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-02 10:03:35	Anyone take lamictal/lamotragine? What dose? I take a minimum dose and wonder if that is normal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-07-01 09:18:52	What a busy fun weekend this was.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-29 07:36:50	@JasonDappert @BipolarTweets or learn from them. Are you sure you didn't let the diagnosis beat you? I quit when I first got mine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-29 01:28:24	love my kids more when they aren't around. #baddad
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 10:34:31	Preparing to drug myself in an attempt to get on a more regular sleep schedule.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 09:58:52	@ybnormal622 hey why not, I do to mine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 09:56:07	@ybnormal622 I have to sleep with a pillow over my head because I can't sleep if I can hear my wife breathe.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 09:52:13	If my students spent as much time studying as they did begging, I might pass some of them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 09:49:45	@nejireta_ki hehe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 09:37:31	Its so very hard to understand each other in 140.chars.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 09:34:12	I get annoyed when people breathe. I am thinking I may be too sensitive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 08:54:04	@Beccas43 don't backfire on me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 06:28:06	It makes me sad that people I don't know don't love me. http:// youtu.be/oofSnsGkops
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 06:14:07	The problem with ##bipolar is that you can have all you need to be happy, actually appreciate it, and still be miserable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 06:09:46	The entitlement epidemic really has to stop. 1 humble person is worth 10 of you all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 06:00:27	when my new tdoc asks why are you here, where the hell am I gonna start?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 05:59:35	I seem to like women who like dogs, which is unfortunate, since I like cats.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-28 02:27:14	@TBALion dont drink coffee but a LOT of caffeine. And yes it can affect your mood swings.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 23:27:37	@ybnormal622 at some point time started slipping but I thought I was waking up. It was weird.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 13:38:26	why do you act like you have a stake in it? is it to make you look like a good person?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 13:13:56	need somebody to come knock me out and drag me to bed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 13:08:28	just a little movement shows how high i really am. yay
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 12:38:48	staying up and the ambien is wearing off. crap. need to go to bed. or take another...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 12:25:18	i am feeling the engines revving. and the kids are outside the door, hours away from waking and wanting their dad...who will win? #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 12:23:20	@outfromthedark oh that is why i tweet. everyone here knows I am flawed. besides its one of the few times i can be happy on twitter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 12:12:06	@Beccas43 goodnight my private dancer. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 12:10:48	i am barely typing on...aahhhh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 12:08:38	@outfromthedark i sleep much better, but i do find my increasing lack of physical control amusing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 12:03:40	@Beccas43 awww..:)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 11:56:47	@Beccas43 that is even slightly old for me, but I like it. you gotta be wearing nice long boots...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 11:53:44	@Beccas43 wasn't flashdance about a welder?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 11:53:21	@Beccas43 whats the tune?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 11:50:34	@Beccas43 i lose concentration. most of the music i like isn't danceable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 11:48:34	@Beccas43 okay, i dance with my kids, because its really cute. but don't tell anyone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 11:47:44	@Beccas43 lmao. its such a guy thing to say i don't dance. i do. but only when the girl is worth dancing with.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 11:44:26	You can't take the sky from me...Firefly Theme: http:// youtu.be/D7vS4z6ngQo via @youtube
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 11:43:54	@Beccas43 I could try broccoli, but why would I want to? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 11:40:06	@Beccas43 its kinda trippy to see how small actions can make monstrous differences. I am seeing it everywhere. Oh, I don't dance. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 11:35:52	Its a thin line between winning and losing, between happy and sad. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 11:31:04	Gonna hang out here while I wait for the Ambien to hit me...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 10:48:30	@Beccas43 you tell em. I love your rants.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 09:38:20	So my only high is exercise and boy did I have a crappy workout today. #vent
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 09:36:40	and before anyone asks, I am not looking to exercise that right. besides, i wouldn't tell you if i did.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 09:35:40	Here is a statement bound to lose me followers: freedom includes the right to control our destiny, including the right to end it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 09:27:19	Pdoc is a bit anal. Told him I drink 1-2 drinks/wk now. Instead of being happy I cut back, he said he had to warn me not to drink on my meds
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 07:27:04	made a tdoc appointment for the first time in 6 years. don't think the pdoc believes me though. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 07:26:32	actually feeling some hypomania, wow its been a long time. kind of annoying. too bad it won't last. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 03:09:48	@jakkicowley I have exactly the same thing happening to me. We mist be special. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 02:48:30	@ybnormal622 oh wow. Great inheritance. Too bad you don't enjoy it. I teach at a U that big. Its something unique.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 01:17:47	@ybnormal622 oh I love CFB. Even if my team sucks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 01:02:57	@ybnormal622 not at all. I live in sec/acc country
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 00:04:56	@Beccas43 doesn't suck. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-27 00:03:51	@Beccas43 out of batteries?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 23:25:00	@ybnormal622 wolverine fan? I am sorry....no wonder you are depressed. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 23:23:53	@ybnormal622 staying up on ambien, that is something fun. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 23:22:37	@outfromthedark as long as waking up is still a positive, there is hope.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 13:11:13	Goodnight Moon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 12:57:06	now I am just tweeting to hear myself tweet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 12:54:24	I guess I will say something positive. Here goes. Today didn't completely suck. There, I did it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 12:52:08	don't really have anything to complain about, so I don't know what to say on twitter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 12:38:32	@Beccas43 oh it is. I could write a book telling stories about my students. I have a thick stack of whiny emails to work from.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 12:31:21	@Beccas43 I don't usually b*tch about my student until exams, but I thought I might start early as I am redoing my courses anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 12:23:50	@Beccas43 so that when I have to listen to them whine and complain, they at least have some good reason I suppose.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 12:19:08	either everyone is gone (unlikely), has unfollowed me, or my feed has gone dead.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 12:05:04	sitting up here watching over lightning down below, the earth is turning why does it go so slow...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 11:57:00	of course, sleep would be better, but I can't sleep knowing they are looking forward to school.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 11:52:35	Thinking up ways to make my new freshman hate college...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 08:55:39	@Beccas43 awww, you are sweet. Cynicism aside, thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-26 08:52:18	@Beccas43 You are in quite the mood. Hope they listen.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-24 23:28:09	@oxymoronic82 thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-24 23:04:48	I feel awful today. Really really awful. Almost cried talking to pdoc. I never cry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-24 10:57:59	why am I so tired all day but wide awake at night?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-22 23:18:31	@JasonDappert it seems sometimes like I couldn't pick up the keys if they were put in my hand. Some sort of self paralysis.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-22 23:07:07	I am self imprisoned and I seem to have lost they key.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-22 07:20:34	@StillHopefulMom I don't mean to be nosy. I kinda wanted to know what he was thinking at the time. What he experienced.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-22 06:33:44	@StillHopefulMom but what did he do. He opens up about other mistakes. Shame is no path to healing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-22 02:27:22	It isn't hate to not give things away. I can choose to help but it doesn't mean the recipient is entitled to it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-22 02:25:44	You don't deserve to be fed, clothed, and happy. Go out and earn it. Why should someone else give it to you for free?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-22 02:24:55	We are all oversensitive and entitled to only what we can earn, not what we think we deserve.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-22 02:21:42	When I was a kid a sense of entitlement was frowned upon. Now it seems to be a virtue.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 23:26:51	If I don't overthink everything, how will I fill all the hours in a day?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 10:22:19	@Beccas43 looove Xanax. That is why I can't have it. And Klonopin too. Zoloft works wonders on my son.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 10:18:27	@Beccas43 ahh ok. You wouldn't be calm, closer to unconscious,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:57:55	@Beccas43 didn't I see where you said you were on seroquel
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:49:10	@Beccas43 lol. Yeah I am much calmer than when I was a kid, just not as calm as I would like.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:47:29	@Beccas43 what am I? Oh what a question is that one!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:45:04	@Beccas43 actually I am lying. Not calm, just hide it better. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:44:11	@Beccas43 I guess I am pro choice, who knew?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:41:57	@Beccas43 and would go to a tdoc, I might be "cured". Getting older does make one calmer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:40:37	@Beccas43 staves off the "blues" but gives me anxiety and insomnia. On lowest dose, and no bad side effects. If I were less willful...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:37:41	@Beccas43 better than "superbatshitcrazy"
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:35:55	@Beccas43 took lithium for a few months. Was a miracle drug, then stopped working, then bad side effects. Taking minor dose of lamictal now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:33:54	@Beccas43 I haven't been manic in years and years. So I believe it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:31:42	@Beccas43 I am calm but hate it. I suppose I am a little jealous there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:30:35	@Beccas43 lmao. Okay maybe I can but I definitely dont think i want to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:26:52	@Beccas43 mellow is good too. Especially when it comes from within.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:25:47	@Beccas43 oh I can't stop being willful. I have taken various martial arts for at least the last six years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:21:11	@Beccas43 good for you though. Really, bars are pretty sucky.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:20:00	@Beccas43 lol. Don't need a library, have kindle on iPad. Don't like walks, would rather run, swim, lift, or kick someone, :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:11:43	@Beccas43 omg I hope I am not that old.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 09:08:36	@Beccas43 you are sweet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 08:46:33	@Beccas43 yeah. Now I know you are just sucking up. Ha
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 08:41:02	@Beccas43 should I go be that creepy old guy? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 08:36:03	@Beccas43 magical? Lol. Had plenty of those but I am too old to be that hot boy I once was. And I don't have the mania to go with it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 08:29:18	@Beccas43 yeah sounds like the opposite of joy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 08:26:22	@Beccas43 easy for you to say. I got no friends that go anywhere on a thursday.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 08:25:06	Pearls Before Swine @GoComics - http://www. gocomics.com/pearlsbeforesw ine/2013/06/19 … #pearlsbeforeswine #GoComics
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 08:23:07	@Beccas43 there's the too old part again, lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 08:21:30	Wonder if the NSA knows yet who won Game 7?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 08:09:41	Too old to expect Joy to find me out of the blue,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 07:37:56	Ready to be done with her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 07:35:36	@hareofthefog you must not like Sean Connery as james bond.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-21 05:05:29	#bipolar isn't a business. I am not buying your book or reading your professional blog. I only follow back those here to relate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 12:03:28	@outfromthedark wow. i know that feeling. sigh...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 11:58:38	and to make it worse, she is being better, just enough so that I shouldn't complain. its like "chinese" water torture.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 11:56:28	I gave my vows, so I am hers, and she doesn't have to make me happy, so she thinks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 11:55:13	And then, of course, there is the fact that I can't see anyone wanting to date me (that I would also want to date). I am not good alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 11:54:20	i know my kids need both of us, but i don't know if i can make it until they go to college.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 11:52:57	actually going to work tomorrow (don't work in summer), but no desire to go to sleep. too much shit on my mind. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 11:51:45	@outfromthedark don't blame you at all. my pdoc just keeps telling me to find things that give me joy. i think he is right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 11:50:44	@outfromthedark its too hard to restart when you aren't young anymore. I can't climb out of the rut I am in, I see no point.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 11:33:56	why doesn't she know how she feels? I have seen it clear as day for years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 11:18:25	I need a playfair
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 11:12:14	I was happier when I was away from her. but then I was also away from the 3 y.o., so can't tell who I was happy to be away from.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 11:05:52	she says she misses me, but doesn't act like it. should i be worried?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 10:35:39	@outfromthedark my parents are at fault with me, no doubt about it, so I get that. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 10:34:34	@outfromthedark can't control or understand others, I can only worry about myself and my actions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 09:03:48	@JasonDappert thanks for all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 09:00:33	@outfromthedark tweet wasn't at all directed at you. I have lost all friends and barely talk with my parents.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 05:38:25	I was happier when I wouldn't accept my #bipolar , but my life was very hard. Now I am stable and working on being happy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 05:36:51	Ask yourself, would you want to deal with yourself if you were someone else. I know I wouldn't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 05:34:18	It's hard to deny physical illness, but we deny mental illness. If you won't take your pills and see your pdoc, don't talk about stigma.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 05:33:16	We blame others when then desert us and resort to blaming stigma. But we don't do what any addict must--take responsibility and apologize.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-20 05:31:34	Those of us with mental illness often forget how hurtful we are to others. MI is not the same as physical illness.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-19 09:30:19	In case #mania hits, anyone in far away places want a visit from a stranger? :) #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-19 09:28:55	@DailyBipolar thanks!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-19 09:27:50	Sitting home doing nothing = ANXIETY Sitting at the beach doing nothing = BLISS
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-19 09:17:47	Not feeling depressed but anxious and irritable. Since stable does not last, I really really hope it's #mania next. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-19 09:13:06	I am not really convinced treatment works. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-19 09:08:32	A #bipolar is not made for bland normal life. OMG do I need an escape.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-17 10:54:31	The stepmonster was so mean to my kids today, but I am just rolling with it. No anger. I don't know who I am anymore. #bipolar ?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-17 10:24:28	Had more to drink this week than maybe this whole year. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-17 10:18:30	Vacay at an end. 5 hours a day at the pool and beach. Perfect. Except for dads third wife.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-16 21:32:30	@BigCityLilGirl definitely would be a nice vacation. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-16 10:05:07	@Owl615 yeah I have lots of them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-16 09:40:48	@JustMarissa21 they must trust you. Dont load any gunshot apps. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 11:53:39	Has anyone here received a diagnosis of narcissism? How would you even know? Does asking this mean I am not?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 11:52:50	I am so absorbed in myself I don't take the time to understand others and just quickly attribute meaning without context.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 11:50:45	@outfromthedark thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 10:44:42	@ybnormal622 oldest is starting middle school. Can't wait.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 10:42:52	@ybnormal622 goodnight moon. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 10:42:13	@ybnormal622 hear ya. Am ready to return the 3 year old.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 10:22:56	@ybnormal622 sounds like me, but I suppose not by choice. I am solitary by nature but I want more than that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 10:14:32	@ybnormal622 Most things are better than crying. Key is finding something that you can enjoy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 10:08:21	@ybnormal622 and there is a permanent record on twitter too. Lol. But life is more fun with embarrassing things to laugh about.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 10:04:23	@ybnormal622 oh but then that might be fun. I should take one or two myself then. Wash it down with some red wine. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 09:30:27	Anyone want to keep me company? #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 09:29:44	Nighttime is the best time. Really. Sigh... #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 07:51:39	All my rowdy friends have settled down...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 06:11:45	Selfishness is the highest virtue. Without it, you would die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 02:14:43	Don't live your life the way you think you are supposed to. You'll be near the end soon enough and wishing you'd lived it how you WANTED to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-15 02:13:11	So many people think too much, and this is made worse by the fact that they aren't very bright.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 12:19:07	@Beccas43 try everything I wanted to. Now I am just bored and have left too many people behind. I have forgiven myself but not forgotten.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 12:17:58	@Beccas43 process so many times and I know it's flaws. What I need is to find life more interesting, my addictions/mania pushed me to ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 12:15:55	@Beccas43 willing is a matter of degree, of which it sounds you are in nearly 100%. I will never be there. I have been through the ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 12:07:58	@Beccas43 I am not an addict in the traditional sense. But I certainly have an addictive personality.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 12:06:52	@Beccas43 it's good if that is true even half,the time. Wish I could say the same.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 12:06:07	@Beccas43 kicking and screaming inside about it, I have no place other than twitter to let off steam, but I need more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 12:04:31	@Beccas43 the inside as on the out. Add a few minor episodes and a complete breakdown at the end. Now I am recovering but I am still ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 12:03:02	@Beccas43 dry not sober. I wasn't accepting the problems just coping with the symptoms. It was exhausting and not as successful on ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 12:01:48	@Beccas43 my worst times were a very long time ago and I have been outwardly normal since. However, in addiction parlance, I was ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:57:39	@Beccas43 isn't DBT for BPD?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:51:47	@Beccas43 of course I would. :) I find stories that relate more comforting. It makes me feel less isolated and alone,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:45:06	@Beccas43 never said I don't try. Just that I fail.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:44:07	@Beccas43 the damage I have caused myself, and most of it cannot be fixed unfortunately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:43:09	@Beccas43 I have created for myself over a period of years. Now that I have faced and acknowledged my problems, I am left with ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:42:00	@Beccas43 I know you mean well, but empty affirmations don't fix real problems. My issues are not my attitudes but difficulties that ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:39:41	@Beccas43 one example does not make a proof.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:35:54	@Beccas43 why would that be true?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:32:56	I have become quite stable and rational since accepting that my life sucks. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:30:15	Things don't turn out how I'd like them no matter how I try. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:18:20	@aButterfly123 I think you are letting your biases affect how you see things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 11:10:15	@aButterfly123 so are you saying that people with mental illness behave normally?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:56:34	@aButterfly123 I am sure you can list many things. For example, yell at family and friends for no reason. Bipolars are quite unstable,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:52:18	@aButterfly123 I rarely take it. Only when I really need to sleep, or sometimes for fun. My pdoc knows I do it, and I only do it at home.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:49:57	Mental illness means there is a problem with our thinking, so we shouldn't be surprised o upset when people question our judgment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:48:04	We are DIFFERENT. Our mental illness causes us to behave badly. People won't like us. It isn't stigma.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:28:11	@aButterfly123 ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:23:34	@aButterfly123 a movie should make you feel worse. Watching other people enjoying themselves?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:22:11	@aButterfly123 I have had it for years. Been very safe for me. Xanax is a horror.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:17:30	Maybe I will take an ambien. Fun combination. I don't do alone good so being high will make me forget. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:16:21	Had a few drinks. Feel good. But still I am sitting all alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:14:07	Flirt with me. More with me. No one will know. No one is paying attention. It's okay to let yourself enjoy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:10:41	I need to need you but I don't yet know who you are. Are you out there? Anywhere?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 10:04:41	Sex may not be love, but it is intimate and feels like it and I have a good imagination.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 09:26:43	You are what you tweet.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 09:24:17	Love me or hate me. Don't ignore me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-14 09:18:13	Sometimes I just feel like whining. Just deal with it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-13 10:58:15	@ybnormal622 awwww. I had some rescue cats. They were challenging. We have siblings from a good home. They are very well loved.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-13 10:55:47	People seem to be having a rough night tonight. I send my love to my fellow #bipolar sufferers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-13 10:53:08	@ybnormal622 that must be the reason we get along! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-13 08:57:51	It seems like I follow an over abundance of dog lovers. No wonder I feel so alone here. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-13 08:46:17	@singingtacos24 am i too late???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-13 07:34:46	Feeling needy for attention.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-13 07:33:54	Wherefore art thou Alfa Romeo?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-11 11:19:59	Staying near the beach. Hoping I can find a good waitress.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-11 11:18:49	@ybnormal622 thanks but in person I am on a completely different wavelength, even among others with mental Illness.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-11 08:54:16	And if I can't type, everyone is gonna think I am an idiot anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-11 08:53:34	If I can't relate well to myself, how am I supposed to relate ton other peopl
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-11 08:51:32	Still waiting for that magical moment that I used to get before the pdoc said I was #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-10 00:24:59	@sweden not sure I can agree. Nice idea, but life gets in the way. i.e., A parent who is too fat to get out of bed is a bad parent.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-09 23:58:33	@sweden weight correlates to health in both men and women,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-09 08:44:40	Lonely even among friends....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-08 11:55:26	@ybnormal622 oh just hearing that story depresses me. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-08 06:52:39	I may not have many friends, but I don't have any drama either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-08 02:45:14	As I have things tondo today, I am not feeling so #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-08 02:44:40	I would just once like to see someone say that a person looks ugly in a photo on Facebook.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 12:03:51	@crazywhisperer that explains all that whispering I was hearing. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 11:49:17	Is there anybody out there? Is there anybody in there?

500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 09:34:22	Sadness implies ice cream. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 09:18:37	would you care if I didn't care what you cared about?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 09:10:33	@JustMarissa21 wishing you the best...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 09:06:21	I find more solace in knowing you feel as I do than your empty affirmations. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 09:05:30	Those who work hardest to help can be the most troubled. BBC News - US radio host self-help couple in suicide http:// bbc.in/18Sh66j
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 08:59:14	does a word really have such power over you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 08:58:23	can I get a "fuck you"?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 06:52:44	I took a hot bath to soothe my aching muscles, and it sucked all energy out of my body. I have been laying here for hours.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 04:12:23	Moments of clarity that answer why still don't solve anything.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 02:36:58	I really enjoy shooting, but it is an awful idea for me to buy a gun. Im not suicidal but I can be impulsive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-07 02:33:33	Not moody yet, but give me time. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 09:27:30	Okay. Ignore me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 08:56:42	@ybnormal622 Xtian rock? i have so outplayed music it seems. and with 3 boys, being alone has become a bigger fantasy than being with...well
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 08:49:16	@ybnormal622 thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 08:10:14	@Daphne_Writes I have 3 boys, what is your load? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 08:07:47	Pointless to get drunk, as I will just get more moody and possibly sick. Any other suggestions....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 08:06:05	Counterexamples do not disprove stereotypes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 08:05:15	Its usually best to refrain from giving useful advice. People just get offended. Experience is the best teacher anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 08:00:32	I think I say don't hit about 20 times a day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 07:59:00	My 3yo is almost as big as his brother was at 8. It would be fine if he wasn't so violently affectionate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 07:54:26	@bipolarvoice its the only side I have...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 07:51:41	Hey whaddya know....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 07:51:27	even on twitter, ppl don't like to deal with the dark side of #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 07:51:11	That tweet which the dam app won't send....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 07:50:24	@Jennka1 what...with my anxiety? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 07:48:09	@BigCityLilGirl but "try" not to be that girl who is ALWAYS the first one to tale off her shirt. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 07:40:52	#bipolar isn't nice. Its not the sad girl in the corner you feel sorry for. It is strong, angry, dark, and willful. It will not be hidden.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 07:37:42	even on twitter, ppl don't like to deal with the dark side of #bipolar .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 06:18:10	You say you want to feel loved, but then you get picky.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 06:16:48	I think I love you. Oh okay. It was nice to meet you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 04:48:27	If this is living, why is it mentally unhealthy to talk about options?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 04:37:34	Apparently my suffering is irrelevant because you think you have it worse. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 01:36:02	I am on a workout routine that is very hard. Being mentally "tired" make is downright intimidating.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 01:14:46	@ItsJackOk then go to the police.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-06 01:09:31	@ItsJackOk you may not like his methods, but be happy he loves you enough to do them. Lots have parents who hate them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 08:08:06	@manyof_sarah idiot doctors. they did that to me, i got addicted. went cold turkey but have never been the same.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 06:32:32	If I curse enough, will I feel better? #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 06:02:53	Another summer is going to be waster because I am too sour to try to enjoy it. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 06:01:51	@oxymoronik82 fixing computer issues is a serious time vortex.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 05:53:18	@ybnormal622 nice to know I am not alone in my antisocialism. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 05:52:32	I don't care if I offend people who are "here to help", but I don't want to upset those who already are having a hard time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 05:49:55	I am realizing that I even have a limit about how blunt and honest I can be on Twitter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 05:41:53	people will say the most ridiculous things to make themselves feel better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 05:38:06	I always wonder specifically which tweets cause people to unfollow me. Can you retweet yourself?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 04:30:50	@MiaFantasticV @EverydaySexism but the run was more fun?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 04:21:57	feeling sick. might be that I am hungry, who can tell. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 03:23:16	feel the #notsadness slipping away to #sadness . #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 03:18:33	The sad part is that I have to pretend to be someone I am not in order to do what I love.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 03:17:37	Get an opinion of your own. Stop mimicking the accepted line.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 03:16:45	I have opinions that people don't like to hear. I will not be part of the herd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 03:12:55	Fuck it...I am just gonna run off...THWE...and...sit in my car until I figure out what to do next. #sigh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 03:09:47	I am less moody today. lol #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 02:54:32	@ybnormal622 some of the pills are probably to counter the negative effects of others. I wouldn't need the ambien if it wasn't for the lam.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 02:53:29	Lots of people who think they are good are really bullies. #dontbullyback
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-05 02:14:19	I overindulge in negativity and am nauseated by positivity.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 23:53:01	as a teen a psych hospital was a prison, as an adult, it would be a welcome vacation--one I can't afford to take.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 10:50:53	@JustMarissa21 hey no problem. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 10:13:52	@JustMarissa21 I continued the statement in the next reply.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 09:46:50	@JustMarissa21find some sadist. I think fighting is a rush, but not for those afraid of pain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 09:44:23	@JustMarissa21 its a great way to vent anger and you learn to protect yourself. If you feel particularly masochistic you can always ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 09:43:37	@JustMarissa21 when you start, everyone is better, so you get bruised up. You won't know enough to hurt anyone....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 09:37:40	@JustMarissa21 you should take up fighting, like kickboxing or judo/jujitsu. I find it soothing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 09:28:49	@ybnormal622 lol. So sad that I can relate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 06:06:25	Moody and misanthropic. That is my #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 06:05:28	You can do it ... unless you really can't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 05:33:03	@Rabbithole192 a MH diagnosis is merely an ordering by collection of symptoms. And what is considered mentally ill is always changing
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 05:17:16	@brain_opera maybe its just we run out of our allotment of energy???
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 05:15:52	I must have some latin blood somewhere. My body takes a siesta every afternoon whether I like it or not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 05:13:51	Do hyperactive children become couch potatoes as adults?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 05:02:16	I need crazy mental immature friends to hang out with. #beinganadultsucks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 04:51:07	@ybnormal622 I had a klonopin/xanax addiction about 18 mos ago and I have not been the same since.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 04:49:13	@ybnormal622 I am on only 25mg lamictal but it makes me anxious and insomniac so I skip sometimes and get depressed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 03:18:23	@JustMarissa21 and for now, I think I will go settle for the hammock and a lemonade. cheers!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 03:03:06	@JustMarissa21 Canda is so cold. Siesta Key in Florida or maybe the beaches of Aruba--where they will serve you drinks while lounging naked.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 02:57:44	@JustMarissa21 do you have a favorite beach?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 02:50:33	@JustMarissa21 this fantasy is almost too perfect for words. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 02:43:54	@JustMarissa21 that sounds about perfect. need music though...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 02:37:38	@JustMarissa21 the first is just gross, but the second is too cliche.maybe toss in the air and see where the wind takes us... lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 02:34:30	@JustMarissa21 and then do what with you? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 02:12:03	There really is no one like me. I really am quite unique. Not a boast not an exaggeration. I can prove it. Hence, I am alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 02:06:52	Outwardly I am very rational and sane. I really am. I impress myself with the self control I have. The inside is black... #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 02:05:33	I am not suicidal anymore. But I am just waiting out my life. Not sure its an improvement. #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 02:00:51	My apathy is my apparent acceptance of having no way to "express" myself. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 00:36:30	bet you don't think it applies to you...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-04 00:36:16	stop trying to impose your views on others--especially if you think you are right and they are wrong.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-01 12:41:53	I have spent the last 5 to 10 years coping with my emotions by becoming excessively rational. The result is total apathy. Help. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-01 12:22:23	I really think I want out this time. For real actually. Sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-01 07:47:43	@SayNoToSelfHarm to get your way, you are a bully, even if its a parent or sibling. Most people seem to bully when it comes to politics.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-01 07:45:44	@SayNoToSelfHarm bullies have friends. A lot of people are bullies in one way or another. If you ever pressure someone to ....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-01 07:11:27	@SayNoToSelfHarm I just commented on the real world part. Bullying, unfortunately, can be a very successful strategy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-01 07:02:31	@SayNoToSelfHarm I know you mean well, but that isn't true at all. You have to learn to stand up to bullies, they pick on the weak.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-01 03:15:09	Just full of random angry thoughts. So much better than apathy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-01 03:11:49	Stop treating us differently and we will stop "overreacting".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-06-01 03:07:32	Screw what the experts tell you. This is the real world. DON'T BE A PUSSY! Face your problems and face your fears.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-31 11:14:55	OMG here we go again. Can we just cut to the chase and not play it out. Save me the years...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-31 10:32:34	@JustMarissa21 we all are. But we are here to share our complaints. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-31 09:46:43	feeling lonely, but that is nothing new. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-31 09:14:41	@JustMarissa21 disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar, or bpd, where the behavior makes people uncomfortable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-31 09:13:59	@JustMarissa21 and I think plenty of people accept psych disorders like depression, where the sufferer is calm and well behaved, just not...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-31 09:12:13	@JustMarissa21 because psychology isn't science. Its "social science" where if the hypothesis occurs 70% of the time, it is a "theory".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-30 20:37:26	@JustMarissa21 sux abt the job. Parents are a big trigger for us, butt they don't take responsibility b/c we are "ill", which is an excuse
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-30 13:03:22	@PainIntoPeace aaaaccckkkk. Lol. Can't see the trick. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-30 12:59:43	Addictive behaviors are considered adult activities, but they have a very child-like quality and feeling to me. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-30 12:57:00	@JustMarissa21 mine told me they wanted lots of kids, but after one, me, it was too much. If they give you trouble make ur own life w/o them
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 09:06:43	Yes children, this is what your teachers do with their summer vacation.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 09:05:43	Always assume the most positive meaning because its easier to hit someone later than take a punch back.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 09:01:50	That time you want to tweet something profound but have absolutely nothing interesting to say.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 08:06:12	@BigCityLilGirl only you can engineer what you are and will be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 08:05:06	@PainIntoPeace I have a friend in a rural part of the states like you, and I am too smart to have regional friends. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 07:58:03	@PainIntoPeace because your aspirations are more worldly! :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 07:49:40	If you are a person struggling with mental illness, and not a professional or blogger, and I don't follow you back, just say hi and I will.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 06:50:19	@sph never rules, just lots and lots of somewhat offensive ideas.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 06:48:21	HA. Lost followers today. If you are sensitive, don't follow me. And if you only tweet false positives, I won't follow you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 03:43:56	The stronger I get the scarier exercise is. Still, its no accomplishment if it was easy and everyone could do it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 03:41:29	@_psychgirl the world has things backward. Fat is unattractive b/c it is unhealthy. Still there are other things that can be beautiful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 03:28:35	@_psychgirl lol. It becomes more apparent as people age. The unhealthy ones really show it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 03:24:54	@_psychgirl healthy is more beautiful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-29 03:23:07	I truly cannot stand my mother oftentimes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-28 09:21:49	Twitter is awesome. I can say all things that most people are too sensitive to hear. And if you unfollow me, good riddance.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-28 09:18:23	Nobody ever says "boy I am stupid" so why do you advertise that you are bad at math?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-28 09:16:47	That so many relate is pathetic. @autocorrects : How to do math: 1. Write down question. 2. Cry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-27 08:55:44	@ybnormal622 thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-27 01:29:09	But help a person with what they need, not what you think they need. Most people just impose themselves on others.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-27 01:27:01	If you really must help, then help a person, don't just give some money to someone and pat yourself on the back.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-27 01:22:58	See how the world suffers. To be a good person you must help. Just don't notice that you have no power...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-27 01:21:42	The pope used to control the masses through religious , now our leaders control through humanism.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-25 11:14:28	Life is strange. Thanks for the stories...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-25 10:03:00	Sex may or may not be love, but to so expose oneself is truly intimate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-25 06:54:19	It looks like life in limbo again. Am moving but in a year.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-24 22:45:46	frustration in just about everything, but I am so used to it, I barely notice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-23 10:40:01	Wishing for some clarity tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-23 05:47:45	yeah...definitely another bout of depression...sigh...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 23:13:06	I get followers because of the #bipolar in my name, but then I tweet and act #bipolar and get unfollowed. Hypocrites all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 03:30:10	The stupid shit people say ... like me ... right now ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 03:10:25	@ybnormal622 I am trying to rid my feed of all professionals. They recite talking points without thinking about what they are saying.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 01:24:55	@WickedTheodora that is pretty bad if you don't think you can keep food down. Been years since I did that. I hope u feel better soon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 01:15:08	@WickedTheodora not a good way to start. The hard part is sticking with it until you get comfortable and really enjoy it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 01:11:25	2000 tweets, 455 followers, what an interesting place this is for me. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 01:10:39	1999
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 01:10:27	@WickedTheodora I left out exercise. That is a good addiction though. I truly empathize. I do
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 01:07:20	@WickedTheodora I did it the other way. Then sex, motorcycles, more gambling, work, and now boredom. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 00:59:20	@WickedTheodora for all practical purposes, to stop you need to replace it with something. A different distraction.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 00:58:04	@WickedTheodora probably not anytime soon. Hard to exercise willpower on a substance that numb a your brain. Been there though. Just be safe
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 00:52:14	@WickedTheodora and its only a problem if u want to stop or care about what happens to you if u don't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 00:49:58	@WickedTheodora less of a problem if you can admit it. Take baby steps. If u r gonna drink, try to ensure a safe environment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 00:47:39	@WickedTheodora "don't want to" ... real question is can you stop at one or two.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 00:45:48	Just because they are wrong doesn't mean you are right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 00:43:29	Social science is NOT science. Psychologists don't always get it right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 00:41:22	@justinrmatheson the language suggestions give power to the words. Wrong approach. Own the words. I am crazy, so what?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-22 00:39:01	Another tragedy of the month. Meanwhile many suffer and die while no one notices. I will not mourn those I don't know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 12:37:47	had plenty of panic attacks the last few years, here's prayin' for a manic attack.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 12:37:12	supposed to be bi, but I haven't swung in the other direction in a long time....lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 12:34:05	I find comfort in knowing that there are people far more fucked up than me. I just wish I knew some of them so I would have friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 12:01:06	not going to sleep because I hate ending a day feeling bad...doesn't seem a productive reason to lose sleep, but that is me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 11:59:24	the depressing part is I have good reason to be sad...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 10:43:05	@VexedLes you are welcome. Like on an airplane, take care of yourself first, and only then can you help others. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 10:30:11	@VexedLes you owe nothing to no one. Your suffering is real, and no one can fault you just cause they can't see it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 10:28:24	I think I have mental arthritis.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 07:18:11	Asking for help presupposes someone to ask....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 03:55:08	@EvinceNaturals its bad at any age--unless they have colic!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 03:53:57	Waiting for an email is torturous.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 03:42:56	feeling invisible, which clearly isn't true as my 3 year old has been yelling at me for the last week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 03:22:36	I have become completely and utterly disinterested. sigh...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 03:19:39	Still waiting for the world to say its your day today. Been at least a few years it seems.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-21 01:38:05	Been waiting a week for information I need before making a decision. This is causing serious mental paralysis.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-18 13:00:49	The world keeps taking from me and yet I keep believing. Too bad I am an agnostic...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-17 08:00:59	Having a big talk with the wife. So far I am handling myself well. Not giving her any reason to get defensive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-16 10:30:44	I am really not interested in furthering your struggling career as an author.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-16 10:29:54	Stop telling me I have to care for someone I don't know just because something tragic happened to them. Life is rough.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-16 07:23:53	People retweet the strangest things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-16 07:22:58	Okay, I am going to try showing more enthusiasm for the wife. If she doesn't respond, then I will know for sure I tried.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-15 04:50:58	sigh...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-12 12:10:13	You would think my wife was god considering the blind faith I have in her despite no proof whatsoever that she will change.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-12 05:50:17	"@AnalieseClaire: It's easier to be stick skinny than have a 6 pack." and it is so much better to have the latter. #healthychoices
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-12 05:48:14	I really don't understand myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-08 11:37:14	I would gladly make some enemies for a few friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-08 11:36:49	There are people who love me, and I am not actively unwanted, but yet I am just not wanted.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-08 11:34:04	It is so easy to become isolated as you get older and so hard to make new friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-08 11:32:42	Its a hard fact realizing how few actually care. And niceties do not change realities.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-08 06:24:31	Went to work today. Felt better. Not a good sign that I don't work again until fall semester.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-07 04:46:20	@nejireta_ki I don't blame you.I am not unhappy enough I suppose to leave my kids when I have nothing else. It could get better for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-07 04:06:21	@nejireta_ki good for you. I don't really have friends or family except wife and kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-07 03:49:57	@nejireta_ki yes. Plus I have nowhere to go to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-07 03:47:09	@nejireta_ki sounds like circumstances are worse even than the relationship.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-07 00:58:10	recently tweeted that I gained a lot of followers when rarely tweeting, now having tweeted a lot the last 24 hours, I am losing followers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-07 00:56:54	worst anxiety in a long time. wishing i could take xanax or klonopin. #addiction sucks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-06 21:52:32	@nejireta_ki that doesn't sound good. Any kids? We have three.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-06 11:52:30	@Owl615 why?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-06 11:51:19	tired of being ignored.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-06 11:48:47	I stay trapped in bad situations because I don't trust my own judgment that they are bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-06 09:25:28	@nejireta_ki sorry to hear that. Its easier to leave the shorter the time. Its been so long, its easier to stay for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-06 08:31:12	@nejireta_ki married 17 together 22.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-05 23:15:25	@nejireta_ki its too easy to get used to one another.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-05 23:07:46	Watched Silver Lining Playbook last night. Some realistic scenes, but the director, in interviews, was very patronizing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-05 21:16:25	I hate my wife.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-05-04 20:02:13	The less I tweet, the more followers I get. I am not sure how to interpret that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-04-12 23:10:03	Year long adventure ending. Future uncertain. Possibilities on one timeline, but may need to create other paths. Hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-04-03 08:44:58	Stable and fairly content with minimal side effects from meds. Haven't felt like this in such a long time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-03-22 07:12:30	May get a job with serious responsibility and importance. This could be very good or very bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-03-22 07:11:04	Wonder if doc is really gonna take me off the meds. Wonder how that will go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-03-04 03:37:10	@Owl615 thanks. I like this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-03-02 08:42:13	The path that I have chosen now has led me to a wall, and with each passing day I feel a little more like something dear was lost.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-02-28 11:21:37	I am not good at being not good at something. It just makes me even worse at it. Maybe I am narcissistic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-02-28 11:14:07	@Owl61 hi there! Been kinda laying low. Coming slowly off meds, so having a harder time. This is always a good place for me to vent.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-02-28 11:11:53	Why should I care about the world's problems when it keeps giving me new ones of my own.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-02-28 11:11:12	It doesn't matter if someone's complaints seem or even are petty, they are still important to the one complaining.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-01-22 10:47:49	More bad news. When do I get to have a good year? Am I allowed to give up yet?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2013-01-17 09:18:08	Sigh...that's all I can say.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-28 03:04:23	Depression self propagates. Because of it, I stopped doing my hobbies, which left me feeling more empty.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-15 03:58:17	@MiraTweeta By that logic, we would all go around shooting people because we can. Real reason is the shooter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-12 10:16:32	hypocrisy prevails...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-10 10:09:22	Everybody hates somebody.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-10 09:43:49	quit
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-10 09:12:48	just bitter i think...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-09 08:03:58	@Owl615 yes the next morning
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-09 05:32:18	we are screwed in out back in, through the sides, and so on...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-09 05:31:28	Finally, people who are compassionate don't seem to care about mental illness.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-09 05:30:49	And the nature of the "disease" is such that coping is nearly impossible.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-09 05:30:13	It is something that is no fault of the sufferer, it generally is uncurable, so there is little one can do about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-09 05:29:31	I am not a particularly compassionate person, but mental illness is something no one should have to suffer with.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-09 05:28:02	I don't know that depression is a disease. I think some of us just feel things so much stronger, so much so that coping is hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-09 00:19:06	@Owl615 I agree completely.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-08 23:09:42	Yes other people are suffering, but it is hard enough to take care of myself and my family. I really don't care about your cause.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-08 07:32:59	How dare you judge me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-08 07:21:46	I would rather be hated than unnoticed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-08 07:14:09	I want to go where I can speak honestly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-08 07:12:17	Wanting to move far away from the city.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-07 21:34:40	@SingnPlay how you look on the outside is a reflection of your overall health.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-07 21:34:19	@SingnPlay Yeah, sounds good, but the insides are turning to mush. I am only in my 40s, but I am fit. My friends look halfway in the grave.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-07 13:00:07	more drink, and an ambien.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-07 12:51:25	I know too many people who pretend to be unselfish. I don't even think that is possible. I miss honestly selfish people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-07 12:32:48	Facebook is where you say nice things. Twitter is where you say what you think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-07 12:32:14	Stop preaching to the choir. Take a risk and preach to someone who doesn't agree. Let me know how that goes...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-07 11:32:26	People don't age well and it makes me sad. I try to remember what grandpa said. Its better than the alternative.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-07 10:16:44	Are the things you write what you think or what you want people to think you think?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-07 10:15:46	I really needed this drink. Ahhhh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-07 08:27:22	Why am I supposed to be so kind and compassionate to others considering how I am treated.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-07 08:22:21	People are not really as compassionate as they would have you believe. You too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-05 07:47:19	Honesty is not a virtue nowadays. You are supposed to be supportive not real.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-05 07:46:05	The hypocrisy of PC has become the hypocrisy of caring.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-12-03 08:58:24	even on my better days, i can still hate my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-11-26 09:53:15	My cat is missing. My girl cat. The only girl cat I've ever had. She is barely older than a kitten.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-11-10 08:21:25	The evidence strongly suggests the world is out to get me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-26 03:52:26	Heading down the rabbit hole...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 11:27:54	@DepressedBmore need sleep though. Didn't expect to have this much to say. Thanks for listening.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 11:26:52	@DepressedBmore she doesn't want to. Its frustrating and its been a very very bad year for me mentally and emotionally.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 11:25:30	@DepressedBmore I don't but she basically accuses me of emotionally abusing her. If she is right, then she should leave but
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 11:23:04	@DepressedBmore supposedly I am bipolar but that really isn't bad. I am prolly bpd or npd, if a labelnis necessary.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 11:20:29	@DepressedBmore 3 young kids, wife with more MH issues than me but in denial and blaming me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 11:19:13	@DepressedBmore thanks. But I am in a catch-22 that plays into my weaknesses.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 11:11:27	Life can be a symptom of bigger problems.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 11:10:12	@DepressedBmore me
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 10:51:47	@DepressedBmore no
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 09:54:40	I can't be as awful as she thinks I am.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 09:38:13	Slipping
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-24 09:27:52	Why?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-22 21:15:53	@Victoria_BPP very good!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-13 12:59:37	hypomanic for the 1st time this yr. nice break from the depression, but i'd really like to get some sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-06 11:42:37	Body image is a funny thing. The skinny ones think they are fat and the fat ones think theyre skinny. No one tries just being healthy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-10-06 09:35:43	I never seem to post here anymore when something isn't wrong. But today something isn't wrong. Hi everyone!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-25 10:24:06	Working is good for me because while I am working, I become visible.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-24 23:10:35	Some say Mondays are the worst days, but I think it is the only day when I am not just distracting myself from reality.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-24 23:09:43	I don't even know how to figure out what to do then. Help. Please.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-24 23:08:41	I can find the perserverence to make it through my contract end date in may, but I cannot conceive being able to work after.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-24 23:07:03	I need to.figure out what is next. It is becoming clear that I will never be fully functioning in the usual sense.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-24 11:00:22	I don't think people who die in their sleep really do so peacefully. There is just no easy way out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-24 10:59:49	My cousin's daughter is starting to get hot. I am not surprised I think this, but it still creeps me out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-24 10:58:50	Lonely, bored, and depressed OR lonely, busy, and anxious. CHOOSE your misery.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-24 10:57:45	I am definitely not happy, and certainly not getting better, but I am being productive and not bored.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-24 10:56:23	I feel bad that my children want to be like me. If they only knew.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-24 10:51:38	Wish I could stop my mind from going there. Eh, I wish I could stop it from going anywhere.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-14 05:15:59	Having urges for excitement again. Been calm and focused for awhile. Guess it was a matter or time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-08 23:34:06	I tweet rarely but I do so in bunches.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-08 23:32:41	I am definitely going to be that old crotchety man that no one likes. The only thing left to do is survive to be old.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-08 23:31:48	Why do people.get so boring when they older. Being a homebody is not a prerequisite to being marries with children.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-08 23:26:53	People don't like people.who are different. Those who are different don't like people who are the same.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-08 23:24:59	@PainIntoPeace you are completely right, but that isn't going to happen unfortunately. I just try not to care what they think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-08 23:20:38	A month in to the new job. Anxiety beginning. About the right time. #anxiety #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-02 07:30:47	@Shawnie_0405 thanks. I napped for awhile.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-02 06:15:57	Lamictal in the morning + Drinking in the afternoon = bedtime before dinner.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-09-02 06:13:33	@crazyivabigrack don't worry about it. Ppl are very sensitive about this stuff.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-31 09:54:30	@Haus0fPain eh, I do have black belts in both my styles, but the one in karate means more as I failed like 3 times before I got it. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-31 09:51:54	@Haus0fPain I know you know this, but I always remind myself that it really isn't about the belt but the knowledge you learn.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-31 09:38:05	@Haus0fPain That is really great. It is always such a wonderful feeling every time you achieve a new rank.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-31 09:37:33	@Haus0fPain I've trained Karate & TKD for 5 years also. Not familiar with the ranks, but I know a little about Kenpo and its a great style.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-31 09:20:00	@crazywhisperer meds are doing good. Mania just isn't an issue whereas relationships are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-31 09:16:56	@crazywhisperer went to a bp group a bit and I didn't really relate as much as I thought I would. Have problems they didn't understand.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-31 09:14:44	@crazywhisperer suppose my question is more whether there are meds for bpd and whether it matters if you take bp meds if u r not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-31 09:13:12	@crazywhisperer no. But no real diagnosis. I know enough to know that bipolar is the least of my issues if at all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-31 09:03:57	@Haus0fPain awesome!!! I keep meaning to ask you what style and how long have you trained?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-31 08:55:29	The demons inside are clamoring again to be fed. Shouldn't have read fear and loathing in las Vegas.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-31 08:55:14	Does it matter for my meds if I am not bipolar but instead bpd w depression and addiction issues?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-20 03:28:15	@my_fight_within thanks!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-19 09:54:31	Wife told me I am too skinny. Haven't been able to lift weights due to surgery so I can't stop losing weight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-18 07:25:10	@Owl615 thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-18 06:47:01	I am back to work. Going okay except the first hour or two after my kids all leave for school. I miss being home with them for a bit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-18 06:45:20	@Owl615 what if you had to get up at 6 am every day?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-18 06:26:24	Having to choose btw lite #depression and insomnia. Which would you choose.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-18 06:25:30	I have finally accepted having some minor side effects. Now I have to decide what dosage I want.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-13 18:58:37	@Shawnie_0405 touche!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-13 12:08:25	Look around at how people treat each other and say with a straight face how people are good at heart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 12:57:14	@Aloneranger pretend that I virtually carries you home. And now I must say Goodnight sweet princess. Til next time. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 12:42:26	@Aloneranger I am sure they are very cute signals.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 12:39:04	@Aloneranger if you keep letting her buy you drinks you better put out. Lol. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 12:32:30	@Aloneranger well enjoy urself. Just be sure to get home safe. Otherwise have fun.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 12:29:19	@Aloneranger for me the girl fights are sexier. But what would you expect. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 12:22:57	@Aloneranger some guys yeah. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 12:16:56	@Aloneranger well built mostly naked men wrestling.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 12:10:39	@Aloneranger im just watching the fights.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 12:04:46	@Aloneranger you are.def having a better time at ur barbthan I am at mine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 11:58:17	@Aloneranger oh that is the good kind. Wink.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 11:50:21	@Aloneranger what kind of trouble? There are all sorts of trouble, some better than others.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 11:47:42	@Aloneranger I was so good at that when I was younger. Can't find it anymore. Lol. Its easier for girls. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 11:45:12	@Aloneranger of being upset and not able to change anything. You should spare urself and just get into virtual trouble.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 11:44:11	@Aloneranger thank you. I've just accepted my limitations and therefore meds and their side effects. It sucks but I am tired ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 11:37:42	@Aloneranger things are better. Probably because I had to get a job and its keeping me focused on something besides my self. How r u?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 11:28:23	@Aloneranger a lot better. Long time no tweet. I was happy to see you on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-08-12 11:25:27	@Aloneranger you enjoy yourself. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-30 04:20:38	@jonylogic "bro" lol. I think you are taking this personally.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-29 07:34:08	@InvictaFights was really looking forward to these. InvFC1 was great. But if it doesn't work soon, I'm watching the olympics.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-27 23:00:51	Excessive sensitivity on our part does not help improve the image of MI, which would help reduce the dreaded "stigma."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-27 22:59:45	@jonylogic @oceangirlholly @bipolarvoice yup
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-27 20:23:07	@oceangirlholly @jonylogic @bipolarvoice not what I said. I said murderers often have MI. Stats show prisons are full of the MI.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-27 08:14:11	@jonylogic @oceangirlholly @bipolarvoice I am sorry to hear that. You must have had pretty bad experiences to believe that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-27 08:10:52	@jonylogic @oceangirlholly @bipolarvoice don't be nasty. Truth is not stigma even if its unpleasant. Truth is always a defense to.libel.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-27 08:09:46	@jonylogic @oceangirlholly @bipolarvoice twitter is not a scientific forum. Do you disagree?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-27 08:05:09	@oceangirlholly @bipolarvoice stats are abundant that prisons are filled w the mentally ill.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-27 08:02:49	@bipolarvoice my bad. Eyes not voice. Imo u ignore my point. I only speculate based on your rant of bias.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-27 07:58:28	@bipolarvoice you said you feel safer around a schizophrenic than a psychiatrist. That is not a good state you are in.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-26 22:45:16	@bipolarvoice no u didn't. U r very biased abt this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-26 22:17:12	@bipolarvoice you are choosing to read that backwards. Murderers often have mh issues.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-26 22:14:58	@bipolarvoice cept that mh does kill ppl. Suicide and murder are often done by mh sufferers.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-26 22:12:26	@bipolarvoice is it offensive to say cancer kills people?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-21 05:14:13	Had complications so back in the hospital. Getting better though so hope to get out tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-20 04:46:07	Just finished surgery. Feel great. Ready to get back to the gym. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-17 05:53:42	In the ER for my mother. New life stage.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-15 09:29:12	Mom visiting after beating cancer, but cancer beat her up first. Fuck cancer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-14 08:04:01	I suppose people would like me more if I didn't hate people in general.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-14 05:27:11	#depression and #mania are things I go through. They are not what makes me different and not quite "human."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-14 05:25:14	I am certain that #bipolar is just a minor problem for me. I am not that normal. Not kidding.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-14 05:23:09	Feeling very philosophical and chatty.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-14 05:22:05	Most ppl keep their medical issues private. Why do MH sufferers so often feel the need to let the world know? Privacy would reduce stigma.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-14 05:13:42	You shouldn't always blame yourself, but you shouldn't always blame others either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-14 05:12:55	Something bad is not always caused by something bad. Bad things often just happen.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-14 05:11:38	Only really smart people are smart enough to know they aren't smart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-14 05:10:22	If you say the word smart over and over and over again, it starts to sound really dumb.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-13 05:27:12	@amanda_stand thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-13 05:06:01	i really can't stand it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-13 05:03:17	fml. it is a hernia. the only thing i was happy about was my fitness progress. the gym was the only productive thing i do. fml.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-12 09:50:14	Been doing such a great job getting in great shape. Already had to.deal w a back sprain and now may have a hernia. Ugh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-10 09:12:11	You really shouldn't discuss legal issues on social media when you aren't a lawyer. It shows your ignorance.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-09 01:58:02	I don't mind anymore than people don't seem to like me, but it still sucks the life out of me to find they actively dislike me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-05 23:48:54	@oxymoronic82 You do, so do what you want, no matter whether "they" like it or not!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-05 23:41:45	Decided to take the morning off from the gym to rest up for BJJ class tonight, but I am really jonesing for it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-05 23:22:20	do you ever want to do something you don't want to do because you know it will really annoy someone else?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-05 11:08:28	Briefly was happy I didn't kill myself earlier this year while watching fireworks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-05 10:56:56	@drella66 your welcome. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-05 10:53:55	Winners quit all the time. They quit doing the things that keep them down.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-05 08:42:56	Love me or leave me. You probably wont like who I am but I am not going to change.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-05 08:41:45	I have stopped caring if people don't like me. I have never been able to fix that. Much less stressful this way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-05 01:54:09	I no longer care about a diagnosis or any treatment. Reality has intervened and that has taken my focus.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-05 01:52:43	I no longer care to behave as I am expected. If that is mental illness, so be it. I will be who I am and more content for it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-07-05 01:51:38	The world has moved on from me and I from it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-06-26 22:04:35	Have 6 weeks until life starts up again. Too many mixed emotions for 140.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-06-26 21:57:58	You know that feeling that things are only better because something is distracting you, something you know is going away soon?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-06-19 06:41:20	Got a job without an interview. Have to spend the week away from my fam starting in Aug. Might be a good thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-06-16 00:59:58	I don't like having a cop at my house, even if we called it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-06-05 02:02:00	I've done a realistic assessment of my life. I have actually accomplished a lot. But I have no friends, which is all I ever wanted.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-06-05 01:45:58	trying to get a teaching job for the fall, pulled up old teaching evaluations, mostly good, but some really rough comments. sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-26 05:42:17	@missemjtaylor so so. And u?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-22 02:35:19	@SaltySmile ty :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-22 01:23:41	@SaltySmile I am sure it would help in healthy eating. I try to "splurge" on foods and vitamins that are good for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-22 01:15:52	Who slapped the "hit me" sign on my back?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-22 01:15:36	@SaltySmile spend extra money of your own, and then pay for meds on your own. does having $50 extra make the juicer affordable?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-20 00:51:10	I don't want to talk because I just don't want to argue.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-19 23:35:06	Doing the right thing has allowed me to be taken advantage of. I need to rethink things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-19 13:22:06	a constant repetitive bass can bring out violent tendencies.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-19 13:05:17	I am so sick and tired of being the one tread upon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-19 13:04:35	Its probably good that I don't have a gun.Latest reason. I would use it on someone else tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-19 06:14:02	@Polarbear3127 That is a relative question.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-19 05:46:25	No one is going to take care of me if I don't let them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-19 05:44:38	I have come to the realization that things could get worse, and I will end up homeless if I do anything stupid.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-19 05:43:42	The problem with weekends is that I have even less structure than my quite unstructured week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-19 00:54:33	@Polarbear3127 Below my level is a very saddening thought too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-19 00:54:13	@Polarbear3127 I am looking for work, but I'm at a loss really for what to do. Either the same and likely fail, or something below my level.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-19 00:49:13	@Polarbear3127 I left my last job because of it. Was having anxiety attacks at work nearly every day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-18 04:02:23	I am an outcast e en in a crowd of outcasts.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-18 00:19:05	Feeling as pathetic and alone as can be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-17 23:46:03	It so brightens my day when someone looks disgusted when I pass them by.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-17 21:36:00	Its the little things that remind me I am a doormat.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-17 01:06:04	Not sure about its accuracy, but took an online personality disorder test and scored high or very high for all 10. Oh boy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-17 00:53:19	I am not a waste of space. The world is not that overpopulated. Even if I was, I couldn't care less.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-16 21:48:54	I gave up, which turned out to be good. It released a lot of anxiety. My family can just take care of me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-16 05:31:13	@sparklypixie72 not really but thank you for the concern.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-16 04:44:10	I am sorry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-16 03:44:14	I know I don't deserve anything from the world, but I think ill accept if it just ignored me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-14 07:58:37	very very frustrated. wanting to accomplish something and keep finding closed paths.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-13 07:05:51	Very nearly drank myself to death last night partying . Prolly a good thing I didn't think of that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 06:28:26	i hate upscale bars, and i may have to go to one and meet new people, and spend money i don't have. nightmare.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:39:56	@ellaboheme I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes good days can come few and far between.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:23:57	@ellaboheme fist bump of gloom. Love it. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:17:17	@Owl615 I actually listen when people do tell me. And I even ask. Most people are too nice to say.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:16:06	@ellaboheme yes, exactly. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:13:14	@Polarbear3127 I am with you there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:12:57	Its hard to make new friends, when I don't understand why people don't want to be friends with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:11:06	very deflating
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:09:25	I can't fix what I've done, but I suppose one day I can forgive myself for doing it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:08:26	@s0ftskelet0ns you shouldn't have to apologize.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:07:58	Life isn't as forgiving as an inspirational quote would suggest.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:02:16	@_chasingdragons it makes me sad every time I see you write something like this. *hugs*
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 05:00:20	I am feeling a little jealous right now at all those people who have euphoria as one of their symptoms of #mania .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 04:59:01	I wish I was more deluded. Could use some of that grandiose thinking right about now. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 04:57:52	When I am rational, it amazes me how much I have fucked everything up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 04:54:08	I am not often rational when I am #depressed or #manic , but at least with the former, I usually know when I am not being rational. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-12 02:19:53	trying to focus on calming my mind. my thoughts are so fast (and pointless) that it seems like I'm possessed. #mania
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 13:28:53	@essally more like a simmering volcano, doesn't go away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 12:57:00	@Owl615 thanks, i think. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 12:50:07	@Owl615 when i was younger, i was always trying to plan the perfect murder.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 12:49:21	@Owl615 maybe your suspicions that i am bpd are correct.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 12:38:16	@Aloneranger I had a feeling you were gonna say that right after I tweeted.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 12:36:44	@Aloneranger you are sleeping with a band? including the drummer? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 12:36:05	my mind is so clouded by anger.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 12:35:39	right now, i understand those people who murder all sorts of random people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 10:51:18	Too angry and impatient for no good reason.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 10:48:21	I wish I had the guts to do something crazy stupid. I have become so spineless.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 10:04:04	Compassion for the depressed, just not for the truly manic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 08:58:13	@Aloneranger maybe. the lamictal is a floor but not a ceiling. i am gonna go self medicate now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 08:53:50	@Aloneranger pretty much. i am not particularly rational right now. thoughts are disjointed in a way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 08:47:33	@Owl615 thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 08:47:23	@essally I have seen the first few. right now, I want to hurt someone with my own hands, maybe later I'll get that bad. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 08:46:11	@Aloneranger yeah. i am especially concerned and hiding as I am wanting to hurt someone else. bad place to be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 08:35:43	wow am i in a dark place
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 08:18:13	@Owl615 no meds have worked well since then.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 08:14:58	lithium used to be a wonder drug for me, then my pdoc thought we might try an ADHD med. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 08:12:11	@Owl615 that wouldn't upset me. i am visualizing breaking random ppl.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 08:11:24	@essally I am waiting for the dreams to start.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 08:05:12	I know my kids would miss me if I was gone. Still its nice to think about.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 07:55:05	my 2yo is going "play, play, play" and I am thinking "drink, drink, drink"
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 07:52:04	"I'm just hanging on while this whole world keeps spinning, and its good to know its outta my control..."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 07:46:55	At least I can control my behavior. Don't want to do anything stupid around or to my kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 07:43:23	I am having violent fantasies again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 07:40:08	Everyone can see that there is something wrong with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 07:37:42	There is something wrong with me. I am not okay.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 07:08:08	Injured again. Very bad for my mood.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 06:39:11	Kansas Carry on my Wayward son: http:// youtu.be/pw6_VXPwm6U via @youtube
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 06:37:30	@IAmReadyWorld that was your drink of choice? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 06:30:25	@Drinking_Coffee going to be would be something to do. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 06:29:32	@IAmReadyWorld i am gonna be doing that tomorrow, may have to be carried home.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 06:28:37	Cannot stand being full of energy and wanting to do something to help myself but knowing patience is more important. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-11 06:27:27	@IAmReadyWorld take the dam things. if its a psych drug, either be on them or off them, but not both.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-10 10:13:38	do you rise or fall in time of real crisis?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-09 06:33:53	@IAmReadyWorld in the US, a LOT of social workers are recovering from something, many of them hardcore addicts who must have a crim record.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-09 06:29:28	my frustration grows and grows. it is very difficult to want to accomplish something but cannot do anything more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-08 02:24:13	What if I truly am not passionate about anything?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:41:23	@punkoj I may have those. Not even sure what identity issues are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:23:53	@punkoj this is getting pretty deep for 140 chars. :-) I agree to the extent that parts of our childhood always stick.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:22:06	@Miss_Gibson91 I keep telling people I am always right. They don't believe me. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:18:38	@punkoj yeah but "who you are" is such a deep philosophical question. I believe you engineer who you are at any one moment.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:16:48	@Miss_Gibson91 cause you love us all so much! :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:15:04	@punkoj its worse because I used to be the type that made sure I was always noticed. Sigh is right.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:13:38	@Miss_Gibson91 I don't really care much about them anymore. If they don't call we don't talk.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:12:39	@Miss_Gibson91 not as much anymore. The anger ate me up so I had to forgive them for my own sanity. I never forget. And ....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:10:12	@Miss_Gibson91 my parents would say that but they never take responsibility for anything they do while always expecting me to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:09:05	@Miss_Gibson91 I would say to consider how well the source knows all the facts. People offer lots of advice without knowledge.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:06:38	@Miss_Gibson91 you shouldn't have to. Its a parents responsibility to accept and love their kids not the other way around.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 11:02:24	@Miss_Gibson91 a spouse doesn't define you like a parent does. I have separate issues with both parents.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 10:59:52	@FindStability superpower anger. I get that. Its what sets us apart for better or worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 10:58:40	@Miss_Gibson91 oh wow. I am so sorry. My wife tends to ignore me at times but that doesn't really compare.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 10:56:23	@Miss_Gibson91 ok. For me I think I always preferred hated. At least people cared enough to feel something about me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 10:54:01	@punkoj I think I prolly agree for similar reasons. Feel very invisible lately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 10:49:54	@hareofthefog hadn't thought of that? I suppose if someone hates you they would at least be acknowledging your existence.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 10:47:49	Which is worse, being hated or being ignored?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 10:42:04	Poll: what should I bitch about next? Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 10:36:04	I keep noticing how others keep tweeting what I want to say before I do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 10:33:44	@Miss_Gibson91 only a fool would take umbrage with your honesty and openness with your emotions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 10:14:10	@Miss_Gibson91 "mania" for me is mostly that feeling. I have several punching bags at home. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 09:31:23	@owallflower thank you. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 08:58:24	@thelilradish im a bit the opposite. Always wanted lots of friends. Don't mind being hurt. Ppl just don't like me much.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 08:53:30	@SmileyPeanuts thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 08:50:55	@SmileyPeanuts assume I mean the best and tell me when my actions don't live up to it. My self awareness is pretty poor.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 08:42:38	@SmileyPeanuts of course. But apparently I am not a very good one. Don't mean to. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 08:41:45	Alcohol and lamictal really don't mix well in me, but why should I care. Drink up gus
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 08:37:30	I always felt different than others. Now I find I feel different from other bipolar. There seems no end to what is wrong with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 08:36:01	I never had many friends so I guess its not surprising that I am not terribly upset to have none.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-06 02:15:48	Spent 2 hours updating my resume and applying for jobs. Didn't get anxious which is a good sign.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-05 06:36:37	I can envision things far worse than bankruptcy and welfare. Thankful for what I have left in a way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-05 06:34:20	Things can always be worse. Really. When life forces things upon you, you realize recovery time is a luxury. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-04 10:38:12	@Owl615 lol. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-04 07:21:46	@Owl615 not wrong at all. I have no idea what you are talking about so you might as well be talking chinese.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-04 07:17:28	@Owl615 then it doesn't do much that you keep mentioning dbt to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-04 07:16:25	@Owl615 sure. But until then you need to put them aside.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-04 07:15:38	@Owl615 it sounds like you are under the impression I am in dbt or are bpd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-04 07:14:07	@Owl615 life doesn't always allow processing time. That is the point of the expression.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-04 06:34:28	@Owl615 that is a generalization. it always depends on context. being overly sensitive does not help oneself cope in society.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-04 06:13:49	@Miss_Gibson91 you would've just gotten sick and been in the hospital, first physical and then mental. you can choose to go back to MH hosp.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-04 06:12:44	@Owl615 it is an expression that adequately explains what I have no choice about. "1 per cent people" is wrong and judgmental.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-04 05:36:34	its official, wife got laid off. since she gets unemployment, me and my mentally unhealthy brain need to "suck it up" and get a job. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-04 05:12:38	Ready or not, I have to find a job, any job, and very quick. @#$%
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-02 00:10:09	@swanners272 me too. I stay home with kids and she works.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 21:49:41	@swanners272 maybe. but I know my wife pretty well, and I have had good reason to believe this for the last 5+ years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 21:48:59	@Shawnie_0405 she has crossed boundaries for years. if I wasn't self-loathing it would have been over awhile ago.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 21:48:18	@Shawnie_0405 I suppose thinking out loud since I haven't given much detail to get useful input. Nothing done.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:46:42	@nejireta_ki ah, yes, indecision. :) Me, I can't even be right by chance. its like i choose, so the universe says lets do the opposite.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:44:42	@hareofthefog its best rare and with fried eggs on top. you cut into the egg and let the yolk run all over the steak. yum.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:40:40	@hareofthefog yes, different time zones, but steak and eggs is very popular in the states.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:39:51	maybe she would miss me, but sooner, and not much later, she'd be happier.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:37:31	@hareofthefog steak and eggs, one of my favorite ways to eat steak!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:25:20	@hareofthefog thanks. right now its hungry. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:22:37	@Dear_Ace good reason) that no one else will stay with me. This isn't to say she stands by me though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:21:25	@Dear_Ace are a little better. Yet, I know she doesn't make me happy. I stay for financial reasons and because I suspect (with ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:19:43	@Dear_Ace That sounds very reasonable. I've known for years that she makes me feel bad about myself. Through a LOT of effort, things...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:15:08	@Dear_Ace any advice?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:13:18	After 4 months home, I finally found a routine I could live with. Now, everything is changing. sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:12:18	of course, my doctorate is in math, so I suppose I should know that. lol. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:11:36	I'm truly very perceptive and insightful when it comes to decisions others should make. When it comes to me I'm 95% wrong. What're the odds?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 11:10:11	I've become incapable of making decisions, and now I don't have a choice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 10:54:24	@SmileyPeanuts right to sell everything and go our own ways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 10:54:06	@SmileyPeanuts i've been unhappy for years. she is about to lose another job (and she is the "sane" one) and we'll be broke. time seems ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 10:42:58	I wonder if maybe this is a good time to end my marriage.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 10:16:48	@Owl615 I know this stuff. The key is being able to tell when you are in "wise mind", which I am usually wrong about. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 08:55:15	@Owl615 Very
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 08:55:01	@MissMedicated you are a better person than me, I would've run off and gotten a new one. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 08:51:31	@Miss_Gibson91 I would suspect that it just becomes less of a priority. Either that or you make an effort to improve it and then be happy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 08:48:10	Ready or not the world is in my driveway and about to knock on my door. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-05-01 08:45:07	@MissMedicated hold out for a payment once a month. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-30 09:36:26	@tiggy_87 would love it. But she doesn't know about this account. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-30 09:31:18	@_chasingdragons what happens with your episodes, if its okay that I ask?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-30 09:22:11	@DreamSmileLive it's worse knowing and knowing there isn't anything you can do about it. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-30 09:20:57	@_chasingdragons I don't know about you but I feel more peaceful at night sometimes. The sun can be oppressive and rain is sad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-30 09:19:50	@tiggy_87 yup. She doesn't listen to me. Need to get someone else to tell her. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-30 09:14:04	@_chasingdragons sleep is overrated. :-) seriously though hope you feel better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-30 09:12:37	@tiggy_87 she gets the #depression but not the anger and irritability that goes with the #hypomania . :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-30 09:10:50	@Owl615 there was no way to tell it was there.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-30 08:35:50	@Owl615 at the park with my son.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-30 08:12:48	Wife getting sick of me being (mentally) sick. But I don't care cause I am gonna take care of me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-29 21:31:14	My foot was swarmed by fire ants yesterday. Swollen painful and very itchy today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-28 23:48:47	not sure I want to go to my son's birthday party. #anxiety
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-28 23:48:24	barely drank last night but was drunk and sick later. dam meds.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-28 15:42:49	@FishArmy lol. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-28 08:16:32	Meds may be stabilizing, mood may be improving. May be ready to try to improve my situation. Just hope wife doesn't lose her job first.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-28 08:15:40	@Miss_Gibson91 you tweet more than 100/hr or 1000/day? wow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-28 08:06:59	That cousin is now complaining about studying for her licensing exam and how it is taking away from her party time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-27 21:29:48	@Aloneranger thanks. Got the decrease. Now cross fingers that this works better. :-) good "luck" to you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-27 20:57:46	Good morning. At pdoc. Am so sensitive to meds. May need to decrease as 100 mg lam is making me quite anxious.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-27 09:55:33	@hareofthefog I didn't think she was like that. Goes to show that they only understand MH from a book.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-27 09:52:56	Beauty is personality, and sexy is attitude.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-27 09:51:55	muscle is the new skinny.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-27 09:46:23	I have a cousin who is a psychologist, but throws around MH terms very casually on FB. Wonder what our tdocs say about us to their friends.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-27 09:30:10	A donut and a coffee cup are homotopic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-27 07:25:48	@Miss_Gibson91 its very common for adults to change tdocs until they find one they are comfortable with.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-27 07:25:03	@Miss_Gibson91 can you switch psychologists? If you aren't happy with yours it wont help and is a waste of time and money.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 09:15:40	skipped meds on purpose today to see if the #anxiety would noticeably decrease. Yes it did. This will make my pdoc appt fri interesting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 09:13:15	@Miss_Gibson91 I did that after something happened. Wouldn't blame you, but you are more open about this than I am. Good luck. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 08:23:29	@Miss_Gibson91 @drinking_coffee @djsooz1 actually, only male scots come to america, don't know how you girls sound.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 08:21:23	@Miss_Gibson91 @Drinking_Coffee @djsooz1 did I miss any stereotypes? lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 08:20:49	@Miss_Gibson91 @Drinking_Coffee @djsooz1 that just means its cold, and funny sounding ppl are playing golf somewhere. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 07:31:53	@Miss_Gibson91 I watch netflix. Does that count?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 07:26:36	@Drinking_Coffee @Miss_Gibson91 better than lions tigers and bears.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 07:26:09	@Miss_Gibson91 you do stuff during the day? Good for you! :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 06:59:30	@Drinking_Coffee @Miss_Gibson91 you are an international tweetmaster. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 06:57:54	@Miss_Gibson91 sleeping at night is overrated. I much prefer to sleep through the day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 06:56:58	@Dear_Ace yeah. I come on here to chat a little and vent a lot. Its hard to ignore some things but it is what it is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 06:55:42	@Miss_Gibson91 it can't be THAT late where u r.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 06:40:41	@Dear_Ace once is more than enough. Im sorry its been rough here for u. I been just ignoring some posts.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 06:37:54	@Drinking_Coffee you sound like my wife. Cept she sometimes rails against it nonetheless. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 06:20:41	@Dear_Ace I sympathize. I have backed away from here myself. Too many disagreements.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-26 03:46:10	@BipolarBimbo I used to break it off if it took more than a week. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-25 07:26:50	@Drinking_Coffee thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-25 07:26:41	@Slumballina we are both a wreck then. oh well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-25 05:48:40	The #anxiety never seems to go away anymore, and I have run out of distractions. I've had enough.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-25 04:14:14	Despite being off them for 5 months, I'm pretty sure I'm still in withdrawal from the Xanax and Klonopin. And I didn't even take much. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-24 01:36:08	Often I just tweet what is in my head, and cannot be understood by just being read. Out of context in a way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-24 01:34:45	@sam_stone152 i figured out that is what you meant. they are important to me, i didn't mean it the way it came out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-24 01:33:49	@BipolarSanity to be more clear, I need/want people who I can go off and feed my demons with.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-24 01:30:24	@sam_stone152 why? it wasn't a comment about anyone but myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-24 01:00:10	I want to make friends with other #bipolar sufferers, but I think I would prefer if they were not in recovery.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-24 00:46:24	Mondays make me cry inside.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 20:57:22	@FishArmy lol. Sounds like me 20 years ago.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 20:53:04	@FishArmy thanks. I think. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 20:52:34	@FishArmy there or Colorado. Love to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 08:11:18	I want to see everything as far as you can see.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 07:53:35	@Miss_Gibson91 I'll follow wherever you go, the bigger the surprise the better! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 07:44:39	@Miss_Gibson91 guess we need to find some sort of compromise in our lives. easier said than done, my brain has been storming for a year. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 07:40:44	@Miss_Gibson91 I keep hearing this is mania and not good. But it isn't better like this. I would suspect you are similar.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 07:38:49	I think I neglect myself trying to hard to behave how society thinks I should. I was happier when I was just myself. #narcissist
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 07:36:06	At the start of each new week I think I don't know how long I can do this. But I do it. Not much longer. Something has to change.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 07:27:58	@Miss_Gibson91 they can help and are necessary for some ppl but they should never be a crutch.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 07:26:41	@Miss_Gibson91 very well written btw
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 07:25:08	@Miss_Gibson91 of course its you not the meds. Mental illness os.not like physical where I just take a pill.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 07:16:47	You work so hard to survive the week. Your reward? Another week. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 01:17:11	@thethirdsunrise Isn't love supposed to be about the inner person? Isn't a woman of 26 old enough to make her own decisions?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-23 01:12:28	Wonder if they would notice if I ran off to Europe somewhere for a few weeks. Such a nice thought.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-22 21:41:46	Life is like a box of chinese water torture. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-22 06:41:58	@Miss_Gibson91 once you get your emotions under control you'll be able to meet people who respect you for what you've become.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-22 06:34:24	@Miss_Gibson91 you will find friends and make your own family that will as well. It gets easier as you get older and your peers mature. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-22 06:27:20	@Miss_Gibson91 I understand how you feel. I am sure you know we all like you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-22 00:32:23	@Polarbear3127 knowing better now actually makes me feel worse it seems.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-22 00:10:37	@Polarbear3127 miles in 7 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-22 00:10:24	@Polarbear3127 we've been in one place for 7 years, but moved probably a dozen times in the 15 years before that incl 5 moves of 1000 ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-22 00:08:50	@FishArmy lol. yeah. me too. wife is a little resistant this time. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-21 22:16:25	@_chasingdragons bruising
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-21 22:09:09	I want to move, just to have a big dramatic change in my life. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-21 22:05:17	Its not like my life isn't bad enough. Woke with a headache and then fought with the wife. #fml
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-21 10:24:54	@Miss_Gibson91 thx not tuxedo
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-21 10:24:10	@Miss_Gibson91 I think that is what I recall hearing. Tuxedo.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-21 04:35:37	@Miss_Gibson91 please do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-21 04:34:29	@Miss_Gibson91 heard of it. I think there was a big convo abt it here a month ago.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-21 04:28:23	On a positive note, I spent about 8 hours in the gym and the dojo this week, and I made it without hurting myself. Only a little sore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-21 04:26:35	There is hope in a friday that the other six days don't seem to live up to. #depression #anxiety #addiction #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-21 01:47:24	@BipolarPosts thank you. These things can be bad or can be an opportunity. We will see.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-21 00:40:01	My wife's boss was just fired. We are up bleep creek if she gets let go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 21:50:12	another day. there seems to be a pattern.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 21:49:26	@jonylogic @oceangirlholly @Dear_Ace @Tessa0274 Thanks!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 21:49:11	@Owl615 didn't even find it sad, although it did make me sleepy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 06:20:34	@Drinking_Coffee I was just thinking it was good that I actually cared enough to want more. Not sure about clarity. lol :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 06:15:36	Is it a good sign that I am not satisfied lying in bed being miserable? #depression #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 04:21:31	@Polarbear3127 can't be much more than where I am at. Really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 04:11:44	@ItsJackOk I think id be safe just somewhere different. I need a kickstart.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 04:10:53	@FishArmy I was taking that a year ago. Stopped and I've been a wreck ever since.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 03:29:44	I want to run away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 02:32:02	But I think I may have to go back on xanax for the really bad days.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 02:31:30	I rode out the klonopin withdrawal, but wasn't expecting the major depressive episode. I suppose I just need to ride this out too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 00:39:37	How do people do it? Why do they do it? Why?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-20 00:31:13	@CarrieQ30 must've missed that. Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 22:44:32	@pinguinokx np. Appreciate you tried.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 22:40:51	@angelsnest777 well that really sucks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 22:30:27	@FishArmy thanks. It is appreciated. I just may sometime.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 22:29:50	@pinguinokx no option to change on the web. Other programs wont upload it. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 21:58:57	Anyone know why twitter isn't allowing me to change my profile pic?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 21:21:08	@Owl615 someone I don't follow and doesn't follow me. don't get it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 10:04:49	Someone should make a website where you could check your karma account. I could use better payment terms.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 10:03:31	Everyone used to say I had no self esteem but they were wrong. Now no one says it but they would be right if they did.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 10:02:17	I am so judgmental in my head then realize what a jerk I am being. Oh the irony.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 09:57:27	@nejireta_ki that is great. Enjoy it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 06:55:01	@_chasingdragons here here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 06:54:40	I feel nauseous and sick. It may just be a def mech to keep me from acting out violently.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 06:51:33	@_chasingdragons me too. I never cry though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-19 03:47:42	There are some mean people on here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 08:40:45	@cutterstorment of course it isn't and their saying that I would think makes it worse. It would go a long way if theyd try to understand.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 08:39:20	This is not a positive feed. This is where I try to store as much negativity as possible so I don't do it to my family.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 08:37:29	Sometimes I want to tell each and every person in the world individually to go to hell.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 07:45:37	Invited friends over sat. Relieved they are coming so I wont feel bad that they refused.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 07:31:25	@Drinking_Coffee g'nite
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 07:28:33	@cornerworker is there really? Didn't know that? For android? What is it called?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 07:27:06	Im not an optimist nor a pessimist. I am a realist and I have a good sense of where I have put myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 07:25:13	@Drinking_Coffee of course not. But you've barely started your adult life. 25-40 are in many ways defining years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 07:20:16	@Drinking_Coffee this is gonna sound bad, but don't mean it to be. You are young. There is so much more to hope for then.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 07:14:56	I don't even WANT to enjoy myself because I know how fleeting it will be and then I will feel even worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 07:09:05	Being #bipolar is starting to seem pretty mild compared to how I feel.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 07:07:38	In the last 6 months, I've had several "not bad"days, but I haven't had an actual good day since my birthday weekend in October.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 07:06:19	Not sure of this is a bad day, an awful day, or a hellish day. I vote for the middle.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 06:56:03	Kids and wife ignore me. Is there really any reason for me to be here?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 06:13:25	Being a troubled youth can be fixed. Hope for the future. Other things cannot be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 06:09:01	A threadbare alibi a lifetime full of promise
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 06:05:45	@Miss_Gibson91 @Drinking_Coffee at least they are good pics.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 05:14:22	@oceangirlholly thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 05:14:15	@Polarbear3127 thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 04:46:58	I would go back on the xanax, addiction aside, but im afraid it wont even help.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 04:39:37	@Drinking_Coffee the reality of my life is beyond overwhelming so I lie to myself to keep going.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 04:37:19	There is no way out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-18 04:28:08	When I accept that this is me is when I want to die. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-17 19:22:17	@oceangirlholly things went my way usually without effort. Now they usually don't even with. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-17 10:42:26	Things used to go my way and I got used to that. Now they never do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-17 03:49:33	@oceangirlholly yeah that is about what happened. I think its more than bp for me. I have addictive tendencies.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-17 01:34:59	@mizzledrizzle yup. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-17 01:34:28	@rescuedMango thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-17 00:26:49	Depressed this morning, now spending money I probably shouldn't. Normal day I suppose. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-17 00:22:21	2 hrs @gym. weights, swim, hottub, sauna. very nice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 21:15:25	@FishArmy done yoga doesn't have the same effect on me. I find it challenging but boring.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 20:57:03	@FishArmy I exercise 2 hours a day. It doesn't carry over much to the rest of the day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 20:43:30	dread. hard breathing. i may be like this the rest of my life. no. #depression #anxiety #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 19:34:22	@nejireta_ki you said, so true.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 19:34:08	@oceangirlholly ph.d a year ago.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 19:34:00	@oceangirlholly that is exactly it, I knew it would happen too. doesn't make it any easier. i'm still going through it from finishing my ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 11:18:58	@Dear_Ace thanks so much. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 11:18:19	@Dear_Ace not enough excitement in anything. I feel like I've tried it all. Maybe ill try my guitar again. It used to be very soothing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 11:11:59	@BipolarSanity @Dear_Ace wow. I meant a little not outlet. Don't know where autocorrect got that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 11:10:58	@Dear_Ace I still want to do more than exist. But this may be the worst I've ever been. I suppose im a outlet better. I want to try now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 11:02:25	@Dear_Ace I like talking w u cause ur honest. It is more helpful to me than empty affirmations.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 11:00:01	I still can't decide if its harder to fight through #anxiety or #depression . Good thing I always have one or the other.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 10:58:46	@Dear_Ace I am very low on strength for it. Running out of effective distractions.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 10:48:51	I know its not rational but I feel extremely vulnerable and alone right now. The dread has returned. #bipolar #depression #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 10:36:25	Goodnight noises everywhere.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 10:35:17	@drella66 thanks. g'night!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 08:50:19	@Miss_Gibson91 its a goal to work towards and motivate you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 08:49:06	@Owl615 I am kinda compulsive about the gym. If it wasn't for the addictive part, I probably wouldn't go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 08:47:59	I've been focused on healing my back and taking my belt test. Now it's done, and it will also leave a void.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 08:42:56	I have hundreds of episodes of other shows to watch, but I am really going to miss Farscape once I finish it (again) this week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-16 01:04:57	@drella66 went well. My back held us so all.is good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 23:14:47	@Shawnie_0405 I can't exercise more than twice a day, and I get a little sick of tv. boring life. :( lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 22:09:13	My only interests right now seem to be exercise, science fiction tv, and twitter. sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 21:06:19	@PoopyPeanuts imo u shouldn't be. its a part of life and relationships, and the meds we take have a significant effect of it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 20:36:42	without my studies this past year, my life has been so empty an boring. can't seem to find a replacement.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 20:29:12	@Owl615 that might be amusing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 20:13:40	@Miss_Gibson91 me too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 20:13:15	Back is fine after the long workout yesterday. Rest of me is sore. Doc cleared me to go back to lifting this week. Hope I'm not too sore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 08:17:51	@BipolarBimbo him now or as a kid?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 08:15:58	I have substantially more of a social life on twitter. I don't mind. Everyone is much nicer here than other ppl I know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 08:14:26	@Slumballina I understand. After awhile you take each other for granted.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 08:12:59	@FishArmy yeah pretty common
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 08:11:17	@pinguinokx thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 07:02:12	@FishArmy nav we had headgear. Cut my leg up, all bloody, from my board break though. My hand got cut up in a punching drill also.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 07:00:52	@Slumballina im sorry for u, my wife and I have similar issues.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 06:16:21	@Drinking_Coffee lol. True
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 06:12:09	@Drinking_Coffee oh yeah. I feel pretty good for once. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 06:07:44	@Slumballina I take it you split recently?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 06:04:58	Corona w lime and UFC fights.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 05:59:56	@Slumballina yes bit things were going downhill for years but I was a workaholic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 05:53:18	@Slumballina school was keeping me together.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 05:52:45	@Slumballina sometimes I like to fight. Get tired of it at times. Love to wrestle though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 05:34:30	@Slumballina the black belt and my phd
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 05:33:41	@Slumballina when my kids get a little older I want to take more self defense styles like must Thai, boxing and ju jitsu(again)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 05:27:37	Even though I've achieved my 2 major goals in life this last year, it still has been the worst year in maybe 20 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 05:16:00	@Slumballina tkd. I have the equiv of a tkd black belt in american karate already.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 04:18:12	@Fallingstar_x thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 04:17:51	@BipolarPosts thank you!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 04:17:37	@jonylogic not sure about that. The test wasn't that hard. But thanks for the vote of confidence.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 04:08:03	@jonylogic very. It was nearly an 8 hour testing
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 04:07:23	Hot shower then an ice cold beer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 04:05:58	@jonylogic they called me first for the board break, out or prior order. I was so surprised that I was shaking. Still made them at least.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 04:02:35	@jonylogic no my son wouldn't behave well enough on his own so i told him he had to stay home.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 04:00:16	@oceangirlholly thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:48:47	Is it too early to start drinking in celebration. Of course my meds inflate the effects. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:47:49	@jonylogic I did. Got the belt, w my name it it, already as well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:46:09	@_chasingdragons thank you so much!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:45:33	@jonylogic I was one of the better testers in most categories imo. I may have forgotten a kick in my form but it was solid otherwise.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:44:23	Thanks for all the well wishes. Easily passed my black belt test.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:43:52	@jonylogic thanks. I am/ was.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:43:36	@pinguinokx thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:43:28	@tiggy_87 thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:43:16	@FishArmy my leg is a bit bloody. Does that count? Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:42:46	@Owl615 thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:42:36	@sam_stone152 I did. Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:42:22	@stevetuck8 thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-15 03:42:03	@Slumballina thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 19:03:53	@jonylogic I leave in a few minutes. I am nervous but very confident. With the ceremonies, it'll be about 9 hours. I will keep you posted.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 19:02:14	Almost time to leave for my Black Belt test. I can do well everything they require, so I expect to pass. Wish me luck anyways! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 08:29:24	@Dear_Ace have one for me, I can't drink tonight but really want to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 08:21:35	@Dear_Ace oh. I suppose your not supposed to drink on the job? shucks, and you liked that job. j/k
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 08:13:01	@Miss_Gibson91 @Drinking_Coffee gives new meaning to "bite me".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 08:12:21	@Drinking_Coffee @Miss_Gibson91 that would explain a lot.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 08:10:27	@Miss_Gibson91 oh good, the way you describe your parents sometimes, I wasn't sure. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 08:09:06	@Miss_Gibson91 you are kidding right?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 08:08:15	@Dear_Ace the question should be how much effort will it take to get the booze and is that worth it? lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 08:07:36	@Miss_Gibson91 you dwell in the cell(ar)?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 08:05:49	Ate too much today. Need to go to sleep early tonight. I rarely take them, but its an ambien night for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 08:00:51	@Dear_Ace is that really the question? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 07:32:30	@FishArmy I also forgot a comma. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 07:26:44	@FishArmy not a complete sentence with the abbreviations.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 06:45:57	@CarrieQ30 goodnight
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 06:42:17	My 7yo can't stop goofing around at TKD but he is really cute doing that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 06:36:36	@CarrieQ30 @Miss_Gibson91 Q knocked me out cold the 2 days I took it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 06:36:04	@Miss_Gibson91 @CarrieQ30 ur lucky. I had a gf on it. She changed, it was awful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 06:34:10	@Miss_Gibson91 @CarrieQ30 depakote is bad news. Side effects are awful. Massive wt gains and it makes u a zombie.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 06:28:20	@fogartyelaine adieu adieu to yuh and yuh and yuh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-14 05:30:10	"little things I should have said and done"
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 21:37:15	@BipolarBlogger @Miss_Gibson91 Not a problem. My wife says I "discuss" very intensely, so I'll take some of the "blame" as well. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 20:46:20	@BipolarBlogger @Miss_Gibson91 I apologize if I sounded judgmental. Who am I to judge others.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 20:44:46	@BipolarBlogger @Miss_Gibson91 I don't want to be as sick as the people I have been around. I don't want to be bipolar or in the MH system.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 20:03:09	@BipolarBlogger @Miss_Gibson91 I don't believe that I challenged your experiences. I just thought we were having a discussion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:52:05	@BipolarBlogger @Miss_Gibson91 I don't mean to invalidate ur exp. I just think the opposite is more common than u realize.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:45:38	@BipolarBlogger @Miss_Gibson91 until recently, i've been highly functioning for nearly 20 years, albeit a difficult person at times.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:45:05	@BipolarBlogger @Miss_Gibson91 ok, I was referring in part to those. I was in both when I was younger.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:43:28	@Miss_Gibson91 @bipolarblogger its often used, but not always, as a transition from a hospital to independent living. Thus, its "halfway".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:39:45	@Miss_Gibson91 @bipolarblogger its an assisted living facility for MH patients.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:39:13	As big as twitter is, you would think they would have a much better web client. FB can't stop changing, but twitter is always the same.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:38:12	@BipolarBlogger @Miss_Gibson91 have you ever been hospitalized long term or been in a halfway house?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:37:31	@BipolarBlogger @Miss_Gibson91 I am not sure that is a common experience, but I only have anecdotal evidence.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:33:34	@Miss_Gibson91 @BipolarBlogger takes the patient's considerations in mind, ie, if side effects interfere with life, like severe weight gain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:32:35	@Miss_Gibson91 @BipolarBlogger become like little kids. and the MH profs treat patients that way. it is often hard to find a dr that ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:31:57	@Miss_Gibson91 @BipolarBlogger they accept themselves as the MH profs diagnose them and they never function well without them. they ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:31:22	@Miss_Gibson91 @BipolarBlogger through several hospitalizations I've seen ppl effectively crippled by "buying into" the system...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:29:28	@BipolarBlogger if that works, a bp 2 diagnosis often follows. bp 1 is often easier to diagnose. its hard 2 have a serious discussion in 140
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:28:16	@BipolarBlogger diagnose based on your reaction to medicine. if antidepressants don't work, they may try a mood stabilizer, ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:27:20	@BipolarBlogger It is the basis for treatment plans, but as you said, the finer distinctions may be irrelevant. And also, many pdocs ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:19:22	@BipolarBlogger its like ppl self-diagnosing in a way. IMO the labels only serve to hinder "recovery" but I am not a fan of MH professionals
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:18:23	@BipolarBlogger that the labels exist for medicinal purposes. The fact that some ppl prefer to label themselves is irrelevant. ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:17:54	@BipolarBlogger It doesn't really change much my first comment, even though your experience differs. I have even been told by doctors ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:17:19	@BipolarBlogger I apologize if you think I was taking it lightly. I read it for a second time and I remembered it correctly....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 19:02:25	@BipolarBlogger unless someone else mentioned bp 1.5 it was the same. I suppose I didn't remember it well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 09:45:52	@SarRAWR_x3 Thanks. Most ppl don't get that. Glad to hear I'm not alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 08:45:56	Maybe I'm different, but I feel better when I acknowledge how I feel, even if it is suicidal. Trying to feel better makes me feel worse.

500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 06:23:25	@LouiseKMcKenzie @Talk_Out yeah same here. just expressing my opinion. not upset. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 06:04:29	@Polarbear3127 thanks for saying that. i was a little confused. very happy u sound better, even if just a little.

500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:56:44	@Talk_Out @LouiseKMcKenzie IMHO best thing to do is say nothing if you don't know the person and what would be good to say.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:56:06	@Polarbear3127 thanks! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:55:46	@Polarbear3127 wish i could do that. having trouble focusing. :( you sound a bit better, maybe? r u still in the hospital?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:54:37	@drella66 it oughta be, i think waiting for it is making me worse. ironically, next week will be tough 4 different reasons as it'll be done.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:51:26	@LouiseKMcKenzie @Talk_Out that was my point as well. dealing with mh is difficult. every person must be treated differently.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:50:21	@drella66 yes, praise the pill. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:49:50	@Dear_Ace thanks. same in return. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:46:15	@Dear_Ace lol. i don't think i have ever been in 1 piece. i'll just be happy to reach the "end" of this "bottom" sometime.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:43:35	@Dear_Ace white-knuckling it. very good description. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:42:57	@Talk_Out mh professionals study generalities (i.e. 65% of population sufficient). that leaves a lot of people out.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:42:04	@Talk_Out I still disagree with your generalization about it being the best thing to say to anyone w mh issue. everyone is different and ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:39:43	@Dear_Ace I've never been this unable to focus and find enjoyment out of at least something. I'm just not used to it, don't know what 2 do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:37:54	@BipolarBlogger I did read the post yesterday. People like labels. The labels aren't even right. Mental health is a continuum.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:37:01	@Talk_Out not sure why you say that. sometimes someone honestly wants to be alone. just saying that is a disturbance.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:33:39	@BipolarBlogger of course not, its just a label for the doctors.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:32:43	@amanda_stand absolutely. just listen always. the person u r talking 2 c's the world different from u. its not helpful 2 impose ur views.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:26:13	@drella66 no, I need to maintain a sleep schedule, at least this week. I have an important day on Saturday.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:24:14	@drella66 did the old ones stop working? I've heard that its very tough to try and change meds.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:18:31	@drella66 the withdrawal from klonopin was what started the misery of the last 4 months. even though it subsided 3 months ago, today is bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:16:32	my wife believes in karma, if she is right, my account is less in debt, but probably won't be even in my lifetime.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:15:29	I have never been this useless. #bipolar #bipolardisorder #anxiety #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:14:05	why am I so fucked up? I've not been able to do anything productive for 4 months. am on meds again and its not getting better. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 05:07:53	had prior physical addiction to klonopin. is it a really bad idea to have a small dose of xanax? really need something. #anxiety #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 04:09:57	@_chasingdragons I've never called a crisis line either. for me, I just put on music and try to get lost in it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 03:58:33	@_chasingdragons just make sure you are in a safe place if you must.:)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-13 01:12:54	@sam_stone152 don't think it'll be any cooler for the rest of us though. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 22:52:29	@fogartyelaine the more celebs w alleged bp, the more they talk abt bp making ppl creative, the more I see how little I've accomplished.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 22:32:50	Is it just me, or is it "in" for celebrities to say that they have some mental illness?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 21:41:35	@Dear_Ace good luck with that. Hard itch not to scratch.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 21:40:52	@Miss_Gibson91 at least someone else is driving. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 21:30:52	How is everyone today? Gonna try to be proactive and fill my day, even if it is just finding movies on Netflix.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 20:02:38	@Owl615 Oh I do that. But I am pretty forgiving of myself. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 19:48:02	@KourtneySawyer nope they don't
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 19:37:40	My Lamictal makes me hypomanic, and I have NOTHING planned for today. Must get out or rip my OWN head off. ARGH. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 09:49:53	Everyone in this house argues w all I say. And they are not all children. Fuck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 05:54:02	add anxious and impatient to the list.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 05:32:37	Not just bored anymore. Agitated and bored. I wish I could drink but I need to wait until Saturday night.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 04:21:58	Lots of ppl have told me to read. Except my 2 yo and my cats won't let me. Really. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 04:16:58	@notquitesorted yes, and it is definitely a symptom of having nothing interesting to do. pop tarts do sound good. :0
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 04:16:00	@Owl615 @KKAlThani LOVE IT!!! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 04:13:07	pardon me for all my bored tweets. "boredom overtook him and he began to speak" KR
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 04:12:31	earlier today i wasn't hungry at all. i have eaten plenty since then. now i am starving. bored.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 04:10:11	Bored bored bored, and no end of boredom in site. I think they have a pill for this, but it might be illegal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-12 04:07:42	Every other time I have had significant unemployment, it coincided with a major life change. No such luck this time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 20:55:50	@garbosmc thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 19:43:55	Yesterday was okay. That made 3 days in a row, but I think its over. The days ahead look very long from here. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 18:45:15	@bullfrogr @Owl615 @garbosmc agreed
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 08:10:50	@Scarlett_Raee I think I saw that you swim. if so, that is great, replace that weight with muscle and you will look good even b4 u hit UGW.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 08:07:46	@Scarlett_Raee I binge eat for months then compulsively diet. I find if I try 2 cut weight 2 fast, I end up binging more. I wish u the best.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 07:56:48	I know affirmations are just meant to be inspirational, but maybe its the lawyer in me that can't help but see their falsehoods.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 07:46:38	#bipolar seems to be stabilizing from my meds, but still want to feed my #addiction . Too bad there isn't a pill for that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 07:43:59	Things might get slightly better in the next few weeks. Won't be enough but I'll take what I can get. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 04:48:35	@jonylogic yes. For better or worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 04:48:10	@Dear_Ace now I just need more stuff to keep me busy. How are you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 04:45:13	@jonylogic thanks. What makes it worse is the afternoon part is mostly sitting and three short demonstrations. Boring.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 04:42:01	@Dear_Ace fair to middling so to speak. Have stuff to focus on this week so that helps.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 04:40:45	@jonylogic not really. Its like 9 hours.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 04:29:51	@Dear_Ace of course you are. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 04:28:56	@jonylogic yes it is. thanks for remembering. back is doing well, so fitness part will be easy. rest of test should be fine I expect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 04:10:41	Treat your issues young before they cause you to make mistakes that will carry forward the rest of your life. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-11 00:58:39	@_chasingdragons celebrating getting through therapy!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 21:44:10	@_chasingdragons great luck. it'll be fun. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 20:33:54	@Polarbear3127 I hope you get better soon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 19:48:28	So I may be cheerful this week because I have some motivation. My black belt test is Saturday and my back is feeling ready for it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 19:47:32	@biggestjourney not a bad idea. although might get a bit depressing if there aren't many. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 19:46:59	@_chasingdragons I think that is good. Its a new experience. Maybe it'll suck, but maybe something interesting will happen.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 19:46:01	@_chasingdragons thanks.:)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 19:41:22	Good morning. Yesterday went fairly well. Thats 2 days in a row. Certainly a record for this year (the old record may have been 0). #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 05:23:41	@Miss_Gibson91 don't online publish. I know serious writers, and the online publishing is a joke. also it'll cost you some money.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 05:19:43	@Miss_Gibson91 don't do that. just don't. not if your serious.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 05:11:07	@Miss_Gibson91 a woman I know met other writers in an online writing forum.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 05:06:37	@Miss_Gibson91 ask another writer to read your work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 04:57:57	@_chasingdragons thanks. I think ppl just take us the wrong way. They don't understand we just feel things more strongly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 04:53:00	@_chasingdragons it isn't conducive to maintaining a friendship. Unfortunately she is really my last good friend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 04:52:31	@_chasingdragons she has violence issues with me because she likes to slug me. No idea what I've done to bring that out in her but ....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 04:51:19	@_chasingdragons I suppose I have been so much of a jerk that the little things are too much now. The latest is my friend has decided ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 04:46:04	@_chasingdragons don't know about you, but i am still losing them from stuff I haven't done in years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 04:44:36	I may or may not be functioning. I can fake it so well that I may have fooled myself. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 04:41:39	@_chasingdragons same to you. a lot of those bridges are friends irreparably lost. and I may have just lost my last one this weekend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 04:40:26	Ive made bad decisions that have closed doors I want open and burned bridges I need to cross. Thus, the road to recovery is broken. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-10 04:35:50	@FindStability i find that psych meds make me feel drugged whether they are uppers or downers. I like to come off them to clear my head.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 23:28:20	@Grassroots___ I've seen this. Best pages on the issue anywhere. Doesn't patronize at all but acknowledges the pain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 23:24:48	@FindStability meds for physical sickness are often temporary. Chronic illness is new to most ppl.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 23:20:41	@drella66 im so sorry that its that hard. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 22:31:04	@drella66 I always wanted to not have to work but we don't have enough money to ever do anything but watch tv and movies at home.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 22:15:37	@Satinsox1 very true!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 22:15:21	@Satinsox1 not of ssri, on lamictal for bipolar. just went on it. b4 the whole week after even 2 drinks was miserabl.e
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 22:04:20	@Owl615 oh yeah. shoulda had a "day off" a long time ago. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 22:03:15	Now that I am out of my #depression and on my full dose of meds, I have been able to drink without sinking even lower. YAY!!!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 22:01:49	@Miss_Gibson91 I think you are close in age so no. It does make me question your taste though. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 21:37:51	I had so many great times, exciting times, when I was younger. Life now is so drab by comparison. Bleh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 20:14:33	@Miss_Gibson91 alright thanks. have some purpose to the week. :) just go in with the idea of letting the hot water relax and warm you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 20:00:47	Yesterday was the first time since I made this account that I didn't tweet. Strange day indeed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 19:58:51	@Miss_Gibson91 Good morning! If you aren't going anywhere, not such a big deal. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 19:29:41	Sunday. I just realized today I didn't take them yesterday. Surprised since I had a very good day despite being tired and a little sick.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 19:28:41	Got really drunk Saturday night and ended up drunk sparring. In my lack of sleep and only slightly hungover state, I forgot my meds on ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-09 19:27:39	Good morning. What an interesting weekend for once.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 07:54:00	@essally very good point.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 07:36:15	@essally thank you! Someone agrees with me. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 07:05:01	I still like cats more than people.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 07:04:06	Hugging a cat doesn't make things better, but it makes everything alright for a little bit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 06:37:10	@Dear_Ace that is embarrassing.some people are very stupid.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 06:33:54	@Dear_Ace hopefully it won't get as big as trayon martin.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 06:32:40	@Dear_Ace what happened? usually stupid stuff happens here in Georgia.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 06:32:10	I didn't handle the #bipolardisorder diagnoses well. I am not handling the thought of #addiction well at all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 05:52:26	@bipolarvoice calm. But the road ahead is clearly broken and there is a strong chance it goes nowhere.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 05:33:19	@bipolarvoice but you aren't me, and we've never met in person. You seem to assume I fit a model.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 05:30:52	@bipolarvoice I'm not depressed right now. You seem to make the assumption that my evaluation of my situation is irrational.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 05:29:16	@bipolarvoice sure, but I am interested in knowing what you base your opinions on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 05:22:20	@bipolarvoice @Miss_Gibson91 @narcopops interesting, so how will I do that?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 04:22:58	@Owl615 I know. Crazy, huh?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 02:51:56	Tell your kids you love them for absolutely no reason.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 02:25:44	That is not to say that people overly self-diagnosing is not annoying.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 02:23:56	Definition of bipolar: "characterized by opposite extremes, as two conflicting political philosophies."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 02:23:31	I know this is a sensitive topic. But #bipolar is a word that has a meaning outside the disorder. So, even weather can be bipolar.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 02:12:45	My 10 y.o. son asked for motor oil so that he and his friend could make ammo.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 02:05:15	On a positive note, my kids were REALLY cute seeing the Easter Bunny today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 02:04:30	@Miss_Gibson91 @bipolarvoice @narcopops still discovering that #bipolar is probably just the tip of the iceberg.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 02:04:04	@Miss_Gibson91 @bipolarvoice @narcopops lol. if you mean I am alive, maybe. but that is a pretty low standard. I really have a ways to go...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 02:01:06	@Miss_Gibson91 @bipolarvoice @narcopops I am not surviving so well. I'll be proud if I can ever pull myself out of this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 02:00:27	@bipolarvoice @narcopops @Miss_Gibson91 its not a life choice like being LBGT is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 01:55:26	@riverluss being proud of yourself for being strong is not the same as being proud of a disease. If you survived, you should be proud.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 01:53:31	@Miss_Gibson91 have you seen how many people have that in their profile or will tweet it on occasion?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 01:51:03	@narcopops Not ashamed but I don't publicize. Stigma is a normal human reaction. I don't want my life harder by being subjected to it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 01:49:14	@_chasingdragons Thanks. I just don't find it helpful all these unrealistic positive affirmations thrown at us.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 01:47:12	Definition of Proud: "having, proceeding from, or showing a high opinion of one's own dignity, importance, or superiority."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 01:45:58	#Bipolar and NOT proud of it. Why would I be proud to suffer like this?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-08 01:13:03	I may be smarter than the above average bear, but I still do a lot of stupid things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-07 23:39:26	@CarolineVGray I think I am on the dose my dr wants me on. Only 100 mg.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-07 23:19:04	@CarolineVGray it may just be that I have had issues with this before.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-07 22:50:02	I can't hold down a job, so I certainly don't think I am better than others, despite that they think I do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-07 21:59:32	@CarolineVGray its more than feeling dizzy. My whole sense or.balance is off sometimes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-07 12:54:14	Lamictal is affecting my equilibrium.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-07 05:43:40	I am a realist. I don't appreciate a positive or negative spin. Neither is helpful, especially to those of us who are trying to get better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-07 05:42:47	#mentalillness means society says you don't think and act within acceptable bounds. I guess that means I was right that I am different.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-07 01:19:53	@Miss_Gibson91 @BipolarBlogger I put on 20 pounds in the first few months I was on Lithium.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-07 01:09:37	@oceangirlholly it worked wonders for my insomnia.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 23:42:44	@oceangirlholly just lamictal. I take ambien rarely. Used to take xanax and klonopin but started to become addicted.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 23:41:28	@oceangirlholly yeah my mania is usually accompanied by anger, irritability, and anxiety.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 22:58:07	@Owl615 I haven't quit anything. My compulsions go away and I find others. I need a new one. No desire not to find one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 22:57:59	@oceangirlholly so sorry to hear abt the pain. Im okay. Meds have helped but moods still up and down.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 22:57:04	@Owl615 no joke. I am sprained my back a month ago from too much exercise.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 22:55:37	@Shawnie_0405 no joke.I've been exercising so much I sprained my back.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 22:55:06	@Shawnie_0405 no one I stay in contact with. Its just a peer group talking about bipolar.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 22:53:30	No, life has not hit me with a ton of bricks. It has dropped a skyscraper on me. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 11:13:36	@nejireta_ki thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 11:12:43	@nejireta_ki oh I only wish.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 11:11:42	@Dear_Ace im just realizing how desperately im looking for a fix and I don't even know what that fix is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 11:01:07	I've been an alcohol abuser, compulsive gambler, sex addict, and workaholic. Craving a new high.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 11:00:03	I think I am an addict presently without an addiction. Addiction may just be scarier to me than #bipolar has been.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 09:51:18	@essally I most certainly am right now!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 09:46:54	@essally agreed. You enjoy your own company!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 09:45:57	Went to a #bipolar support group tonight and realized how much I rely on many of you. Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 09:44:58	@oceangirlholly how are you doing lately?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 09:40:47	The drinks feel good but no one wants to talk to me. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 09:32:50	I want a new addiction. Make that need.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 09:31:52	@Owl615 what the h does that mean? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 09:19:41	Haven't drank much in months. Could drink now til I can't walk.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 09:16:24	Wishing I wasn't me right now. I can't recover when I don't want to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 09:15:29	@essally better to be alone than some people's company. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 09:07:16	Sitting in a bar cause I don't want to go home.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 08:43:30	I am very agitated and very upset. #bipolar #bipolardisorder #anxiety
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 08:39:07	I think I am an addict, but what I am addicted to keeps changing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 06:16:38	@Miss_Gibson91 I always use the dr as a cover when I want my kids to do something. No one argues w a dr.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 06:11:42	@Miss_Gibson91 if ur ok w a little white lie, tell him ur therapist said its a bad idea.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 05:49:31	@jonylogic I do it as a hobby, for exercise, and to get out some aggression.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 05:48:14	Real anxious can't sit still have to keep looking at my phone or doing something.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 05:31:11	@jonylogic I don't know. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 02:25:49	@jonylogic thanks. Breaking is my favorite part. Wish we did it more often.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-06 02:18:16	@jonylogic a week from Saturday. Was finally able to practice my board breaks this week which went well despite a.new break.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 21:30:40	I have spent my whole life wanting to be "normal", yet I really enjoy standing out from the crowd. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 21:27:38	@BipolarPosts well, i quit my job b/c of a klonopin addiction. i very much need a daytime hobby. i've lost interest in many i used to have.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 21:22:03	Twitter is really good in teaching you to write sentences without extra verbiage.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 21:21:30	@bipolarchick I knew many ppl on meds to treat side effects. Very rough. I'm glad the situation improved so much that you are down to 2.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 21:20:04	I really, really thought I would like being a stay-at-home dad (AKA Mr. Mom), but I am sooooo bored.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 21:14:46	@bipolarchick omg, 17 pills is a huge number. I dated a girl once who was on like 3 or 4 different meds, and I thought that was a lot.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 21:10:19	@bipolarchick goes to show how unpredictable these drugs are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 21:04:39	@bipolarchick my pdoc thinks its unusual that lamictal would cause hypomania though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 21:03:51	@bipolarchick that is completely different than me. Lamictal is great for my depression but tends to make me hypomanic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 20:56:00	@nejireta_ki maybe they might be, but what do you do when the party is over? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 20:54:23	@bipolarchick Wow, that sounds like a very high dose. I have tried a lot of other meds and reacted poorly. Lam is the least bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 12:42:41	Goodnight. Gonna try to sneak into bed while the #insomnia is looking at twitter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 12:41:56	@Shawnie_0405 yes, agreed!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 12:40:55	@oceangirlholly thank you so much. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 12:40:41	@oceangirlholly did you get the rash? I had to come off last year because of a small rash.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 12:03:04	What do your choices say about you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 12:02:36	If you could have a pill that makes you feel better or one that makes u the life of the party, what would u choose? #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 12:01:09	@Dear_Ace well at least im not the only one. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:54:14	@Dear_Ace if I wasn't somewhat shy I would be out drinking and sleeping around constantly. That may be good but I hate it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:50:14	@Dear_Ace yeah we do. Any idea how to let go of the things that are bad for us? Honestly I don't want to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:44:23	@Dear_Ace I may be selfish but I just need mine to be so.much more than it is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:41:36	@Psycblog lol. That would mean that I only needed to be willing to be in the same room as her. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:40:08	@Dear_Ace hey that is a start. I just wish I had a plan even a very long term one that I could focus on. Then id be fine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:37:18	@Dear_Ace I just know I feel like crap and have for nearly a year. I am a little better but see no end in site.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:30:09	@Dear_Ace others with bipolar still seem to react more normally than I do to others. But who.knows.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:29:11	@Dear_Ace it might be similar for me. Never been diagnosed but wouldn't be surprised if I had some.sort of PD also ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:27:38	@Dear_Ace exactly. Same for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:26:31	@Dear_Ace my docs have said it is prolly hypomania symptoms, at least for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:24:29	@Dear_Ace whatever it takes. Twitter should be what we need it to be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:21:24	@Dear_Ace depression has subsided for now which is good. Im just very agitated and argumentative.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:20:26	@Dear_Ace I was happy you made contact again. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 11:03:56	@Dear_Ace its good to at least identify that its probably the meds. Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 10:59:37	Has anyone had increased #anxiety from taking lamictal/ lamotrigine?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-05 00:45:09	Bored, anxious, and impatient. What to do? Sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 22:20:44	@Polarbear3127 btw, I am not uncomfortable around all schizophrenics, only those that are generally incoherent.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 22:19:52	@Polarbear3127 psychotic features are one factor in a manic episode, but not usually common in depression.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 22:17:53	@Polarbear3127 do you have psychotic features when you aren't manic?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 22:14:11	@Polarbear3127 halfway house with severe schizophrenics. Many of whom also had severe med side effects. They were very disturbing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 22:13:11	@Polarbear3127 sorry abt that. I am just not into the PC thing. And I am probably guilty a little of the stigma thing. I spent time in a ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 22:08:20	@Polarbear3127 its alright. I just don't worry abt other ppl's assumptions. Its natural to generalize, so no reason to get upset abt it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 22:03:53	@Polarbear3127 I can't imagine how anyone can be creative on a deadline.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 22:03:25	@Polarbear3127 yeah, I was just commenting on the usual generalization that is made.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 21:55:21	#bipolardisorder is supposed to make you more creative, but I had better tweets when I was #depressed . :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 21:47:37	Out of work and mood starting to elevate. Going very stir crazy inside myself. #anxiety and impatience rising but can't take xanax. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 21:45:01	Once the depression is gone, it is more important to be cautious so #mania doesn't start new problems. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 21:43:28	Back still feels fine this morning. Didn't get hurt again at TKD. Yay!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 11:08:41	That's the problem with #bipolardisorder . Every feeling is so magnified that one has no rational perspective.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 10:36:14	I don't know. Maybe my problems are small. But to me, they are larger than life and hard to overcome. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 09:40:20	Tkd went well. Made my breaks. Will see in the morning if my back is ok.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 09:37:10	@Owl615 lol. Probably would help if I defined all the other terms. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 08:53:34	@Owl615 the expectation of a random variable is the weighted average of all possible values that this random variable can take on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 04:41:14	@brokenmind_ for depression it helps me quite well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 04:24:14	@jonylogic Thanks!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 04:23:52	@jonylogic yeah, they grade really really easy for 1st degree. just need my breaks and the fitness will be harder since i've been injured.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 04:22:21	@brokenmind_ I am on 100mg.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 04:15:49	@ArsenicNAce @jonylogic don't mean to barge but just use DM for a private convo.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 04:14:08	Going to a party sat nite. Let's see which me shows up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 04:09:23	@BipolarBlogger omg yes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 02:56:40	@oceangirlholly need a good class. if i can do my breaks after this long layoff i will be very confident going in to the test.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 02:56:03	@ArsenicNAce thanks! just hope my back doesn't give out again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 02:46:35	Finally, I am cleared for TKD tonight. Black belt test next week. Hope I have enough time to prepare.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-04 02:16:54	spent time with my older boys individually and wasn't anxious about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 23:03:56	@Miss_Gibson91 I am so sorry. Thinking of you. *hug*
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 22:02:54	Okay, gonna try to be more patient today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:56:27	@Miss_Gibson91 ur not no one, ur just someone different that you need to get to know better to understand her.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:52:52	@Miss_Gibson91 awww. you are young, and once you get back out iin the world, you will meet lots of reliable trustworthy ppl.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:51:41	@Miss_Gibson91 I was a lot more interesting then, especially to myself. that is what makes it hard for me to want to "recover"
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:49:54	@Miss_Gibson91 that I do. and I admit when I am wrong, which my parents never did.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:48:50	@Miss_Gibson91 when I was very manic, I found ppl wanted to be around me not cause they cared about me but just b/c I was fun. Not worth it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:48:14	@Miss_Gibson91 not really a great dad. theory and practice are two different things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:43:18	@Miss_Gibson91 exactly. I don't talk much with my parents and at this point could care less. i only spend time w ppl who care abt me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:41:41	@Miss_Gibson91 I am sorta convinced you can't help screwing your kids up. You can only hope to make them self sufficient. No excuse though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:36:41	@Miss_Gibson91 no you didn't. my parents are the same. and my mom treats my stepsisters better than me, so I think I understand.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:34:17	@Miss_Gibson91 I agree you have to try. I was just suggesting one possibility why they would act so poorly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:33:39	@Miss_Gibson91 Yes, I agree. My oldest son has #mentalhealth issues. I've made it worse I think sometimes by trying too hard. But ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:29:31	@Miss_Gibson91 sometimes you just feel helpless and don't know what to do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:25:21	@Owl615 The problem is I may have screwed it up beyond repair and I may not be functioning enough to work. Thus, I am fairly hopeless now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:24:13	@Owl615 I let the #mentalillness get the better of me and settle for just anything?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:23:43	@Owl615 fits quite nicely. I have genius level IQ and multiple advanced degrees. I've been successful but thrown it away. Why should ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 21:22:03	@Owl615 This article give the math definition expectation. I have a Ph.D in math, so I know it well. And by that definition, expectation ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 11:41:32	@Owl615 I need goals/expectations. They are my motivation. I thrive on the journey.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 11:36:32	briefly feeling sane. too bad its time for bed. maybe i can repeat that trigger tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 11:06:22	@Owl615 lack of expectations invite failure. And what kind of life is it with none? And why be afraid of failure?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 10:53:05	@Owl615 no its really not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 10:49:29	Positive thought for the day: not everyone hates me yet. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 10:48:13	Everyone had such very high expectations for me. Just not gonna happen. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 08:18:58	Underwhelmed by the entire world. #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 08:18:32	Overwhelmed by anger, agitation, and irritability. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 08:15:46	@ArsenicNAce isnt it barely diinner time where you are?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 07:48:00	@Miss_Gibson91 @essally try lamictal. i only seem to get the ups.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 07:37:08	@Miss_Gibson91 I thought you weren't taking it? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 07:33:05	@Miss_Gibson91 what do you do to distract yourself. I am multitabling at online poker.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 07:29:47	my mind moves faster than the world, so it cannot find anything to alleviate the boredom. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 06:29:13	@eternalseeker7 thanks. now i understand what you were saying. :)

500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 06:16:39	I've done this too many times. I am just not interested.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 06:08:34	@eternalseeker7 what is the law of attraction?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 05:44:35	@Miss_Gibson91 end of vacations suck. just close your eyes and pretend you are still on the beach. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 05:39:28	@Miss_Gibson91 me too. hope you feel better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 05:37:14	@Shawnie_0405 I know you are just trying to help, and I do appreciate it. I am just a very long way from any meaningful recovery.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 04:06:41	@Shawnie_0405 I have all those things in order that I can control. Its those things that I can't that are so hard for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 04:06:11	@Shawnie_0405 yeah, until I sprained my back, I exercised once or twice a day. Been eating healthy and losing those lithium pounds.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 04:03:59	@Shawnie_0405 while it may sound otherwise, I never give up. But right now I am running into walls and haven't yet found an alternate route.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 04:02:03	@narcopops yup. i rarely drink 'cause it makes it worse. and I already went through the klonopin withdrawal, so i won't go back there either
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 04:00:24	@Shawnie_0405 yes, I have truly faced my crap. and I have fucked up. some things aren't recoverable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 03:59:40	@Shawnie_0405 you're been saying I can just be happy by choice. without knowing me, why do you assume that there is something I can do?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 03:49:02	Every person is made happy in different ways. What works for some may not for others.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 03:45:51	@Shawnie_0405 that is idealistic. while you were going through your trauma, did positive thinking make you feel happy?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 03:41:34	@Shawnie_0405 how about if you are being physically abused?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 03:36:18	@Shawnie_0405 What I meant was that there are outside influences that positive thinking cannot affect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 03:34:39	@Shawnie_0405 okay, you got me there. I know from experience that positive thinking is very important in recovering from physical sickness.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 03:32:39	Don't assume that because I have #bipolardisorder that I cannot and have not rationally assessed my situation.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 03:31:26	If you are unhappy for reasons that are not negative thinking, how is thinking positive going to help?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-03 03:29:43	Would you tell somebody who is dying that its okay and will all get better soon?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 22:50:37	@Polarbear3127 not really a video game person. But I like the motion detectors like wii and kinect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 22:47:00	@Polarbear3127 thanks. Yeah I really shouldn't spend the money but I am sooooo bored during the days.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 22:45:26	@Polarbear3127 ok thanks. So what is pos?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 22:24:35	@essally we have a wii. kids like it, but I am not crazy about it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 22:19:41	@Polarbear3127 probably is a bit manic considering i'd have to pay for it out of savings. what is qmania?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 22:14:03	I must be feeling more up today. Been shopping online for an Xbox.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 21:44:26	Good morning. Spring break for my boys. Should be a loud week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 11:39:19	Goodnight comb goodnight brush
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 11:37:26	@ArsenicNAce it does sound perfect. hey thanks for the chat. kept me off the xanax and outta the bars. now, i need sleep. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 11:32:37	@ArsenicNAce i suppose I understand why you seem to like to go to work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 11:31:47	@ArsenicNAce im sorry. my friends are all couple friends, who mostly just like my wife.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 11:27:53	@ArsenicNAce that sucks. do you know others w similar conditions near you? support groups? friends who don't run away? ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 11:21:22	@ArsenicNAce c'est la vie. although you miss ur kids, you can use the time to get your thoughts together. less pressure?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 11:11:36	@ArsenicNAce we make too much for any public welfare and not enough to afford a sitter. I might have to spring for it though anyways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 11:10:29	@ArsenicNAce well i don't beat them, and i don't ignore them completely. but i don't play with them either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 11:04:04	@ArsenicNAce have no one to watch my 2 yo so i can go, and i am not sure i can find a good therapist. i am very picky about them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 11:03:15	@ArsenicNAce u were a stay at home mom? right now, i do that, but i am awful. cant get past my issues enough.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 11:00:39	@ArsenicNAce i need therapy. i know these things about me, but i need someone to focus my attention better on what i should be doing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:59:53	@ArsenicNAce at least you are prolly a more attentive mom when you are with them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:58:07	@ArsenicNAce i can't imagine where i'd be or what i'd be doing without them though. i love them more than anyone else.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:57:39	@ArsenicNAce my kids are the only ones being nice to me. still its difficult being home all day every day with just them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:55:14	@ArsenicNAce do you? i've gotten better over the years with that. still do it sometimes when the person deserves it. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:54:04	@ArsenicNAce for awhile i wanted company other than my kids (who i take care of), now i just want to be alone. suprised im even on twitter.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:52:45	@ArsenicNAce im there too. ive known for years i was heading for a bottom like this. i knew when it would happen, but its not any easier.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:51:02	@ArsenicNAce is there any treatment options you get that you wouldn't otherwise?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:48:53	@ArsenicNAce at least it sounds like you are "in recovery". me im just on meds. not sure i can stomach another "recovery".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:47:44	@ArsenicNAce that is why i am starting to wonder if there should be a secondary diagnosis, like narcissistic PD
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:47:07	@ArsenicNAce yeah. i just always knew i was different, no matter how much i was assured otherwise. i still am, even around other bp. ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:45:49	@ArsenicNAce I just know that you are just a patient to the docs, you have to be an active participant in your therapy (talking or meds)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:43:58	@ArsenicNAce i was in denial about the bp. way too serious a diagnosis. would mean i was like those odd ppl in the halfway house i was in.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:39:47	@ArsenicNAce my parents always just wanted to know that it wasn't their fault.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:39:20	@ArsenicNAce ive been in the "system" so long, I might as well have an honorary degree. knowing what it wrong fixes nothing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:36:32	my thousandth tweet was a curse. lol. completely not surprising to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:35:50	@ArsenicNAce they think they know how you think. and they know they don't like it. they don't know how we feel. hopefully they care.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:32:05	@ArsenicNAce eff them, they don't make it any easier. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:29:24	@ArsenicNAce yeah, its also a bit of an escapist thing for me. get my mind onto something that feels good, or at least not bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:23:52	@ArsenicNAce Its been a long time since the need has overwhelmed the thought of the consequences, but its coming if not here already.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 10:08:19	@grapefruitxo thank you. its appreciated.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 09:55:55	@grapefruitxo I am not the one to ask that. I've had it since I was a little kid and I am in one of the worst relapses I have had.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 09:49:33	@grapefruitxo big smile. I was afraid any response I might get would be preachy. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 09:46:27	I am addict, of sorts, and I am really needing a fix right now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 09:05:11	I had hope because I always thought it wouldn't be like this when I got older. At least I fooled myself awhile. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 09:02:07	@DailyBipolar trying to. thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 09:01:27	@Miss_Gibson91 on the positive side you haven't hit rock bottom. if you did you'd make sure you never missed a dose on the chance it helps
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 08:44:28	I think I am crashing. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 08:42:45	How many failures is too much? #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 05:21:22	@Owl615 sounds good to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-02 05:08:17	I just want to curse .... and sleep ... a lot. #bipolar #bipolardisorder #mixedstate
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 20:55:53	Morning all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:47:43	Goodnight little house goodnight mouse
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:43:04	@ArsenicNAce you are a stronger person than I. Good for you. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:41:02	@garbosmc yeah that is really tying one on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:39:01	@garbosmc @ArsenicNAce once upon a time I would drink nearly a fifth of.vodka in a nite.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:36:17	@garbosmc @ArsenicNAce sounds like you've had your share of troubles with it as well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:31:05	@ArsenicNAce sounds like alcohol doesn't mix well w u. Tends to make me more impulsive. My friends aren't so I don't get in trouble anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:25:23	@ArsenicNAce if I drink alone I wallow and get more sad. It is a great social lube for me in a group.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:22:14	@ArsenicNAce that's good. Don't know bout u but I don't get enough of a rush drinking without others around.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:14:47	@ArsenicNAce take or ur mostly sober now? I don't drink vodka alone anymore so its.not been a big problem.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:12:51	@ArsenicNAce see its my elixir of life. The price is I am out of it for at least a day and a bit slow for a week. I drink a lot of it. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:10:57	@oceangirlholly great.for u. U look good.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:09:25	@ArsenicNAce I prefer vodka. Weed makes me too mellow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:07:16	@ArsenicNAce is this a stick up? Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:03:48	Twitter for Android has issues. Argh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 12:02:19	@ArsenicNAce well the twitter play would be interesting and different. Don't have weed. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:55:42	@ArsenicNAce I am too practiced in suppressing it. And everyone I know is too mature. Lol any ideas for me? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:53:11	@ArsenicNAce quite on edge. Really want to get out and just go somewhere. The pressure is building. Glad 4 u you'll be loopy soon. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:48:30	@ArsenicNAce yes it is. But at least its my cousins not parents. Hope ur not up all nite with the med problem.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:44:54	@ArsenicNAce I have 5 kids here this weekend. My 3 boys and my cousins 2 girls. This place is very loud and for no reason I'm very tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:41:41	@ArsenicNAce thanks. same to you. How u doin'? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:37:33	@SarRAWR_x3 I.did. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:37:08	Everyone has compassion for someone depressed but no one does for a #bipolar when they are #manic . #bipolrdisorder .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:29:20	I can't stop thinking about Las Vegas. Booze and gambling. That is my version of heaven.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:26:50	I am exhausted. But I know I can wake up anytime I like by just going to bed. #insomnia
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:22:00	@crstlskyscraper that is great. I am the same way. Love how exercise makes me feel.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:19:27	Give me mania or give me xanax. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:17:36	F the consequences, I am still hoping for a full blown manic episode. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 11:07:54	Reading my old tweets, I seem to get in a really bad moods on weekends. That is sad as I am lonely and bored all week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 07:42:24	Mad not mas.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 07:41:43	My 7 yo cousin just said she was afraid of me cause I was in my mas world. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 04:42:46	I'm not in the world, and the world doesn't care.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 02:06:32	I kinda feel like getting into a fight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-04-01 00:07:29	I don't play well with others. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 22:26:10	Who else can be euphoric and suicidal at the same time? #bipolar #bipolardisorder #mixedstate
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 22:22:57	@oceangirlholly he is just extremely selfish although he often accuses me of that. Like your sister?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 21:44:55	@oceangirlholly Wow. My mom is afraid her husband will leave her and she'll be alone. He pushes her against me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 21:28:33	@oceangirlholly yes, and somewhat insulting, as the money was my grandfather's, and my mom didn't remarry until the steps were grown.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 20:49:38	Nothing in particular to complain about. Maybe I should tweet positive thoughts and inspirational quotes. Or not. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 20:48:20	House full of family this weekend. At least these are ones I really like.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 20:48:03	Good morning all!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 20:46:26	@oceangirlholly I have had similar issues with my mom and her stepdaughters.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 20:36:54	@_chasingdragons yes it does! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 20:33:04	Love this pic pic.twitter.com/dl6HoF55
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 12:34:36	@grapefruitxo functioning so no one knows I have bp except family. They do treat me differently but better since diagnosis.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 12:33:32	@grapefruitxo strong about it. Don't think I could be as strong. Stigma doesn't affect me as much. I appear to be very high ....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 12:32:32	@grapefruitxo I guess it depends on how well you handle physical sickness and a possible life threatening condition. You sound very ....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 12:27:36	@grapefruitxo I feel for you. Leukemia is much harder. It takes real strength to get through that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 12:21:07	@grapefruitxo yeah. That is about near to where I am except I am out of work bc I quit from the bp. Need to.find a routine I can handle.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 12:12:56	@grapefruitxo @ArsenicNAce very glad to hear your stable. Enjoy it. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 12:11:16	My meds keep the #depressiom at bay but they can't stop the deserved sadness over what is left of my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 12:09:23	@grapefruitxo @ArsenicNAce my pdoc says a bipolar can use an AD once a mood stabilizer is in place.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 09:06:09	@ArsenicNAce of course as you are surrounded by them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 08:33:09	@ArsenicNAce you rebel.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 07:57:26	@ArsenicNAce ur such a rogue.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 01:49:35	@BipolarMomLife yeah. Mine never naps when I need him too. Oh well. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 01:09:15	@bullfrogr im not schizo. Im bp I, haven't had psychotic features in a very long time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 01:00:31	@bullfrogr @Owl615 not schizo. But I was starting fights with 20 kids at a time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 00:57:01	@bullfrogr @Owl615 I've been "sick" since I was 6.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-31 00:47:50	@BipolarMomLife you really don't think its coincidence? Babies are smart. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 21:59:31	@jonylogic np. I wasn't really clear.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 21:43:45	@jonylogic not a drop. i was ramping up, so i was at 75.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 21:29:20	Going to 100 lamictal. Realized its not making me stable just numbing my feelings about everything. No cure.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 20:34:44	@MadeiraBoo Same to you! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 12:36:42	@bullfrogr @Owl615 good observation
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 12:36:18	@bullfrogr @Owl615 I've been fortunate that the only psychotic episodes I'm aware of are blackouts, and haven't had any since I was a teen.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 12:12:18	@bullfrogr @Owl615 its much easier. but they don't know as much as ppl think. I have misdiagnosed and wrongly treated my whole life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 12:10:34	@Owl615 I have been in the system for 35 years. Hospitals, halfway houses, and worse. I don't worry abtwhat ppl say, I've seen much worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 10:54:56	Goodnight stars goodnight air goodnight noises everywhere.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 10:54:07	Let it be even if there is no answer let it be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 10:53:07	RT if u dislike ppl asking u to retweet. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 10:52:19	Have pdoc tomorrow but I already know im going up to 100 lamictal. Only question might be if I continue to go up in a few weeks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 09:50:58	@bipolarvoice @garbosmc don't know that drug but I gambled away at least half that when I wasn't on drugs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 09:50:07	@bipolarvoice @garbosmc yeah I've heard that is a diagnostic tool - whether ad drugs make u manic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 09:08:59	@ArsenicNAce lol. I know. Weird.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 09:07:09	@ArsenicNAce its a bit of a turn on for me. TMI :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 09:03:24	@ArsenicNAce I swim at my gym.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 09:02:59	@ArsenicNAce it is relaxing. Very sensual in a way. Also, I always loved the chlorine smell. I don't know why.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:54:24	@ArsenicNAce I just started to swim this year but its so much more enjoyable than the stationary bike or elliptical runner.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:52:08	@ArsenicNAce swim, lift, and take taekwondo.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:49:06	@ArsenicNAce well at least it is good enough now to walk. That's a good step. Next u should get a punching bag to get out aggression. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:43:51	@Owl615 coming from a.science background, I can't really discuss without being verb precise, which takes a lot of words.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:42:35	@ArsenicNAce oh they are a mess. Can you get an injection of.joint fluid?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:38:46	@Owl615 a scientific discussion is much too hard to have in 140 characters at a time. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:35:04	@ArsenicNAce have you tried glucosamine?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:31:30	@bullfrogr @Owl615 uh oh. Don't want to do that. Psychiatry is such an imperfect field. They are wrong a lot. Not much comfort I know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:29:23	@ArsenicNAce does that mean ur knees feel better?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:24:41	@ArsenicNAce yeah. Keeping busy. Finally can exercise. Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:21:41	@ArsenicNAce *hugs*
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:12:00	@essally @Miss_Gibson91 im sorry for you both. I find that sex helps.my mood even if im not wanting it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 08:10:27	@bullfrogr @Owl615 diagnoses are mostly used to help choose treatment. More important that treatment works than labels.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:58:19	@Miss_Gibson91 @essally lithium had an effect on me, but I'm a guy, our mind wants it even if our body doesn't. lamictal doesn't affect me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:56:36	@Miss_Gibson91 now ur just teasing me... :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:53:49	@Miss_Gibson91 I can't judge. I've been dying to go manic for weeks. Fly off to Vegas or something.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:49:12	@Miss_Gibson91 I am prolly not helping. Sorry. You are definitely having cravings today. Vacation is making you rowdy. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:46:41	@essally sounds like fun. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:44:54	@Miss_Gibson91 yup. I am addicted to the rush and excitement. Mania plus alcohol or sex or gambling is ecstasy for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:41:57	@Miss_Gibson91 w gambling. Later it was sex. Then it was work. I like to say I have a floating addiction.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:41:15	@Miss_Gibson91 I made my 90/90 and then started drinking more than before. Kinda lost interest after awhile. Then had an issue ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:39:41	@Miss_Gibson91 understand. Had a stint in rehab when I was younger.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:37:09	@essally its 7:30 pm in Atlanta. U in australia? U r up Very early. I go to bed then sometimes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:35:34	@Miss_Gibson91 is that an issue for you? Cause lots of ppl do that on vacation.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:30:27	@essally you must be in another time zone. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:04:48	I'm good at stuff except the stuff I want to be good at.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 07:00:39	I can only do what I can. Brilliant.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 06:25:44	@Owl615 mine is good. Listens to what I want and doesnt tell me what to do. Respects me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 06:24:42	@Owl615 yes and no. I liked knowing at first but now it is very depressing to know ill prolly always be dealing with this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 06:23:38	@garbosmc I've been told by a pdoc that if bp drugs work they consider you bp.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 06:22:59	@garbosmc it is. I really am very textbook unfortunately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 06:15:44	@Owl615 I'll give you my pdoc's number though, and maybe you can talk him out of it. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 06:15:16	@Owl615 I have had it for 35 years, even if I refused to believe it. The symptoms and the patterns are "hallmark". :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 06:12:24	@Owl615 oh well, then you haven't met my dad. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 06:11:28	@Owl615 I am sure you do. I actually wanted and ADHD diagnosis. Was given bipolar and told clearly not ADHD. I would prefer your suggestion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 06:10:03	@Owl615 motivation issues come from a lot of things, and they do not have to be mental health related. You don't have a causal effect here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 06:06:32	@Owl615 Well, I'm sure you're not really trying to diagnose, since you know it isn't possible from tweets.You are entitled to your opinion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 06:00:39	@Owl615 to be honest, i am really not sure where you got ADHD from the comment I had made.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 05:59:25	@Owl615 I know. My son is. I am not. No denial. I Prolly have worse issues. Am bp. Could have a pd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 05:25:36	@Owl615 cant afford it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 05:22:22	hungry and cranky
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 05:20:34	@Owl615 no. been evaluated for that. definitely not adhd. im just too smart for my own good. really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 05:19:15	@Owl615 no
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 03:46:50	@Miss_Gibson91 lol. You move fast!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 03:36:14	@Miss_Gibson91 it sounds like you have already started to. Now just imagine what you'll be thinking after. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-30 03:33:30	@Miss_Gibson91 if you or your friend are the type to overthink it, then yes. If u r interested in something more, there are better ways.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 23:36:47	@CarolineVGray my youngest turns 2.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 21:58:30	Good morning everyone! Its my son's birthday!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 21:57:52	@Owl615 that is one of the problems, really, is whether or not I can or care to. Just having a job doesn't work for me unless I care abt it
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 21:56:48	@Owl615 neither. i left my job and stay home with my kids. can't see a therapist with a 2 yo in tow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 21:56:16	@Owl615 self care isn't an issue.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 10:31:31	@s0imp0ssible I appreciate that you can express what I feel.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 10:24:01	Wife tells me for first time in ten years I've been traumatizing our oldest, in her opinion. Nice to tell me now after I fucked him up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 10:22:20	Been doing this since I was born RT "@Scarlett_Raee: I fuck everything up. everything."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 10:20:16	Me too RT"@s0imp0ssible: I'm still unhappy no matter what I do. It doesn't matter what I try to do with my life anymore, nothing helps."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 10:17:30	Ur preaching to the choir even if most of the audience would disagree.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 10:12:29	Been there done that RT "@SarRAWR_x3: I'd apologize but I don't know what I'm doing wrong.."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 09:23:52	Been on twitter for 5 weeks and you all have been quite literally a lifesaver. Thank you. #bipolar #bipolardisorder #mentalhealth
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 09:10:51	@Owl615 not to toot my own horn but I have completed multiple significant achievements which has left me a bit directionless.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 09:09:30	@Owl615 never heard the yoga suggestion. Ill try it if I can get myself off the couch. Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 08:47:42	Fighting a headache. Tension headache. Not that I have any responsibility to be tense about. Bleh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 08:45:55	@ArsenicNAce . I just think that way even when I don't realize it. Lol:-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 08:41:30	Really REALLY need some goals that are not #mentalhealth related.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 08:05:31	@ArsenicNAce ok so there was no double meaning intended even if that reads funny. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 08:04:24	@ArsenicNAce lmao. At least u know how to fake. I just try to shut up and keep my head down so I don't say something provocative.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 08:01:28	@ArsenicNAce so ur just rational on the outside? Lol :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 07:58:40	@ArsenicNAce for all ur going thru ur very rational.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 07:49:54	@ArsenicNAce yes, but if u get little respect already it may not be worth it. I just ignore mine as.long as I can.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 07:25:12	@ArsenicNAce that is a very good quality to have then.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 07:22:14	@ArsenicNAce I don't envy you. I can't stay with them for a week without a blowout fight. Broke a lamp last yr should got stitches.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 07:13:29	@ArsenicNAce I talk as little.as possible w my rents. Im just tired of their condescension.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 07:10:51	@ArsenicNAce oh everyone says that abt me, incl my parents. Only my oldest son will say otherwise, and he is a little politician.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 07:08:42	@ArsenicNAce we're not really nice though. Lol. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 07:03:49	@ArsenicNAce got along well with others. Made friends like never could before.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 06:56:35	@ArsenicNAce exactly how I felt. The answer. Good concise description.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 06:55:17	@ArsenicNAce so the dose kept going up and then the compulsion started.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 06:54:39	@ArsenicNAce had the usual dry mouth, but I was the person I always thought I could be much of the time. It started to wear off ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 06:52:04	@ArsenicNAce the sucking of my mouth started with lithium but never went away. Too bad. B4 that lithium was my dream drug.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 06:50:00	@ArsenicNAce most ppl legs gets very restless. I just felt like I needed to crawl out of my skin.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 06:47:50	@ArsenicNAce the crawling thing is akasthia. Ppl have committed suicide cause of it. I've had it twice and I understand perfectly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 06:44:26	@ArsenicNAce that was all within 2 wks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 06:44:02	@ArsenicNAce last yr came off lam from rash. Came off abilify and Prozac from akasthia and off xanax and klonopin from addiction.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 06:41:15	@ArsenicNAce I get them quick. Keep stopping meds cause I get sick of it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 06:35:05	@ArsenicNAce hope so cause I have the least side effects from lam.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 05:56:52	@ArsenicNAce yeah a little. Came off lam and had mystery breakdown. Going back on slowly and it hasn't come back.,
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 05:52:29	@ArsenicNAce lam gives me insomnia. i take it all in the morning. im sure it'll give you more energy. its a good drug (cept for the rash).:)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 05:47:49	@ArsenicNAce my pdoc says 200 is a normal dosage. lam is best for bp depression anyways. it makes me hypomanic. maybe it'll give you a lift.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 05:46:49	@mgoodingartist lmao. i think i'd be the same. we are really cursed, ya know? lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 05:44:52	@ArsenicNAce cause of the extra meds, or that you might feel better?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 05:42:46	@ArsenicNAce yay! hope it helps. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 05:42:18	@mgoodingartist the jackpot here where I live is half a billion dollars exactly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 05:35:17	@Owl615 thanks. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 04:55:44	My last child turns 2 tomorrow. I feel like I should be sentimental that his baby years have passed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 04:54:23	Is there any treatment value in getting a secondary diagnosis of a personality disorder?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 04:53:51	@jonylogic yeah, my hair curls like crazy when its long, girls are jealous, but its so frizzy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 04:51:13	@jonylogic my hair changes more than my wife's. it was blonde once, and right before this pic, it was down to my butt.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 04:50:09	The lights in my eyes are gone. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 04:29:00	I'm pretty sure I'm not just bipolar. I really don't get along well with others. Someone I don't like said I was NPD. Anyone know abt this?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 04:22:35	@Owl615 is that a good wow or a disturbed wow? :) I think it suits me to a tee.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 03:17:35	@bipolarplusbaby hi to you too. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 03:12:20	@bipolarplusbaby @recoveryleeds @arsenicnace sorry things are so rough. It was a compliment. I like interesting characterizations. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 03:01:06	@bipolarplusbaby @recoveryleeds @ArsenicNAce broken brain? I hadn't seen that. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:52:56	@ArsenicNAce @recoveryleeds I wish u the best in that endeavor. Maybe u just need. A new one. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:52:11	@recoveryleeds @ArsenicNAce lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:49:05	@ArsenicNAce @recoveryleeds Viagra. It works for women too. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:43:09	@ArsenicNAce @recoveryleeds yeah you are really drugged up it sounds like. Really not surprised you are numb.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:36:54	@ArsenicNAce @recoveryleeds I am just on the lamictal I told.you about now. It doesn't affect me that way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:35:04	@ArsenicNAce @recoveryleeds now that I think about it, lithium made it noticeably less enjoyable for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:32:51	@ArsenicNAce @recoveryleeds does it just feel different or.you don't want it?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:31:38	@recoveryleeds @ArsenicNAce guys have different reactions. You might not notice and you are used to it now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:29:55	@ArsenicNAce @recoveryleeds most psych meds have sex side effects. At some level they must be acceptable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:25:45	@ArsenicNAce @recoveryleeds its different for girls as I understand it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:23:23	@ArsenicNAce @recoveryleeds completely? Not for me. Mental addiction here not just physical.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:17:02	@ArsenicNAce i am very comfortable with any talk. my mom numbed me by always talking about sex. disturbing too though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:13:31	@ArsenicNAce lol. all the time. get very fixated and don't want to do anything else. motorcycles for awhile, sex and gambling always. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:09:23	@ArsenicNAce manic just gets me angry because no one wants to go out all night or do anything spontaneous, which is all I want to do then.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 02:06:30	@ArsenicNAce do you find that as you get older that manic energy is not really "appreciated"?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 01:55:31	@ArsenicNAce not sure that is true anymore, but thanks anyways. I liked it better when my mania was euphoric and I was the fun person. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 01:07:29	@ArsenicNAce tell me about it. It seems like it never is easy, just some days we're tougher than others. :-) ur pretty tough I think.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 01:05:16	@Dodgingsuicide lol. Heard it compared to diabetes but never hemorrhoids. That is great!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 00:50:34	Fake it til you make it. It sounds silly but it has worked for me. #bipolar #bipolardisorder #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 00:49:10	@ArsenicNAce I don't know what it is but it helps me not to think about how long or hard just getting there eventually.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 00:44:26	@ArsenicNAce it is hard but if you have something to aim for it should help u focus. I ran out of hope which isn't good. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 00:43:17	Excessive optimism doesn't help. Facing and conquering reality makes us strong not empty words. #bipolardisorder #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 00:41:29	@ArsenicNAce I don't know about you but it seems like it will never end. To be honest I have no ideas how to make it better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 00:37:50	The pain doesn't just get better. We have to be proactive and work at it. #bipolar #depression #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 00:33:45	Im trying to be less whiny but the last year has been one of the worst in my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-29 00:31:12	Just plain dissatisfied but that is how I feel most of the time I suppose. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 09:38:34	@ArsenicNAce bath didn't help?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 08:13:05	So I can vent about stuff like this is why my wife doesn't know about this account.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 08:11:52	@DignityPeace yeah i am. just hate to be in a lose lose situation. thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 08:07:53	wife screaming at my son while he is having an anxiety attack. i try to calm her down and she yells at me for correcting her in front of him
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 08:03:55	I tried to calm everyone down and just got yelled at for my efforts.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 08:02:56	@bipolarbearnz at home with my family
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 08:00:48	everyone is yelling and crying. i want to get out of here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 07:31:05	2yo is just like his brothers in every way I wouldn't want. arggghhhh
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 06:53:13	I know its colloquial to call it a nervous breakdown, but that's basically what I had at the end of last year. Still not recovered. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 05:13:09	@Polarbear3127 I would think meds at your level would make that job difficult.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 04:31:37	@BipolarSanity not to say y'all are fake, but i think you know what i mean. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 04:30:54	I'm a lawyer and a Ph.D, but right now I want to work as a bartender again, so I can have conversations with real people. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 04:06:51	@Polarbear3127 I suppose it depends what you were trying to work as.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 00:37:47	@jonylogic very cool. The tkd is more traditional but low standards. The Am karate was tougher. My two older boys train as well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 00:30:01	@jonylogic that is very cool. My sons friend trains aikido. I like that old style. Took american karate for a few years. Not the same.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 00:25:29	@jonylogic me too. If my back is well enough I test for my black belt in tkd in 18 days. What style(s) you take?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 00:22:23	@jonylogic are you a swimmer? My time is slow cause my stroke needs work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 00:21:14	@Polarbear3127 it doesn't surprise me you feel numb at that dose. Does it help?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 00:13:22	@SarRAWR_x3 I've been there. The only thing I did was just "keep my head down" and try to weather the storm. Hope it gets better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 00:11:34	@Polarbear3127 I've been on that briefly. Not sure how you are conscious at that level. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 00:09:31	@SarRAWR_x3 exercise is. I take tkd, lift weights, and recently started swimming. Have lots of time since I quit work. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-28 00:08:27	@jonylogic thanks. I was doing that before I got hurt so im glad I could still do it. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 23:43:53	Back got cleared yesterday to swim. Just did half mile. Felt great. #happy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 23:42:24	@_chasingdragons side effects of all meds can suck. Depends how it works for each person. Hope u feel better. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 22:30:08	@_chasingdragons i don't think my wife gained weight on effexor, but she was a mess from the brain zaps. my stepsister was already fat.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 22:23:36	@_chasingdragons my wife got brain zaps. my stepsister gained a lot of weight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 11:57:39	Goodnight light and the red balloon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 11:57:15	@grapefruitxo @bipolarvoice @ArsenicNAce u 2. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 11:35:49	@grapefruitxo @ArsenicNAce @bipolarvoice thirded. Is that a word? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 11:34:47	@bipolarvoice thanks. Its appreciated.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 11:34:25	@ArsenicNAce *smile* tks. it feels very surreal in a way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 11:21:36	Very disconnected from the world. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 09:40:41	@SarRAWR_x3 if you don't want to be there, it won't help as much. you ever been in? it can be a nice break from all the pressure. good luck!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 09:22:52	@oceangirlholly @miss_gibson91 at least you get disability.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 09:20:46	@SarRAWR_x3 focus on relaxing and not thinking about it. its scary when at the hospital and your loved ones leave. you'll get through it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 09:07:44	@oceangirlholly @miss_gibson91 Yeah, I can see why you wouldn't be happy. You work now?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 09:02:42	@oceangirlholly @miss_gibson91 yeah, but did you like it? everyone i know in HR is very happy with their career.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:34:40	@StacyFears better to be a drunk idiot than just a plain ole idiot? :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:27:55	@Miss_Gibson91 goodnight, sleep tight. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:27:23	@Miss_Gibson91 you may need grad school to be a journalist, but your system is different than ours.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:25:45	@Miss_Gibson91 Human Resources. Its very broad, includes employee and labor relations, recruiting, payroll (yuck), and a lot more.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:22:11	@Miss_Gibson91 hmmm. ur tough. any interest in journalism? its a tough field, but not impossible. You could go into HR, that works w ppl.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:14:21	@Miss_Gibson91 journalism is definitely a.tough road. Advertising has some writing in it. What about nursing?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:06:06	@Miss_Gibson91 it is. Makes more money tho.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:05:40	@mgoodingartist @ArsenicNAce americans LOVE grits.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:04:59	@mgoodingartist @ArsenicNAce lots of places in the us are beautiful. Nyc is just dirty.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:02:48	@Miss_Gibson91 social work. Or if u r willing to goto grad school could be a twice or psych nurse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:00:59	@ArsenicNAce @mgoodingartist lol. I just saw the NYC ref as I scrolled by.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 08:00:00	@Miss_Gibson91 ur pretty good at helping ppl.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 07:58:53	@ArsenicNAce @mgoodingartist I lived there for most of my life. Not a very family friendly place, or even a friendly place.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 06:45:47	@mgoodingartist @ArsenicNAce discipline. Oh well. Not me. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 06:45:01	@ArsenicNAce @mgoodingartist you work in a liquor store tho. they can't like that. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 06:43:28	@mgoodingartist @ArsenicNAce as I said earlier I don't like pain so I am safe around sharps. Maybe not a gun or pills tho.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 06:40:32	@ArsenicNAce @mgoodingartist I want one but I am too unstable right now. My grandpa was a champion marksman.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 06:38:58	@mgoodingartist @ArsenicNAce I have a couple of fun swords. A few are even sharpened. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 06:37:10	@ArsenicNAce @mgoodingartist lol. I am really not as.crazy and f-d up as i sound lately. Do usual.stupid guy stuff.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 06:34:23	@ArsenicNAce @mgoodingartist lol. No. Wasn't real. Weighed as much as a real one though. They wouldn't give us real ones in hs. We asked.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 06:31:52	@mgoodingartist @ArsenicNAce I slept.with my drill rifle a few times when I was in junior ROTC in hs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 04:25:41	Chiro cleared my back for light exercise, but the elliptical hurt. Will try swimming tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 02:28:52	@ArsenicNAce you have to have some kind if hope to continue. And some ppl can find that inside whereas others can't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 02:27:08	@ArsenicNAce I think it would be easier to prevent suicide if on weren't judged so much for contemplating it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 02:26:27	@ArsenicNAce very hard to be truly that close to someone that they share so much.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 02:25:07	@ArsenicNAce I guess it just bugs me how ppl don't "understand" ppl taking their lives. Why should someone have to suffer?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 02:22:46	@ArsenicNAce goes to show u can never tell how much a person is suffering inside.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 02:20:30	@ArsenicNAce I am not judging u at all. Sorry if it came across that way.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 02:19:12	@ArsenicNAce I didn't say you did and didn't mean that. I am very libertarian and was just stating a general opinion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 02:17:33	@BipolarSanity @ArsenicNAce I meant a wrong choice. Anyways just my opinion.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 02:16:52	@ArsenicNAce are assisted suicide or mercy killings wrong? Suicide is just a step further. That said I have never truly been suicidal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 02:15:12	@ArsenicNAce maybe I shouldn't open this can of worms, but suicide is a choice. Its most often a weigh choice but not a sin ....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 01:16:59	@ArsenicNAce @mgoodingartist I am not counted out but EXPECTED to do it. High expectations lead to high failure.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 00:48:27	@ArsenicNAce @mgoodingartist not much for pain. Prolly be dead if I didn't mind it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 00:33:57	@BipolarSanity @ArsenicNAce if I may ask?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 00:31:39	@ArsenicNAce was that a self hurting thing or just a bad habit?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 00:26:42	@ArsenicNAce but just a little. Lol. That sounds painful. My pdoc suggested geodon but I said no. Saw something about a lawsuit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 00:17:12	@ArsenicNAce I suck the sides of my mouth til I get sores. Weird huh? Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-27 00:14:32	@ArsenicNAce ser knocked me.out b4. Lith worked perfect for awhile and then stopped. Plus had a bad side effect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:51:17	@_chasingdragons how come?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:50:42	@ArsenicNAce ir is good for depression. If I get too amped up I may try seroquel again or risperidal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:26:21	Cats are the best medicine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:25:37	I hate doing chores when I am manic. Can make myself only when I am down. Strange.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:24:54	@ArsenicNAce ill move to.only 100 next week. I am very anti meds and the lam tends me to hypomania.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:23:52	@TazMopula sorry I am so cranky. Ill try. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:21:51	off to the Chiro. he had better approve me for exercise again. way too much built up energy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:20:25	@ArsenicNAce @mgoodingartist I have pdoc too. my lamictal goes up next week, which means I'll prolly be more manic and more cycling. Argh :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:10:33	@ArsenicNAce @mgoodingartist That was me all weekend. Our pollen is bad too, but I don't need a trigger. My moods change at random.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:07:14	She smells like cat food and is attacking my feet, but it is still nice when my kitten crawls up on me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:03:36	@mgoodingartist @ArsenicNAce if you lived here in Georgia I would say its the pollen. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 23:02:54	@ArsenicNAce lmao. Yes we will. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 22:58:31	@ArsenicNAce thanks. :-) I am angry and spiritually tired today. Such a rollercoaster I am on.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 22:53:29	Its okay for.my depressed SIL to stay in bed but not okay for me to be upset anxious and mad. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 22:51:03	@TazMopula I do follow you. And u r offering empty positivity w that statement
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 22:48:53	How do u know it will get better? Really? Historically for me that hasn't been true. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 22:45:43	" @TipsyChick : #thatmoment you wake up and instantly realize it's gonna be a long day... #MondayHangover " got to get thru morn 1st.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 22:30:06	@MyBipolarBrain that is fantastic!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 22:29:38	@CarolineVGray I just meant that she was the central character.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 22:08:42	More of that shortness of breath feeling. Tell me why ... I don't like Mondays.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 22:07:34	@CarolineVGray except Lindsay, who was the star of the show. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 11:54:11	@essally yeah. I've been in a mixed state all weekend. Down but very agitated and irritable. As you said, 'happy' to be alone. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 11:35:19	What's right for me right now doesn't usually coincide with what is right for me. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 11:27:02	Goodnight kittens goodnight mittens
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 11:06:27	@ArsenicNAce almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 10:52:59	@ArsenicNAce all revved up w nowhere to go. Glad I could make you *blush* at least virtually. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 10:49:44	@ArsenicNAce lol. U r very cute then. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 10:18:09	It would be nice to feel sane even just a day a week, or even a day a month. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 10:17:04	Being home alone all day with the kids will be harder this week. Have too much energy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 08:12:26	@seaneen_molloy hi there. enjoy the whiskey! wish I could join you. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 08:10:09	@bipolarvoice its not anyone I am particularly close to this time at least. lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 08:05:47	@bipolarvoice ah but I am on FB. oops. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 08:03:08	I got what I asked for. At least the major #depression is gone. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 08:02:41	I cannot help pissing people off when I am like this. #bipolar #manic #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 07:58:29	The hunger is eating me up. Haven't found enough of an outlet yet. #bipolar #mania #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 03:13:00	@bipolarbearnz yes, but i can't think straight well enough to tell if i am being nice back to the other person. make any sense?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 03:06:17	Lonely, but still just want to be left alone. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 01:16:11	@_chasingdragons I am so sorry you are having such a difficult time. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 00:45:23	I want to go to Vegas. Even alone.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-26 00:44:17	@_chasingdragons yeah I can really really relate to that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 13:02:20	Anyone get supersensitive skin while on lamictal? I have checked and there is no rash.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 11:22:48	@bipolarvoice I wasn't depressed. They first thought I was bpd.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 11:19:58	@bipolarvoice mine said I was cyclothymic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 08:50:55	What a bad day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 07:29:47	@Miss_Gibson91 @bipolarvoice @wombatkx @youshouldsee it was tough though at times.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 07:29:13	@Miss_Gibson91 @bipolarvoice @wombatkx @youshouldsee its not the end of the world at all. I didn't take meds for 15 years. I lived.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 07:26:49	@Miss_Gibson91 @bipolarvoice @wombatkx @youshouldsee you should talk about it so that those who don't can help if you need it. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 07:21:25	@bipolarvoice thanks.:)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 07:14:39	@Slumballina yes well you and I are special. We are definitely not like other ppl. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 07:11:52	Don't want to be around people ... don't want to be alone .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 07:10:18	Angry ... Prolly at myself ... don't know what to do with myself so I stand still ... so much frustration inside.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 07:02:22	@BipolarPosts me too. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 06:45:11	I am hiding so I don't say or do something I will regret. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 06:30:26	We are not all special, cause if we were the word special wouldn't mean the same thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 06:18:02	I am taking my meds. So WHY?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 05:25:45	@SarRAWR_x3 ask her if you can join her. Lol. :-)

500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 04:38:55	What other disease makes its sufferers long for the symptoms to return. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 03:55:29	@bipolarbearnz yeah I'm alone now. a bit stir crazy though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 03:50:31	@bipolarbearnz lol. i am home. they are visiting us for the week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 03:48:02	@bipolarbearnz all day
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 03:44:10	@Polarbear3127 lol. it must be an interesting sight. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 03:28:49	@bipolarbearnz i am trying to get through a very frustrating and boring day. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 03:26:29	@bipolarbearnz they are uber xtian so we dont drink around them (or swear or listen to music).
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 03:26:02	@bipolarbearnz I was thinking i could sneak vodka, but they would notice if i was drunk. drinking wine would be obvious...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 03:03:26	if I start to drink now in the middle of the afternoon, will my in-laws notice?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 02:48:17	The frustration is building up inside. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 01:27:28	@Slumballina I seem to be having the same day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 01:14:52	If I can't go anywhere tonight I am going to drink. A lot.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 01:12:36	I really wish my cat would stop licking me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 01:12:18	I really shouldn't complain about not working when I quit my last job and am not looking for another.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 01:05:39	@Slumballina wow. What a week. I quit my job 3 months ago. I kinda want to buy a boat or go to a casino.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 00:56:36	I hate being hypomanic, wanting desperately to do something to improve my life, and sitting there with no way to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 00:51:13	I wouldn't mind someone telling me they know how to help and it was true. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 00:47:42	Being told it will get better REALLY doesn't help because the person saying it isn't psychic. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 00:46:43	Being told to look on the bright side doesn't help because the dark side is still there. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-25 00:38:49	Being told others have it worse doesn't make me feel better. It just means that I have further I could fall. #bipolardisorder #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 23:56:19	need.to.get.out. atlanta is sooooo boring. #mania #bp #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 22:03:25	Another day, another dollar. Oh wait, I am out of work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 11:47:06	Goodnight cow jumping over the moon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 11:32:04	@ArsenicNAce of course, your a mama. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 11:15:18	@ArsenicNAce glad you had such a nice visit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 08:02:11	@Miss_Gibson91 goodnight. Very nice chatting w you. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:51:32	@Miss_Gibson91 you will. The Meds aren't perfect at all. It'll peek through at times when you're not expecting it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:47:36	@Miss_Gibson91 I had short term memory problems on lithium. They actually gave me extended testing time cause of it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:46:44	@Miss_Gibson91 I miss the euphoria but as I get older I had it less and less anyway.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:44:15	@Miss_Gibson91 I think the meds do have an effect on mental ability.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:42:53	@Miss_Gibson91 i have a gift and I have a curse. the curse costs me jobs, friends, family, as well as personal misery. It wasn't so bad ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:40:01	@Miss_Gibson91 a little, i had developed some reasonable coping skills that are gone now, but it was always so much work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:38:59	@Miss_Gibson91 not to be arrogant, but I am extremely intelligent. but the bipolar does more than balance it out. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:32:48	@Miss_Gibson91 but since I have been on them, I am very aware of it. this last time i tried, I became suicidal for the first time ever.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:31:33	@Miss_Gibson91 I become completely ruled by my emotions and lose sight of any rationality. I never felt out of control before I started meds
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:30:22	@Miss_Gibson91 too bad ur so far! ;) I like getting in touch with the me that isn't drugged, but I quickly remember how "unfocused" I was.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:27:01	@Miss_Gibson91 that is it! tried coming off the meds to see if it might kickstart me. it didn't. I always say I need a partner in "crime".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:21:36	@Miss_Gibson91 I suspect that a lot of us have that in common. I am never particularly satisfied. I crave intense excitement.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:20:24	@Miss_Gibson91 math. it was so all consuming that I had few other interests. Now I am at a loss with what to do with myself. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:13:13	@Miss_Gibson91 to prepare for and get my Ph.D. I have it now, but it was always about the journey, not what I would do when I was done.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 07:04:04	I had a purpose for nearly 12 years, and now I have been without one since last June. It is a void in my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 06:30:39	My 2yo thinks I am a trampoline. My injured back is afraid.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 06:29:56	@Polarbear3127 it did. My wife just shrugged.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-24 05:33:17	While I was upstairs, my inlaws took my children and left without saying a work. Nice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 21:34:28	@PoopyPeanuts same here at least the last six months.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 21:04:58	@BipolarBlogger I had that w abilify. Its hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 21:02:24	@BipolarBlogger lol. I don't know how you can stay awake on that drug. Its seroquel right? That knocks me cold.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 20:57:57	Had so many good tweet ideas last night but didn't want to wake the wife. Can't remember any now. LOL
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 20:55:53	Little sleep cause I was hyped up last night but where is all that energy now when I have work to do?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 20:53:53	@BipolarBlogger I was so tired last night then I woke up a few hours later all hyped up and was awake for hours! Bleh. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 20:51:33	@PoopyPeanuts I don't know about you but as I get older it has maze me find myself very annoying. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 20:48:21	I don't shut up when I am manic but am terribly shy when I am depressed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 20:47:11	Either in a mixed state or rapid cycling. Its exhausting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 10:07:16	Goodnight moon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 08:17:59	Can't do it. Or maybe won't do it. Don't care. Don't matter. No difference. sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 08:11:13	Pick a curse work ... that is how I feel.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 04:54:51	@Polarbear3127 then I must be switching directions because I have lost the urge.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 04:40:02	@Miss_Gibson91 I might be wrong. That is just what I recall from when I was on it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 04:32:10	@Miss_Gibson91 yes. Pretty sure that is a common side effect. Hope ur enjoying ur trip.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 03:57:20	Not ready to make life decisions. Thought I was burning always rush things. Need to take more time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-23 01:54:39	Why do very smart people pretend to be ignorant. It really doesnt enhance your credibility.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 23:47:58	@SarRAWR_x3 I've seen how hard you've had it the last few days. I have felt sad for you. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 23:43:57	I hated being in a psych ward before. But right now it would be a relief.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 23:25:16	My law career is in a coma and the prognosis is pretty bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 22:08:58	Sitting like this all day is not good for my back. On a positive note my mood is fine. Not #depressed or #manic .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 20:59:22	Good morning. Up bright and early to.sit it professional seminars all day. Boring.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 18:24:12	@earthatmilkyway thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 10:40:00	Goodnight nobody goodnight mush
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 08:42:57	Don't need it but it would taste so good. I miss it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 08:40:00	Just found a whole other bottle of xanax I didn't know I had.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 08:17:22	@ArsenicNAce you work in a bar? I used to be a bartender a long time ago.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 06:26:46	I am selfish and don't care if anyone doesn't like it. No one else is taking care of me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 02:02:27	@Polarbear3127 I am pretty sure I had months of mania when I was younger but I couldn't tell you my symptoms then now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 02:01:38	@Polarbear3127 psychosis has not really been an issue. Only very minor episodes like blackouts during fits of rage when younger...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 01:34:33	How do you know if u r bp 1 or 2? Is a single manic ep (1wk or.longer) enough? Is gambling with little sleep manic behavior?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 01:32:48	And it seems that everything is a disorder. On the bright side id everyone has some form of #mentalillness there is less #stigma
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 01:31:06	Pdocs make things so complicated. There are so many "disorders" that are just abnormal compulsions. But each is considered distinct.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 01:27:01	If I don't find a good job, I wont work. That is fine. But how do I spend my days is gonna be hard.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 00:29:38	Anyone know if Lamictal can affect your equilibrium?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-22 00:25:25	Lamictal up incrementally. Starting to feel better. I have my work cut out for me to put my life back together. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 22:33:31	Good midnight everyone. Was I tired last night.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 09:49:32	@bipolarnotcrazy it sure is!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 08:50:13	@bipolarvoice @garbosmc good luck. It sounds ideal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 08:49:32	@bipolarvoice @garbosmc I have a very part time job that could turn into what you have but I work at home and am very lonely.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 08:47:52	@garbosmc I work best with a flexible schedule but I really need human contact.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 08:15:59	Being busy and being around people makes me feel a lot better. I really need a full time job. Been fired too many times. Sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 07:18:20	Thank you to my followers for being there for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 06:37:49	Look towards the future without coloring it by the past.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 06:36:55	I may be laid up with my back, but on the bright side I have dropped some of the weight I gained on lithium.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 06:34:22	@SaltySmile I know its not much but I like your new pic alot. You look very pretty.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 05:46:22	Turns out I sprained my back. Didn't know you could do that. Oh boy. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 03:24:14	Chiro not chirp
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 03:23:57	At the chirp getting elec stimulate treatment. Feels very nice.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 02:56:39	@oceangirlholly the one good thing about depression is that I get a LOT more sleep than when I am manic.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 02:55:22	@oceangirlholly lol. Be my guest. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 01:21:41	@ArsenicNAce lol. Yeah. But I am feeling a little better since I came on twitter. Just hoping I can figure some way back on track. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 01:06:58	@ArsenicNAce thanks. :-) Hope u feel better. Ive seen how rough its been for u.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 00:41:03	@bipolarvoice I am way past denial but mired in a mix of pain, anger, and depression. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 00:35:35	@Polarbear3127 all the time. My kids are suffering for it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 00:35:05	My past is screwing up my future. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 00:34:14	I don't care what you call me, just treat me with respect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-21 00:33:33	I waste my days. I waste my nights. I waste my weekends. I waste my life. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 23:25:51	I am home alone. Wow. NO KIDS. Have no idea what to do with myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 23:24:21	@ArsenicNAce try not to break your hand.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 21:44:40	@garbosmc oh I agree totally with you on that. i was given klonopin for sleep and got addicted to it. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 21:25:42	@garbosmc @puddyuss Are You Bipolar? http:// nymag.com/nymetro/health /features/n_9986/ …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 21:24:42	@garbosmc @puddyuss are the rage of the last 10 years. it said some believe there is a causal link.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 21:24:12	@garbosmc @puddyuss I saw an article that suggests that pointed out that antidepressants were the rage of the 90s while bipolar diagnoses...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 21:06:22	Good morning. Didn't get enough sleep, but maybe I can back on a better sleep schedule now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 21:05:50	@bipolarbearnz interesting thanks! I will look into it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 11:11:24	Goodnight Kristin, wherever you are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 11:05:31	@natasha_tracy I can only go from my experience, and I have been a significant disruption to the workplace, although my work was stellar.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 10:17:49	Happens to me every night. RT @laurenelicker97 : I'd say goodnight but I know in 5 seconds I'll be back on here anyways
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 10:15:45	I always get accuses of being selfish like its a bad thing. Its not like anyone else is looking out for or taking care of me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 10:10:53	Feeling very frustrated with everything. Sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 10:09:49	@bipolarclub just don't always expect the same courtesy in return. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 10:07:05	@natasha_tracy a person with seizures isn't going to argue w all coworkers. I think its the applicants stability that is more in question.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 10:04:54	@natasha_tracy not sure it's credibility. I have bp and I know the workplace issues I have caused. Its about risks ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 09:39:55	Are You Bipolar? http:// nymag.com/nymetro/health /features/n_9986/ …
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 08:39:41	@Polarbear3127 grammar enthusiasts that is. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 08:33:25	@Polarbear3127 lol I know so many ppl like that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 08:06:47	@Polarbear3127 yes. And I am a very careless typer.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 08:05:55	@oceangirlholly I should just retweet u without your @, since these all describe me. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:57:21	@oceangirlholly yeah I am very similar.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:56:06	@JessebelleWho thank you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:55:45	@Polarbear3127 lol. My phone.does that too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:55:07	@oceangirlholly pretty much how I feel.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:48:09	@bipolarbearnz math
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:43:21	@Polarbear3127 agreed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:42:40	@Polarbear3127 im so.sorry to hear that. Ive lost jobs friends. Almost my wife.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:41:54	@Polarbear3127 wow. That can be dangerous. Hope you don't have too many consequences.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:40:39	@Polarbear3127 oh I just "haunt" myself. I am very good at it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:39:31	@bipolarbearnz it an idea worth looking into. Need real counseling sometime. Its eating me up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:38:21	I am so much happier when I am manic, but I have so much less patience. Lack of.patients causes anxiety. Lousy cycle. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:36:50	Sometimes a diagnosis gives hope and other times it squashes it. Mine did both. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:35:10	@bipolarbearnz i want and need too, badly, but im staying home w my 2yo so it isn't feasible now unfortunately.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:33:33	@earthatmilkyway thank you so much. Its well appreciated.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:31:23	@bipolarbearnz but I do need to spend less time dwelling. Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:30:40	@bipolarbearnz don't blame anyone. Just not thrilled that I have an incurable sickness that causes me so much suffering. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:29:16	@DailyBipolar I like dark and sad music when I am like this. As you said, comforting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 07:27:06	Dark thoughts are not invading my mind. I invited them in. #bipolar #bipolardisorder

500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 00:45:25	@Slumballina i taught math for a semester to a bunch of college kids who shouldn't have graduated high school. very frustrating.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 00:33:58	@Slumballina me too, except being a TA while doing my phd. I suppose though that there wasnt a lot of work as a TA, so it was easy enough.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 00:20:54	@Polarbear3127 thanks!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 00:20:20	@Slumballina yup. I need a job that has distinct achievements.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 00:05:52	@Slumballina that is exactly what happened to me. been a mess since i graduated last year.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-20 00:05:28	@Polarbear3127 math
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 23:56:37	I need to go back to school. Its the only place where I am happy. Fat chance though, already have a phd. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 23:39:51	@ItsJackOk yw. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 23:35:30	I believe in realism over positivity. I don't sugarcoat my life. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 21:53:58	Good morning. Lotsa crazy dreams. Still tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:55:29	@SarRAWR_x3 its.nice for me too. Thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:52:43	Its always nice to talk w ppl you have something in common with. Thanks. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:49:21	Goodnight noises everywhere.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:48:59	@SarRAWR_x3 I really gotta try to sleep. It was great chatting w you. Talk w you soon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:43:40	@SarRAWR_x3 lol. I hit ppl for laughing while standing near me. Sigh. Kids aren't thought able to be bipolar either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:38:05	@SarRAWR_x3 being an adult should give you a little more responsibility for your own care hopefully.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:36:19	@DailyBipolar thank you so much! I was happy w myself to have come up w it. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:33:54	@SarRAWR_x3 I was never good at getting anyone to understand me, so I get your frustration.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:31:46	@SarRAWR_x3 can u switch pdoc?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:30:19	@SarRAWR_x3 irritability is a symptom of hypomania or mania. I am sorry you are having such a hard time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:28:05	@SarRAWR_x3 pdocs rarely understand they just manage w drugs it seems. It can be hard to find a good one I guess.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:25:34	@SarRAWR_x3 imo she is useless. Try using words other than anger. Mh professionals don't believe in anger I've found.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:21:56	@SarRAWR_x3 pls ignore my typos. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:21:25	@SarRAWR_x3 ugh. That is awful. These meds are so unpredictable. Its such a guessing game. If I were you id call me pdoc soon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:12:21	@SarRAWR_x3 I have a poor history w Meds myself so i empathize. I don't expect much from them but I was suicidal so I needed to go back on
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 12:05:49	@SarRAWR_x3 you are more depressed on lam? Wow. Any life issues that it could be? That is too bad. Lam is a good drug mostly.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:56:31	@SarRAWR_x3 is a lot of rapid thinking, anxiety, agitation, and anger. Lam is supposed to be best 4 bp depression but ppl react diff.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:54:53	@SarRAWR_x3 my pdoc doesn't know why but last time I was on lam I got hypomanic, I think manic though. Manic for me ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:51:43	@SarRAWR_x3 what are you on if I may ask? I am on lamictal now but dose is too low.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:45:56	@oceangirlholly thanks for telling me. No one ever understands what I mean when I tell them that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:44:59	@SarRAWR_x3 did this happen to you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:44:19	@SarRAWR_x3 don't think so. I've had a few that made me extremely anxious and agitated. Ritalin did set me off a bit though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:36:20	@oceangirlholly you said it. I always feel like such a spectator. and it always happens without any trigger too. Sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:34:38	No im not like the weather but I will kill you when I am feeling up to it. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:33:26	If you patronize me I will be perfectly happy to remain in my non medicated state. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:32:09	Make that NO side effects.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:30:58	Give me happiness or give me a reasonable non drowsy non addictive low side effect substitute in convenient pill form. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:27:51	I think I may be back to bicycling again. #bipolar rapid cycling.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:03:29	"@MyNocturnalSoul: Never change who you are because someone doesn't like it..." hell yeah.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 11:02:15	Monday is closing in. Oh boy oh boy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 09:21:23	Feeling drained like the life is being slowly sucked out of me. #mania next stop #depression going down. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 08:59:18	@Shawnie_0405 lol. yeah advise ppl how to be like me. oh boy. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 05:48:52	The truth is ... I don't know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 05:30:15	Back sore again today. Feel kinda nauseous. Bleh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 04:28:42	@oceangirlholly aggravating isn't it. I keep thinking "all dressed up and no place to go."
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 04:23:53	Wasting away another day wishing I was doing something more. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 01:32:00	@BipolarTweets just taking care of my kids. Im not really that good at it though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 00:17:44	oh yeah, good morning everyone! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-19 00:17:19	Need to find a purpose in life other than the one I currently have. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 11:34:32	@Miss_Gibson91 I hope you'll love it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 11:28:10	@Miss_Gibson91 its like talking to religious zealots. Ignore them and go have a great holiday. We'll "see" u in 2 weeks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 10:06:06	@ArsenicNAce hang in there. Im pulling for you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 09:14:23	@ArsenicNAce sending you a virtual shrimp and a big smile from me. Gotta go eat. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 09:09:37	@ArsenicNAce not long enough to reach the shrimp. ;)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 09:00:30	@ArsenicNAce yes I do. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 08:56:09	@ArsenicNAce fresh not frozen large Georgia shrimp. Your mouth should be watering by now. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 08:53:56	@ArsenicNAce yup. Live across the street from whole foods.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 08:48:24	@ArsenicNAce thanks. Splurged and bought some shrimp. So I will. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 08:37:28	@ArsenicNAce keep smilin'
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 08:27:20	@ArsenicNAce I knew you could do it. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 08:18:28	@Shawnie_0405 very glad to hear it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 08:11:50	Prolly not prompt. Autocorrect issue.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 08:11:09	Can't sit still. Yay. Lol. Realistically im prompt in more of a mixed state but ill take over being so down as i was. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 08:08:39	@Miss_Gibson91 use a pill.box with days of the week ans morning evening if necessary.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:56:05	@ArsenicNAce at least you have the wine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:44:01	@ArsenicNAce food is good. I love food. Red wine goes very good.with steak. Okay my mind is getting distracted. Sry. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:42:04	@Miss_Gibson91 I might have to. The kids will love it. Little chance of anyone but the 2yo going topless. Lol.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:38:46	At home for St. Pattys day, but have loads of energy right now. All revved up with no place to go. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:36:52	@ArsenicNAce lol. Just that you sounded like you were having that third glass.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:33:33	@ArsenicNAce lmao. Need more wine for that huh? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:32:45	@ArsenicNAce sounds like you aren't leaning towards water.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:31:44	@ArsenicNAce toasty? Is that like hot and toasted? Lol.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:23:25	@ArsenicNAce sounds like it should be a fun pill, but i would guess reality is never as good as advertised. now you got me thinking wine.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:15:10	@ArsenicNAce don't know that drug. enjoy the wine, no matter how much or little of it you choose to enjoy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:09:13	@ArsenicNAce i was like that w klonopin, actually became physically addicted. wine makes me sleep, at least if i drink the whole bottle.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:06:55	@ArsenicNAce then don't take the ambien tonight.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 06:04:16	@ArsenicNAce wish I were there. tipsy that is. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:33:21	@ArsenicNAce and yet it must be hard to "get better" dealing with that. I can't fix mine but I try not to be like that with my kids.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:28:59	@ArsenicNAce been there. They say they are free pf guilt because it is a medical problem. They conveniently ignore the environment part.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:26:56	@ArsenicNAce I guess that is why we are different. I never got it, which doesn't help me but so be it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:25:05	@ArsenicNAce lol. are yours clearly mentally ill but claim that all the problems stem from your "issues"? Hate those words.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:23:33	@ArsenicNAce but I think most ppl are flakes. For me I always want more than they do.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:22:50	@ArsenicNAce there is always something interesting about a.passionate person which you seem to be. Other ppl are drawn to it ....
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:21:14	@ArsenicNAce it isn't worth it. I have few friends but only those who treat me well. Lonely but easier.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:20:03	@ArsenicNAce I understand that. My 'rents have as much as said that. But they aren't easy either. They need me to validate them. ..
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:16:21	@ArsenicNAce that is a tough mix it seems but I get it. Im a loner as well. I mostly want others to want to be around me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:10:05	@Shawnie_0405 very nice. Good day then.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:08:38	@jonylogic @ArsenicNAce lol. Im a guy but I've been told I can certainly be the male equivalent.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 05:04:25	@Miss_Gibson91 when do you leave. Sounded like you were going today. Have a great trip.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 04:55:58	@FishArmy NE is a tough place for ppl from other places. Thy are not always friendly. Wish u better luck in MN.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 04:48:31	@ArsenicNAce I hate being alone. Of course being around certain ppl is often worse. From the tweets I've seen, you sound better. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 04:40:10	@ArsenicNAce yeah. Back is better so I can get back to the gym and tkd. Thanks. How are you?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 04:37:45	@ArsenicNAce always.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 03:09:49	@earthatmilkyway :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 02:56:12	@earthatmilkyway you are cute and sweet. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 02:52:06	@earthatmilkyway lol. When I was younger I could just will it, at least temporarily. Now its not so easy. Still trying.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 02:45:54	@earthatmilkyway yes a very big relief. <<smile>>
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 02:42:38	@earthatmilkyway mixed is tiring for me but not terrible. I get in the least trouble this way. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 02:31:40	@earthatmilkyway trying hard to be manic not depressed. Sort of.in the middle right now. How're you? Your posts seen a little better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 02:28:28	The manic me says where is the party, looks around at my life and says I'm outta here. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 02:13:45	I'm stuck. I can't move forward cause I am afraid to act. I am afraid to act cause I am afraid to make things worse than they are.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 01:26:09	You are the only friend that you will have for your entire life. Treasure that friendship.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 01:04:02	Starting to "tell stories" to myself again. Sign of #mania . #bipolar #bipolardisorder . #anxiety
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-18 01:03:14	Went to tkd class. Back held up but is sore. Mood mostly okay today.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-17 22:14:33	pretty sure I am in a mixed state, but they are sort of cancelling each other out at the moment. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-17 11:32:38	Goodnight kittens goodnight mittens.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-17 08:06:07	@Polarbear3127 wow I sure hope so. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-17 07:57:53	@Polarbear3127 that stuff knocked me cold. I would say you didn't. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-17 05:33:21	Wow am I in a bad mood. I don't usually curse in front of my children.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-17 04:52:32	I feel the #mania rising but I have nowhere to go. It is all bottled up inside me and ripping me apart. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-17 04:12:17	My kids didn't get off at their bus stop. This is a fun day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-17 03:08:17	That car ride w the cats was a nightmare.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 20:49:53	Good morning everyone! Back feeling better, gonna try the gym. Also, bringing the cats back for post-op checkup. Busy day is a good day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 11:59:11	Goodnight cow jumping over the moon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 11:58:32	As things stand lately, this was a pretty good day. Now let's carry it through the weekend.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 10:39:59	@bipolarclub sorry to hear you have to deal with this. Most ppl here are so nice but some are not.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 10:16:25	@Miss_Gibson91 I hope you enjoy the book.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 10:15:46	@Miss_Gibson91 the narrator is important. The best audiobooks I ever heard are the green mile, harry potter, and enders game.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 10:13:14	@Miss_Gibson91 if you have a good one, its like an audio play. Some have full casts even.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 10:10:44	My life is so boring, so what good would manic energy do? #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 10:08:36	Needing something for #mania to grab whole of so I don't stay #depressed . #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 05:50:22	Massive T-storm. Cats and kids all scared. Not going to that mtg looks like.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 04:57:49	@Slumballina that still.seems like fun. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 04:47:45	Think I am going to try a local #bipolar support group tonight. Anyone been to one? What are they like?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 02:52:42	YAY I was able to work out on the wavemaster without back pain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 02:30:19	@Slumballina its an awful balance it seems. I try to do that myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 02:00:59	@Slumballina is that the same as seroquel? I took that for 2 days. Couldn't function I was so drugged.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 01:20:13	@earthatmilkyway pretty good right now. At the park with my 2yo and its a very nice day. Feels good to be out of the house.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 01:17:54	Sun is very hot when you are wearing black.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 01:09:23	@earthatmilkyway I cry only half heartedly 2 or 3 times a year. Maybe.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 00:56:11	@Shawnie_0405 nope I live in the beautiful south!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 00:55:42	@earthatmilkyway it'd easier to cry for girls. Its not pitiful at all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 00:54:37	@Slumballina sorry to hear that. I am trying hard to harness the power of the sun. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-16 00:03:40	Wow it is such an incredibly beautiful day! #happy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 23:55:33	@earthatmilkyway I relate. I don't cry. Will force myself sometime though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 23:49:37	That noise is me slapping myself and saying "snap out of it." #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 23:48:11	I would really like to be excited and interested in SOMETHING. But alas I am interested in nothing. #depression #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 23:24:47	@Shawnie_0405 would be good, except I have my 2 y.o. who isn't very quiet. I was thinking the bookstore though. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 23:17:27	Good morning! Still can't go to the gym until next week, but I am going to leave the house. Just gotta figure out where! :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 12:14:30	@ArsenicNAce thanks. You've really been helpful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 12:10:02	@Shawnie_0405 I get quite anxious talking to strangers sometimes. Small talk doesn't always hold my interest. But Ill try the 7 things idea.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:49:37	Goodnight light and the red balloon.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:49:06	Happy Pi day everyone. I never remember it until its done. Oh well.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:46:10	@Shawnie_0405 being sociable helps when I cam do it. Heck even this small chat helps.:-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:44:38	@Shawnie_0405 yeah. Being a stay at home dad right now is hard. And I am not good at small talk, so it's hard. But you are very right
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:42:57	@Shawnie_0405 sublingual b? That is a new one to me. Thanks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:40:02	@ArsenicNAce I fully agree.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:30:29	@ArsenicNAce you are a strong woman. That is great. I need to get such determination back.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:26:15	@Shawnie_0405 I need such conviction right now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:25:36	@Shawnie_0405 cheering myself up doesn't work well now unfortunately. any ideas how to get me to switch to mania? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:24:17	@ArsenicNAce that does suck. Hard to get better mentally of you hurt physically.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:18:59	@ArsenicNAce my wife had knee problems in her 20s bug not chronic. Do you take Meds for that too?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:09:52	@ArsenicNAce medical apart from psych? I can't imagine how hard that must be.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:06:21	@ArsenicNAce back in for 3 weeks. Only at 50mg. Lith worked great for awhile then didn't. Side effects can be tough huh?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 11:00:27	@ArsenicNAce trying lamictal for the 4th time. Hate Meds. Hate side effects, but really need them now. You take anything?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 10:53:54	@ArsenicNAce never sure. I am trying to be patient w the Meds but that isn't something I have a lot of.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 10:36:23	This is all so pointless and meaningless. And I actually feel okay right now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 09:02:18	I used to be able to force my own mood changes. Can't remember how. Any suggestions? #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 08:41:09	I'd like to stop thinking about killing myself and be back to thinking about buying things I can't afford, like a boat. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 06:33:57	@bipolarturtle lousy. But thanks for the concern.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 06:06:54	@Miss_Gibson91 don't. Distract yourself and plan what you will be doing in 5 years.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 05:38:19	Was able to stretch out my back. It helped. Would be nice if I could stretch out my mind/emotions. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 04:36:30	@cackiesmum yes.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 02:17:22	Need to be patient until I can ramp up to full dose of lam then look for and find a full time job. Patience not my virtue. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-15 01:03:38	why do I bother. oh wait, I don't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 23:44:46	Not sure if it's #anxiety or #depression but the thought of being awake is painful.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 23:43:33	@earthatmilkyway thank you. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 23:27:55	Not gonna happen. Can't breathe again. #depression #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 23:03:55	Good morning. Will try to make this a better day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 12:37:53	@bipolarturtle thanks. I hope so.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 12:36:35	@garbosmc every 10 min or so I turn on my phone and read tweets. Does that count? :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 12:00:42	I am so thankful for my followers and how nice and helpful they are. I am so bad w ppl so its nice. Hope I don't screw it up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 11:58:57	Cant sleep. Feeling sorry for myself as usual. #depressed #bipolar #anxiety
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 11:52:27	@ArsenicNAce my wife plays the blame game. So hard to work things out. My dad always said it takes 2 to fight and both are to blame.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 11:31:43	Goodnight bears goodnight chairs
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 11:30:23	Here's to a better mood and thus a better today tomorrow. #bipplar #bipolardisorder #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 07:31:43	@BipolarPosts are you any good as a bartender. Jk :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 07:04:10	@ArsenicNAce that isn't helpful. He isn't accepting your diagnoses.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 07:02:41	@_chasingdragons curse of #mentalillness that so many will desert us. I try to take care of myself first and not worry about others.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 06:09:02	@robjamil thanks for the chat. It really did help. Gotta go now. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 06:08:22	@robjamil that is great you found something you love. I loved being a ph.d student but that is done. Having a hard time adjusting.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 06:07:16	@robjamil I never stay in a job long enough. I quit or get myself fired. I am more trouble than anything.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 06:05:54	@robjamil gotta be smart and not rush back and get hurt worse.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 06:05:24	@robjamil its my low back so yes. Been a week prompt at least another. All I think about, when my mind isn't empty, is getting back.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 06:02:51	@robjamil normally I swim, lift, and take tkd, working out about 7 to 8 times a week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 06:01:59	@robjamil I am but I find that I can't go enough to satisfy. And right now I am injured. Bad times. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 05:59:54	@robjamil not really. I sabotaged my legal career badly and now I have a ph.d and screwed that up even quicker.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 05:58:42	@robjamil more accurately I can hold a job but not for very long.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 05:57:53	I am an addict with a floating addiction. What I am addicted to keeps changing. Right now I am looking for my next one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 05:53:26	@robjamil thanks for the suggestions. Usual stuff don't work anymore. Can't hold a job so life seems very pointless now.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 05:47:07	I want something to look forward to but haven't been able to.come up with anything.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 05:45:49	Don't really have anything I am looking forward to. Never felt.this bored, blah, empty before. True even on my better mood days. #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 04:00:33	@Miss_Gibson91 does that mean she preferred the tattoo. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 02:57:19	Thinking about the future is what makes living in the present so much harder. #bipolar #bipolardisorder #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 02:55:05	@bipolar2gurl the guy is a moron who.just likes to insult ppl. Look at his tweet history. Complete idiot. To hell w him.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 01:05:33	When I was younger and depressed, I knew what I wanted and was missing. Problem is now I don't want anything.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 01:04:26	I've ALWAYS been #bipolar but I haven't always been unhappy. I've just lost sight of how to be happy.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 00:25:17	@ArsenicNAce I do appreciate it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 00:24:47	@Shawnie_0405 that does work, but I am so sick of tv. Thanks for the *hug*.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-14 00:23:22	@ArsenicNAce tks. Been trying for years to find something new. Very frustrating.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 23:44:28	This just never ends. I gave up a long time ago. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 23:43:30	Just remembered that even if the meds stabilize my moods, my life still will suck. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 22:56:46	World is weighing me down this morning, hard to breathe. #bipolar #bipolardisorder #depression #mentalhealth
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 11:28:26	@Scarlett_Raee its gross you wouldn't want to do that. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 11:24:19	@ArsenicNAce huh? Is that your daughter?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 11:21:04	@ArsenicNAce what kind and will it give enough relief and satisfaction to be worth it. I love trouble but it doesn't do me any good anymore.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 11:17:27	@ArsenicNAce yeah well .... lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 11:09:31	@ArsenicNAce if you figure out how to relax when you feel that way let me know. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 11:08:14	@bipolarclub nite nite :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 11:07:33	@ArsenicNAce and we feel this sht more than others. Stay strong. Don't let it beat you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 10:13:10	@Miss_Gibson91 10 pm. We just moved up an hour to daylight savings time.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 10:12:09	#positives back healing and I am thinking about thinking about what to do to start improving my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 10:07:41	@Miss_Gibson91 not too bad thought it might be 5 or 6 am
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 10:02:27	@Miss_Gibson91 what time is it that you are still up?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 09:33:52	@Shawnie_0405 this is the longest offseason I can remember. ;( I am happy for you though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 09:11:12	@Miss_Gibson91 you are very welcome.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 09:06:59	@Miss_Gibson91 pure arrogance not smart living. For all your struggles your effort to be smart impresses me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:59:07	@Miss_Gibson91 I didn't see pdocs much. Didn't trust them. I did relatively well all things considered, but still f-d a lot up.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:57:21	@Miss_Gibson91 they see it right they see it well but they think it saves us from our hell - sanitarium by Metallica
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:51:18	@Miss_Gibson91 you were completely untreated until 18? Worst years for that. Im so sorry.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:50:11	@Miss_Gibson91 here they throw pills at any misbehavior nowadays.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:49:42	@Miss_Gibson91 bipolar is not thought to start til teenage. But they will medicate where appropriate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:48:30	@Miss_Gibson91 I spent 9 mos in hospital at 18 w only cyclothymia diagnosis. Took 20 years til they said bipolar.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:46:01	@Miss_Gibson91 I was on antipsychotics when I was 6. My son started risperadol at 9.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:44:01	@Miss_Gibson91 and you will do the same for yours. I wasn't capable of trying as hard as you are when I was your age.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:42:03	@Miss_Gibson91 its tough but at least you are prepared. I didn't have a diagnosis back then, so I just hoped they'd be "good".
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:40:51	@Miss_Gibson91 that we do. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:39:18	@Miss_Gibson91 I should also say that my oldest got treated early and is a far better kid than I ever was.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:38:35	@Miss_Gibson91 the odds are really not that bad, and environment plays a role too.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:37:32	@Miss_Gibson91 really. I feel so sick and selfish for having them. To be fair, my wife has psych issues too so it was more likely.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 08:25:49	@Miss_Gibson91 I said that for years but probably 2 of my 3 boys are #bipolar .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 07:00:08	@Shawnie_0405 wow im jealous. Other than taking kids to dentist, I watched tv and laid in bed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 06:57:59	@Shawnie_0405 I only screamed at people I knew. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 06:43:01	Anyone else find the euphoric highs replaced by irritability and anxiety as they got older? #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 04:18:23	If I am more than my #bipolardisorder , much of it isn't any better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 04:16:54	@Miss_Gibson91 a lot of us here would, but I understand what you mean and can relate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 04:15:28	I feel trapped. Right now by my body but always by my life. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 04:12:56	When I am angry I don't say things I don't mean. I say things I mean but wouldn't otherwise say.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 04:10:50	Inspirational and motivational sayings rarely help me. If I COULD me inspired I would gladly do it myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 04:06:56	I am so healthy ans rational in so many ways -- except the ones that count. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 02:17:42	How pathetic am I when I have no idea what to do with myself as I am completely and utterly sick of tv? #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-13 02:13:30	Bored. Somewhat sad. Very very blah.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:46:24	Forgot to eat and now its noon. As my wife says, a very special kind of stoopid. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:41:59	@oceangirlholly @Miss_Gibson91 I meant concerta not concerts. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:41:15	@oceangirlholly TYVM for sharing w me. I may suffer w #bipolar but I am lucky my wife has a good job and good coverage and stays w me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:39:35	@oceangirlholly @Miss_Gibson91 at least for me it didn't work anyway. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:38:02	@oceangirlholly @Miss_Gibson91 I couldn't try abilify at first because of the cost. And my son wasn't slowed concerts st first either.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:36:48	@Miss_Gibson91 can anyone use nhs or do you have to be under a certain income level?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:35:17	@oceangirlholly @Miss_Gibson91 we have an hsa. The drugs eat up the very high deductible very quickly for us.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:32:29	@Miss_Gibson91 TYVM for telling me all this. I had no idea.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:31:08	@oceangirlholly @Miss_Gibson91 how is the drug coverage?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:28:40	@oceangirlholly @Miss_Gibson91 serious mental health issues are really not taken seriously enough.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:25:35	@oceangirlholly @Miss_Gibson91 how is the mental health coverage?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:23:47	@Miss_Gibson91 it is, but three of us use psych treatment so it pays for itself really.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:22:20	@Miss_Gibson91 I hated being locked up, but mine was a good place and I actually have some good memories.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:20:52	@Miss_Gibson91 I can't imagine those are very comfortable.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:20:10	@Miss_Gibson91 we probably pay seven or eight hundred dollars a month for insurance, but then we pay almost nothing extra.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:18:37	@Miss_Gibson91 yes very good depending on what you can afford. I have 3 kids so we make good insurance a priority.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:16:11	@Miss_Gibson91 is health insurance available over there?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:15:25	@Miss_Gibson91 that is a crazy.amount. I.was hospitalized as a teen for 9 months and our insurance paid it all.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:14:47	@Miss_Gibson91 but they don't pay much so the beast docs don't take it. Not sure what the mental health coverage is.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:13:38	@Miss_Gibson91 we have a Medicaid system that is basically govt insurance paying private docs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:12:08	@Miss_Gibson91 I guess its like I tell my kids you take what you get and you don't pitch a fit. Still I don't like it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:09:57	@Miss_Gibson91 do you have insurance for that, or is it out of pocket? With my insurance I pay $6/visit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:08:13	@Miss_Gibson91 that is awful that they can refuse treatment. A regular md couldn't do that? Or could they in the UK?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:06:43	@Miss_Gibson91 wow. Are you allowed input on medication? Do they force ppl.to stay on something with bad side effects?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:04:12	@Miss_Gibson91 let them push around like they try to.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 23:03:50	@Miss_Gibson91 you can't ask for a new one? That is awful. And everyone here wants your system. I still think that one shouldnt
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 22:58:50	Remember that ur pdoc works for YOU! They are NOT an authority figure. If they aren't helping, find another.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 22:51:16	Back is taking much longer to heal than expected. Having to use the dreaded tv babysitter for 2yo.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 21:30:12	I.don't know about anyone else, but MY past did not make me a better stronger person. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 21:25:50	My 2 year old is hugging strange girls at the dentist's office.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 20:30:17	Morning world. Sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 20:29:04	@garbosmc yeah something to distract you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 12:14:11	We couldn't all be cowboys, some of us are clowns ... goodnight Elisabeth, goodnight
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 11:28:53	@DignityPeace my first week of klonopkn withdrawal I watched repeats of Friends all day.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 11:27:34	@garbosmc its very frustrating to feel fine then for no reason it all slips away. And I can just watch it go.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 11:06:45	@DignityPeace I do appreciate the concern. Tweeting is helping release alot for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 11:05:54	@DignityPeace aside from the injury its been my best week since october. Shrug.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 09:59:20	Taking the pills but the darkness descends nevertheless. #bipolar #bipolardisorder #depression #mentalillness
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 09:23:09	Back injury means no gym or tkd this week. Have to stay home all day every day. #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 09:02:14	@Miss_Gibson91 you have your whole life ahead of you. Get yourself all straight and the rest will follow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 07:36:39	I really need some excitement in my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 07:36:03	Another weekend over another long week alone. #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 04:15:41	@Shawnie_0405 I exercise a lot. It is not so much enjoyable as reliable distraction.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 04:14:45	@Shawnie_0405 not much. Sometimes my 2 y.o.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 03:18:19	Its really a lot less fun to be #manic without an accomplice. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 03:00:47	@BipolarPosts @Miss_Gibson91 that is me. All my "friends" are really my wife's.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 02:56:55	I need to find a way to improve my life, else no amount of Meds will relieve my #depression . #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-12 02:55:32	There is a cacophony of cats in my house.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 22:22:03	Back pain subsided. Now I will be back to focusing on everything else that makes me sad. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 13:08:23	Goodnight noises everywhere.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 13:00:47	@ArsenicNAce I am almost always in that mood. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 09:31:14	The world disagrees with me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 09:30:16	@Miss_Gibson91 I hear that. Been bored since last year. Hope something interesting your way comes!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 00:58:46	@Shawnie_0405 my wife cleans when she is depressed.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 00:58:03	@Shawnie_0405 probably not prompt. Autocorrect doesn't like me. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 00:57:18	@Shawnie_0405 I'm being a little dramatic. More like high potential, way under achiever prompt attributable to #bipolar .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 00:31:02	@Shawnie_0405 but its really what I should have could have been. And the fall I took is staggering.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 00:29:10	@Shawnie_0405 oh I used up my mulligans years ago. Too late for me. Its irrelevant I have some things.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 00:27:49	@Shawnie_0405 only started feeling better this week.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 00:26:52	@Shawnie_0405 I exercise daily. Know what I am grateful for. I eat pretty well. Take vitamin D and many vitamins.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-11 00:09:41	Not suicidal anymore but reasons haven't changed. I've screwed relationships and career beyond repair.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-10 22:52:09	I can't help but wonder if I am not #depressed because of my physical pain or my low dose of lamictal. #bopolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-10 12:42:39	Goodnight to the old lady whispering hush.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-10 06:54:49	My kitten Maggie is a boy. Lol
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-10 04:08:52	@oceangirlholly type. Hang in there urself. I've numbed myself w endless tv.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-10 02:50:01	When you have burned all the bridges, there is nowhere you can go. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-10 02:20:51	Being laid out flat on my back gives me lots of time for my mind to go places it probably shouldn't.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-10 02:10:49	@angelsnest777 thanks. My 10 y.o. is being very helpful with his baby brother.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-10 00:48:50	Even family and friends stop being supportive when the problems never go away. #Bipolar is a lonely life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-10 00:44:27	What about me, it isn't fair, I've had enough now I want my share. Can't you see, I wanna live, but you just take more than you give.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-10 00:39:37	Sitting up here watching over lighting down below, the earth is turning, why does it go so slow ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-09 21:53:19	Back is worse but at least my moods are stable. #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-09 08:50:53	Arrrrrrggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! Sometimes I just want to scream.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-09 08:50:13	Emotional pain can make you want to die. Physical pain can make you want to live.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-09 08:32:08	Being injured kills me. I am laying in bed longing to get back to the gym.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-09 04:00:56	@Slumballina strained it at the gym
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-09 02:44:49	Along with the back pain and #depression , my mom may have lymphoma or lung cancer. Sigh.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-08 22:53:15	My back is worse today. It will be very hard to take care of my 2 year old.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-08 09:38:27	@bipolarclub adults have more constant pressure and stress, but we are expected not to be moody. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-08 08:07:54	@cackiesmum only 50mg. This is my 4th go around with the drug. Usually helps depression at 50 mg.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-08 05:19:26	Bored, in physical pain, but no #depression . #positive #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-08 03:14:56	@PsychIssues never had cocaine but would still have to agree.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-08 03:14:20	1600mg of ibuprofen is barely helping. May take something stronger later.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-08 01:38:19	Physical pain does a good job making me forget about emotional pain.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-08 00:55:22	@angelsnest777 thank you
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-08 00:15:53	This is not turning out to be a very good day. And I was really hoping for two in a row.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-08 00:14:33	Strained my back at the gym. May not be able to go for a few days.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 23:55:22	First day on the increased dose of lamictal and I am a lot more depressed than yesterday. What's up with that? FML
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 23:54:00	Why is it #mentalillness if anyone would be miserable if they went through what you did?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 09:41:11	@angelsnest777 same here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 08:28:23	Just took my first higher dose of lamictal. Made me hypomanic last go round on lam. Waiting... #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 08:23:02	@SaltySmile sounds like it. That is too bad.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 07:29:30	@SaltySmile I guess but premiums would then have to go up. In the US we pay for our own LTD.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 06:56:50	@SaltySmile LTD is usually 2/3 pay. Are you getting less?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 06:41:34	@richardjwaters @bipolarclub . Naps always help me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 06:20:45	@robjamil lol have to wait and see on that one.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 05:49:23	Its not as much fun being #manic where I live now. It was great growing up near NYC. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 05:46:52	It is starting to feel like my disorder is changing direction. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 02:29:47	@oceangirlholly Thank you so much. I am trying to be positive today. :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 02:23:29	@earthatmilkyway I don't know. My pdoc said I was on withdrawal, so I believe him.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 02:12:06	@earthatmilkyway for me the withdrawal was over a month of constant mild anxiety attacks. Heart always racing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 01:55:46	Somehow I will find a way to get past this awful cycle of episodes of #depression #anxiety and #mania this past 8 mos.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 01:51:43	@earthatmilkyway withdrawal was so bad I have been afraid to take it again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 01:51:08	@earthatmilkyway didn't take it for a week b/c I didn't need it. Then the withdrawal hit.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 01:48:28	@earthatmilkyway I used to take it for #anxiety and sleep almost daily, about 1.5 mg.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 01:45:50	My 2 year old can be so cute. #positives
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-07 01:45:09	@earthatmilkyway I just don't know. For me xanax is addictive.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 21:44:35	Had to get up at a normal hour and now im exhausted b4 most ppl get to work. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 21:04:11	@earthatmilkyway I don't know what else they might have given you. My wife got her antidepressants from a regular doc, and it was okay.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 21:03:39	@earthatmilkyway Probably a good idea, at least with the xanax.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 11:21:07	Goodnight bears ... goodnight chairs ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 11:20:07	@ProjectBip0lar I agree. Animals have a very soothing effect. Its my kittens for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 11:00:54	@bipolarclub every country should have an afternoon siesta. Everyone would be happier.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 07:48:26	@Scarlett_Raee that is fantastic. There is nothing better in the world than real hope.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 07:43:40	@Scarlett_Raee congrats. Others never see us as we see ourselves and that can be a great thing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 07:38:15	Being #bipolar isn't the same as all the professionals describe it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 06:16:08	Sometimes I miss being impulsive. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 06:01:17	I just really need go feed my disease. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 05:33:02	Its not that I don't have a good life, its that I don't have the life I should/could have had. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 05:16:49	In the category of what is wrong with me, my mom is seeing an oncologist, and I don't seem to care.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 02:28:49	@Slumballina I am really not sure how to regard it. Right now, #bipolar is my entire existence. I suppose I need to find a way out of that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 02:15:02	@Slumballina I can try to act normal, but people always know I am different.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-06 02:11:40	Sometimes I think I don't want to feel better. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 23:44:22	Reading your blogs, I realize I define myself as #bipolar instead of as a person with #bipolardisorder . Need to think about this.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 23:42:33	Mondays would be so much better if #anxiety and #depression would let me breathe better. #bipolar #bipolardisorder #mentalhealth
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:54:47	@Miss_Gibson91 thanks for sharing this. I can really relate.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:27:35	@earthatmilkyway doesn't sound like a lot. May not really be helping, but im just guessing.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:25:58	@earthatmilkyway pdoc. Not process. Stupid autocorrect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:25:24	@earthatmilkyway 0.25 isn't much of a dose. Taking a lot really should just make u numb. Ask ur process, I never became manic from it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:23:48	@Shawnie_0405 I was taught it in a psych ward 20 years ago. Still use it. Have no idea about how to find someone to train you.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:22:38	@Shawnie_0405 it isn't easy but it biorhythms work really well for me. Helps me sleep.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:18:16	@earthatmilkyway were you on the xanax when that happened on class. How often do you take it and how much?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:16:21	@earthatmilkyway the xanax shouldnot make u angry. It should make u not care.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:14:52	@Shawnie_0405 done that. Works really well for me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:14:23	@earthatmilkyway I was on xanax and klonopin for anxiety and sleep. Became addicted and went through an awful withdrawal.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:12:16	@Shawnie_0405 yeah. Came off then. That was six mos ago. Were trying again.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:09:54	@Shawnie_0405 ok tks
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:09:26	@Shawnie_0405 I had a little rash, but hives? Yuck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 10:06:59	@earthatmilkyway sort of. what's up?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 09:54:00	People spend a lot of time worrying about other people. I have a hard enough time worrying about myself.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 09:36:02	@DignityPeace yeah, I thought weight LOSS was a side of lam. I did gain 20 lbs on lithium though.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 09:19:46	Anyone gain weight on lamictal. I go to the gym once or twice a day, but I have gained 6 lbs. in the last 2 weeks.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 09:16:16	@RitasReality They kept having to up my dose 'cause Lithium only worked for a little while for me. I hope you feel better tomorrow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 06:13:52	Naps are my favorite part of the day. #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 05:05:34	I always feel the worst at 4 pm. Anyone else? #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 04:08:18	@earthatmilkyway #bipolar is incurable, can only be managed w powerful psychotropic drugs.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 03:58:36	Self medicating w southern sweet tea. #happy
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 03:53:52	@earthatmilkyway np. I can only hope it gets better. No way to know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 03:19:16	@earthatmilkyway yeah me too
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 03:14:05	@earthatmilkyway yw. Here's wishing we don't have to feel this forever.

500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 03:05:13	@actondepression empty. Thanks for asking.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 01:41:47	@Slumballina I am only anxious and irritable when I am "up" and empty when I am "down". But, maybe the meds will help.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-05 01:20:29	No hope for my future. Good reasons to be #depressed . Not sure how meds are supposed to overcome reality. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 08:39:30	I am treating myself tonight. #success
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 07:22:32	We lie to ourselves but it keeps us going. #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 04:40:12	@FishArmy lmao, took me a few to get that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 04:38:16	@DignityPeace I know. Wish the ramp up on lamictal was faster. Got a rash last time so must rake it slow.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 04:36:20	@FishArmy lol. Idk but I make a great steak.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 04:35:47	@Slumballina I always get in more trouble when I am manic. I can't manage myself well, so I can't be much help. :(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 04:25:42	The mood is slipping away .... #bipolardisorder #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 00:40:40	@SaltySmile great question
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 00:15:47	@FishArmy last time I had a mild rash when I hit 100mg, which is why I came off. Trying again to combat depression.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 00:10:49	@FishArmy I just restarted lamictal last week, and my sleep patterns did change a little right away.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 00:09:46	@FishArmy I can't recall, but these are all such powerful drugs. I mean lamictal has a deadly rash, so why not?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-04 00:07:01	@FishArmy lamictal tends to make me hypomanic, so what you describe doesn't sound unusual to me.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-03 23:19:39	When I was young I could self induce a mood change. MANIC manic Manic MANIC ...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-03 22:49:20	I actually feel somewhat human today. How unexpected. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-03 11:26:51	@simplyeasylivin @BipolarBimbo oh the things we could think, the dreams we could dream. Happy Dr. Seuss day!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-03 10:37:09	@robertgray49 we live in alpharetta and it passed nearby.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-03 09:41:40	I hold 2 advanced degrees but I can't hold a job. When I am depressed, I end up quitting, and when I am manic, I get fired. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-03 09:40:00	@FishArmy good luck. on my 4th (I think) go round on lamictal. takes too long to ramp up on, but it works.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-03 09:37:54	@oxymoronic82 please hang in there, we're only tweeps here, but we like to see you here.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-03 03:00:51	Mind not racing, just empty. Very strange. Only thought is I hate tuna fish. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-03 00:43:31	Sometimes I feel sick about my life. No wait, sometimes I don't feel sick about my life.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-03 00:40:59	@RitasReality if I only had any idea how to get myself to do thaf.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 22:55:31	Meds not mess. Stupid autocorrect.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 22:54:07	Have to stick to strict dosing schedule so I don't die. Love those #bipolar mess.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 22:00:59	At pdoc, hoping to double my dose today, not wait til tues.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 11:12:02	@bipolarclub What comes to mind is the curse of my existence. I am gifted in many ways, but this disease has held me back in all of them.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 09:27:53	@bipolarclub yes, search "bipolar cool"
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 09:02:29	What I wouldn't give for even just a little hypomania. #bipolar #bipolardisorder
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 08:20:26	@bipolarclub hello!
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 07:46:32	What do you do when you can cope with the pain, but you are just tired of the fact it never goes away. #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 07:27:20	@pensandpotions if you figure out what show to replace it with, I'd love to know.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 07:19:56	@pensandpotions Wow! I have been doing that, except that TBS doesn't show ALL of them. Just start over! :-)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 06:52:33	On a positive note ... hmm ... have to get back to you on that.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 06:34:00	Need goals in life to want to live. Achieving them leaves me empty and hopeless. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 06:30:26	I think I have become Holden Caulfield.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-02 05:21:19	Ignore that last tweet. Existence can be painful anyday. #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-01 23:36:52	Existence is less painful on Thursday than it is on Monday. #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-01 07:21:53	Neglect of mental illness exacts a huge toll. RT @SciAm http:// bit.ly/wJJdNd
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-01 04:35:20	What if you screwed up your life so bad that you have very good reason to be miserable. Can meds really help? #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-03-01 02:23:14	Started back on meds. #depression is worse. Don't you just hate that? #bipolar .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-29 12:16:19	Goodnight moon...
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-29 12:14:08	@earthatmilkyway thanks for your concern. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-29 12:12:53	@earthatmilkyway yes, and that is why we can hurt each other so much.:(
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-29 12:08:20	@earthatmilkyway yes, she said it was b/c she was upset and needed someone to talk to. if she is this upset w/me, I have no one left.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-29 12:00:41	My wife doesn't consider my mental illness a private matter and has told too many people. I want to die.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-29 05:55:41	#happysongs irritate me, I prefer #sadsongs . somehow they get the #sadness out of my system.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-29 01:21:51	it takes tooooo long to ramp up on lamictal. #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-28 23:32:21	@SaltySmile I suppose you are right, my uncle manages his so well, but it does take a lot of work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-28 23:24:05	Trying to figure out which non #mentalillness to compare #bipolar to. Something chronic, uncurable, painful, and meds don't always work.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-28 23:22:11	I have fought tooth and nail against my #bipolar my entire life, even when I didn't know what it was. Now, I am tired, very tired.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-28 11:37:39	Here's to a better tomorrow. Its all I got. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-28 06:03:51	@actondepression Its been a bad day, but my positive is I got sent some work and I did it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-28 05:55:17	Heart racing. Chest pounding. Tell me why. I don't like Mondays. #bipolar #anxiety #depression #mentalillness
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-27 23:29:17	#anxiety and #depression making me feel sick. Self-medicating with high levels of caffeine and sugar.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-27 23:27:23	@bourach I feel the same. Good luck.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-27 11:06:37	The benefit of being unemployed is the lack of a sick feeling on Sunday night. #bipolar #anxiety
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-27 03:39:36	I am finally having a good weekend, but I am still #depressed . I hate this. #bipolardisorder #mentalillness
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-27 01:56:38	Back to meds. Back to insomnia.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-26 10:08:16	Friends coming over soon. Hope I can enjoy myself. Not always the case. #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-26 05:08:34	I feel awful. I am glad that I don't feel worse. #bipolar #depression
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-26 02:35:12	Weekends lately are worse than the weeks. That proves I am insane. :) #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-25 09:22:50	#Sadness and #anxiety are my albatross
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-25 06:37:41	@Lareve Call the dr. if they don't work, it'll be h*ll stopping. i've been there. wishin' you the best.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-25 03:20:09	I don't know about "recovery" some people speak of. For me, #bipolar is a curse that, even with meds, can only be held in abeyance.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-25 03:08:29	Typical Friday. Don't know what to do with myself. #Bored . Have work I could do, don't want to do it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-25 00:24:27	The baby is gonna drive me crazy ... I mean crazier. :)
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-24 21:55:46	@abipolarmom Nice to see this. Medication choices are hard. These are heavy duty, serious drugs we take.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-24 13:06:29	I guess I should attempt round 2 of trying to go to sleep. I don't really know better.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-24 11:18:20	I know better than to waste my time trying to go to sleep at a reasonable hour. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-24 10:19:19	@BipolarPosts been there, doing that. I try not to take myself too seriously. I wish you the best.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-24 10:14:51	#Cats are good therapy. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-24 10:01:38	I am #bipolar -- NOT #evil .
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-24 06:45:22	@bipolarchick Sad songs make me feel better. Is that strange?
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-24 06:42:48	At the park with my kids. It shouldn't be this hard. #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-23 13:28:31	Been bipolar all my life, but just got the diagnosis 2 years ago at age 39. Having a harder time accepting it than being it.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-23 12:36:23	Especially as you get older, it becomes harder to find hope. Finding the right cocktail (of meds) is the key to survival... #bipolar
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-23 12:34:57	I am #bipolar . That means some nights I lie awake trying to decide whether to kill myself, while others I decide whether to buy a boat.
500442723	BipolarSanity	2012-02-23 12:33:56	To get stoned on legal drugs, or ride the emotional rollercoaster that is me. #bipolar
