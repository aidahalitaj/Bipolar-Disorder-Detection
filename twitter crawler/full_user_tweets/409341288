409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-10 16:34:48	@IamCarrieeeeee feel for you, before my old psych retired I had to travel 3 buses to get to where he was based, stressful to say the least.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-10 16:30:52	@mrsmentalhealth ive got the raspberry ketones do they work? What else are you doing to get that fab weight loss? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-10 16:28:52	> you feel stupid and want to reactivate accounts etc?
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-10 16:28:05	Does anyone when feeling rejected, cut ties with everyone? Deactivate social media accounts, ignore texts but when 1 person makes an effort>
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-09 23:49:01	To be making things worse no matter what I do, but need to keep people happy.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-09 23:47:30	I need to get myself into a better mindset, stay away from the internet, my phone etc and live in the offline world for a while as I seem
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-09 22:51:43	Those who have me on facebook, ive deactivated it for the moment.

409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-08 06:47:46	So sad to hear the passing of Peaches Geldof, may she be at peace now. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-07 16:12:20	This time 6 years ago I was just waking up from my first night in a psych ward. I was scared and alone. Sharing a dorm with 3 other patients
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-07 00:43:20	@SecretSchizo I took quetiapine during my pregnancy and am on psych meds now my son is perfectly fine and thriving.i had lots of support too
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-06 03:36:39	horrible weekend this as in trigger sense. the days and dates of this april are the same as april 2008. 4th 5th and 6th were spent in icu :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-05 03:56:24	@IamCarrieeeeee yep the products were £36, £10 tip and the rest cut and colour. :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-05 03:52:12	Had my hair cut and coloured today today was cheap too, including products I brought it was £140.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-04-04 18:13:04	I hate depakote, been off the med now 2 weeka roughly and my hair is still falling out and its getting worse. Wish id never taken it!!!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-29 22:34:04	@silentlyana I didnt know you very well, but am sorry to hear of your passing, hope you are at peace now. RIP xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-25 16:49:15	Since stopping depakote my hair seems to be falling out more :/ how long does it take to get out of my system completely?
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-24 03:22:03	@Schizorrific hi im ok, adjusting to med changes to everything's a bit all over the place, keeping close eye on it tho thanks for asking x
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-24 03:20:13	@Hannahblah_ it might be in the privacy part, im not quite sure x
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-23 05:43:14	I knew it would happen that when I stopped depakote my migraines would come back. Trip to gp next week :-/
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-23 05:14:33	Grr unless I have a really long top on, when I sit on my sofa my top rolls up at the back causing me to stick to it (have a leather sofa)
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-23 04:28:10	I cant figure out my mood state at the moment which isnt good when im trying to monitor it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-23 03:15:52	Lol at ant and dec saturday night takeaway
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-23 03:09:27	@Hannahblah_ go to your settings and its the protect tweets bit you want to tick that should protect your account.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-20 20:14:39	@Hippychick1987 ive never been one to reduce meds gradually except antidepressants. I was only on a lowish dose anyway.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-20 16:33:44	@barmybelle its to do with awareness of breast cancer.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-20 16:32:59	@Hippychick1987 I have spoken to my psych he says to reduce gradually but im stopping completely.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-20 06:11:11	@Hippychick1987 todays the second day of not taking depakote, havent been taking it properly about a week prior. no adverse effects yet.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-20 04:48:40	Anyone stopped taking depakote (for bipolar) cold turkey before? what happened?
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-20 02:18:05	but then i am easily confused anyways!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-20 02:16:12	Does the gov do a "the budget for dummies" book. Because it never makes sense to me!
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-20 01:05:29	Stopped taking depakote, phoned cmht to speak to psych, message passed on. Hair loss is way too much now. not sure what he'll suggest tho :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-20 00:54:38	I added fattoes to my name because whilst i was in the bath i noticed I have really fat toes!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-19 05:56:32	everything I hear has an angry tone even the tv not watching anything thats angry. Thoughts angry, reading angry, jaw clentched.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-16 05:30:22	@harmon_lj thanks me too. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-16 05:29:08	@harmon_lj it worse. Its been getting worse as the weeks have gone on. Psych said to contact if gets worse. Hub agrees hair is thinner now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-16 05:27:35	@harmon_lj im taking a vitamin called selenium which helps with hair loss, sadly not in my case. My hair falls out anyway but depakote makes
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-16 05:05:44	Need to come off depakote as the hair loss is too much now. Hope psych is available monday. Worried tho as he mentioned clozapine last time.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-16 05:03:26	My anxiety is reducing thankfully, think its because the main trigger has been removed. Just got to work through this mixed episode now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-14 06:40:32	@harmon_lj ive got someone coming tomorrow to assess my needs (long story short "sacked" my cpn) will talk to them about it Its bloody scary
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-14 06:37:16	@harmon_lj no its a female voice but doesnt sound like me, sounds in the distance as well.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-14 04:50:17	@harmon_lj have these thoughts been your own? Because these dont feel like mine, dont sound how id say things.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-14 04:46:40	@ALittleBitLost_ have a read about labyrinthitis, your symptoms remind me of this, hope its eased off now x
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-14 03:53:00	I will never be beaten throw at me what you like but I will bounce right back up!
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-13 23:02:20	@oxymoronic82 once id had my son, I was supported and closely monitored and when I deteriorated they admitted me to a mum and baby unit.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-13 23:01:25	@oxymoronic82 id never had any experience with children before so didn't have a clue. The psych was specialist in mother psychiatry too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-13 23:00:14	@oxymoronic82 I had a cpn and nursery nurse who I saw weekly and helped me prepare for the birth and teach me how to wash, change nappies
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-13 22:30:43	@oxymoronic82 hope they are helpful for you especially at the moment xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-13 22:20:31	@oxymoronic82 feeling horrible whilst pregnant. It doesnt mean you're going to be a bad mum it just means that right now things are tough xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-13 22:19:44	@oxymoronic82 do you have support from a perinatal mh service? Sorry to hear you're struggling, I know personally the guilt you feel for (c)
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-13 21:37:16	Has anyone been happy full on life, got plans for the future etc but had "thoughts" saying kill yourself? Thats the last thing I want to do!
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-13 15:47:45	@turquoisejulia c. Days did you work? Is it a good experience? Thanks and hope you're ok x
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-13 15:44:38	@turquoisejulia heya, ive just seen that your position at the recovery college is being replaced. Im thinking of applying. What hours and c
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-13 03:53:41	I am feeling & thinking some scary thoughts & i dont like that they are there. Its like they have been put there because they arent mine!
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-12 23:21:54	Some people really know how to make you feel shit with just a few words.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-11 05:23:44	I havent had thoughts and feelings like that for a long time, so am really shocked they have surfaced. Im aware and focused. I will be ok.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-11 05:21:21	But I noticed these thoughts accepted they were there but didnt act on them. I know enough about bpd and dbt to know wise mind was needed.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-11 05:19:37	I did feel like I was going to lose someone I had built a friendship up with over the past year This scared me and certain thoughts appeared
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-11 05:17:46	This then caused a chain reaction in thoughts. I was most scared about my friendship with my friend and how this was going to effect it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-11 05:16:26	I spent sat and sun petrified people were going to come and take me and/or my son away. I felt so bad and that I had failed.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-11 05:14:46	It started with a major argument with a friends sister threatening me involving my son and hub. This attack left me shellshocked and hurt.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-11 05:13:21	I have been having some very borderline type thoughts recently and this past weekend was very tough indeed. Had self damaging thoughts.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-10 18:51:12	Might actually be worth going through this hell, nasty shit for a clearly nasty person as the world very much sees me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-10 18:50:23	Wow I really must have been evil people in my past lives, for all the shit im getting thrown at me maybe I should behave like it
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-10 06:51:44	I have been verbally hurt by a very vicious person this has thrown me out of whack with my stability. I am now unstable but keeping safe.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-10 05:00:24	Friends what and who are they, I just don't know anymore Not letting anyone in again Need to protect my son from evil that I seem to attract
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-10 03:48:44	Not dyslexic but words are reading like they should.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-09 09:28:06	I so hate it when someone projects their faults onto me. Especially when they know I am fully aware of their behaviours.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-09 07:33:51	@jenflowers65 thanks trying to protect myself at the mo.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-09 07:24:34	Im making my account private for the time being. I cant take risks.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-09 07:17:42	@BPDjade thanks, me too xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-09 07:17:11	@autiepower thank you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-09 05:10:54	Im so frightened I cant say why but its tearing me apart inside.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-08 07:57:30	The inside of me is shaking so much, agitated and angry. Trying to do mindfulness to calm down not working atm but keeping trying.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-08 01:23:04	Have you ever, ever felt like this When strange things happen Are you going round the twist?
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-06 06:52:37	Feeling really emotional but no reason why. Odd going to get some sleep. #lookingaftermywellness
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-05 05:54:50	Makes me think tho if I am more ill than I believe and that the psych can see this which is why he has said this.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-05 05:48:43	This came about after talks that if I need to stop the depakote then it would be one of the options.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-03-05 05:46:26	Has anyone heard of clozapine being used for bipolar? My psych said today that I shouldn't rule it out even tho it would be a last option.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-02-27 16:50:18	Im so irritable and I dont know why, the last couple of days all ive done is snap peoples head off.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-02-24 03:48:34	@mycuriousmind no didnt do anything, didnt give me any side effects either. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-02-24 03:46:53	@mycuriousmind I have and it was like a sugar pill for me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-02-21 17:21:46	@IamCarrieeeeee its horrible isnt it. ive been up since 7 and think it should be 11ish want to ring sis in law but know shes still asleep.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-02-19 19:46:41	@puppypicks just my current mood right now. Got no motivation to do what I need to do :-(

409341288	RayvenMental	2014-02-01 19:26:14	Being a mum is the most amazing thing ever but i still need me time, but he gets everything he wants and only does things when it suits him!
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-02-01 19:24:24	Its ok i wont get the driving lessons that you promised me, you carry on modifying your car, going to golf when ever. I know where i stand!

409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-24 05:56:58	negative thoughts linger and that makes me feel awful. My son still isnt talking and is having speech therapy and im expecting miracles
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-24 05:56:05	how do i know that they arent just being kind. part of me is saying hey tash dont be so bloody stupid, you know your a great mum, but the

409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-24 04:19:36	At this time 2 years ago I was sat in my room after just being admitted to a mother and baby unit. Have come a long way since then.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-23 03:59:19	@Love_my_Westie we dont do the whole buying cards/gifts thing, just have a lovely home cooked meal that we've made together. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-22 20:04:15	Just learnt that @mybipolarlife has passed away as well. RIP Heaven has gained 2 angels xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-20 06:07:39	@turquoisejulia shes not currently in AH but a general hosp further afield.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-20 05:59:37	I want to speak to my best friend but her phone is dead and i dont have the number for the ward/hospital she is in :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-20 05:37:33	Another glass of brandy then onto the whiskey.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-20 05:29:21	@star_curl @freckles6127 @TinyO_oRatty ive only seen whats been tweeted today
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-20 05:28:21	@georgina_557 @freckles6127 @TinyO_oRatty not sure only that she has passed away
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-20 05:25:19	So sad to hear the passing of @TinyO_oRatty may you rest in peace xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-19 06:55:45	On the cognac mmmm
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-16 01:14:54	@hayley40 i had pre-existing bipolar, the pnd was treated and spent time in hospital, but since my episodes have getting longer :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-16 01:10:29	question about SH. has anyone intentionally tried to break a bone, but not to release emotion but so theres something physical not mental?
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-15 21:02:02	@hayley40 could be, had my son 2 years ago however :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-15 18:50:09	Since having my son my episodes have been more intense and lasting longer.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-14 07:10:50	I told friend this, plus they know how bad things have been and the lack of pro support Guess they are concerned about me and trying to help
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-14 07:07:39	I know whats done it I went to the minor injuries unit today as did something intentional to my arm and thought it was broken, its not.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-14 07:06:10	I really hope they dont suggest IP. I cant go in, I will fight them.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-14 07:03:20	Had voicemail from psych unit saying they're concerned about me & getting cpn to call tomoro. My friend in the unit has told them about me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-10 23:43:15	Spoke to pdoc am increasing lamotrigine back up to 200mg sertraline to 100mg and depakote staying the same. Hope to be feeling better soon.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-10 00:48:50	@Polarbear3127 we are called clients here, only patient when IP.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-09 23:54:30	Hmm telephone support where meant to call me back. Im doubting that will happen.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-09 23:41:37	Why am I made to feel guilty when I cant help being unwell. Its not my fault. I didnt ask for this!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-09 01:36:51	Stupid mht said id get a call yesterday but I didnt so phoned today told id get a call tomorrow. Whats the betting I don't :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-08 07:05:10	I always thought since a child i should be blamed for others crimes then there would be no bad/evil. I should be punished for their actions.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:44:31	@Jademr22 sorry to hear youve got a shit cpn too :( x
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:44:15	@Jademr22 thats what I'm doing tomorrow when I speak to the team leader. This is the second time Ive complained about her :( x
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:42:32	Mental health services are meant to help but all they do is distress me further. Its alright shes mental no one will believe her.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:39:03	The cpn hasnt tried to help me at all. When she visits its like someone having a catch up over coffee. How is that helping me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:37:06	Feel like im being pushed out by a cpn that doesnt care at all. I dont feel im ready for discharge yet.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:32:42	Me that she has sent the referral off. So how can she say I dont need therapy, when its the psychology dept to decide. :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:31:31	A report and make a referral, ive asked several times and shes always said im still writing it or havent had time. At no time has she told
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:30:35	After your next psych appt, I apparently dont need therapy, yet when I transfered from perinatal to adult I was told my cpn would write up
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:29:33	Her last visit was well you didnt need me during the time we hadnt seen eachother so you're clearly doing well and we shall discharge you
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:28:22	Call me but she didn't and would just say I didn't get any text or my phone was broken, left my diary at home so couldnt phone to make appt
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:27:08	Take over a week to get back to me. Ive rung up asking for support and got told from receptionist that they would send a text and get her to
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:26:05	Without seeing her, a couple of times I cancelled but when I rang to rearrange she was never available and id leave messages which she would
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:24:58	Supposedly getting a call back tomorrow from mht about making a complaint of my cpn. Im disgusted by her treatment, I spent 8 or so weeks >
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:23:04	@WickedTheodora @Polarbear3127 channel 4
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-07 05:04:34	Not even a few minutes into benefit street and im pissed off with it already!
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-05 07:46:37	Busted my wrist. Can move it but it bloody hurts. :-(
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-04 16:56:53	@IamCarrieeeeee it would seem I missed your birthday. Happy belated Birthday hope you had a great day xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-04 15:05:13	It turns out that this low mood has been around longer than id first thought, after discussing things with hub :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-04 14:55:53	@IamCarrieeeeee I took a bit of a break and found/finding it hard to get back involved. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-04 14:53:13	@BipolarAuthor I took low dose quetiapine from 11 weeks to 36 weeks and my son is fine.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-04 05:50:18	Been holding the tears so much today and they released this evening but I quickly stopped them. I won't fall apart. I cant.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-03 16:03:36	@lucy_seren it is, here the physical health staff are great its those who should understand and in the mh profession that are cruel.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-03 16:00:42	@IamCarrieeeeee hope you feel better soon x
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-03 15:16:38	Spoken to me. I dont really trust my cpn.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-03 15:13:13	I wonder if the need to discharge me by end of April is part of the clustering tool, they say I dont need any therapy but they havent really
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-03 15:11:10	There are alot of failings going on and whilst some can be blamed on lack of funds etc sometimes its just the staff being damn right cruel!
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-03 15:08:54	(C) why would those in dire need of help want to seek it from you with judgements like that.
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-03 15:04:04	"Its those who stay quiet when in crisis who are most at risk" yeah because your service has branded all in crisis as attention seekers! (C)
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-02 16:49:56	Monitoring mood I know its early days to say whether this could turn into an episode. Trying to use skills and mindfulness #mustnotgivein
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-02 15:29:17	Day 4 of low mood. Meh
409341288	RayvenMental	2014-01-01 07:50:18	Ah the last tweet of 2013. Its been an up and down year but a good one. Heres to 2014!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-25 08:52:35	Merry Christmas everyone have a great day xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-24 23:18:12	Have been on the depakote since last friday and so far no side effects at all. And its helping my migraines and mood.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-24 23:16:10	I have alot to be thankful of this time of year, my thoughts are with those less fortunate and alone at Christmas.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-22 13:38:07	No its ok I'll run myself into the ground doing everything around the house and with our son! Hope your enjoying your nice long sleep too!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-22 07:41:59	@Hopingforhope1 the 1st time I took it I was zombified but no weight gain the 2nd time no sedation but put on alot of weight in a short time
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-21 06:37:16	Bit of an update http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-ns
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-19 23:26:11	So all being well and I stay stable on meds end of march 14 I will be discharged from CTT back to GP.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-15 04:59:51	Any bipolars get an internal buzzing/tingling/feeling of electricity running through them when heading towards or in a high?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-14 00:54:56	@00_LostSoul_00 just seen your tweets sorry to hear your in hosp, hope that it helps and your out of there soon xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-13 19:52:27	Anyone taken depakote and lamotrigine together and if so what side effects did you have. Pdoc is adding depakote to my lamotrigine.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-11 04:58:11	@ecrjones I dont stutter but instead I do something similar called cluttering. Not sure if med induced however. On lam/sert with no stutter.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-09 02:25:11	@shelz1986 hope it goes ok, im waiting on a decision of which med im going on either sodium valproate or toparimate most likely the first 1.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-08 08:05:00	@anyonecandie that is really reassuring thanks :) hopefully you will have the same results this time round. x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-08 07:58:24	@anyonecandie ive tried lithium but couldn't get levels high enough before side effects became too much :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-08 07:57:02	@anyonecandie not for a while and am on pill contraception too, not taking chances.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-08 07:54:28	@anyonecandie valproate. im already taking Lamotrigine and sertraline, my lamo levels would be monitored with the valproate.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-08 07:53:19	@anyonecandie the only options for me are valproate or toparimate, but psych said the topa wont do anything for the bipolar so has suggested
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-08 07:50:10	@anyonecandie my gp and psych want to kill two birds with one stone and add in valproate to my cocktail to help with highs/mixed & migraines
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-08 07:41:15	I know I don't use twitter much anymore, but could anyone tell me about sodium valproate and its use on both migraines and bipolar?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-12-08 06:09:59	Has anyone taken sodium valproate for both Bipolar and Migraines?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-27 15:56:29	Morning.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-19 22:31:21	Im done with the bullshit. I wish I could just discharge myself but I cant hate being stuck in catch 22 situations. Hate being trapped.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-19 22:29:34	The mh trust here only cares about those who are psychotic or manic the rest well they are just attention seeking. Sad but true.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-19 22:27:56	The mental health service in this county is shit. Haven't seen cpn for over 2 months call and leave a message she doesn't return call.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-12 18:04:09	@samaritans @anyonecandie http://www. dailyecho.co.uk/news/10800704. Update__Southampton_s_Itchen_Bridge_re_opens/ …
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-12 03:22:49	@anyonecandie @WickedTheodora like this up however this is the first with a photo and video. That's what has disgusted me the most.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-12 03:22:12	@anyonecandie @WickedTheodora when they have reported an "incident" on the bridge before it's to do with RTA's. They always put articles
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-12 02:45:48	@WickedTheodora @anyonecandie the daily echo x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-12 02:30:27	@anyonecandie @samaritans the daily echo, I've commented on the article how comments/videos/photos shouldn't be allowed.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-12 02:21:33	@anyonecandie I know I can't believe it, and they have allowed comments too to the article.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-12 02:18:16	I am absolutely disgusted with my local newspaper website! A photo and video showing a distressed man wanting to jump of city bridge :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-07 21:30:37	@Clairey_Love thank you, I feel awful and can't help it :( xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-07 21:29:46	@silentlyana I don't know for sure yet have to wait and see how things go :(

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-07 21:12:08	Said it was the best drug for pregnancy and he has prescribed it many times, doc is also a high level doc so I trusted him. I will sue him!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-11-07 21:10:48	If it turns out that the cause of my sons communication disorder is the fact I took quetiapine during my pregnancy which my perinatal psych>

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:43:35	@pyschosis84 so supportive. Yep it was, took cocodamol and codeine during pregnancy to relieve it and had physio too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:42:50	@pyschosis84 this was my first birth, some do to over some early, just prepare yourself for it incase it happens. Hub and his family were
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:41:24	@pyschosis84 was the safest med for pregnancy, my son is fine with no issues other than late speaking.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:40:38	@pyschosis84 spd is where the relaxin causes the hips to separate too much and grind together. I saw a specialist psych who said quetiapine
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:39:42	@pyschosis84 my hub went back to work, the depression got worse I think it was the labour and delivery that caused me not to bond.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:38:43	@pyschosis84 then developed an infection and had to be on iv antibiotics was in hosp for 5 days. I hardly slept that whole time, hated when
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:37:47	@pyschosis84 born, he wasn't breathing at first due to swallowing meconium, needed to stay in hosp due to c section and to monitor my son I
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:36:40	@pyschosis84 the induction failed so needed emergency c section, was so sedated throughout that that they had to wake me when my son was
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:35:55	@pyschosis84 my labour and delivery didn't go to plan either, I had to be induced as went to 42 weeks, had pethadine which made me sleep,
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:35:03	@pyschosis84 I was on a low dose of quetiapine throughout my pregnancy due to depression, stress at work didn't help and I developed spd.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:25:37	@pyschosis84 yes, when my son was 8 weeks old, I hadn't bonded and was severely depressed. The unit helped me so much.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 18:15:52	@pyschosis84 yes but they are more relaxed, more staff, nursery nurses, it's slow paced to help the mothers bond with their babies, calmer.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-20 07:00:07	@NatalieOxford sympathise so much! I'm sweating so much, it drips from me, I know it's the sertraline that's causing it :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-18 20:09:40	@Profanity_Annie I'm taking it and have no side effects. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-18 17:08:45	@bipolarparent British gas, it's about the price hike.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-18 14:55:37	Not even sure what the point of an appt would be at the moment, not got anything to say, well not yet anyway! by end of next week I may!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-18 14:51:45	Rearrange but she hasnt, not that it matters much, as come to expect it from the CTT, shes prob been so busy, hasn't written it down to call
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-18 14:49:03	Just realised that it is nearly two weeks since I cancelled my cpn appointment to go to a skin camouflage clinic, she said she'd ring to
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-18 03:16:28	@Glass1ncision that's fab congrats x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-16 04:15:35	@pyschosis84 alien inside me the way my bump shaped during movements, used to poke my bump if a limb was there too long lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-16 04:13:50	@pyschosis84 lol I remember that all to well, he's just running out of room now so every move is heightened. I used to look like I had ab
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-16 04:09:02	@Profanity_Annie no probs :) I'm doing ok ty finally feeling stable. How are you? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-16 04:07:18	@pyschosis84 likely to be your waters, however if your unsure always worth calling your midwife or labour ward/place of birth.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-16 04:06:18	@pyschosis84 it could be your waters, also heard that your waters smell different, so if your damp clothing doesn't smell like wee it's most
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-16 04:04:56	@pyschosis84 always gush out but instead can trickle out over time, if you feel wet and know you couldn't have possibly wee'd a little then
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-16 04:03:58	@pyschosis84 I don't know as I had mine broken whilst in hosp, my friend didn't realise till she went to the loo, apparently it doesn't
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-16 04:02:59	@Profanity_Annie on lamotrigine which hasn't caused any weight gain at all, infact I lost weight on lamotrigine.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-16 04:02:13	@Profanity_Annie I found the only AP that was weight neutral was abilify, and AD sertraline, which isn't causing me weight gain. Also I'm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-15 05:56:20	Fair enough they warned there would be scenes of self harm but could have clarified they meant actual act of self harm!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-15 05:54:16	wtf watching #999whatsyouremergency on 4+1 and tell me @Channel4 what was the point of showing the man actively self harming on screen??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-14 23:40:20	@IamCarrieeeeee yay congratulations so pleased for you!! :) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-14 23:30:26	@IamCarrieeeeee thank you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-14 20:03:37	@will7201 lol we had that rain yesterday! Not likely to go kayaking for a while now :(

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-14 18:49:40	I'm quite sure that it's called laziness lol do feel antsy and fidgety however! Maybe it's my head trying to force me to do something!! Haha
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-14 18:46:29	Don't think I'm in a episode. I just want/need to do a lot & in my head it sounds great & I can visualise me doing it, but still I sit here!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-14 18:43:06	Pdoc increased sertraline to 150mg whilst keeping lamotrigine at 250mg and I'm wondering if this is what is causing this inner restlessness.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-14 18:40:05	In limbo want to do something but haven't a clue what even just sitting here isn't helping, I know there's a lot I could do, but stuck.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-14 15:52:43	@brokenmind_ good luck for today, hope the move goes well :) xx

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-10 15:11:44	@IamCarrieeeeee also search bath cupcakes, some of them smell good enough to eat!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-02 19:24:47	In my ears to try to make myself deaf, I'd throw myself down stairs to try and break a bone. I was 11 at the time! No wonder I was bullied!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-02 19:23:16	Chase me everywhere, I'd dream of my fire alarm that it was going to eat me. I went to a school that accepted deaf children and I put things
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-02 19:21:43	Jump fences as if I was this amazing human cat. I was scared of what I can only describe as a grilled drain that are in the roads. It would
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-02 19:20:27	I had paint flicked at me by another classmate. Even younger I'd sit at my bedroom window thinking I could parashoot to the ground and then
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-02 19:19:20	Growing up I knew I was odd that something wasn't right, I was different to others, I'd do things that were odd, like paint my face because
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-02 19:17:56	Have this feeling that something is going to happen soon relating to my health :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-01 20:52:21	@IamCarrieeeeee can I have some #happymental please? I miss mine haven't had it in months :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-01 15:58:07	@brokenmind_ it depends on why you were awarded the mobility, but definitely find out will give you a little extra if you can x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-01 15:55:35	@brokenmind_ keep the mobility side of Dla whilst in hospital.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-01 15:55:02	@brokenmind_ can you find out of there is anything else you could claim whilst in York, you will lose care side but I've known people to
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-01 15:49:57	@brokenmind_ wow that will be quite a drop in money!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-01 15:49:31	@barmybelle @brokenmind_ not sure about shorter term admissions. My friend has been in hospital 5 years and needs to reapply when discharged
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-01 14:46:47	@pyschosis84 thank you me too, how are you this morning? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-01 14:36:33	Been having this overwhelming urge recently to destroy myself, been trying to ignore it, but this morning it's rather strong :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-01 14:34:21	So I'm awake early as son got me up, and now I can hear my next door neighbours screaming at their kids..... Again!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-10-01 01:25:24	@g00dbyes answered for you
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-30 22:04:14	I just need shooting or a change of body, this one is falling apart!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-30 06:48:52	I forgot my memory
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-29 06:37:05	@autiepower ty for the hugs, I didn't think it would have that sort of power, last time I was expecting it due to being my first claim xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-29 06:35:54	@NatpopsEvans I opened it but that's as far as I got, going to ignore it for a few days, then attempt to fill it in :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-29 06:34:48	@NatpopsEvans yeah been out all day so missed post so found it when I got in :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-29 05:30:15	Had a really good day, come home to a blumming ATOS letter on my floor :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-28 17:10:42	Good morning twitterland :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-28 03:49:45	@pyschosis84 did you speak to your midwife? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-28 00:09:40	@pyschosis84 ring your midwife, they will be able to tell you, haven't heard of that before but it could be babe laying on nerves. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-27 23:06:55	@brokenmind_ that's fab news really pleased for you xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 19:50:20	@SmileyPeanuts then it would be abuse as by that age they should know what's right and what's wrong.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 19:43:57	@SmileyPeanuts I would say they are still innocent and need to be told what the consequences of their behaviour are.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 19:36:02	@SmileyPeanuts also any form of touching someone in an inappropriate manner and without consent is abuse.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 19:35:20	@SmileyPeanuts I'd be concerned at why the young person is touching others, is it copied behaviour because they are being abused themselves.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 16:05:17	@pickleslife aww I'm ok ty still fighting this inner ear condition however :/ x

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 05:47:57	@SJ25XX @asda me too, we work so hard to try and reduce the stigma and actions like this make our efforts pointless.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 05:45:40	@stevehanda lol I would!! If my driving is anything like my buggy pushing then god help us all!! ;) thankies
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 05:42:44	@SJ25XX @asda that's really bad & increases the stigma! I'll remember the meat cleaver next time I visit asda, after all that's what we do!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 02:39:32	@thisisamy_ ok just wanted to let you know that it can be a long process, tho mine was purely mental health, it took so long.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 02:35:38	@thisisamy_ the reason I ask is because I applied for mine end of March & only today found out from DVLA that they are sending me a license.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 02:34:41	@thisisamy_ have you sent any medical forms in with it?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-26 02:31:56	@thisisamy_ have you just applied?

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 23:39:56	@Danonymous1990 @pyschosis84 gosh that's not good, you were failed by the service, they should have given you more support!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 23:38:41	@Danonymous1990 @pyschosis84 try to bf but son wouldn't latch on so gave up as he lost a lot of weight.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 23:38:13	@Danonymous1990 @pyschosis84 gosh I had perinatal service support from 11weeks gone till my son was 15 months old, he wasn't effected. I did

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 23:32:19	@Danonymous1990 @pyschosis84 son chance to "withdraw" I think I was told I could breast feed whilst taking it, but as I stopped it it didn't
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 23:31:14	@Danonymous1990 @pyschosis84 I was only on a small dose of 50mg I didn't want to take anything higher. I came off it at 36 weeks to give my
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 23:29:59	@pyschosis84 @Danonymous1990 could do OT whilst they looked after my son. I hadn't bonded and was severely depressed which is why I went in.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 23:28:57	@pyschosis84 @Danonymous1990 then they will ask you to go in, they try not to section. For me the unit was so relaxed, loads of staff and i
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 23:27:36	@pyschosis84 @Danonymous1990 perinatal services are great, they don't do anything without talking to you first and if they feel MBU is need
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 23:16:00	@pyschosis84 @Danonymous1990 I was on quetiapine during my pregnancy too. I spent a short time in MBU so different to an acute ward.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 23:12:55	So after waiting since end of March for a decision from DVLA, found out today they are giving me a license!! Can't wait to learn to drive!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 17:53:45	In the ear I get the tinnitus in when I get loud ringing :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 17:52:36	Issues, lost count how many times I've sprained my ankles or fallen over because I've lost my balance. Get tinnitus a lot and lose hearing
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 17:51:32	Realised I've had Labyrinthitis a few times before over the years. I had glue ear as a child and ever since I've had balance and hearing
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 17:48:21	Currently laying on the sofa because sitting up makes me feel like I'm on a boat in rough seas and laying down reduces it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 17:46:58	Had a really bad attack of vertigo last night. Everything span for ages, met the door frame too which hurt a lot.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 17:42:46	Grr why is it when my mental health is ok my physical health declines. :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-25 17:32:17	@SJ25XX hey no worries hope your ok x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-24 00:50:09	@janetpeelargent yuk think I'll give that one a miss!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-23 02:11:19	@anyonecandie thanks, it sure does, im so exhausted all the time, feel like im 90 :( x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-22 18:49:54	My physical health hasn't been too good lately and struggling with Labyrinthitis makes using phones etc hard as scrolling effects my eyes.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-22 18:46:42	To others tweets I feel like I'm a rubbish followee. I feel so lost and I don't like it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-22 18:44:34	Been somewhat quiet on twitter for some time now not really sure why, just tweeting the odd bit here and there but not really responding
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-22 15:43:06	Someone want to shoot me and put me out of my misery?? Lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-21 05:44:20	@thelilradish haven't been able to find out anything on what your wanting but this link maybe helpful http://www. telegraph.co.uk/technology/app le/iphone/10320848/iOS-7-how-to-disable-the-most-annoying-new-features.html …
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-21 05:25:11	Did too much late afternoon, tried to fight through the dizziness/spinning wish I hadn't I feel 10x worse :-( Labyrinthitis is hell!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-21 05:18:59	@thelilradish I haven't noticed a difference really except my email now deletes a lot faster than it did
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-21 05:18:08	@thelilradish think it just blends with what ever the back ground picture is :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-21 02:39:03	Amusing myself with Siri and changing the language to Chinese and asking it "cream of some young guy" #immature
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-20 23:54:44	@brokenmind_ that's fantastic news so pleased for you :) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-20 23:53:40	@brokenmind_ so glad you are ok, had guessed you had been admitted again, great to see you back x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-20 21:38:37	Seems if I want anything done around the flat I have to do it in the morning as I'm too dizzy and disorientated by the afternoon :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-20 02:43:15	This Labyrinthitis is knocking me out, I feel so nauseous from the dizziness, tired and my balance is really off so falling into things :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-19 02:58:49	So it turns out I have Labyrinthitis :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-18 03:34:54	I'm pissed off and in a foul mood everything seems to be going wrong lately
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-18 03:33:53	My tv has blown up, was watching eastenders and hub blames me because of that!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-16 19:41:39	Today is a bad day, there's loads I should be doing but can't get the energy or motivation to do it, enthusiasm and interest disappeared :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-16 17:07:00	Oh and spammers fuck off, blocked and reported!!!! #notinthemood
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-16 17:05:49	Seems if I want something doing might as well do it myself, who cares if I pull muscles or injure myself.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-16 17:02:22	Needed the tumble dryer moved and that's a two man job thanks to a stair gate in the way, my flat is a shit hole & its really getting to me!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-16 17:00:38	All I wanted this weekend just gone was to sort out the flat once & for all & guess what, nothing was done because lazy hub wouldn't help me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-16 16:57:53	Today can just go do one, if you speak to me today expect short curt replies, not in the mood for people.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-15 06:55:49	Don't like this feeling of being physically and mentally unwell and having no control over what's going on. I really don't feel right :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-14 06:19:40	I'm tired, in pain and cold. Feel so run down, gut instinct is telling me something's not right, will have to see doc on Monday :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-14 03:05:13	Feel incredibly anxious for no reason :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-13 23:37:54	I desperately need to nap, been battling to keep my eyes open all day. Can't nap once hub is home as have the kitchen to sort out :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-13 22:38:27	Gone right into cooking mode, want to use cooking as a way of distraction and also self soothing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-13 20:44:32	@taralynn_poll I hope not, should go to docs about it but worried it is diabetes :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-13 14:49:43	I do NOT like Friday the 13th! Laying low today and a great start to the day I have a pounding headache :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-13 06:20:35	@MariesVoice_MG instead said I have Bipolar, BPD traits which is right, I see him next week & have letter he wrote 4 years back for proof.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-13 06:18:57	@MariesVoice_MG I saw a psych 4 years ago who diagnosed schizophrenia, saw same psych again few months back who denied giving that label >>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-13 04:35:59	Why is it when I'm having a good day I have to self sabotage. It's like I can't even allow myself to be ok for a day :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-13 00:21:59	@psychoticdancer so in a case of emergency they would have official details however if your not taking prescribed doses they won't know this
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-13 00:21:00	@psychoticdancer I got a letter the other day about an emergency care summery stating meds, dx, and allergies that the nhs are producing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-12 23:27:59	As much as the craziness is debilitating at times I wouldn't change it ever its made me who I am and I like me!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-12 23:18:26	@WickedTheodora well done :) xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-12 03:09:26	Go through phases where I'm really thirsty and can't get enough water. I ache and itch all over :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-12 03:08:43	I don't know what's wrong with me lately I'm getting enough sleep but always tired, have a wound on my thumb for 6/7 weeks which won't heal
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-12 03:03:45	@ALivingLie_ love your trees they are amazing :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-12 01:41:08	@quetiapineFella thanks for that!!! Tho i am sat here lmao!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-12 01:39:52	I'm exhausted haven't really done much walked to sure start twice, up to the shop and to the doctors, and chased my son around a play group.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-12 01:37:28	Ahhhh it's on repeat #killmenow
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-12 01:36:53	I'm being subjected to gangnam style :/ hub is playing it to my son as he finds it hilarious!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-11 23:45:37	@MariesVoice_MG I cooked for 9 on Christmas Day last year! And for 3 daily.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-11 23:37:15	@MariesVoice_MG it takes a while to develop this patience trust me, I'm still learning!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-11 22:20:29	On the outside she looks and behaves within the social norm but inside her mind is crumbling, the foundations of her being is falling apart.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-11 15:28:07	@brokenmind_ so glad your ok was really worried x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-11 03:33:51	@BPDFFS thanks hun x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-11 03:31:49	@BPDFFS hey have you heard from Hannah? Is she ok?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-10 20:17:06	@BPDQueen lol true xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-10 20:12:33	Men are such dicks!! #thatisall
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-10 06:37:20	@ecrjones I found chewing gum helped a little as well as trying to be mindful of when I was clenching and try and relax my mouth.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-10 06:34:37	@zoe_bearx with you on this, it's so annoying, and the blank expression you get from them when you confront them about it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-10 06:32:12	@ecrjones I had it bad with fluoxetine but not with sertraline.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-10 06:29:38	@mycuriousmind back 4 years ago I was on 3 at one time. I know some who have been on 2 together too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-10 03:39:39	@MentalHealthCop I'm a service user of the trust on panorama :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-10 03:39:00	Yep this is my city on panorama and I can tell you AAT are useless for MHA assessments in police cells!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-10 03:31:55	Apparently this panorama has my local unit in it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-07 20:51:39	Well today seems a better day, I'm doing some cooking from scratch eek and cleaning too, taking each hour at a time and not over doing it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-07 20:49:30	@brokenmind_ mmmm yum! Frankie and Benny's do something similar.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-07 20:46:56	@brokenmind_ wow that's fab! I know my boys would love to be there right now!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-07 07:20:16	She seems stuck she can acknowledge her surroundings & play the part but inside she is lost, jut wandering from day to day.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-07 00:23:27	@Sexy_eyes35 I can't do it due to the reasons why I was awarded ESA in the first place.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 23:56:00	Wish I could do college but I'd lose ESA if I was to start college. Thing is would I cope at college at the moment? Barely leave the flat.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 23:53:49	@pickleslife but hub has said we will watch a film tonight so hopefully that will happen.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 23:53:27	@pickleslife hard with a toddler running around and being noisy terrible twos etc. won't get any me time till he goes to bed :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 23:52:13	Giving up uni was hard but the right thing to do. I'm just not ready. I'm not brainy enough for uni level courses, can't do college either.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 23:48:32	@pickleslife I don't know how to do that, when I try I just seem to fail. :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 23:41:20	@pickleslife if you could take everything away all responsibilities etc that would be fab. Just can't deal with it all right now :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 22:51:38	I'm not coping
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 19:43:12	@brokenmind_ hey good to see you back online and doing much better. Missed you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 19:42:14	And recently seeing on tv the resus room I was in and nearly died in. Also I'm used to noise in my head but now it's quiet, there is nothing
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 19:41:02	I should contact her and deciding not to. Becoming depressed and being put on sertraline, mood improved to this them several things happened
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 19:38:41	This has been like this since I found out about my aunts death and realised I missed my mother but then spending ages thinking about whether
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 19:36:17	Can't say I'm depressed but I'm definitely not happy, feel lost and like I'm here in person but somewhere else in mind.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 19:30:00	Hub says he's worried about me. Says I haven't been right for some time but he too can't pinpoint whether this is mood/BPD or something else
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-06 19:24:58	Remember back a few months ago when I signed up to Open University funding accepted etc, well today Ive quit it. Just not ready for it atm.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-05 23:03:51	Trying to reach out on here but failing pathetically! Guess BPD thoughts are in full swing and I don't know how to deal with them :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-05 22:38:43	<------- worst person ever, just a waste of space! FACT!!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-05 22:27:06	have reverted backwards, withdrawing from the outside, avoiding contact, staying within the four walls of my home im safe here, well sort of
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-05 22:25:09	think things have be proven, im not very well liked no one wants to make the effort with me & I just seem to let myself get hurt repeatedly!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-05 22:17:35	I feel so alone and I know its all my own doing, ive pushed people away, avoided talking to others, just hiding, not fitting in anywhere.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-05 00:30:13	@barmybelle yep I was in tears at the end, felt so much for the parents of the boy & hope I never end up in the waiting room they were in!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-05 00:16:16	@barmybelle the hospital in the show is my local. The drs and nurses are amazing, have brilliant bedside manner, am so thankful of them.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-09-04 05:18:21	Watching level one trauma based in my home town, just seen the resus cubical I nearly died in :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-29 04:57:20	@Prettybones1990 happens for a reason :/ xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-29 04:55:51	@Prettybones1990 all points to the possibility of a miscarriage. I'm still got pills left so this isn't normal for me :( believe everything
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-29 04:54:53	@Prettybones1990 well I'm on the pill and had unprotected last month never had any early bleeding on the pill before plus other symptoms it

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-29 03:48:24	@Love_my_Westie and the only possible cause is a miscarriage, as this has never happened before with pills and doesn't feel right either
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-29 03:46:55	@Love_my_Westie well I don't know for sure I'm on the pill and had unprotected last month but have started bleeding before pack has finished
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-29 03:20:08	@Thewayimfeelin thank you x

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-29 03:11:28	@BPDQueen thanks Hun, firm believer in everything happens for a reason :/ xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-29 03:07:13	TW there is a high possibility I'm having a miscarriage :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-28 17:06:23	Bloody mosquito bites, trying to resist itching, well I will go swimming in the sea in the dark, buggers got me when I was getting dressed!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-27 00:44:38	A tumbleweed bounces by in a light breeze

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-17 00:18:05	@pickleslife @mycuriousmind they are just rumours no confirmed deaths been reported. Many directioners are angry over the doc that aired.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 18:34:20	Maintenance to look after on your own with two young kids. You were just doing the right thing at the time!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 18:32:30	I understand why you sold the house. It was a quick way to get some money, we had somewhere else to live and really the house was too much
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 18:31:35	I understand so much now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:26:34	Most likely too late to change things. And it's killing me inside to think that this is a highly likely possibility.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:24:41	Said anything good about you, it's like they didn't think you had a good bone in your body yet you do. And I realise that now when it's
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:23:48	Old neighbours just wanted to have me on their side (their side of what I don't know) everyone seemed to be on the hate you wagon. No one
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:22:46	Some things just don't make sense, they don't fit with my memories. Dad just wanted to bitch about you and couldn't see any good in you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:18:11	More hours job didn't seem feasible to me, i wanted the best of everything and all I did was fall flat on my face time and time again.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:17:17	All I was good at was getting into debt. Thinking my £200 a month wage would cover my rent, bills and food. How wrong was I, yet getting a
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:15:24	Not like I do now. You were right I wasn't mature enough I didn't have the skills I needed to live I dependently, I was bailed out so much.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:13:02	You were trying to maintain the bills, keep afloat, losing money when I quit college so needing me to pay half the rent. I didn't understand
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:11:48	Things were tough in the last two years that I lived at home, I was trying to find myself & didn't know the way of life & responsibilities
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:07:05	Like on my 16th birthday I had 2 GCSE exams that day and you took me out for a birthday lunch I between, just you and me, your treat to me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:05:56	I want to forget the bad and remember the good times. I know there was many good within the bad.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:03:39	I need to write down everything everyone had said to me and try to work out things from there. This is going to be a hard task for me to do
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 17:01:33	Everything is twisted I don't know who was lying, telling the truth everyone was trying to get one up on each other & me stuck in the middle
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 16:59:24	Am I expecting to walk into fire and not get burnt? If you did want to talk, would I like what you would have to say?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 16:58:08	I want to contact you so much, but the fear that you won't want to know me again and further rejection. I regret what I did to you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 16:49:50	I forgive you mum, I miss you & want contact but I just don't know if its possible too much has happened & what if you don't want to see me?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-12 09:21:46	I miss you mum but I don't know if contacting you and such is the right thing to do, I can't get hurt again. I don't know what to do. :'(

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-08 16:48:33	I know grieving is a process that is unique, the hurt on top that the family have rejected me and didn't want to tell me about my aunts
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-08 16:46:29	I think finally the depression is subsiding and the sertraline is working however as good as it is, it doesn't repair a broken heart :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-08 16:31:08	@DannieGirl1990 before xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-08 16:06:16	@DannieGirl1990 you risk fines and it will void your insurance too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-08 16:05:20	@DannieGirl1990 a decision it can be a long process. Xx

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-07 18:13:35	Words can't describe how I feel right now. Can't even cry anymore :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-07 17:34:26	@DannieGirl1990 it's not as easy as that, there's alot of politics with the family. Plus the funeral starts in 25 minutes.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-07 17:30:44	@DannieGirl1990 because the family have rejected me, didn't even tell me my aunt had died.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 23:15:53	I have a heart I am not my mother like they have tarred me off as, it's not fair that this has happened.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 23:13:27	I felt the family rejected me and now it's confirmed, I don't exist in that family I care still and yes I'm devastated that my aunt has died

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 18:22:55	To manage my emotions better, I am wondering if the sertraline is starting to work. I hope so as I want out of this depression ASAP!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 18:21:59	Sons with his aunty today to give me a much needed break and time to myself. The urges I had a few days ago have reduced alot so I can start
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 07:02:07	Night need to try and sleep :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 06:47:02	Not stop me from feeling this guilt. I am guilty of so much stuff and I don't deserve the good things I have. I honestly don't!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 06:46:01	Feel guilty for not even being able to give birth properly. I know that any other way and the outcome would have been different but it does
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 06:45:10	Of my pregnancy and labour, felt guilty watching it in the first place like why should I be doing something good for myself then on top I
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 06:43:53	I found it hard to watch a film earlier as was about pregnancy and labour, upset me at the end with one woman needing c section reminded me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 06:42:13	I exhaust all distractions etc before calling, it just distresses me further when they won't listen to me, making me feel like Im worthless.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 06:40:58	I don't need telling by some fed up of their job person to distract or have a bath go for a walk etc. I've done all that before I call them
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 06:39:23	Happen, they will have to take me kicking and screaming on a section before I'll go into hospital, and won't have the AAT either, useless!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 06:38:33	Would have to take time off work to look after our son or he go to family to stay whilst hub works, its not fair on everyone. I won't let it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 06:37:36	I'm having but I won't act on them, not sure whether to tell cpn or not the H word came up last time, but I can't go in it would mean hub
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 06:36:40	I just want relief from this it hurts too much, I hate what it's doing to us, how it's making me think and feel. I don't like the thoughts
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 06:35:28	Say in bed can't sleep hubs beside me snoring his head off. I want to cry scream shout do something but i can't. See cpn tomorrow.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-06 05:29:34	@Glass1ncision thank you so much that means alot to me. ive spent the evening with hub had a little cry released some emotions xx

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 20:33:25	I can't cope at the moment things are too tough. I need to get through but every minute is a struggle. Skills are helping a little but hard.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 19:00:26	@autiepower sorry to hear that, I've slipped back quick and now finding every meal a struggle and drinking my body weight in water

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 18:16:34	He's been through me trying to end my life to wanting to leave him and disappearing to a different city for 2 days, self harming, he's been
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 18:15:07	It's my wedding anniversary & I should be happy but instead I'm in the grips of a bad depression, I'm a bad wife, put my hub through so much
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 17:39:38	@BPDPrincessx :/ ty x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 16:53:29	How quickly can you fall back into the grips of an ED? Been 10 years & although not fully recovered as went the other way, seems to be back.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 16:51:09	@Prettybones1990 thank you it's my 7th year & tomorrow is the anniversary of us getting together 9 years. Congratulations to your g/parents.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 04:06:04	not able to participate in #bpdchat tonight, need to look after myself.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 03:57:12	@mycuriousmind they don't help, just tell people to distract and such, for me when I phone its because ive done all that and still strugglin
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 03:56:18	@mycuriousmind im stubbon and try to get by on my own, usually resulting in needing extra support, I just don't want the assessment team,
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 03:52:46	@mycuriousmind yeah im seeing her Tuesday, I hope so, might give her a call tomorrow just to let her know how im feeling and such. x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 03:50:08	@mycuriousmind the thing is if I do she will want to send the assessment team out to me, and I don't want them and I don't want IP either :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 03:49:02	@mycuriousmind its easy to say things to a friend when your low, I just cant associate it with me, my mind wont let me :'( xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 03:47:54	wondering do I call my cpn tomorrow which could potentially lead to being assessed by AAT or do I just cope through till Tuesday?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 03:46:43	@mycuriousmind thank you, xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-05 03:45:19	im sorry im such a huge disappointment, I drive people away & push them too far. I try so hard to remain positive but I just cant right now

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 15:18:05	So fell asleep on the sofa last night, woke up at 2:50 got into bed where I tossed and turned for a while before going to sleep, was better
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 15:16:57	@WickedTheodora would have made more sense, and how many pillows do they think one person needs!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 15:15:26	@WickedTheodora don't see the point of that if your just going to get back into it :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 14:36:24	@barmybelle @Polarbear3127 @iloveianx I do the same, have logged off Facebook now on my phone and won't log back in for a while now x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:51:05	Can't stay awake any longer, off to bed I go night and thanks for chatting with me xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:47:30	@Polarbear3127 @iloveianx I'm sorry to hear it caused a relapse, its hard when you feel pressured to go back to work by the gov :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:45:54	@Polarbear3127 @iloveianx thank you, you have helped me to feel less alone, sorry your feeling the same :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:45:19	@Polarbear3127 @iloveianx mine was complicated, they bullied my whilst pregnant then rejected me when I went back after maternity leave :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:44:13	@Polarbear3127 @iloveianx true guess its hard to see it for what it really is :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:43:47	@Polarbear3127 @iloveianx to having a major relapse and not being able to cope. Feel stuck and pathetic that I can't hold down a job :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:42:09	@Polarbear3127 @iloveianx I think it's the photos that get me the most especially seeing old workmates and knowing I had to give that up due
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:37:04	@Polarbear3127 @iloveianx having spoken to you both I am seeing reality for what it is rather than letting my emotions rule.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:36:05	@Polarbear3127 @iloveianx it's like people are happy all the time and in a sensitive moment it makes me feel bad because I'm not happy, now
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:27:17	@iloveianx @Polarbear3127 more clearly now and know I was being irrational I guess.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:26:35	@iloveianx @Polarbear3127 thank you both, Facebook is a huge problem of mine, having your point of views has helped loads, can see things
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:19:49	@Polarbear3127 @iloveianx your both right and I should ignore it but its so hard, always seems so happy go lucky and I feel like why not me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:15:48	@iloveianx I am going to leave it alone for a while least till I'm in a better place. I think your right, it's a bloody competition on mine.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:12:05	@iloveianx feeling very sensitive and rejected. Hate it :( xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:11:03	@iloveianx I've thought about deleting it but need it to communicate with some people. I try not to go on it very often now but today I'm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:06:12	@iloveianx :'( everyone on fb seems to be happy and getting on with their lives I'm stuck, they have left me behind :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 05:03:42	Feel so alone :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 04:59:30	@georgina_557 thank you xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-04 00:08:35	@Sexy_eyes35 that's what I thought but clearly not, said something about the cheque being from a different area so takes 3 days :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 23:52:03	@iloveianx I do :( feel bloody awful, sorry your feeling like this xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 23:50:01	@iloveianx it is really tiring, I want to sleep all the time, yawning and have no energy or appetite x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 23:32:45	Moods plummeted again :( knew the slightly better feeling wouldn't last, gonna go curl up in a ball, and hide away :(

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 18:14:34	That's if we go out today. But have gotten dressed. Using skills and be willing. This has got to lift this depression!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 18:09:56	Looks like I'm going to have to change my bottom half, suns gone away and it doesn't look very inviting outside now. Really not fair!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 18:07:34	After self banning from bingo site I've had no withdrawals may self ban again once the 4 weeks are up.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 17:54:05	@Prettybones1990 @nuttylotte you can do it! #oppositeaction x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 16:29:40	@nuttylotte yep no motivation and feeling don't deserve to have a bath/be clean, acting opposite to thoughts today, depression won't beat me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 16:03:13	Looking after my personal hygiene today feel minging. Need to wash hair and sort monkey legs out if I'm going to wear shorts today!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 15:52:20	@nuttylotte morning x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 15:17:11	I don't know whether its the meds or what but I am feeling slightly better, psych said the sertraline could start working after a few days!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 15:16:09	I really really hope that the cheque that I'm waiting for comes today, retail therapy will be a great distraction #oppositeaction

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 02:17:41	@kaycey55 thank you xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 02:11:44	Since 2011/12 resulting in hospital, I don't want to go down that route again, I want to stay out of hospital. I'm just struggling so much.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 02:10:43	Just went out to get some parcels I hadn't been able to get for a while. Shaking the whole time out. :'( haven't had a depression this bad
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 02:07:22	Not giving in to the thoughts and urges I have right now. Nope nope nope I refuse to. :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 02:05:26	@Prettybones1990 if I lived near you I'd wanna spend time with you!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-03 00:08:19	Managed to have a little cry earlier, a certain song triggered it. Feel a little relief but could cry alot more :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 21:25:52	@freckles6127 aww silly twitter needs to behave x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 21:23:56	@freckles6127 my twitter app is doing the same thing x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 20:55:02	@Prettybones1990 sorry to hear you have it too its horrible x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 20:54:39	@will7201 thanks for the suggestion will try it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 20:34:40	I hate the inability to cry. I want to cry badly!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 20:34:02	@Polarbear3127 I'm trying, you too hang in there hope your appetite improves x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 19:59:36	@autiepower it is even trying to trigger crying by listening to songs isn't working :(

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 19:54:45	@Polarbear3127 :( not good, thank you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 19:54:28	@autiepower that's what I'm finding now its impossible :( just started on sertraline :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 19:34:40	Is it even possible to be so low but not have suicidal thinking. I can't even cry at the moment I want to but the tears aren't coming :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 18:43:54	Have just spoken to hub and asked him to read through some of my dbt skills so he will be able to skills coach me when I need it.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:50:03	So how is everyone this evening? I'm tweeting to keep distracted from my thoughts, so apologies for filling your timelines.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:48:10	How the BPD traits really were in force and how I wasn't using skills to get through. I am more aware now and will learn from this.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:47:30	Last night I wrote down all the potential triggers to my breakdown resulting in me having to give up work. It was interesting and I can see
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:46:10	Bother but you need to keep going! You can do this, you are strong enough and there is light, the darkness won't be there for long.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:45:06	You can do this Rayven you've been through depressions many times and come out the otherwise. I know now its tough and your wondering why
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:44:14	@silentlyana hope it helps, seeing cpn tomorrow and got many thoughts going round so trying to use cheer leading skills.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:43:24	@mycuriousmind yes a little pep talk, cheer leading skills x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:42:44	Your cpn will understand, you spoke to her Tuesday, told her how you feel, she knows now and your going to work with her to sort things out!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:41:17	@Huma101 thank you, it took hard work but glad I did.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:40:54	Stop catastrophising tomorrow, it will go ok and your allowed to cry, just tell the truth on how you feel, you can work through this it's ok
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:14:36	I want to have a #selfsoothe and #mindful bath but my stinky husband needs it more!! #smelly
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:12:56	Just a tweet to get me off 6,666 tweets!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 01:11:58	@myblackdogandi that's fab :) lovely scenery. I did have a good chat with my friend, it was hard but I'm glad I did it x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 00:42:05	Really glad I was able to go out, I did almost cancel but I fought the thoughts and did it. #oppositeaction worked!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 00:35:32	Feel awful with side effects from 50mg sertraline so am going to take half for a few days to get my body used to it then increase back to 50
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 00:32:50	Back they are so cautious now. Thankfully it was under control very quickly. Heart rate reducing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 00:31:23	Phew neighbours just had a fire needing the fire brigade, was waiting for the knock to evacuate, since the fire in a tower block few years
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-02 00:27:24	@myblackdogandi that's fab glad I was able to inspire you, did you enjoy your walk? :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 23:53:40	Went round to my friends and had a good chat & my son had fun back home and a little deflated & still feeling nauseous too #hatesideeffects
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 23:41:11	@W4tch3r_An0n aww thanks, glad your good. I'll get through just going to take some time xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 23:15:06	@W4tch3r_An0n hey I'm getting there, started sertraline yesterday, getting a few side effects need to bare with. How are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 16:16:16	Wearing all white today. Although my mood is dark my clothing doesn't have to be, plus white is cooler in the warmer weather!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 15:13:29	Rayven!! Don't succumb to the depression no matter how much you want to!! You ARE going out today it will do you good!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 14:29:31	@pickleslife *virtually knocks you out with said hammer* :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 14:27:34	@pickleslife after 5 years I'm not surprised! Need a sledge hammer to knock you out for a day ;)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 14:23:56	@pickleslife I understand that, they wanted me to do CBT but I wasn't well enough. Does seem a visit to dr psych is needed x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 14:20:04	@mycuriousmind morning x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 14:19:44	@pickleslife oh gosh no that's not good. Guess it's about finding what works through trial and error x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 14:05:45	@pickleslife again for a while and hopefully feel better and able to sleep easier.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 14:05:26	@pickleslife definitely sounds like a med change is needed. Just think see a psych for however long on one day don't have to worry about it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 14:02:13	@pickleslife that may be the best thing to do, and to help stabilise your mood a little too!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 13:58:01	@pickleslife thanks me too if not quetiapine will be added. That's a shame does winding down for an hour before bed help to calm your mind?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 13:55:57	Note to self! Don't take sertraline in the evening it doesn't make you sleepy in fact it does the complete opposite!! #numpty
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 13:54:17	@pickleslife oh no :( do sleeping meds help at all? Definitely! my insomnia is due to starting sertraline and taking it at the wrong time :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 13:50:32	@IamCarrieeeeee thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 13:50:08	@pickleslife it does suck! hope it goes for you! I'm going round a friends to sit in her garden and chat which will be good for me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 13:47:07	@pickleslife I'm depressed but trying to use dbt skills to get me through. And tired too silly insomnia! Good that you're alright.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 13:45:21	I have decided today I am going round my friends to sit in her garden and chat whilst the kids play in the paddling pool. #oppositeaction
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 13:43:25	@pickleslife morning how are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 13:15:06	I see its that thing called morning now, well proper morning anyway.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:40:08	Think I'm going to take sertraline earlier tomorrow and with food to avoid the nausea, this icky feeling is uncomfortable :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:38:18	I watch too much Disney junior :/ got the theme song to Henry hugglemonster going around my head!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:36:56	@WickedTheodora you can do this, hope they don't keep you waiting too long x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:33:13	@WickedTheodora I understand that, will you go home once you leave the hosp and go straight to bed? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:32:18	@WickedTheodora no need to apologise, twitter is an out let. You tweet away x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:31:30	@WickedTheodora if they don't help tonight, can you be honest with your cpn and see what s/he will do? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:30:16	@WickedTheodora your welcome, sadly it seems my body and mind doesn't want to do the sleep thing :/ xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:29:24	So I have insomnia bruxism a dry mouth, and a tremor all side effects said on PIL hate first side effects, feel rough on top of low mood :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:27:35	@WickedTheodora you right now causing you to be in distress, really hope they help you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:26:53	@WickedTheodora if you did take them would you seek treatment? I hope they offer you support or short admission, you have alot going on for
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:25:10	@WickedTheodora what do you have?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:24:38	@WickedTheodora sometimes you need that extra support, that's what they are for, why can't they see this. Please be safe xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:21:27	@WickedTheodora oh lovely if that fixed everything then you wouldn't have needed to go to ooh gp :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:20:26	@WickedTheodora lol could be that rare occasion that's called a quiet night for them ;) c
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:18:28	@WickedTheodora a hug in person. Xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:18:19	@WickedTheodora you will get through this, may not seem like it at the moment, but you can, wish we lived closer to each other could give u
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:14:56	@WickedTheodora thank you and hugs to you too xxx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:09:49	Guess whose got full on insomnia?? Oh yes that would be me then!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 09:05:03	@JogaLuce persevere,give it 2 weeks to get your body used to it mine went away after 2/3 days
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 07:57:54	@Rainy0Daze just started it today x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 05:15:57	I have a horrible headache wondering if its due to the sertraline or just coincidence :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 04:10:56	@Broken_Jigsaw you can do it :) and get your diabetes in control, you have a goal now which is achievable :-) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:57:18	@turquoisejulia thank you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:51:48	I have been invited round to a friends tomorrow and really want to go use the opposite action skill my son will play with other children too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:49:00	First day of taking sertraline fingers crossed it kicks in sooner than 6 weeks they usually say, psych said could be as early as a few days!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:47:24	@amanda_stand me too, make trips alot quicker and easier. Think the first non health related device scientists need to make is this!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:44:46	@amanda_stand give me a transporter any day!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:42:06	@WickedTheodora not near by but online x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:40:32	@ukschizophrenic say what?!? White English/welsh people face racism just as much as anyone else, that's really invalidating them saying that
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:37:22	@freckles6127 @thelilradish max Clifford says its a sensitive matter when questioned by media.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:36:09	@NatalieOxford have you heard of the Cambridge diet? This is a mainly liquid diet at least at first, get a consultant who can help too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:20:04	@NatalieOxford ah right, not sure you would get the approval to do it without seeing someone :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:17:56	@NatalieOxford could you speak to your dr about safely doing it? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:14:15	@NatalieOxford @Channel4 @DiabetesUK am watching it too x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 03:13:20	@freckles6127 @thelilradish apparently so been all over the radio today x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 02:39:32	It's still blumming nice to be asked ya no. Seems again putting all the effort in and getting sod all out of it. :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 02:38:59	Feel rejected by family right now, it's almost as if we don't exist when it comes to being asked to join for meals out, even if we can't go
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 01:55:09	@WickedTheodora if it will keep you safe too then do it. Hugs x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 01:52:39	@IamCarrieeeeee enjoy!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 00:46:18	@NatalieOxford thanks me too, hope that the evidence given will be enough for ESA too but still reckon they will send out form :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 00:45:11	Feel so shaky and frightened :( feel something bad is going to happen and I don't know what :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 00:43:07	Well the plan I had to help distract is in ruins, thought I had money on a DIY voucher but its expired so no painting the mural for me :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-08-01 00:37:38	@NatalieOxford this is to do with my dla claim and that a decision should be made within 8 weeks
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 23:37:40	I can't believe I got a text from the dwp they could have said that they would text, or maybe they did :/ do I start fearing my texts now?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 23:36:00	@barmybelle thinking of you hope the admission will help you, thinking of you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 22:53:36	Ok so dwp now text you to let you know they recieved your claim how long it will take and will text future updates :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 22:46:43	Just need to keep telling myself I will get through this episode, pick up new sertraline script in a bit, dunno when they will kick in :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 21:18:37	@silentlyana I fell pregnant, set the BPD off in full swing :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 21:16:37	@silentlyana this is what happened with my last job didn't help that my employers fed my issues then cause more when they rejected me when
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:30:20	@WickedTheodora @silentlyana that sounds a good plan :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:27:54	@WickedTheodora @silentlyana that's good that they are understanding, maybe try just an hour and once that's up see if you can do another 1
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:23:29	@WickedTheodora @silentlyana do they give you extra support too to help you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:22:09	@WickedTheodora @silentlyana least with volunteering you can leave if not feeling too good, but with employment you can hardly walk out :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:19:54	@freckles6127 I pronounce it pro-prana-lollol!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:18:34	@Bpdtan same here but with the pharmacy :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:16:30	@WickedTheodora @silentlyana fellow workers. With my aggression levels too high I'd likely get sacked for hitting someone and arrested :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:15:52	@WickedTheodora @silentlyana due to my last job and the fact that Im so angry with them that I can't think differently about future jobs and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:15:12	@WickedTheodora @silentlyana cause me to relapse so badly that i would end up in hospital or prison because of my aggression. This is all
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:14:18	@WickedTheodora @silentlyana go in your favour. I too think I should just get a job but every one is saying that I'm not ready and it will
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:13:26	@WickedTheodora @silentlyana if you have the support from your team behind you and who feel that work could result in relapse then that will
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:11:47	@silentlyana @WickedTheodora for work it would damage the health of both myself and others. :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:11:12	@silentlyana @WickedTheodora my ESA form so angrily, and with what my psych at the time said, I was considered under the rule if found fit
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:09:51	@silentlyana @WickedTheodora after filling the forms in for years with nothing changing then it gets repetitive what to write, I filled in
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:08:46	@WickedTheodora @silentlyana gives me mixed feelings until I look at it properly and if its the dreaded one it gets thrown back on the floor
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:08:04	@WickedTheodora @silentlyana I know, I'm waiting on a letter from dvla which is also brown so every time a brown letter comes through it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:07:16	@silentlyana @WickedTheodora just fill in the form theyve sent you, and if they say you've filled in the wrong one, tell them they sent u it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 20:06:12	@silentlyana @WickedTheodora to award ESA as well or will I have to fill in that ATOS form again :/

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 19:53:25	@jaynederench thank you.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 16:57:19	I am out of my flat for the first time in days only because hub is home and has forced me to, the depressive thoughts aren't helping however
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 16:35:02	@safeinwater thank you it does I may have to do this in a bit so wanted to make sure before I did. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 16:11:57	Help!!!! When you need to get the police to do a welfare check is it ok to call 999 to do so?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 15:55:21	A stuff neck?? What the blumming hell is one of those? I'm sure I meant stiff silly auto correct on iPhone!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 15:54:27	Woken up with a stuff neck, I didn't order that with my tossing and turning all night sleep, being awake half of it, insomnia is pants!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 15:52:51	@ALivingLie_ your welcome, I'll get there just don't know when :/ x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 15:49:24	@ALivingLie_ good morning, hope your home move goes smoothly x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 15:47:55	@IamCarrieeeeee I love this song!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 06:08:03	Was tired yawning head off get into bed wide awake grr time for mindfulness and hopefully relaxes me enough to sleep if only a little :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:31:57	@freckles6127 she's facing prison in September so may get mental health support inside. Me too bet they have a good ole laugh about us!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:29:50	@Polarbear3127 should have been struck off or sacked in my opinion.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:29:26	@Polarbear3127 :( that's really sad
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:27:51	@freckles6127 made an attempt on her life or self harmed. The team now don't want to help her, so she is on her own :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:27:20	@freckles6127 it's disgusting tht they think they can treat us this way. My niece was told that she was attention seeking because she hadnt
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:26:36	@AnjaHolst1 me too, struck off definitely. Not sure what's going to happen, named in the paper too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:25:30	@Polarbear3127 omg thats disgusting, it's taunts/opinions that can make a person feel so worthless they leave the hospital & kill themselves
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:22:25	@AnjaHolst1 in front of the patient/within earshot is very very wrong.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:22:06	@AnjaHolst1 I know it's disgusting, there is an investigation going on with this worker. Fair enough they have opinions but to voice them
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:18:42	@Polarbear3127 definitely! But I guess there is too much politics surrounding it that they have to be careful. Tho not sure id tell my story
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:17:11	@Glass1ncision I know I was so shocked when I read it yesterday. She was 136'd at one point and the unit didn't want to assess her either!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:13:20	Calling the young woman of being a f***ing waste of space. Not directly but to another person but in earshot of the woman.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:12:21	There was a article in my local paper where an inquest to a young woman's death is undergoing. A mental health worker has been accused of
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:10:33	But watching that program made me realise my local A&E is really good with mental health assessments, whether AAT or psychological medicine.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 05:09:04	Just watched that failed by the nhs program, in mixed minds shame it only focused on camhs and not adults, that's where I've been failed.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 03:05:38	@ALivingLie_ aw suppose that's a good thing, tho least you would grow into them if the event happened.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 03:04:17	@will7201 @IamCarrieeeeee I am honoured. Really pleased that you like it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:57:40	@ALivingLie_ wow, I've got several storage boxes of them, and have given many to charity shops, as gone up a size after pregnancy :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:56:13	@IamCarrieeeeee I agree it is very hard. Im trying go do the same Can easily tell someone else they will get through without believing it :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:46:51	@ALivingLie_ lol will need a cupboard just for them.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:43:13	@Prettybones1990 ah I remember you saying.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:40:43	@ALivingLie_ noo never can have enough!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:39:39	@Prettybones1990 she may not and just focus on the the session itself. Chain analysis are a nuisance but helpful too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:34:48	@Prettybones1990 ah right will a chain analysis result due to this?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:33:17	@turquoisejulia replied x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:31:03	@kaycey55 I'm going to get some too, see what it will do for me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:30:38	@Prettybones1990 hopefully your 1:1 will have a sense of humour too. You have an excuse, it's impossible to have bubble wrap and not pop it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:29:09	@kaycey55 hopefully you won't have to wait 2 years.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:27:55	So greedy I had my whole medium sized pizza and half of hubs too :o think it's comfort eating but I did like it tho so worth it I guess.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:24:54	@McMorag I built mine a few years back, with the help of hub mind but it was fun.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:20:48	@kaycey55 wow
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:15:38	@Prettybones1990 nope!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:15:29	@Prettybones1990 nope nope nope!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:14:58	@turquoisejulia gosh, what sort of therapy do you need? Seems you get fast tracked for dbt but anything else and you have to wait for it :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:13:04	@IamCarrieeeeee feeling like that myself at the moment :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:01:19	@kaycey55 hopefully you will get it I hear that it takes quite a while to get it and its a long process :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 02:00:40	@turquoisejulia wow that's a long time to wait :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 01:55:23	@NatalieOxford lol drawings for some, it's taken me 6 months to do it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 01:53:18	@turquoisejulia thanks cpn said its because she's still doing a report ready to send off. Maybe that's the case for you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 01:52:32	@Prettybones1990 good for you, I found it difficult to get my head around, wow that is soo hard not to pop them did you manage to afterwards
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 00:09:55	Diet going out the window thanks to Dominoes and two for Tuesday!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 00:08:49	@NatalieOxford thanks fingers crossed it will. Getting the paint tomorrow, need to decide on colours, will do progress tweets so you can see
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 00:06:56	Referral and help me to get on track, find the environmental causes for my mood and chain analyse to see what's happened this time round.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 00:05:42	She agrees with me regarding BPD traits and we are going to work on them using skills and homework, she's going to speed up the psychology
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-31 00:05:01	Just spoken to my cpn, I know I said I was in between them but I was honest with her & agreed to keep her as my cpn & work through things
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 23:20:36	Mindfulness time, new one putting thoughts in box and float down the river, hopefully I can do this one.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 23:18:52	Just need to remember that no matter how dark it seems right now there is light and it won't last forever, however unlikely it seems.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 22:34:14	Well psych phoned and we are adding sertraline to lamotrigine start at 50mg and go from there. Feel relieved that I will be on these tomoro
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 22:33:00	@will7201 glad you like

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 20:11:38	@will7201 I can give it a go.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 20:11:03	@NatalieOxford or rather it is on my sons wall at least the basic outline, need to paint some if it now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 20:10:36	@NatalieOxford yep it's going on my sons wall
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 20:10:21	Once my son is in bed for his nap I'm going to either have one too or do some drawings, need to help myself too, might draw my happy place.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 20:07:57	I miss my perinatal cpn least she did stuff for me and got it done quickly :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 20:03:39	@silentlyana yep not sure what type on my letter it just says bipolar affective disorder. Doesn't give a type.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 19:45:37	@silentlyana ah right.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 19:32:09	@turquoisejulia I can't go out and the rain is an excuse to why I can't, just can't face the world :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 19:30:02	@silentlyana other than that no side effects x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 19:29:54	@silentlyana at first it was great but it's not doing very much for my many episodes, even with increases. :( makes me a tad constipated but
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 19:26:01	@turquoisejulia that's what I've done today spoke to the person on duty and she's the one whose getting everything sorted for me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 19:25:18	@silentlyana lamotrigine at the moment waiting on a call from psych to add in more meds :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:48:33	Now in between care coordinators, spoke to team leader who is phoning my psych asking him to phone me ASAP She really listened & that helped
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:45:05	@silentlyana I'm in a depressive episode, I'm rapid cycling this year 3 hypomanias, 3 depressions and one mixed episode I feel like a yoyo
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:44:12	@turquoisejulia wrong for me to have to call asking for help, Ive lost faith but hopefully won't have to wait too long for a cpn.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:43:30	@turquoisejulia 14 months is a long time, it's wrong how long they leave you waiting, I don't ask for support only rarely so something is
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:42:47	@turquoisejulia I am now I between cpn's I have telephone support too. An emergency call to psych is being made for him to call me back. Wow
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:41:40	@silentlyana i know how you feel only that my hub knows how much I owe :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:41:15	@silentlyana that's fab it's always good to keep young x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:11:11	@silentlyana acting your age & being responsible are two different things, you can still have some inner youth it's balancing the two out :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:04:32	Not suicidal, I don't want to cross that level, I really don't, I want this sorted ASAP
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:03:51	I see cpn on Friday but is it unreasonable to ask for support earlier? I feel like I shouldn't ask for help. I'm at the lowest of low but
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:01:37	Hear from her by 4:30 to phone again and speak to her manager. Actually feel listened too now
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 18:00:42	Phoned CTT again the lovely receptionist this time said she would phone cpn and ask her to call me as I'm struggling, and that if I dont
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:59:48	@brokenmind_ sorry to hear this hope it helps being in hospital hugs x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:58:46	@jackychan2904 It was and I do I can't help it :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:58:15	@IamCarrieeeeee just feels that way when i was with perinatal services it seemed it was easier to get support/see a psych to sort out meds
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:46:46	My cpn doesn't give a damn about her clients or at least me, I'm asking for a change in cpn.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:46:19	Back to me, emergency psych appointments that are made 4 weeks after mentioning it, fortnightly visits despite struggling its seriously like
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:45:29	Why do I have the most awful mental health services. Everyone else gets support and help straight away. Me I'm left days before anyone gets
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:43:44	@turquoisejulia the thing is I'm asking for her to call me ASAP not for a bloody message to be left in her pigeon hole for when shes next in
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:40:17	@silentlyana they are fab and give advice to help you out for free and get your debts down in a legal way & saving you money in the process
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:39:06	@silentlyana clearing our debts, I have worked with debt collection agencies who like to intimidate. Have you tried http:// moneysavingexpert.com
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:38:27	@silentlyana including the new car we have just brought, now the pay day loan has gone we have our finances in order again and can start
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:37:50	@silentlyana of my mother in law bailing us out and us paying her the money back bit by bit. We have 10k of debt we are getting down, not
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:37:10	@silentlyana your welcome, it's hard being in debt, we got a payday loan at Xmas last year it's only this month we got out of it by the help
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:36:22	@silentlyana advice from advice services and use them for free and save your self money in the process x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:35:42	@silentlyana wow that's alot and just unfair on you to have to pay that, your debtors will have to wait a little longer, always best to get
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:05:24	@silentlyana @WickedTheodora contact cab ASAP that's wrong and they are taking mick doing that to you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:03:47	Am in tears with her kind words, they mean so much yet I feel so guilty like I don't deserve them :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:02:31	My friend replied saying that she sending hugs and love and that she will come and see me on Thursday and will take my son to the park too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 17:01:32	@silentlyana @WickedTheodora wow ouch yeah that's wrong
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:49:16	That I'm bipolar, feel so blumming awful right now, sat here in tears, just want to go back to bed, but can't need to be here with my son :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:48:31	Just told my friend the truth to why I can't go out today, now waiting for the response, don't know what she will reply tho she does know
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:46:52	@WickedTheodora ah right, guess the risk is too high :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:42:43	And I don't exactly want to be sharing out what's going on for me right now, especially with all the judgements and stigma :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:41:55	Got friends encouraging me to go out to a play thing for my son but worried if I do and cpn calls I'm not going to be able to speak :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:40:06	@Prettybones1990 aww personally no least not on its own.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:39:08	@WickedTheodora @BarrassBrough I think that's the best thing, if she won't fund the rent can you get a short term loan but not a pay day one
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:16:31	@barmybelle realised they were in the wrong and given a holiday.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:16:13	@barmybelle good that he's been told off, not good that the company wasnt compassionate about his wife being ill but good that they have
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:15:17	@WickedTheodora ah right that's good really
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:14:42	@WickedTheodora when I say you need to start standing up to her or she will always walk over you and undermine you. :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:13:42	@WickedTheodora ah right just say you brought it forward a couple of months, I know that's hard with the confrontation side, but trust me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:12:48	@barmybelle yep it was, the cleaning one was good too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:12:21	@WickedTheodora something for you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:12:06	@WickedTheodora that's the killer the first months rent up front and deposit. Keep on at the ha hopefully they will be able to provide
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:11:03	@barmybelle I saw that one, bless the guy when it sunk in tho he was really grateful. Let me know when you get to the end :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:09:46	@WickedTheodora when I lived with my mother and the environment was abusive and controlling x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:09:20	@WickedTheodora hear but then do the opposite and go by your decisions and in your mind you can have one up on her. I had to do this alot
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:08:38	@WickedTheodora ok if she does let her think she's taking charge, agree with what she's saying at face value, let her hear what she wants to
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:07:23	@WickedTheodora what about supported accommodation?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:06:58	@barmybelle omg that's just plan stupid, what did the boss say at the end, did the bloke get sacked.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:06:12	@WickedTheodora admitted again soon because it will cause distress :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:05:43	@WickedTheodora that's a good plan, you need to get out of your mothers home it's detrimental to your mental health and I can see you being
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 16:00:38	@WickedTheodora and it is causing me a great deal of distress which in the past has resulted in short admissions under the MHA.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 15:59:52	@WickedTheodora can you go to your council with a support worker/cpn and say because of my situation at home, I'm going to become homeless
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 15:58:45	@barmybelle I watch undercover boss and it does surprise me how people don't click on. Same as secret millionaire.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 15:57:11	Woke up to work men talking and drilling this morning, lovely! And it's raining outside. Spending the day in my Mickey Mouse onsie pjs.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 15:54:28	@kaycey55 hey, sounds like your very sensitive to side effects. Do you get Medicaid or similar? X

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:56:04	@kaycey55 that's fab that pot worked for you. Side effects of meds are hard to deal with and not worth the effort sometimes
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:54:38	@kaycey55 that's good that it helped can you get it for medical reasons? Sadly it doesn't work for me just causes psychosis :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:53:24	@kaycey55 that's exactly what i do too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:52:02	@kaycey55 its pot luck what you get now a days like a postcode lottery, have been told the same here :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:51:05	@kaycey55 the shakiness is unbearable at times, but good for you for teaching your dog that's amazing :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:49:49	@kaycey55 to do with body clock and what can cause an off balance and cause relapse.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:49:12	@kaycey55 I don't know maybe it is the cooling down of the weather or a mid season change. Read something about circadian cycle...
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:47:13	@kaycey55 yep it's like playing Russian roulette with out lives!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:46:45	@kaycey55 glad your doing better now, can you set an alarm to help you remember to take your meds? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:45:45	@kaycey55 doesn't surprise many are sent to private units because the nhs ones are full :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:44:30	Every part of my body feels so heavy like I can't move anything bar my fingers, I'm stuck till this wears off its uncomfortable :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:42:35	@kaycey55 lol aww bless

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:39:33	@kaycey55 aww bless, no worries, yep did get a tweet :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:38:21	@kaycey55 those moments are horrible, you can't control the rage but the guilt that follows breaks your heart, me neither :( x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:35:12	@NatalieOxford night Hun x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:34:46	@kaycey55 that's something to think about. Thanks you too. I feel I'm rapid cycling going nowhere fast just torment and tears :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:33:20	@jackychan2904 being aware of what my son is like and not wanting him to touch things he shouldn't, but I think I was/am in denial a tad :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:31:57	@jackychan2904 that's what the doc said, she noticed how on edge I was with my son lose in the wrong, touching everything, I blamed it on
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:30:42	@kaycey55 sorry to hear your having a bout too I'm sure the hot sun to this cooler darker weather during the day isn't helping the situation
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:24:46	Depression is so kicking my butt right now Usually when I wake I have a period of time to come round before head kicks in not today it seems
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:22:31	Why am I awake FFS don't want to be with my thoughts but don't want to dream either!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 09:20:47	And I'm awake
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 04:56:16	I don't consciously realise I'm anxious or feeling anxious, anyone here know what the hell I'm on about?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 04:54:45	Said to me that my joint pain and muscle pain is purely due to anxiety and that anxious all the time. I don't know if I agree or not because
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 04:54:02	Yesterday whilst sorting out veg for freezing, I started shaking uncontrollably, I consciously felt ok but couldn't stop the shakes a gp has
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 03:20:24	@act1175 thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 02:22:21	@mycuriousmind it is :-) I get so into it when i do mindfulness I can smell the grass and feel the air, i let all my senses get involved :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 02:20:56	@DanielleHark I've distracting by using art, designed and drawn a mural on my sons bedroom wall, Mickey Mouse clubhouse theme :-) thanks
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 02:16:49	@mycuriousmind yeah thinking of my happy place, observing and describing :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 02:15:34	Float around. Looking to the sky it's a gorgeous blue, with whispy clouds here and there. It's warm with a gentle breeze.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 02:14:24	A green meadow, birds twittering, bunnies jumping through the grass, water flowing through mini waterfalls smell the flowers butterflies
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 02:12:27	I'm addicted to meringue nests yum yum yum, a self soothe treat, can't eat it mindfully tho it breaks apart to quickly.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 02:10:56	@act1175 thanks I've designing and drawn part of a mural on my sons bedroom wall, sat watching Disney junior with him atm going to blog soon
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 02:05:53	Nothing will be triggering as I won't voice anything of that nature as its not fair on tweeps who are struggling themselves.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 02:05:11	Tonight twitter I am struggling so any helpful thoughts I have to make myself cope, distract etc will be voiced, random ramblings etc
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 02:03:57	Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out. Feel calm.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 01:53:33	I feel really upset that my cpn didn't bother to call me today, I swear I've had enough now, everyone else has great mh services except me!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 01:02:54	So guess who didn't call........
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-30 01:02:22	@WickedTheodora thank you :-) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 23:53:04	oh and self banned from the bingo site, I will get on top of things, oh and yeah cpn hasn't bothered to call yet, shes got 40 minutes!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 23:52:10	well that's the design for my sons bedroom mural done now just to transfer it from paper to wall, that's the hard bit!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 19:17:54	and my neighbours are at each others throats again....
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 19:04:53	@WickedTheodora thank you :) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 19:04:00	those of you who want to know whether a storm is near you or will be leaving you soon search netweather lightning and the website is great.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 19:02:52	@WickedTheodora if I struggle or get tempted is it ok to ask you for help regarding it, but only if your in a place to be able to?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 19:00:27	@Prettybones1990 that's very true, definitely worth doing just to rule it out :) thanks for the suggestion :) how are you? x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:58:28	@Prettybones1990 that's a good idea will do that in a bit, and see if I can find something, not sure if its just part of bipolar tho :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:53:24	@WickedTheodora the right way to go to make sure I don't gamble it all away, going to self ban on hubs account too just to avoid temptation.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:52:54	@WickedTheodora thank you, I need to get a grip on this, having control of the money for the next few months I definitely think self ban is
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:43:49	@WickedTheodora will self ban for 4 weeks that way I cant get on it and lose money, plus just got £745 from ppi claim so need to quickly :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:42:24	@WickedTheodora that's an interesting thought, hadn't considered it like that before.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:41:16	asked CTT to get cpn to call ASAP this was at 9am, still nothing, bet she doesn't get the message till tomorrow or Wednesday!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:37:01	bloody hell just worked out in the past 2 weeks ive put on nearly £200 on bingo, I did have a £90 win but seem to be putting it back on :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:35:39	@WickedTheodora that hub says to me oh you can have x amount today or have a go, I have no self control :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:35:14	@WickedTheodora this addiction has really taken hold, my mother was a gambler but I swore to myself I would go down that route, doesn't help
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:32:45	@WickedTheodora bingo site tombola, reached my £100 limit sat so used hubs account yesterday and back to mine today :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:31:49	@WickedTheodora am self banning after this I have to!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:30:12	just cant bloody help myself :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 18:29:17	so gambling again, reached my limit Saturday fresh week today :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 16:41:58	@Prettybones1990 thanks I haven't a clue Hun I seem to be rapid cycling at the moment, its really testing me, do think weather isn't helping
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 16:26:19	Going to stop filling everyone timeline up now and shut up :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 16:25:56	It hasn't hit the self harm/suicidal urges, and I'm trying my hardest not to let it get that way.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 16:24:52	Low mood, agitated, restless, stressy, go from eating everything to not eating at all and back again. Classic depression I know, thankfully
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 16:23:35	Don't think the weather change here is helping much, that's effecting me alot, just want to sleep all the time, lost interest in things, Los
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 16:22:02	But it's just not as easy when it comes to going out, I am going to try and do something around the flat just haven't a clue what to do yet!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 16:21:14	Hate letting people down feel like I'm doing it all the time, I just can't face going out at the moment. I know opposite action and all that
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 16:14:21	Wish I had said yes last Friday as would have the meds now :/ I feel so low right now and I hate it. I need to have something to boost me up
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 16:13:25	Have decided to go the add sertraline to the lamotrigine and go from there route rather than make an appointment with a psychiatrist.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 06:15:53	Moods dipped again hope it improves tomorrow
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 05:27:36	@Fallingstar_x it's your birthday? happy birthday to you :-) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 05:11:58	@IamCarrieeeeee night sleep well x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 05:02:50	#bpdchat tonights chat has helped me to identify some areas I need to work on in the near future as a mini goal, maybe revisit full dbt.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:56:47	@theborderline94 that's fab thank you will be using this a lot I think #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:54:46	@theborderline94 that sounds really helpful, what sort of skills are on it? #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:52:37	@CarlDunnJr #bpdchat this is something I am working so hard on right now, its a difficult skill for me but one I hope to accomplish soon
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:47:43	@Girl_Interrupt_ @Patient_Leader #bpdchat I have found that doing something slow but positive/self soothing helps to slow my thoughts
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:40:10	@OfficialBPDChat #bpdchat well for me its doing the opposite action to what I want to do so use list if depressed and just want to sit down
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:36:42	@OfficialBPDChat #bpdchat its also a opposite action list because I tend to just sit allday then feel guilty ive done nothing to help myself
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:33:29	#bpdchat back its just lightning nothing interesting really :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:32:57	@OfficialBPDChat I have a magic 7 list, includes, get dressed, take meds, brush teeth, comb hair, & 3 housework chores which helps #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:20:43	going to have to leave #bpdchat as there is a thunderstorm and I love watching them. chat soon
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:18:31	@OfficialBPDChat #bpdchat yes they are, my ultimate goal I think is to live contently with bpd and bipolar kept in tow with skills and meds
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:17:08	#bpdchat I think using a wrap plan will also help me to achieve my mini goals, that and having coaching from my cpn and chain analysis.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:15:39	@OfficialBPDChat I have many mini goals before I get to the big main goal, but for now, its utilising my skills so they become second nature
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 04:14:18	@McMorag well one of my fav celebs is stephen fry as he is inspirational. #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 03:57:56	@PositivitySmile thanks I will :) oh no that's a shame, enjoy the dvd when you dig it out :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 03:55:34	@PositivitySmile its on watch right now :)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 03:49:51	@barmybelle me too cant help it, hub knows it word for word
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 03:48:53	@barmybelle nowt wrong with that at all :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 03:48:33	If you wanna be somebody If you wanna go somewhere, you better wake up and pay attention
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-29 03:47:34	@barmybelle am watching it too love it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 20:46:58	@turquoisejulia good that you were able to catch up on your sleep a little. Haha me too trying being the main word here lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 20:16:59	So how is everyone this afternoon?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 20:15:01	Quite fit, so I'm trying to find an even balance between the whole lot. I know having a bit of inner child is good but then there's me!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 20:12:09	I actually think the fashion aimed at teens and young adults is good and I want it but as a 28 year old who's trying to act her age it dont
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 20:11:16	Had a thought earlier, when I was young I thought like a grown up and tried to be a grown up now as an adult I'm a bit childish in nature.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 16:08:40	Morning had a 10 hr sleep now feel dozy lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 05:10:16	Right am actually off to bed now early but need sleep night all xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 05:07:45	@W4tch3r_An0n hey been feeling low trying to use skills waiting on psych app, been retail therapy today. How are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 05:04:10	@brokenmind_ if you lived down here you'd either be sent to a low secure unit in London for years on end or sent to a private prison :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 05:01:04	@brokenmind_ down here my niece is facing prison because of mental health issues but is refused psych help, doesn't make sense :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 04:56:16	I'm going to bed in a bit even a sugar rush from 3 meringues didn't give me much energy. Prob best as reading a good book hasn't helped much
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 02:53:13	Cpn says Monday when I call her first thing. Think I need something ASAP
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 02:52:10	Get your head together rayven geez right distract for a while, maybe the offer of sertraline with lamotrigine wasn't a bad idea, see what
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 02:50:08	@Glass1ncision wish I was alone in that Boat and no one else was suffering. It sucks big time :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 02:45:49	@Glass1ncision thank you I will try, it's trying to believe that they will go away that's hard bit :/ x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 02:35:01	@SophieSheldrick yep going to read more of the book I've been reading and self soothe with a foot bath, might ask hub for back rub lol xxx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 02:31:51	@Glass1ncision thank you wish I could see it myself :( your right they are and can't be shut up either :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 02:29:38	@Glass1ncision sorry to hear that hope Things get easier for you xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 02:29:09	@SophieSheldrick it's ok it's helped :-) thank you :-) I'm trying, battling the wilful/negative thoughts and trying not to let them win :/xx

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-28 02:26:55	Think a strongbow may help for today, only one can, that's all I can cope with but just enough to mellow me out a touch, not ideal I know!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:59:08	@NatalieOxford conversation. So how are you doing? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:58:54	@NatalieOxford snap it's not nice, I try to tweet everyone who tweets me in order of tweets received and always reply or favourite if end of
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:31:08	than keeping my mouth shut from now on?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:30:30	is it right that I have this non sugar coated straight up attitude, not egotistic but just fed up of the bull and telling home truths rather
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:25:13	@turquoisejulia thanks, not dm'd this is basic tweeting but if im ignored then im ignored, people cant seem to handle how I am anymore!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:24:19	@oxymoronic82 no worries fingers crossed for you that it will help you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:23:47	@FemalePTSD ouch can really sympathise with you, find walking on it does ease the pain and tightness x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:20:44	@oxymoronic82 that I don't experience as bad a dream, if that makes sense.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:20:26	@oxymoronic82 aw hugs, does reading or watching something good before bed help? ive found that if I go to bed with good thoughts and feeling
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:19:37	oh damn it I forgot to take my morning meds despite setting alarms... goes and takes meds
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:18:02	@SophieSheldrick thanks I love being able to do retail therapy can see my hubby leaving me in town and coming home because he will get bored
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:16:59	@FemalePTSD oh yes definitely especially when you have it in the middle of the night and kick out and then pull the blumming muscle, owwie!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:15:36	@oxymoronic82 glad you have had lots of cuddles to make up for the nightmares you have had, its hard but remember they are just bad dreams x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:14:35	I don't tweet enough I don't think, but when I tweet others I swear they aren't getting notifications that ive tweeted them
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:12:28	mickey mouse ride on, id forgotten about that and the fact it had a hidey seat lifty up thingymabob. I now have a messy flat, grr!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:11:30	turned my flat upside down over the past 2 days looking for the rather expensive clark shoes id brought for my son, they were hidden in his
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:10:18	Ive decided that today happiness is going to rule no matter what I choose my feelings no one else has any right to decide for me its my life
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:09:22	At the end of the day if people don't like the home truths they shouldn't lie about themselves!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:08:36	good reason too, but why are the thoughts still floating around in my head, habit maybe? im trying to form this straight up attitude now
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:07:57	im trying to challenge the thoughts in my head that are related to rejection. I really shouldn't care what has happened, I caused it and for
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 18:06:32	I love having money & being able to spend going shopping later haven't a clue what to buy but as I've lost weight it will be clothes Im sure
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 17:58:35	Every time I stretch and yawn on my sofa I hit the gigantic picture on the wall behind me, one day the thing is going to land on my head!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 17:55:45	'Choice, not chance determines one's future, so choose well'
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 05:12:23	@FrazerNorris wow best get some sleep then!! :-) Thanks for chatting and clearing the air too :-) you take care!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 05:09:57	@brokenmind_ glad to hear your back home now :-) have missed you on here x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 05:08:30	@FrazerNorris worth making the use of it :-) set yourself mini goals before making a end result goal and you'll see how far you've come :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 05:05:50	@FrazerNorris it's something I was taught during dbt therapy and to do when your being wilful, it's surprising how much you feel different.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 05:04:41	@FrazerNorris could you start doing some gentle exercises then build yourself back up? When you feel awful use opposite action skills.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 05:03:11	@FrazerNorris fingers crossed for you that the same can happen.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 05:02:52	@FrazerNorris i know someone who has lost alot of weight whilst taking depakote using a slimming world diet and exercise, can be done :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 05:01:36	@FrazerNorris don't they just! I just can't handle the side effects, been on lamotrigine the longest of 7 months everything else lasts weeks
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:58:07	@FrazerNorris this them I'm worried I'll be fighting a losing battle :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:57:52	@FrazerNorris that's a slow increase then that could be managed with a healthy diet and exercise? I'm starting a slimming club and if I take
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:57:07	@FrazerNorris 56lbs in 5 months I lost half of it, need to lose the other half now :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:55:55	@FrazerNorris wow that's a considerable amount of weight increase was that over a long time or very quickly? I was on olanzapine and put on
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:50:19	@FrazerNorris is it the epilim that makes you sedated? Read its a side effect, not being happy with meds has made me non compliant at times.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:49:19	@FrazerNorris typical most anti depressants, most havent been on for long, so need to clean slate and start again really :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:48:44	@FrazerNorris ideas for what works, I've been on alot of meds all mood stabilisers apart from depakote, most a typical anti psychotics some
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:47:47	@FrazerNorris me neither :) I'm currently just taking lamotrigine but been told that it interacts with too many other meds so needing fresh
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:45:05	Freaked out by one of my sons toys randomly going off blumming made me jump!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:44:02	@FrazerNorris that's fair enough that it did, kinda the same for me, wrongly assumed you had seen enough of my tweets recently. My bad :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:41:19	@FrazerNorris but just a little extra I also have BPD traits so have the mood swings from that as well as bipolar if that makes sense.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:40:10	@FrazerNorris I think I need to apologise, I'm sorry my phone didn't notify me of your first tweet so I took the tweet in the wrong context
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:36:55	I snapping at everyone and getting rather pissed off at myself
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:36:24	I am in a foul mood!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-27 04:35:44	@FrazerNorris um excuse me but I have actually been diagnosed with bipolar thank you, so don't tweet me having a go ok!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:45:07	@harmon_lj that's a good plan thank you for chatting to me :-) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:44:42	@GiraffesSong nope just cpn and psych apparently a referral is being made but I haven't a clue when or if its actually been made yet :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:44:04	@harmon_lj I'm going to write some things for my personal blog which I'm trying to keep positive yet straight up & away from my rayven blog
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:42:40	@GiraffesSong yep that's me all over :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:41:50	@harmon_lj will speak to cpn about it when I see her in a week or so time :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:41:25	@harmon_lj did it with the mental health team and since then everything has changed I wouldn't know who to get it from now :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:39:56	@harmon_lj he can't as he is the site supervisor and works 45 minutes away so not able to do it :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:39:08	@harmon_lj I haven't done dbt for 5 years now maybe I should make one and go from there with it, or ask to redo dbt. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:33:55	@harmon_lj I don't have a dbt cd, what's one of those? I'm interested where can I buy them?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:33:01	@harmon_lj hard when he works 7-5:30 week days so only when he is on holiday could he see them & that's pointless because he won't see them
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:31:57	@autiepower it's prob easier to say what I haven't been on, I've tried so many that I'm at a loss now :/ maybe need to retry some :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:30:50	@autiepower that's good to hear glad it works well for you
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:30:24	@harmon_lj this hard work with dbt and he doesn't get it and won't help me to help myself and put the skills into action :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:29:50	@harmon_lj that could be it ya know, told hub I felt invalidated by him and he said sorry and didn't realise but it's like I've done all
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:28:52	@harmon_lj is when I need to be using skills and putting things into action and not cause myself any distress by being wilful
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:28:16	@harmon_lj have got my son to look after so he takes up most of my attention except when he's in bed that's when things go to pot :( so that
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:27:08	@harmon_lj like this, think there is something out of control just don't know what, :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:26:48	@harmon_lj that's very true, Im just trying to work out why I'm being impulsive and what am I running from and ignoring usually why I'm like
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:25:02	@harmon_lj you say I'm going to self soothe and distract from it :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:24:46	@harmon_lj I'm going to self ban which means I can ban myself for 4 weeks which is good and I only use this one site as its the best. And as
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:23:29	@autiepower is the combo working for you? I think I need a mood stabiliser just can't be lamotrigine anymore as interacts with other meds :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:22:06	@barmybelle @autiepower don't blame you but need to to get meds sorted catch 22 situation :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:21:41	@autiepower thanks will keep this in mind :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:21:25	@StillHopefulMom glad that works for you and you have that support. Thanks :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:21:01	@harmon_lj it's impulsive nature doing it cause I can and have the money and then getting angry when don't win :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:20:17	@autiepower need a med change sort out and to get that I need contact :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:19:55	@autiepower mine don't even do that just call everyone attention seeking and label BPD! I try to avoid them as much as I can but I know i
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:18:54	@GiraffesSong it's impulsive doing if cause I can and have the money to, but not winning and getting angry :/ def self banning :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:12:46	Those of you with Bipolar or a mood disorder what works for you, med combinations etc?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:12:14	interactions with other meds and that I cant take anything like prn with it apparently, going to have to change meds me thinks to what tho?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:11:11	guess that is the harsh reality of things tho isn't it, pass me on to psych let him deal with me, I hate that Lamotrigine has so many
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:09:49	trying to top myself, im not in need of help, I swear with this trust unless you do something very serious with your life they don't care!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:09:09	oh yeah so tell cpn things haven't been too good and she doesn't even suggest moving the appointment closer, what because im not sh'ing or
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 23:08:14	I need to get hold of myself, im gambling too much at the moment and I need to stop think im going to have to ban myself from this site :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 20:49:58	sertraline but im worried about the manic switch and really don't need to be manic right now, nice and stable and in control, that's needed!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-26 20:49:05	so cpn is making me an emergency appointment to see the psych, as somethings not right and we need to sort out meds, could have added in
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 20:15:18	Just filled in my dla form as my current claim ends before feb next year I still claim dla instead of pip incase anyone asks
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 20:14:31	@Prettybones1990 ah right that makes sense really, can you take any pain relief stronger than para or co codamol? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 16:27:57	@IamCarrieeeeee @barmybelle my psych first told me 200mg but recently said 400mg I'm on 250mg.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 16:22:33	@IamCarrieeeeee @barmybelle butting in my psych said that can go to 400mg for bipolar sometimes higher if needed.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 16:15:23	@Prettybones1990 maybe trying the pill will help to regulate your periods will also help your mental health x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 16:14:36	I feel so horrible why does this happen to me. The one day I actually need her and she's not about, the one flipping day it's not fair!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 16:13:17	The one day I need my cpn and she's on leave my psych isn't in and I have no one on to talk to, and the years won't stop I rarely phone her
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 16:09:24	Oh fanflippingtastic ring CTT and cpn is off on annual leave :( feel like crap :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 16:06:25	I need to sort myself out, going to ring CTT in a bit see if I can speak to cpn moods dropped considerably and I need to sort this out :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 16:04:41	@Prettybones1990 yep mood drops alot :( the pill helps to regulate things a touch but in my pill free week it goes to pot :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 15:21:55	Maybe I should just be submissive & do everything, clean, cook, entertain our son do the washing well you get the gist. No arguments then :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 15:18:36	For what I've done, no it don't work that way and this place is a mess but that's my problem and I've just got to deal with it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 15:17:47	Look after a 20month old toddler, entertain him, play games. Whilst he can come in from work junk his stuff down with no respect for me or
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 15:16:31	Could allow me to stand up for myself, and not be a walk over, he reckons because I'm home all day I should so all the housework as well as
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 15:15:40	To shut up thus being more invalidating so yeah the guy whose been continuous and helped me alot clearly doesn't like me using skills that
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 15:14:06	Doesn't have to change or help me, he can continue to invalidate me, despite me telling him what he's doing. Tho most times he just tells me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 15:12:49	And he can't get why I'm peeved with him, as if my feelings aren't justified, so invalidating, it seems I'm supposed to use my skills but he
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-24 15:11:33	I can't go out as waiting for parcels but he the f'ing prick couldn't be bothered to go and get his son some milk, now he's gone to work FFS

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 22:30:17	obviously that was just said in anger but the neighbours running in like I was some psychotic rampaging lunatic was hilarious, couldn't stop
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 22:29:28	the day before I moved out, we had the most horrendous argument had the neighbours all trying to butt in. Told her I wanted to kill her!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 22:28:35	just remembering the arguments I used to have with my mother and calling her an old bat, and other things, she deserved it all! haha

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 06:00:26	@amanda_stand I guess that sometimes it takes a repair to realise how much you were using the laptop/phone etc x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 05:56:55	@amanda_stand bet you miss it, I wouldn't function without my laptop/phone, my ipad screen is smashed so its unusable but was glued to that

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 05:11:21	@littlepumacub without knowing the situation I'm unable to advise you any further :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 05:09:56	@BPDFFS was good to be apart of #bpdchat again
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 05:02:47	@BPDFFS thank you it was really helpful #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 05:01:22	@littlepumacub #bpdchat could you maybe re evaluate what this person meant to you and the situation that has caused you to feel this way?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:55:45	#bpdchat recovery I found having people around who are healthy for me helped I have distanced myself from those who weren't very good for me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:54:00	@littlepumacub #bpdchat I hope it does too for you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:52:17	@littlepumacub #bpdchat , radical acceptance! accept that it happened even if I hate the situation, notice how I feel observe and let it go.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:51:12	@IamCarrieeeeee your welcome :) #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:50:09	@PhilipRankin I had periods where I felt like this, but thankfully I havent felt like it for awhile now I do believe that recovery does help
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:48:28	@littlepumacub glad you had that supportive relationship to help you to face it #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:47:49	@IamCarrieeeeee yep and your one of them :) without realising it just reading your tweets helps #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:44:58	@IamCarrieeeeee #bpdchat thank you the twitter community has helped me to notice when im exhibiting bpd behaviours and help me to use skills
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:42:36	#bpdchat I found having a dream/hope has helped me as well with many things knowing that one day I will find the light has kept me going!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:39:51	@littlepumacub @BPDFFS #bpdchat thank you I hope that you get it :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:38:42	#bpdchat I think one of the best things I have done is accept the bpd diagnosis and use skills, ive noticed I am using skills everyday now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:36:13	#bpdchat ive hidden from bpd insisted that I don't meet the criteria when the truth is I do along side the bipolar I denied it due to stigma
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:33:30	@BPDFFS #bpdchat thank you
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:32:32	@BPDFFS #bpdchat he has been the one continuous person to stay and prove to me that not everyone abandons/rejects me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:29:31	#bpdchat Ive got a very supportive husband who has been with me and through everything for 9 years in a few weeks time, he has saved me!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:19:11	@Girl_Interrupt_ I have and im redesigning it to fit with my life now, I do have an pdf version too. #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:18:15	@BPDFFS @McMorag definitely! I think its unrealistic to expect everything to be handed to me I have to work hard for what I want. #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:13:17	@BPDFFS for me recovery means to be at peace with myself, using skills and living a happy life. #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:09:52	@Glass1ncision me too, give me a snake any day, spiders on the other hand, I will run away screaming. #bpdchat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 04:09:12	@BPDFFS nope he harmless, hes gone for me but his teeth are blunt at his current age even when fully grown he'll just nip us #bpdchat

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 00:31:41	my dream, is to live in a world that accepts me for who I am, to be the best mother, wife and friend I can be, to be euthymic.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 00:26:12	I believe we can change anything. I believe we can rise above this. I believe there's a reason for everything.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 00:25:13	I read the stories, see the photographs. World's in a crazy space. I've got to hold on to my dreams; There's just no other place.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 00:24:38	I've been out walking for hours. I've got something on my mind. How did we get here? where are we going? And why is life so hard?

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-22 00:00:21	@oxymoronic82 that's ok it's not for everyone's taste :)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-21 23:00:11	@mycuriousmind I think I was born in the wrong era!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-20 22:37:11	@RayvenMental that should say us not is stupid auto correct!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-20 22:36:41	I want to scream out to those who judge is and say "so what I have a mental illness, 1 in 4 do so don't say I'm the only one you know!!"
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-20 22:35:40	That comes with its own setbacks cause when there is a point where I can't hide anymore people don't take me seriously as "Ive been so well"
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-20 22:34:32	Functioning even in my lowest hours and high ones too. I can hide it so well and make people believe I'm alot weller than I actually am tho
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-20 22:33:28	I've realised I've come so far from where I was and some things have made me realise I'm one of the lucky ones! Guess I've always been high

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 05:21:19	@turquoisejulia yeah but I feel so guilty and he should just take my son and leave, cause I don't ever want to cause him that pain again!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 05:12:57	Yeah anyone else finds out that they made their partner suicidal due to their behaviour and people give support, when its me no one cares!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 05:05:09	So yeah what a complete fuck up of a wife I am!!!!!!! A*grade fuck up!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 04:47:49	So asked hub if he finds my bipolar/BPD traits challenging and he said no not anymore but there was a time he was suicidal because of me :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 03:35:11	@freckles6127 it's what everyone's been saying down here in the south :/ just want a thunderstorm to clear the air a little x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 03:18:32	@freckles6127 your most likely right. I'm ok ty a tad warm due to the heat meant to be hot for two more months yet :o x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 03:15:19	@barmybelle I know but hopefully we will have a huge thunderstorm to clear the air at some point and make it more bearable x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 03:13:19	@barmybelle glad your ok yeah this heat is getting to me now, meant to be here for 2 months more now :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 03:11:55	@barmybelle fingers crossed, she hasn't got back to me yet, trying to think that she's prob busy asleep or hasnt seen her phone. How's you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 03:05:55	@freckles6127 tis true have sent a text but not heard anything yet :( thanks for hugs :) how are you? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 02:58:44	@aweebithopeful gave one lot of sarnies to my son for lunch, the other is still in the fridge make him take them tomorrow they should be ok
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 02:57:09	@aweebithopeful ah right I get you. It's great your making them the night before, can just grab and eat. Should do the same really :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 02:54:40	@mycuriousmind me too fingers crossed she will text me and let me know either way x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 02:53:52	@aweebithopeful I made a sandwich for my hub for lunch only for him to leave it at home too :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 02:52:37	Ok so text and asked the question hope she is ok with me and I haven't upset her or nowt.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 02:48:40	Family and other friends and I really should just get a grip of myself and use my wise mind! Right analysis in progress!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 02:47:33	I'm scared that if I have peeved her off that she will end our friendship but logic is saying she's prob just busy with her freedom & seeing
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 02:46:34	She actually is, two best friends with BPD may not be a good thing but we know each other & I'm sure I'm just being irrational & I will ask.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 02:45:31	I've been fighting this rejection issue all day think my best friend is peeved with me and I know I should just ask but I'm scared to incase
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-18 02:42:14	Had one pint of strongbow and I'm woozy I'm such a light weight! Ha!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 19:02:53	@SmileyPeanuts hello :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:53:29	@zoe_bearx I think it's where I have my tweets made private. Going to change that as did it when paranoid :/ x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:45:51	@TinyO_oRatty omg you are so brave I would have screamed and ran about shaking just imagining it is making me cringe.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:43:17	@zoe_bearx aw ty shame twitter decides what you can and can't retweet :/ how are you? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:41:34	@barmybelle @is_cam_24 well you are, just being you which is amazing :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:39:59	@barmybelle can say if we lived closer I'd go out for a coffee and chat with you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:37:56	@barmybelle @is_cam_24 i understand, it takes time to get used to the fact people can actually like you and want to be your friend.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:36:42	My 6000th tweet goes out to all my twitter followers if ur struggling I hope that things ease up for u & if your doing ok thats fantastic :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:34:44	@barmybelle whether twitter or rl you do have friends, and loads of us :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:33:16	@amanda_stand @nuttylotte glad things are seeming more positive, if you speak to her again can you tell her I'm thinking of her please x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:18:20	@silentlyana I'm doing good today thanks, playing nurse for hub he has heat stroke and feeling poorly :( x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:17:49	@silentlyana done on getting this far, guess also its getting used to coping with new skills instead of the behaviours you were doing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 04:17:04	@silentlyana guess getting used to being "normal" and everything that entails is rather daunting at first until we get used to it, but well
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 03:38:18	@amanda_stand @nuttylotte how is she doing?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 03:37:41	@mycuriousmind that's good! I'm ok ty playing nurse again, hubs got heat stroke and is poorly too :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-17 03:34:27	@mycuriousmind waves back too :)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-16 22:10:01	@silentlyana things have been quite tough, ive just come out of a mixed episode and battled with norovirus. and as you know bpd playing up.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-16 22:09:12	@silentlyana will definitely let you know if I find out a way,just guess distancing yourself is the best way forward to stop any hurt :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-16 22:08:18	@silentlyana it all and don't feel im with everyone now, like up to date and so much has gone on with others, and I feel out of the loop.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-16 22:07:17	@silentlyana hey thanks for the tweets your right its where I haven't been talking to others on here I think its because ive lost touch with
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-16 01:47:57	Feel very ashamed of my scars tonight, I wish they weren't there at all. I hate them, the reasons behind them. I hate myself for doing that!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-16 01:07:26	@NatalieOxford thanks hun, sorry that you know the feeling too hugs xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-16 01:07:00	@Love_my_Westie could change but no point people would still know its me and stuff sticking with this one.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-16 01:06:04	@AshleySparklez thanks your right! X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-16 01:03:59	@Broken_Jigsaw owwwie that all sounds very painful, definitely avoid all glass for a while! Hugs xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:54:04	@xMis_Fitx loves me and will never leave me, kind of like a your not going to be rejected or abandoned by everyone x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:53:21	@xMis_Fitx and shout things that would not be helpful. Lily avatar is staying its really pretty and reminds me why I got them and that hub
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:52:36	@xMis_Fitx thanks :) I'm going to use some skills to reduce overwhelming emotions, your right least I am recognising it. I do want to scream
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:51:53	@andbenrow it can be, prob just the BPD talking and I need to use some skills to help reduce the emotional overwhelming I'm having right now
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:50:29	Help me and let me recover.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:50:17	Think I was trying to grasp at a second mum type of thing from her which is neither fair on her nor me. So letting go and realising will
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:49:02	She's old enough to be my mother as well and I've realised I didn't want to let her go as she had that motherly figure which is wrong.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:48:13	I've decided that I'm not going to put the effort in to a friendship that wasnt going anywhere and just fuelling my BPD type thoughts aswell
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:46:53	Feel rejected again can't shake it just want someone to say hey I'm here and in rl to say hey can I come round for a natter but no one does
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:42:28	It may be the BPD traits talking but im suddenly not feeling very welcome in this twitter network :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:34:35	Factor in my head on whether to stay on meds or not, I know I should anyway but oh I don't know. Going to gp tomorrow so will see then!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:33:20	And I've lost weight in just one day, my ed thoughts are screaming at me, the lamotrigine really suppresses my appetite which is the arguing
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 21:32:05	Due to this bug I didn't take meds yesterday and now im starting to think maybe I can do without meds but then they control my appetite too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 04:43:39	@turquoisejulia yeah my mil gave it to me thought i felt better yesterday only for it to hit with force today :-( hub & son have had it too!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-15 04:36:04	Get out of a hellish long mixed episode just to battle blumming norovirus!! yuk!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-14 18:18:57	@jackychan2904 everyone's suffering more this year :( can you take a night time version or even promethazine? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-14 18:17:46	@Prettybones1990 aww so cute
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-14 18:14:46	Well actually!! pic.twitter.com/hXrPX0TFIf
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-14 15:53:20	@jackychan2904 have you found this year it's worse? Hub is really suffering this year with it, even tablets aren't doing much.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-14 15:37:54	Substance abuse has claimed another life, didn't watch glee but still RIP Cory Monteith, thoughts with family and friends.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-14 15:24:58	I wish I had a shower could really do with a pressure shower right now!! Think within a few months we are having one installed!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-14 15:23:00	It seems no matter how hot it is at night I still end up with the covers on me when I wake up, tell me what that's all about?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-14 15:17:50	Good morning twitter how be everyone this fine morning?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-14 05:32:18	Can people stop tweeting about the luxury of a cold shower please. I'm rather jealous right now!! ;-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-14 03:36:12	@Profanity_Annie @brokenmind_ nothing hope your ok Hannah x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-14 03:34:40	Stigma around suicide attempts http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-nm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 23:17:25	@spring_lamb you need to do what's best for you not what your psych and cpn want, if its causing you too much distress it's not worth it x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 19:16:18	@Prettybones1990 that's good hunni good work with no crisis well done you xx I'm ok I'm out of a mixed episode now and feeling much better x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 19:04:18	@spring_lamb they can't force you and shouldn't put pressure on you to either that's wrong of them x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 19:00:32	@spring_lamb ah it's a touch of catch 22 for you then. That must of hurt finding out about your grandad like that x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 18:55:17	@spring_lamb it's hard when you want to keep the good times, maybe just reduce slowly so that it doesn't seem so sudden, but not altogether?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 18:50:28	@spring_lamb can understand that, but it's what you feel and is such a huge decision to make, took one conversation with my mother to end it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 18:45:50	My previous tweet may sound harsh & all but I don't care she abused me so why shouldn't I wish her dead, she's looking worst for wear too!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 18:44:09	Half way through the day and I've just remembered its my mothers birthday well I hope she has a good day and that there arent many left!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 16:50:51	@Prettybones1990 argue that. Hope you do enjoy yourself at the beach and ignore the person who indirectly tweeted about you hugs again xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 16:49:53	@Prettybones1990 sending hugs, if your friends are true they won't care about the scars, and I do not believe you are fat as much as you may
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 16:48:53	@Prettybones1990 read your tweets sorry I haven't been around to support you recently :( and sorry to read things are tough right now :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 15:31:14	My shoulders are killing me this morning feel so stiff, got a poorly son too so sorting him out isnt helping, but must grind on!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 04:39:43	@WickedTheodora cool well if you come down this way let me know and we can meet up would love to meet you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 04:28:33	@WickedTheodora yeah i live in Southampton x

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 04:24:00	@turquoisejulia my mobility is getting worse, for the past week I've been in so much pain. Seem to be having a flare up of what ever this is
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 03:09:08	So today I did a small amount of walking yet my body aches like I've run a marathon, I needed a afternoon nap again & joints hurt like hell!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 02:59:38	@IamCarrieeeeee @barmybelle @NatpopsEvans do any of you know if the depo provera or progesterone only pill effect lamotrigine?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 02:56:52	@W4tch3r_An0n aww thank you :-D x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-13 02:56:12	@kaycey55 thank you so much :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-12 06:17:41	It's been 9 years today that I moved out of my mothers home and Ive never looked back! Best thing I ever did!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-12 04:07:49	It's just gone 9pm I'm tired I'm in pain with my joints, my muscles ache and I have a issue that I'm not sharing, too early to go to bed??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 05:12:45	@jackychan2904 thanks I want to get a green and white one for mental health awareness :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 05:11:49	@W4tch3r_An0n that's fab :-) stable is very good :-D
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 05:11:25	Now they have I'm feeling better, tho I don't miss the headache I get when I increase lamotrigine :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 05:09:00	I think the increase of lamotrigine and adding in aripiprazole has been the best way forward, it took awhile for the changes to kick in but
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 05:07:57	Today has been really good, after feeling very mixed up and all over the place I'm now feeling better, no paranoia no crap just better!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 05:06:34	@W4tch3r_An0n thanks :-) how are you doing?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 05:06:02	@will7201 thanks it makes a bloody change lol :-)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 00:36:21	See yesterday I added loser girl to my name today it's more positive with im'possible. Because i am possible and I can do possible things!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 00:34:49	With this episode I wasn't being wilful not using skills but rather forgetting them, I can't believe that during this time if forgotten dbt!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 00:32:57	@georgina_557 thanks, I am doing ok now I'm using my dbt skills that I wasn't using and should have been. How are you? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 00:30:58	Well that was hard and had to stop as son fell on the sofa. Was able to notice thought and let them go but sound distractions were difficult
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 00:25:22	Going to sit here and do some mindfulness I think, a breathing exercise will suffice for now, part of my needing to be more mindful.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-11 00:23:48	I have been busy today opposite action definitely working, done loads of housework took my son to surestart for an hour and no nap today :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 19:41:54	@will7201 it is and I've good reason too my best friend is off a section 3 that she'd been on for 5 years, she gives me hope :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 19:40:11	Mindful of everything, being aware of my thoughts accepting them but not allowing them to take control. Oh and opposite action too!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 19:39:23	Bipolar will not beat me, I may be having a difficult time lately but realised I wasn't using the skills I should have been, so now Im being
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 19:36:22	I am so chuffed with my best friend, she'd had been on section 3 for nearly 5 years and today she has been taken on it. I'm so proud of her!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 04:19:11	@xMis_Fitx am going to get an early night but will reply in the morning, think its a wise idea for me tonight ty so much for talking to me x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 04:17:44	@xMis_Fitx alot more than I'd care to admit and I don't want to do that :( x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 04:17:06	@xMis_Fitx and told her if she was serious she would have done something by now. I dont want them too because that would then mean Im unwell
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 04:15:51	@xMis_Fitx I'm 28, I'm on lamotrigine & aripiprazole, the reason I won't have the AAT is because they accused my niece of attention seeking
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:21:27	@xMis_Fitx conform to societies ways and reasonings :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:20:38	@xMis_Fitx I just don't know for sure hence confusion and fear. I want to be my own person but feel I need to do what the thoughts say and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:19:58	@xMis_Fitx could it be possible am I going crazy I know what psychosis is but don't think this is that, I think I know what's happening
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:18:43	@xMis_Fitx the feeling I have is something close to paranoia I guess that these thoughts I'm having are being put in my head but I dont know
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:15:56	Im not well enough, so I either have to live up to my mental illness or work the middle bit doesn't seem possible apparently so confusing!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:14:39	Everyone is laughing at me, Im the only one who doesn't work who is on disability benefits my friends all work I want to work but apparently
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:13:08	To just find a full time job stick my son in full time nursery and be like a normal person tho that could never actually happen to me, feel
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:12:18	Am I stupid to think that I need to get a job to conform to societies way and by being on benefits Im just dirt and scum. I have this urge
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:10:21	@Profanity_Annie its confusing as I've been in a mixed episode for 6/7 weeks I'm all over the place think meds are helping then they arent x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:06:51	@Profanity_Annie I'm trying tho its hard :( thank you means alot x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:05:56	@xMis_Fitx thanks Hun just want to self destruct but not hurt myself as I just won't do that it's hard confusing and a huge struggle :-( x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:04:32	@Profanity_Annie not really no I seem to be on a self destruction but with actually harming myself, I won't do it, mind is tearing apart :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:02:40	Point I left because I couldn't get better with them taunting me like they did. But in reality I'm am just that the loser girl!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:01:51	That was what they called me in the psych unit. Read my diaries from when I was IP and I was treated really badly by other patients to the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:01:06	Aren't really friends then, if its online. I dunno maybe it's the traits of BPD playing up I dunno. I guess I'm just a fucked up loser!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 03:00:11	So what the hell do I do, don't get acknowledged on here like I used too, I do feel so alone and rejected by "friends" online maybe they
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 02:58:04	Them, plus I don't know what they could do because i won't see AAT after the treatment they gave my niece I just refuse to see them.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 02:57:24	Feel as if I should go back to work people clearly don't think I'm ill, I won't ring for support from the CTT because I don't trust any of
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 02:56:26	@xMis_Fitx it helped for a little bit but then didn't so I stopped x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 02:55:53	@W4tch3r_An0n I'm still around just don't fit in anymore; I dunno why however just don't :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-10 02:55:23	@Nikkers09 thank you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-09 18:55:06	@xMis_Fitx I'm writing, getting thoughts out helps me alot x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-09 18:23:24	Just read my husbands account of what happened the night I did a massive OD, it's bloody heartbreaking. I feel so guilty for what I did :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-09 18:21:48	@xMis_Fitx not really in a good place at the moment. Feeling very fragile :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-09 18:17:25	to escape one's head would be to float along in the breeze with peace surrounding you
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-09 16:53:18	That annoying dot on the screen that won't wipe off no matter how much you try, I can go if people want, I can disappear, vanish!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-09 16:51:50	Or am I just making excuses in my head to hide the fact that no one actually gives two shits about me, just another blob on the net.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-09 16:50:46	And again twitter is somewhere I don't fit again. Or is it just that I'm feeling very fragile and sensitive and perceptions are distorted?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-09 16:49:27	@W4tch3r_An0n hey I'm ok I suppose not really around on twitter anymore don't fit in, your the only one who notices if I'm quiet :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-08 21:53:31	So What? A fb group raising awareness of mental health issues. https://www. facebook.com/groups/6788640 55464506/ …
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-08 03:01:09	Oh and I have a head ache too :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-08 03:00:18	Ow f'ing ow, joints are so painful, I'm so tired have to click joints to relieve pain a little, muscles hurt like anything too :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-07 16:18:27	@will7201 would love to but have no one to look after my son today. The water is really calm too, which is just typical lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-07 16:07:47	@will7201 enjoy :-) taking son to a country park and letting him run around!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-06 20:56:35	Maybe it's the aripripazole that I've been taking and increase in lamotrigine, I don't seem so crazy mentalness now just a tad mentalness!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-06 20:54:01	Maybe it's talking too soon but things may be improving with this mixed episode can recognise that I've been paranoid & a tad delusional :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-06 05:40:14	agh I forgot about the Lamotrigine headache that I get on increase, paracetamol hasn't touched it. have a very noisy head right now!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-06 05:02:46	For those of you on Facebook this open group is aimed at reducing mental health stigma. https://www. facebook.com/groups/6788640 55464506/ …
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-06 04:55:11	@Fallingstar_x its childish but that's what my mother is like. I haven't even seen or spoken to her for 6 years but its part of her plan :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-06 04:51:08	cant believe she has gotten to everyone, going around telling others if they know me to ditch me, she did that when I was at school :(

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 20:28:20	Can't stop shaking with anxiety, feel like a freak :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 16:57:52	Is it classed as a audio hallucination if the "voice" is your own or could it be classed as a type of thought? I'm puzzled :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 16:56:12	@IamCarrieeeeee it's the innocence and care free too that I love. Love watching him learn and explore new things too :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 16:54:49	>that I can't believe him. We've been together 9 years married 7 of them, I should be able to believe him but I just can't :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 16:53:43	So hub has tried to reassure me that my premonitions are false and that he will never cheat on me and I'm the only one for him, feel guilty>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 16:51:41	@IamCarrieeeeee my son is like this all the time :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 12:06:36	@will7201 plus I won't do anything just have the thoughts. Feel like they are stuffing meds down my neck to keep me from knowing the truth:(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 12:03:44	Premonition http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-ne
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 11:38:57	He has met someone else, this isn't a one off bad dream it wasnt a dream but a premonition and its not the only one Ive had. :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 11:37:42	Just searched through his phone but no texts or emails, no messages on Facebook or twitter. I know I'm not being irrational, just need proof
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 11:28:18	There are articles being tweeted on here about break ups it's a sign its definitely going to happen.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 11:27:09	@NatalieOxford http://www. rayvenmental.wordpress.com and http://www. battlingbpd.org
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 11:26:11	@will7201 I won't call anyone I can't trust anyone professional anymore.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 11:25:10	It's 4 fing am & I've woken suddenly, in tears & the feeling of heartbreak. I'm sure my hub is going to tell me he's seeing someone else :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 06:09:35	I think the cpn is on the wrong side, I need a new cpn so will be requesting a new cpn tomorrow. She has betrayed me for the last time :-(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 06:00:41	@will7201 yeah could say that, my latest blog post linked in a recent tweet kinda explains alot :-(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 05:55:05	Everyone's ignoring me because they've been told too "make her feel alone and rejected" lets really hurt her, it sucks to be me :'-(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-07-02 05:11:29	Does no one care? http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-nc
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-29 04:58:40	Asked 9hrs earlier but in psych terms what does thinking out of context mean?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-28 19:19:10	in psych terms what does thinking out of context mean?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-28 19:18:48	I had a flat tone today the cpn said, shes speaking to psych on Monday about med adjustment and she will phone me Monday.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:51:45	@will7201 thanks will try and get some kip later, mind is on overdrive at the moment. good night.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:50:37	@brokenmind_ I make it sound like its a separate entity but hope you get what I mean
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:50:02	@brokenmind_ your recognising when the bpd is acting up and that's fab you can become aware of it more and learn to quieten it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:48:57	@brokenmind_ talk with your psych and cpn, and without wanting to jinx things, things have been good for you lately, so SAD could be right.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:48:13	@brokenmind_ true we all have traits of things, its when they disrupt our lives that they then become diagnosable. do research however and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:46:59	@brokenmind_ in the nicest way possible I agree with you on that :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:43:48	@brokenmind_ yes was going to say maybe they couldn't see passed the bpd, and thought the mood shifts were part of the bpd rather than BP.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:42:52	@brokenmind_ working for you so that's brilliant, it was the same thought that made me question the bpd diagnosis & new psych agreed with me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:41:51	@brokenmind_ is that the quetiapine? it could be that there is a mood disorder going on, quetiapine is the fav atm for mood issues and its
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:40:43	@brokenmind_ at the retreat they will be able to see your moods better on a day to day basis and tell you if there is a mood disorder too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:37:40	@brokenmind_ overlap and be diagnosed together, sometimes misdiagnosed as the other too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:37:08	@brokenmind_ it could be that there are mood issues going on, its good that the meds are helping your moods better. bpd and bipolar can
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:35:40	@brokenmind_ cyclothymia is usually diagnosed after 2 years of hypomania and mild depression, it becomes bipolar 2 if severe depression.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:21:23	Trying to work out what this bad thing is but I cant figure it out, but the guilty feeling is so overwhelming and painful. I want rid of it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-23 05:20:36	I feel so guilty, Ive done something bad but I don't know what it is, theres a voice repeating in my head telling me ive done a bad thing :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-22 17:45:45	Trying to remain sane least pretending I'm half way there, they can't do anything if I appear ok right? I'm so bloody scared right now :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-22 17:34:15	My mind and body is a mess right now, unsure what to do anymore :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-22 03:26:31	Yes I have a damn good reason to be questioning the sincerity of everyone around me, trust has gone out of the window. I am scared :-(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-21 21:27:08	@stilgarg @ecrjones @janetpeelargent aww thank you :-) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-21 03:01:19	@brokenmind_ I know, in a previous tweet I've linked to the website and my comment, I lost it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-21 03:00:02	@autiepower thanks made me so angry I couldn't just leave it I had to say something!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-21 02:58:54	@brokenmind_ someone commented on an article on my local papers website saying mentally ill people are like terrorists!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-21 02:56:45	So I kinda just went off on one on my local papers website, stupid comment made about the mentally ill grr http://www. dailyecho.co.uk/news/10495753. Mental_health_patients__put_at_risk_/ …

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-20 18:55:39	@stilgarg what they'd call paranoia anyway and on top of that I'm not well physically :( how are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-20 18:55:01	@stilgarg hi I'm all over the place one minute I'm ok the next crying or laughing hysterically, thoughts racing, feel a bit "paranoid" well
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-20 05:17:35	Seem to be falling apart mentally and physically! Fun times for me right now!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-19 23:26:34	"She's always been weird that one!"
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-18 23:21:21	My anxiety is through the roof any loud bang and my heart is pounding, there is no cause for this, I don't get it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-18 21:11:31	Standing in the mouth of the cave Darkness swallows me in The light that once fulfilled me Now hidden behind the black clouds
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-17 05:05:44	@stilgarg aww that's fab :-)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-15 18:09:19	We have our new car but hubs stuck at work he's been to collect it from the showroom but I want to go for a drive now!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-14 23:12:03	@will7201 I did but the app ive got is rubbish didnt pick it up at all :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-14 22:29:22	I like enquiring/complaining online because it reduces the anxiety, just wish noise nuisance team would get back to me about her upstairs :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-14 22:27:13	So have enquired about skin camouflage there is a 2 month wait for an appointment but it will be worth it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-14 17:09:24	@nuttylotte good for you!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-14 17:00:31	@nuttylotte I'd be telling her to F off and that she wouldn't get a penny until she made more effort to see your daughter.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-14 14:47:59	I have the song "the grand ole duke of York" stuck in my head and its driving me nuts its stuck on repeat and I can't stop it!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-14 00:09:40	@Irish_lass1975 good to know the cream lasts that long, sorry that you feel the same as me. hope the new wounds heal quickly for you. Hugs x

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 23:33:47	@stilgarg how are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 23:33:40	@stilgarg hey im doing so so up and down so much I don't know where my heads at right now turned 28 on Tuesday & since been thinking to much
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 22:27:40	@WickedTheodora hope everything goes ok for you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:46:03	@WickedTheodora thanks Hun xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:44:06	@turquoisejulia I've supposedly been referred to psychology but god knows when I'll hear anything, if cpn has even done referral.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:43:03	I'm never telling anyone new about mentalness. I'm seeking advice about skin graft on my arm better to say I had a bad burn than the truth!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:40:42	I must bring everything onto myself Its the only conclusion to why bad things keep happening. I want to change but don't know where to start
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:39:08	When things repeat themselves over and over in your life, you really start to question what your doing wrong. No one could be so unlucky.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:38:18	That screams one word to me and one I was repeatedly told at school, college by my mother. Loser :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:37:12	That night, seriously apart from hubs family & mutual friends of mine & the person I was having a joint party with none of my friends came!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:35:53	I had a good friend but after she didn't turn up to a bday party I had in 2011 I cut her off she did give a reason days later, felt so alone
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:34:36	I used the term my friend on fb alot but they aren't really a friend. I've lost count of how many times people say we must meet up then dont
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:32:16	Hub has brought a new car, it's his choice after all he drives it, he's so excited over it, and I'm rather jealous, still waiting on dvla :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:30:50	Yes I am upset that hardly anyone wished me a happy birthday in real life and online. It does make me feel I don't have any real friends.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:29:03	Realised I was expecting others to think and behave like me, just because I remember and put bdays in the calendar doesn't mean others do.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:27:47	I refused to see the world for the cruel place that it actually is. I've come to accept that I will have to fight for everything in life.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:26:41	Some things are seriously making me question alot of how I perceive the world. Things aren't right and I've been in my own little world :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 21:23:34	@BPDinNYC only just seen this :/ thanks :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 16:04:24	So randomly brought a new car this week.... It's a beast!! Puts our old car to shame!! Pick it up on Saturday!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-13 16:01:48	@brokenmind_ hope it goes well for you! Thinking of you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-12 18:18:25	Yeah thanks all supposed friends, family shows exactly how much people think of me when they can't be bothered to wish me a happy birthday:(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-12 16:33:22	It hadn't been my birthday yesterday because money wouldn't have been spent on me and instead the bill that he forgot to pay last month!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-12 16:31:42	Had a great birthday yesterday. Today is awful what a great start to being 28, cut off by virgin 3G is shit moneys tight and I actually wish
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-11 17:54:22	@will7201 thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-11 05:42:42	Ooh 1hr and 18mins till my birthday :-) tho I was actually born at 7:45am but hey I'm having the whole day lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-10 05:13:43	@psychoticdancer I was shocked as I'd taken it before at max dose and no side effects, was why it was chosen. Hope it doesn't happen to you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-10 04:22:49	@psychoticdancer wasn't on it for long made me very aggressive and agitated this time round, few years back had no side effects at all.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-10 02:34:40	Wooo I'm all over the place, this is great fun... Not!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-08 20:55:25	@jackychan2904 what's the saying your only as old as you feel ;) thanks not sure what I'm doing yet on tues think hubs gonna surprise me x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-08 17:44:50	@turquoisejulia thanks will have a look
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-08 17:41:01	@nuttylotte true! And in the Mediterranean Sea too lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-08 17:40:21	@Fallingstar_x thank you will be glad when this weeks over with :-) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-08 17:39:57	>a £500 limit, it's confusing, seeing cpn Monday she wants to see me soon because of mood state.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-08 17:38:06	>doesn't make any sense to me, how can you have a high without lack of sleep or the euphoria, not spent but opened a catalogue account with>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-08 17:36:27	Have no idea what's going on with my mood, cpn said yesterday that it sounds like a high but without the euphoria and lack of sleep, which >
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-08 17:32:09	Swear I'm about to explode, it's been one thing after another this week, my niece, a stomach bug, cpn, and now credit card trouble!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-08 16:17:49	3 more sleeps till I'm 28!! I can't wait!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 22:18:35	@WickedTheodora well done you :-) congratulations x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 20:52:48	@turquoisejulia the way the weather changes it would be a full time job!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 20:36:33	Just a boring weather update as I know you love them haha, the thunderstorm has gone and blue sky and sun is starting to appear :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 18:35:48	@will7201 it's ok I don't mind a thunderstorm the summer is coming back this arvo according to the weather forecast :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 17:36:02	@turquoisejulia my hub works at the old Netley landfill and I've been there in a metal portacabin when it's been a good storm, that was fun!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 17:35:00	@turquoisejulia yes it is, Ive given my sis in law the information & she is going to every app with my niece to ensure she gets treated well
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 17:31:19	@turquoisejulia well just had a strike that hit the old landfill in Netley and made my block shake, that was goooood!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 17:30:05	@turquoisejulia after the week I've had with my niece and the AAT I'm done with the service. I won't be ringing them for support at all!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 17:21:22	It was 2 and a half weeks ago that I saw my cpn, I can prob 100% sure that its likely a good week or so till I see her again!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 17:18:53	This is a pathetic thunderstorm we are having! No evil clouds just a few flashes here and there with rumbles. I want a proper mean storm!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 17:12:21	And if anyone wonders what the shoes were, they were slip ons, I saw her pull up and walk towards the block didn't see her fall over however
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 17:06:34	Prob sound like a really heartless cow right now & uncaring. But I have no sympathy for people who choose to wear stupid shoes when its wet!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 17:04:26	Really shocked at myself too that I actually don't feel any sympathy for her, she wasnt wearing the right foot wear for this weather!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-07 17:01:55	Well I won't be seeing my cpn today she fell over outside my block and has to go home and get changed.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-06 04:39:34	@stephenfry I have bipolar too, I find your honesty about it inspirational and it gives me hope, so glad things are ok now for you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-06 04:36:11	@jackychan2904 coca cola does have a list of the 150 names available and they are doing something else via http:// shareacoke.co.uk x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 23:03:42	@s88_x when she goes to psych they treat her like that, she feels like she isn't worthy of help and unfixable :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 23:03:05	@s88_x through or what's caused her to be in and out of prison on remand doing petty crimes, everyone's telling her she needs psych help but
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 23:02:18	@s88_x I can't either people who have never met her before have called her attention seeking. They have no idea of the trauma she's been
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 22:38:37	@autiepower thanks, I knew they treated people who have been on/off crisis team and they are fed up with like that but not a newbie :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 22:32:10	So AAT have told my niece she needs to wait for a referral for a 6 session emotional coping skills group which will fix her EUPD!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 22:31:11	@ALivingLie_ your not suicidal it's just that's the idea you've thought of. That's rediculous :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 22:30:34	@ALivingLie_ hmm like they can read your mind to know how your feeling. Just because you've planned to do it in a public place doesn't mean
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 22:29:43	@autiepower my sister in law is building a case against them and will be fighting them all the way.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 22:28:30	@spring_lamb it's the stupid system here :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 22:28:16	@s88_x say wait for referral to emotional coping skills group, they say the 6 sessions of the ecs group will fix her for life as she has bpd
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 22:27:15	@s88_x I don't know my sister in law went nuts at them, we her family have to support her now as they won't give any support at all, just
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 19:11:23	That she wouldn't be here now, she would have done something!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 19:11:00	So my niece has been told that she should be diagnosed with adult adhd and EUPD, that she's attention seeking and of she was truely suicidal
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 15:07:43	@NatalieOxford cool :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 15:07:26	@Scarsarebeaut_ thanks hunni, not sure what time they are going down to the unit but will update when I know something xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 15:06:24	My hub gave my son a wooden spoon to play with yesterday, today it is a weapon..... Ouch!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 07:05:48	Suppose I'd better drag myself off to bed just hope I don't get interrupted during the night by my body :( night everyone xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 07:04:28	Oooooh 6 more sleeps till my birthday (after tonight lol)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 07:03:01	@Scarsarebeaut_ just want her to be well and to have the right support, hope something happens tomorrow :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 06:49:12	TMI have had an attack of diarrea can't spell it, 4 times, have taken loperamide and co-codamol but doesn't seem to be doing much.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 05:51:11	@Scarsarebeaut_ I'd like to hope that my niece will be safe tonight, really worried about her :( x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 05:50:05	@Scarsarebeaut_ hopefully, my sis in law is scary when she's angry and determined I wouldn't want to be the person speaking to her tomoz!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 05:48:59	Just found out I've got sunburn on my back, had an itch and scratched it and now it really hurts and I put sunscreen on too. No fair!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 05:42:38	@Scarsarebeaut_ if they'd seen my niece a million times before then I wouldn't be so shocked its still wrong but that's another story.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 05:41:36	@Scarsarebeaut_ straight to the unit tonight if my niece tried anything. I'm really shocked especially as my niece is new to the system.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 05:40:33	@Scarsarebeaut_ I think she will get through as her mum is there with her and she can't leave as on tag. But I know my sis in law will go
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 05:31:44	@Scarsarebeaut_ when my sis in law told them the attempts shed made If my niece doesn't get the help I fear she will do something drastic :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 05:30:58	@Scarsarebeaut_ if my niece is admitted it will be relief for all of us. I just can't believe that the team refused to do something tonight
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 05:29:28	@Scarsarebeaut_ my sis in law is taking her tomorrow armed with what Ive said to her. Sadly not getting hopes up that they will do something
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 04:47:07	@Scarsarebeaut_ I want to bloody scream at them! X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 04:46:54	@Scarsarebeaut_ assessed without any bloody judgements, they don't know her at all and to tar her off as attention seeking and manipulative
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 04:46:04	@Scarsarebeaut_ yep I'm fuming I actually want to get ready and take my niece down to the hosp with my sis in law and demand her to be
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 04:41:01	@Scarsarebeaut_ and they aren't going to do anything, just said wait for a call tomorrow!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 04:40:43	@Scarsarebeaut_ just heard that she didn't even put it down for someone to call my sis in law told them the attempts my niece has made today
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 03:41:54	I'd hate to be the person who answers the call to my sister in law, they are going to get an earful!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 03:41:22	I am flipping livid right now!! Bloody AAT were meant to call my suicidal niece today and they didn't! Her mum is phoning them!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-05 03:38:18	@Scarsarebeaut_ thanks I'm currently fuming the woman we saw last night said someone would call her today and no one has.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 20:55:19	@Prettybones1990 how are you doing? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 20:55:11	@Prettybones1990 not at the mo will be in an hour or so, got boring housework to be done, then walking several miles to a pub for a meal x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 20:32:46	@Prettybones1990 thanks :-) I'm ok I go into a different mode and as I've known for a while that my niece has been unwell it was ok for me x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 20:22:57	@Prettybones1990 not sure going to call her in a bit and see how she's doing x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 16:08:35	@spring_lamb support in hours and AAT out of hours, it's supposed to make things easier all round but its just confusing
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 16:07:38	@spring_lamb it's down to the access and assessment team who deal with crisis and first time referrals, the hospital at home does intense
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 16:05:48	@spring_lamb thats what it used to be like here then they changed it there is still a hospital at home team but they don't work 24/7 instead
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:59:25	@spring_lamb coping skills and you can see someone for 6 weeks as its different here and the cmht is split in two short and long term. :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:58:25	@spring_lamb telling her she is mental but this social worker comes along and basically says no meds will help you and here's emotional
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:57:26	@spring_lamb yep my niece has been in and out of custody spent time in prison the courts say she needs psych help, basically everyone is
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:54:21	@spring_lamb it to first timers too. :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:53:48	@spring_lamb they are disgusting here, I thought they only had that attitude after seeing someone for the millionth time but seems they do
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:53:01	@Prettybones1990 7 hours last night the referral was made around 8pm and they turned up at 11:30pm!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:52:06	@Prettybones1990 she really treated my niece very badly and I'm making a formal complaint. Seems their attitude still stinks was in A&E for
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:50:28	@Prettybones1990 to which I turned around and sarky said hmm unlike my diagnosis and taking mood stabilisers this woman didn't like that!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:49:12	@Prettybones1990 must know all about that! I said well I have a few friends with BPD, then she turned to my niece and said no meds will help
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:48:34	@Prettybones1990 scars and made her own judgements, when she said to my niece about being emotionally unstable she turned to me and said you
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:47:57	@Prettybones1990 a million times before, she didn't know my niece at all and didn't want to listen to anything I had to say, she saw my
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:47:16	@Prettybones1990 punches walls and she does spur of the moment things. This woman had no right to tar my niece like that like she'd seen her
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:45:59	@Prettybones1990 after speaking to my niece for 10 mins she came to the conclusion she has BPD, based on anger issues and the fact she
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:18:31	Didn't show through body language or emotion how she was, but thats just my niece If anything happens I know my sis in law will hit the roof
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:16:22	Is very suicidal that she needs to take responsibility for her actions and that she didn't think my niece would do anything because my niece
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:15:02	She blatantly said my niece has BPD but has no right to diagnose, and because of that my niece got treated like crap she told my niece who
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 15:11:40	Still reeling over that crisis woman last night she spoke to my niece like she'd seen her too many times when it was the first time.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 07:22:02	@Love_my_Westie mum and nearest relative so can make a application for a MHA assessment and that's what she is going to do x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 07:21:26	@Love_my_Westie I know but my sis in law is going to speak with the team my niece is under and ask for her to be admitted, she's my nieces
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 07:18:36	@Love_my_Westie my niece isn't known to services either, my sis in law is going to get her admitted as she has more power to than I do.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 07:14:12	>>admit her despite what she's going through at the moment, she can't be safe in the community, have her mum some advice on what to do next.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-04 07:12:31	Have just got in after spending nearly 7hrs in A&E with my niece waiting for crisis to come, finally she is getting help but they won't >>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-03 22:53:30	Haha it's Rayven vs Bank PPI. Been through loan agreement and I have a case so complained to bank itself and they are looking into it!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-03 05:56:34	@WickedTheodora @autiepower you've just reminded me that I have this in my med drawer :-) thank you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-03 05:50:26	@Sectioned_ I suffered with this when on a combo of fluoxetine and aripripazole, was horrible, soon as I stopped these meds it went away.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-03 02:27:58	Hmm maybe an indoor water fight wasnt the best idea, fun however lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-03 02:26:49	@acarerseyes I do the same when my son goes down for his nap, it's on for a good 15 mins before I realise what I'm doing lol

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-02 01:08:03	A way to annoy the neighbour whose been playing music up loud for weeks, play everything she plays but louder!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-02 00:18:58	Aww now hubs playing one of our songs whispering a prayer by Steve Vai :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-02 00:09:47	Not sure what song my hub is singing but he sounds Jamaican :0

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-01 03:25:59	@brokenmind_ reminds me of the Michael Macintyre sketch about dead arms and burglars :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-01 03:22:15	@will7201 not sure about other snakes but corns start off with pinkies moving up to fluffs, then small mice then large mice.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-01 03:18:14	@brokenmind_ cringe, I know that feeling worst is when waking up with a dead arm.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-01 03:09:25	@brokenmind_ stand up and walk round gets rid of them really quick, might hurt a tad at first tho
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-06-01 03:07:09	@will7201 thanks nagster is a corn snake brought him & a starter kit for £75 last year he's really cheap to look after & mice are cheap too.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-31 02:30:32	@IamCarrieeeeee it's always said take in the morning. But this time it just says take as Dr W directed in letter but I don't have the letter
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-31 02:23:06	@IamCarrieeeeee I've been taking the full dose in the morning :/ wasn't aware until today that it should be split due to the half life.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-31 02:09:36	>> have been given 50mg tablets I can only assume dr W wants me to split the dose throughout the day, gonna have to get another pill box!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-31 02:08:08	>> in letter dated 23/5/2013 considering I haven't got this letter I have no idea what has been directed. I'm on 200mg of lamotrigine but>>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-31 02:07:14	>>said letter, I picked up my script and then meds from pharmacy got home to find on the boxes it said take as directed by dr W as written>>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-31 02:05:49	Those who read my tweets yesterday about my mental health team will know that yesterday they faxed gp about med increase, I'm yet to get >>

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-30 20:16:46	@will7201 that's a brilliant idea thanks
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-30 17:48:46	Always nice listening through the paper thin walls of my flat to next door having a screaming match at each other :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 21:48:58	And now im going to get off twitter and stop depressing everyone and go and get everything I can to sell.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 21:48:06	sell absolutely everything I can, would rather pay ebay fees and get the money asap than sit at a car booty with slim chance of selling.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 21:46:42	We make sure our son has everything he needs, food, nappies, milk etc. Im just going to eat as minimal as I can, make food last longer.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 21:45:16	it may not seem much to a lot of people but 10k of debt and a payday loan eating our money each month, we are drowning fast
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 21:44:04	I actually feel like opening my front door and saying give me your best offer for all the stuff in it, might sort out finances then.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 21:42:08	Oh to rub salt into the wound. Most likely wont be moving into a house end of next year. Stuck in this shit hole forever.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 21:36:34	(c) find they haven't received it, Im stopping my medication. wouldn't be able to get anymore anyway, disgusted with southern health!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 21:35:14	(c) been sent via fax to gp, I have 1 days worth of meds, and if in an hours time when I ring the gp to make sure they have it, that I (c)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 21:34:32	so 4 weeks ago I saw my psych, who said to me to increase med for 2 weeks then increase again. he will send a letter to gp. today it has (c)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 19:34:20	@will7201 yeah still works, was going to get it repaired but maybe end of August now, have gone round the flat and found a bit that can sell
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 19:23:50	@jackychan2904 @will7201 true but I'd actually sell my iPad 3 now if the screen wasnt smashed :( couldn't be separated from it before :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 19:12:39	@will7201 yes you do, will do a few things eBay but going to try Facebook too as avoids charges and fees then
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 19:09:06	@will7201 I've tried making and selling didn't sell anything, so now just selling all the jewellery bits and card making things too.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 18:58:33	@will7201 I'm going through all my craft stuff and other things, as kayaking is free and I live by water I don't want to sell it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 18:51:32	Don't ever get a payday loan and think you can control it, we got one for Xmas last year and still in the trap now, it's hell!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 18:50:36	@will7201 tis true, all I want is a small break, in all truth all I need is a £1000 to sort out the crap I'm in with pay day loans :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 18:44:37	Why is it so hard to try and get everything on track when theres always something to knock you back, finances, health, diet, hate it so much
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 02:53:10	@Love_my_Westie had the hotdog stuff crust and really wish I hadn't wasnt that nice really, did you enjoy your pizza?

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-29 00:44:25	@brokenmind_ forgive and forget
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-28 16:31:52	@IamCarrieeeeee @ManchesterMind there is one down here in Portsmouth bit far for you to travel tho.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-28 03:48:18	@stilgarg that is true, maybe put it out there to known people with bp.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-28 03:47:04	Lmao at dec #bgt he is proper shitting himself!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-28 02:47:24	@stilgarg that's a fab idea I'd love to be a part of that, would be great for support/advice.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 23:31:29	Im in a sharing mood, anyone want my cold?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 23:31:06	@turquoisejulia thanks its part of a new me, im not sugar coating anything anymore and saying what I think, need to be more assertive. x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 23:27:58	@turquoisejulia yes jani, amazing young girl, having known her story is what made me realise this girl was lying.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 23:25:45	@stilgarg hows you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 23:25:38	@stilgarg didn't like very much, and deleted her post on the group so that no one else could read it and see her for the troll she is :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 23:24:56	@stilgarg hey there im good thanks, had an argument with a child on a bp group on fb, she was clearly trolling and I outted her, which she
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 23:23:53	@turquoisejulia to me when its almost identical to the American childs story. she gave me a lot of abuse because I outted her on the group.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 23:22:57	@turquoisejulia said she had 500 the cat telling her to do bad things, and that she too was diagnosed at age 6, it really doesn't ring true
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 23:22:17	@turquoisejulia girl who was diagnosed aged 6 with schizophrenia, one of this girls delusions is a cat called 400, the girl on the fb group
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 23:21:42	@turquoisejulia this was on a bipolar support group on fb, the child because she was just that was copying the story of a young American
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 22:09:30	Im slowly coming back to twitter, my mood improved several days ago so not sure what happened there, I felt very low but it lasted 3 days :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 22:07:30	Why do some people think it is funny to lie about being mentally ill? Its sick and to copy the sad story of a young girl is disgusting!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 00:05:34	@stilgarg depression :/ feel stable at the mo, sleeping ok and feel ok within myself except have a cold :0 how's you doing?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-27 00:04:36	@stilgarg hey thanks :) well I don't really know what happened with the depression it went after 3 days, so not sure I can even say it was

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-22 03:25:25	I love it when my hub tries to wind me up and it completely backfires right in his face, his facial reaction was priceless hahaha
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-22 02:32:06	>>had put that dream in my rem sleep state for me to experience, it was totally unrelated to me and anything I have read or seen recently.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-22 02:31:14	>> emotions. you could sense the person in the dream feelings, pain etc and what was physically happening to them. It felt like someone >>

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 18:50:54	@brokenmind_ ah not so good then if needing a pee and struggle to undo the buttons :/ can you have a zip sewn in instead?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 18:49:48	@alittlevanilla that is unbelievable I really cant believe such a service exists, suppose tho its a good business if they are making money:/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 18:46:10	@brokenmind_ good about room on top, is the bottom half comfortable despite being a tad tight and short?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 18:43:44	@brokenmind_ does it fit like you were hoping it would?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 18:25:25	@alittlevanilla I really don't get why people would want to buy followers, I just report for spam.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:47:41	Just learnt my friend who has been in a long battle with her ex for custody has been granted custody as he has been sent to prison!! #happy

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:35:17	@Irish_lass1975 it is very terrible a school took a direct hit too :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:22:07	#PrayForOklahoma thoughts are with the people in Oklahoma, the images are heartbreaking.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:20:07	@Prettybones1990 see what they suggest to help support you better so your still getting something out of therapy. Xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:19:36	@Prettybones1990 again, only you know what's right for you, can you talk to your therapist about not feeling like your giving it 100% and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:18:39	@Prettybones1990 aww thank you, maybe you do need to cut down something, but only you can decide, you don't want to burn out and need hosp
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:17:15	@Prettybones1990 you're right! I've got to stop expecting change over night and thinking I can do everything at once :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:09:33	Keep getting random people favouriting random tweets :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:07:18	@Broken_Jigsaw lol that's the one :-) glad you knew what I meant! X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:05:21	@Prettybones1990 admission if I attempted work at the moment. Kinda kicks reality into focus a bit that I'm not as well as I think I am :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:04:21	@Prettybones1990 the bipolar and how I'm so up and down at the moment, he knocks sense into me and tells me I risk a major relapse and hosp
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:02:26	@Prettybones1990 thank you, I do every so often think I should be working but I ask hub if he thinks I should and he says no atm because of
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 16:01:29	@Prettybones1990 that's true, I just feel like I should be working :/ my ESA income is the same roughly as what he pays in tax every month!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:59:02	@BarrassBrough it should be on 4od if you did want to watch it :-) and thanks :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:58:22	@Broken_Jigsaw house, giving ourselves max 2 years. I like the fung shway (not right spelling) feeling about a clear out.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:51:57	@Broken_Jigsaw things together to put on eBay, my sons old toys bundles of outgrown clothes plus other bits to sell, this is to raise cash
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:51:04	@Broken_Jigsaw thanks :-) with shops like cex and alike it's easier to sell some items now and eBay is good for others. Currently I'm gettin
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:49:09	@Prettybones1990 everything to make sure our son has everything he needs.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:48:01	@Prettybones1990 warmth nappies etc, he won't go without and if we got back to the stage were we were 6 years ago the. We'd sell absolutely
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:46:56	@Prettybones1990 struggled and have found ourselves in the payday loan trap we are getting out of it. My son will always have food, clothes
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:45:45	@Prettybones1990 bills, hub works full time and we always make sure my son has everything first, he will always come first. Whilst we have
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:44:22	@Prettybones1990 being on ESA now does make me feel awful but as many have said to me there's a reason I'm on it, and it's still paying the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:43:26	@Prettybones1990 wow :-) your parents are an inspiration and many should take their lead, I agree it gave me good work ethics, and for me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:21:49	@IamCarrieeeeee ah right, that's wonderful that you volunteer for such a needed service :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 15:08:18	@IamCarrieeeeee ooh that's true hadn't thought about that :/ forget those companies exist. Thanks for reminding me :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:49:13	Got quite a bit to blog about later today, will be interesting!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:46:43	#earlymorningrant is now over!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:45:45	>something for nothing. It's disgusting and those who aren't abusing the services and charities and benefits get tarred off under the brush!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:44:32	>> it's as simple as that really. The sad reality is that Scunthorpe isn't the only place to have those attitudes and think they should get>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:42:25	>> they just took from a food bank that in all fairness they didn't actually need. In difficult times if you need money you sell stuff >>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:41:27	>> charity. It annoyed me on last nights #skint that they had that big telly and games console but instead of selling them to raise cash >>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:39:22	We regularly donate food and clothing to the charity, my hubs employer does regular collections around the sites, so we give back to the >>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:38:24	>>support, I couldn't claim incapacity benefit they had refused it, I didnt even know about dla at that time. Because we have used food bank
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:36:56	In fact hub was working but off sick due to depression after his dad died, the only benefit we were claiming other than ssp was income >>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:35:55	We didn't have any luxuries at all, we were #skint but our attitudes werent "the social should pay for this that etc" we both wanted to work
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:33:36	Regarding the #skint program last night and food banks Ive used them twice but before I did I had sold all my belongings first to raise cash
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 14:31:48	Well had a good 8 hrs sleep last night that was good but dreamt the most vivid dream ever which I've just woken from and its left me shaking
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 05:06:26	Watching sky news and the devastation in Oklahoma :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 04:52:12	That 16 year old on #skint would be a good mum I think if she could get out of that house & away from the boyfriend, she just needs a chance
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 04:13:34	My head is so noisy and feels swishy again. Even tho I know my body is tired I feel like I could stay up forever.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 03:45:15	@stilgarg cool that's good :-) I talked my cpn's ears off, she's not concerned at the moment as I have insight but she's monitoring things.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 03:36:23	@stilgarg lol I saw mine too, how did yours go?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 03:30:41	@stilgarg how's u and how's your day been?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 03:30:34	@stilgarg yeah it's been a good day, niece on tag and probation officer is seeking psych help for her. She's been told some home truths.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 03:25:23	Body is fighting mind and mind is winning!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-21 01:50:50	Hmm thought my high was on its way down but having 3hrs sleep seems to have sent it back up there again :-) I love my highs :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 23:26:28	On 3 hrs sleep I'm now wired buzzing and ready to go, gonna get son ready and walk the few miles to the supermarket :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 23:25:32	Anyways chewed cpn's ear off non stop talking, she can tell I've been high but we are monitoring things at the mo incase I plummet.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 23:23:44	Told my sis n law u have a few things I'd like to say to my niece but don't feel it's my place but Ive said if she does anything else I will
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 23:22:46	Her probation officer is seeking psych help however and I know they can refer her to a low secure unit here so fingers crossed she gets help
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 23:21:58	Like she can continue to do these things and still have a job and luxuries when really she should lose it all, shes not learning her lesson
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 23:21:02	Found out about my niece she's on a tag but her dad has sorted things out so she can still work he's treating her like she's done no wrong
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 22:58:39	@nuttylotte I had one when I was in juniors, had her during my parents divorce and she referred me to a psych after a traumatic event.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 19:19:31	module being a 60 credit module :/ I cant do anymore than 30 credits to avoid relapse and stress. Just going to continue on the DipHE Open.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 19:18:18	So just phoned OU about withdrawing from a module saying I can only do 30 credits and the guy talks about doing a degree with the first
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 19:17:34	@nuttylotte lol good luck!! :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 19:17:16	@stilgarg thanks may find out soon if my other niece contacts me after they have gotten out of court, if not it will be this evening.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 18:19:09	@nuttylotte let me know if you find one could do with losing some before my birthday :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 18:14:33	I know I may sound harsh about my niece but something needs doing before things get dangerous for her or others & im thinking of her parents
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 18:12:11	I really hope that my niece either gets a custodial sentence or is held in hospital.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 18:10:28	So have just found out my sister in law has gone to court she said she wasn't going to go, may find out earlier what the outcome is.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 18:09:41	@brokenmind_ earnings, seems pointless but its how there system works mine had my previous employment end of year total too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 18:08:35	@brokenmind_ its like if you started a job in the February and not worked at all for the financial year prior it would only show those
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 17:55:50	@stilgarg hey I'm good despite 3 hrs sleep, waiting in outcome of my niece court appearance for assaulting a police officer :/ how's u?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 17:55:05	@brokenmind_ was it from dwp? Think it's like a p60 letting you know how much you've recieved and paid in tax last financial year.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 17:39:26	My niece again http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-mT
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 15:30:37	Suppose it could be that my body isn't used to food at 7am and its throwing a hissy fit!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 15:29:51	Can't decide if I'm still hungry or have heartburn/indigestion from eating my weatabix too fast, it's an odd sensation I have :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:58:44	@mycuriousmind hopefully, time will tell I guess, see what happens today I guess then go from there.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:52:57	@Prettybones1990 think it was from being rudely woken up apparently he didn't sleep well last night :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:51:21	@mycuriousmind path we are scared of what she will do next, either to herself or others :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:49:57	@mycuriousmind I think she's in turmoil in her head doesn't know which way to turn so she's behaving like this, she's on a self destructive
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:40:56	@mycuriousmind since her attacker got off Scott free she's gotten worse, she got given a restraining order as she was threatening attacker.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:39:15	@mycuriousmind teens who can't really get into much trouble with the police she however being 20 can and has, she has no respect for them &
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:38:35	@mycuriousmind yep I think she is, she's really impressionable too and fearing rejection she tends to hang around with kids still in their
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:29:32	@mycuriousmind thanks will update as soon as I know anything which is likely to be this evening when my sis n law gets in from work.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:28:54	@mycuriousmind yeah she doesn't seem to understand what her actions are doing to her family or if she does she doesn't care :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:27:39	@mycuriousmind psych help so fingers crossed now the ball gets moving for her to get it. My sis n law is on antidepressants too :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:26:43	@mycuriousmind it's hard watching my sis n law struggle thinking she has failed her when she hasn't, even her solicitor has said she needs
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:25:50	@mycuriousmind supposed 'uncle' (through marriage) she's been doing everything to get sent back to prison as she feels safe there :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:24:56	@mycuriousmind she's been on a downward spiral for the last year or so but even more since end of last year when she was attacked by her
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:21:24	@mycuriousmind SH watch when held on remand in prison. Told her mum as NR she can request a MHA assessment so she's going to do that.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:20:24	@mycuriousmind says her behaviour is linked to adhd but we don't believe it is, I suspect BPD she fits most criteria except SH tho was on
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:18:56	@mycuriousmind thanks, her parents are at their wits end now, she's so out of control, I've been fighting for psych help for her and her gp
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:16:46	@mycuriousmind if she doesn't get a custodial sentence then I'm going with her mum and taking her for a MHA assessment as she needs help.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:09:15	My niece has court today, we shall find out her fate for assault on a police officer, she was already on bail for attempted robbery :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 14:03:32	@Prettybones1990 lol I did and got abuse for doing so lol he should be grateful that I got him up for work haha!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 13:34:35	Trying to refrain myself from going in the bedroom and jumping on the bed like a child to wake the husband up, not sure I can refrain myself
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 13:13:14	In the early hours of the morning I'll just be repaying the favour!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 13:12:39	I really feel like making alot of noise at this precise moment in time if I have to be awake then the neighbours do too, they wake me often
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 13:11:04	I'm not going to wake him up if he becomes late for work, that's not my responsibility.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 13:09:54	Well my lazy assed fucking husband who can't be bothered to get up in the night with his son, is now having a snooze on his alarm.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 12:56:19	So I've had about 3 hours or so sleep, had been trying to sort out my sleep and get some sort of sleep pattern back due to the high, oh well
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 12:54:04	We watched the Incredible Hulk last night and I had peculiar dreams myself, as it was a late one for son he saw some of it too!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 12:52:32	Moved to the lounge at half 5 as he was wanting to play with toys and think its a tad early for that. I think he had nightmares last night:/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 12:49:52	Good morning I've been awake since around half two laid on the floor in sons room as he wouldn't sleep an kept screaming.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 02:40:58	@WickedTheodora @brokenmind_ well miracles can happen, don't know much about footy but I'm sure having good players is key to winning ;-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-20 02:34:49	@brokenmind_ the only thing I think your unlikely to do is see England win the World Cup ;) but what a list :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 19:20:03	@stilgarg That's good to hear, im going to pick my son up later from his aunties, but other than that im lazing around the flat today. :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 19:18:54	I am missing my son too, he stayed with his nan last night and has now gone to see his aunty and go to the park.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 19:18:02	I have a husband on the sulk because I wont let him do something, oh well he will get over it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 19:17:23	@stilgarg how are you today?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 19:17:14	@stilgarg Thanks, I managed to watch from country number 8 up until bonnie tyler, which I thought was very disappointing, switched over then
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 19:12:33	Good Afternoon twitter, how the devil are we today? Have had a long soak in the bath, due to playing bejewelled on zen mode. Have a good day
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 04:16:04	Well that's that within the first few lines we won't be winning, she's too croaky I won't be believing in bonnie tyler!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 04:12:30	O.M.F.G thought they had no bits till I realised they were wearing skin colour shorts :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 04:08:39	I'm watching up till bonnie sings then I'm switching off find out who wins tomorrow, sleep has caught up with me, body exhausted mind not so
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 04:04:48	Omg what was that then?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 03:59:29	Ok so persuaded hub to watch Eurovision seen from number 8 and hmm think number 8 was the best can't remember the country tho.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 02:14:31	Atomic Kitten should represent the UK at this year's Eurovision Song Contest. Kerry Katona can guarantee us 12 points from Iceland.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:50:10	@stilgarg your doing well the first few weeks are the hardest but by the end of the first month it becomes a lot lot easier!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:46:12	@stilgarg too and the way they smell and think gosh I used to smell like that. At least it was the case for me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:45:46	@stilgarg you smoking and think eww can't believe I used to be like that, clothes will smell better, you'll be able to notice other smokers
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:45:00	@stilgarg pen or something, I did have the inhaler thingy at first, soon that passes and say in a years time you'll look back on photos of
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:43:22	@stilgarg the feeling will get better and better, I found situations where I would usually spark up felt weird at first, would play with a
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:33:39	@stilgarg haha he would if he drank, but he rarely drinks anymore since giving up his partying days before he met me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:28:41	@stilgarg hope you get some sun tomorrow :-) no I won't be watching it Hub has protested against it, may try to change his mind however!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:11:21	@stilgarg glad your ok, I get what you mean about the cloudy weather, feels dull, have had some sun here today :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:09:44	Brought some jelly belly's earlier can say was rather disappointed with the sour ones not very sour at all!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:06:22	@stilgarg not as much as I was. How are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:06:10	@stilgarg hey don't be sorry she's made her bed now she has to sleep in it! I'm ok thanks feel better than last night still up a little but
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:05:05	Anyways enough about that, how's everyone doing? Seen loads of tweets about Eurovision which I won't be watching due to hub protesting!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:03:46	With it all. Well I can't help her anymore, she's not willing to listen and I can't force her to, I just feel for her parents right now :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 01:02:29	She has no respect for everyone who has bent over backwards to help her, including me. She thinks its a game and that she can just get away
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 00:59:34	She was arrested earlier in the week too, she just wants to be in prison she feels safe there apparently. Her mum feels like she has failed!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-19 00:58:38	Just discovered my niece has yet again got herself arrested and this time for assaulting a police officer with a spray can. I'm very angry!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 18:06:34	I really want to go kayaking later but not sure I'm actually fit enough to go, I don't feel sick anymore but sweaty and shivery still :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 17:17:17	@Prettybones1990 aww wow that's fab shame about the hours change tho x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 16:35:48	@Prettybones1990 great and inspirational :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 16:35:36	@Prettybones1990 gosh wow even on a day off your busy, well have fun with your friend and be good to you. All the work you do with kids is
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 16:31:46	@Prettybones1990 yep I think that's all I can do :( will take hub with me so I'm not fobbed off. Just thankful the iPad still works!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 16:30:54	@Prettybones1990 her in when you can, do you get a day off to yourself at all?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 16:30:34	@Prettybones1990 that sounds very hectic for you. And during your lunch break is hardly giving you a break, but understand you have to fit
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 16:27:45	@Prettybones1990 lol :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 16:27:38	@Prettybones1990 found a place that will do it for £50, the dealers on the markets here are very dodgy, wouldn't trust them with it :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 16:26:40	@Prettybones1990 don't stop what you enjoy, there needs to be a healthy balance between work and play but don't let work overrule! X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 16:26:00	@Prettybones1990 yup that is true, especially when your working your butt off with no gratitude and soon you begin to despise the job :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 15:58:22	God the price of screen repair ranges from £50 to £120!! Fingers crossed the £50 one isn't dodgy and will do a good job of the repair!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 15:21:31	Just discovered my iPad screen is smashed I'm gutted, the iPad itself still works just need a new screen which is gonna be costly.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 14:43:08	Must have had a 24 hour bug thing can say it wasn't nice!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 14:42:31	Good morning I am feel tons better than last night, tossed and turned all night but did eventually get some sleep.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 02:20:59	I'm not well :( sat here shivering whilst feel hot too. Yawning away but mind is still going million miles an hour, still feel queezy too :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 00:51:09	@stilgarg :( guess what goes up must come down just hope I don't crash. Thanks might have a lie down in a bit.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 00:50:15	@will7201 aww that's horrid hope it buggers off soon
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 00:45:04	Re last tweet I have since been sick twice, feel slightly better, this could potentially bring me back down from my high :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-18 00:43:11	@stilgarg thanks think I've got food poisoning or something. Feel this could potentially bring me back down :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 23:43:43	Slept much at all. I feel sick, have a headache and none stop drinking water, bet I'm coming down with some bug or something just my luck!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 23:42:28	My body is screaming out for sleep yet my mind just won't let it rest, may have had 8 hours last night but woke up feeling like I hadn't
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 22:55:03	@Cath_Parfitt Thank you that's a really nice thing to say :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 22:31:33	Well as it turns out no I can not clean the bathroom when my son is asleep he wakes straight up. Bummer
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 20:51:20	I wonder if you can quietly clean a bathroom my sons due a nap in a minute and I'm itching to get in there and clean!! Gonna try it!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 18:57:17	@stilgarg Thanks :) you too :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 18:55:36	@stilgarg @ANAL0GY @Ag3nt47 @TruthIzSexy @anon99percenter @ecrjones @AnonymousJaye @AlexHawg @ALivingLie_ @7hird3y3 ty :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 18:01:50	@stilgarg more energy :-) how are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 18:01:37	@stilgarg doing great thanks, got 8 hours sleep last night my body was exhausted, hasn't reduced the high thankfully infact it's giving me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 17:47:42	Making Changes http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-mQ
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 16:44:06	Would rather do just 30 credits and take longer to complete the course than overwhelm myself and risk a relapse. I think that is wise of me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 16:43:21	I have just contacted OU about withdrawing from one of the modules starting in October as I feel doing 60 credits may be pushing things.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 16:20:36	Think that was the fastest vacuuming I have ever done! My son was determined to get out all his toys before I'd finished, he's a hurricane!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 15:58:16	I wonder what the weathers doing Sunday? Could do with a good kayak :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 15:54:56	@Love_my_Westie how are you anyways :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 15:54:48	@Love_my_Westie im still rather hypomanic, trying to restrain myself but many plans have been put in place and im really enjoying things :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 15:53:06	@IamCarrieeeeee you're welcome :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 15:52:46	My body gave me 8 hours sleep last night, i think 9 nights of 4-6 hours sleep caught up with me and my body said enough, still raring to go!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 15:50:47	@IamCarrieeeeee holding :-) fingers crossed everything will be ok for you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 15:14:10	So now im all better and all, im going to go a get a job. Ad im never going to be unwell again!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 04:22:32	@turquoisejulia bbc3
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 04:20:45	The inside of my head feels swishy there's a constant buzzing going on, there's too much noise!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 02:22:01	@will7201 it was the tropical fruit flavour and was delicious :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-17 00:06:09	Look what I've got and its lush :-) pic.twitter.com/vqNh2uGGrB

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 20:49:04	@stilgarg afternoon :-) have been busy clearing out sons bedroom cupboard finding stuff to sell to clear debt. It's a big cupboard lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 20:47:44	Right time to put son to bed for his nap and sort out my bedroom looking for everything I can sell. Fun fun fun hahaha lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 20:44:56	My birthday being 3 1/2 weeks away gives them enough time. I just need to be patient something I've never been able to do for long lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 20:43:18	At next week so it seems I will likely find out the conclusion by my birthday will either be a great birthday present or the worse one :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 20:42:03	So as you know I'm waiting to hear from DVLA well I phoned them today and they've today received letter from old team and it will be looked

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 19:44:15	Alot of computer bits I'm hoping he will be able to flog, can see a car booty coming up soon. Operation clear debt is go go go!! Hahaha

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 18:03:22	I need to raise cash, gonna sort all my junk out and work out whats sellable and sell it. Lets see if i can raise enough to pay off 3 credit
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 18:00:38	@will7201 cool!! Always shop there, in a mile radius there are 6 coops!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 17:56:21	Or something, just pay off debts and get a house this year. Would be so lovely and my relapse risk would reduce significantly as less stress
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 17:55:08	Yey by next xmas we will be in a lovely house, away from this hell hole estate!! I can not wait. Wish we could win 20k on the lotto, bingo
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 17:32:33	@will7201 lol I can't get to a costa and my local coop was selling these so I had no choice :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 17:31:27	@brokenmind_ I know it's so unexciting I think I'm going to cry...... Lmao!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 17:29:03	just hate it when people ask for a follow back and have no information about themselves, I don't play the how many followers can I get game

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 06:38:38	@mycuriousmind oh yep :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 06:35:57	@mycuriousmind yeah over and over in random voices, with background thoughts, like being in a club with loads of chattering and music. Noisy
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 06:34:18	Ooh ee oo ah ah ting tang walla walla bing bang ooh ee oo ah ah ting tang walla walla bang Ooh ee oo ah ah ting tang walla walla bing bang

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 05:46:59	@stilgarg well it feels the same as the other hypos have gone reduced sleep increased energy more outgoing racing thoughts, invincibility
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 05:45:59	@brokenmind_ that's good to hear, now you need to let the thought of tomorrow go as it may bring you do, however you are sound positive :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 05:38:36	@brokenmind_ you don't need to go through with it, it started off as a thought doesn't mean it has to become a reality, remember the retreat
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 05:37:29	@stilgarg he doesn't show any concern so until he does I'm not going to worry. I want to stay like this forever, I feel so bloody amazing!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 05:11:11	The trick with neat voddy is to gulp it down fast enough the taste buds don't sense too much of it!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 05:06:07	Wow vodka really has paint striper smell about it, tastes good tho!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 04:50:03	@ss88ox that is a rather odd name for it I have to say, never heard that myself either!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 04:48:28	Been seeing white squares about 10cm square out the corner of my eye, more bugging me than anything else tho wonder if they mean anything?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 04:43:16	Bounce off the walls then be like a pinball machine bing bing bing haha
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 04:42:49	Just to keep some of what I've said at bay I'm bouncing my legs on the sofa to release. Wish I had a bouncy castle right now literally could
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 04:41:14	Escape my body feel like any second now my thoughts are going to seep through my skin and pour out onto the carpet like a huge wave.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 04:40:24	I feel dizzy, my mind wants me to keep moving and the energy builds up and I have to release it. So restless, my mind literally wants to
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 04:39:29	I'm ok if I'm on the go moving around doing something but the second I stop my head starts pounding, I've drunk enough so not dehydrated :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 04:34:31	I sent a message via Facebook and I can see its been read but no response, could have gone for that meal tonight.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 04:33:21	But they haven't let us know and now it's too late for them to come round and they think because they are family they can treat us like that
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 04:32:35	It's nice isn't it that for us to find out if our guests are still coming we have to ring round only to be given an might do will let u know
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 04:31:19	Now that was good ;-D
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 02:52:12	Seen it rain upside down now, called him a few choice names but found it hilarious!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-16 02:50:42	Hubby was playing with the steam genie and instead of listening to me about releasing the pressure he opened it and got burnt can say I've

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 23:35:13	The moment you realise that dress you really wanted to wear got taken to the charity shop. Bummer!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 23:08:47	Finally some music that's going to speed my head is Listening to the gathering by infected mushrooms!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 23:05:36	@stilgarg Its all gravy :) I had one done a while ago and got a wrap plan on pdf that old cpn emailed me but haven't done it recently.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 22:12:38	Ordered myself a dress of eBay its a boring grey colour but was thinking I could accessorise it with some corresponding colours, its plain
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 22:11:42	residue and dirt on the outside. I got some strange looks from peeps outside, what haven't they seen someone window clean before. shesh!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 22:07:09	hello my gorgeous followers how be your afternoon/morning depending on where you are in this wonderful world? :-D
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 20:35:50	Always fun when you start randomly choking on nothing :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 19:27:47	Trying to persuade hub to move to a wonderful village about 10 miles from here, used to be the county asylum too. I want to live there!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 19:06:27	I think I want to move to a village, out of the main city, to a small community where everyone knows everyone & there's a sense of community
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 19:05:14	I am old fashioned in the sense that I want my son to grow up with respect for authority, adults, have manners, not like most youths!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 19:03:06	Kids don't do that anymore, they hang round shops or cause ASB, or indoors on computers, games, phones etc. No exercise and junk food :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 19:01:41	Anyone remember the days you could safely play outside your home with pavement chalk, etc. SMS didn't exist, no social networks etc.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 18:10:08	@oxymoronic82 Thank you, and thank you for the retweet too :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 18:09:51	@oxymoronic82 I was so glad when they decided to delete my account for inactivity. :)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 18:07:29	@oxymoronic82 :) some of my days were rather shameful, I was terrible before I met my husband :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 18:06:45	@NatalieOxford I did it when I was at school but not since :)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 15:11:50	@Love_my_Westie it was a dodgy site, as soon as you got adult verification & cool tools the guys wanted nude pics & the chats I had, wow lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 15:10:25	@turquoisejulia still as well side effect of Lamotrigine as it can mess with temperature control
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 15:09:57	@turquoisejulia I think it was a combination of the tumble dryer being on all day as well as the manic energy and not being able to keep
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 15:07:48	@Love_my_Westie Bebo was boring, lol had faceparty before met hub had some fun via that site hehe

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-15 03:20:39	@will7201 yep, aw maybe a early night will help? I had 4.5 hours sleep last night :)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 23:29:50	Ah it seems the temperature issue is a result of the Lamotrigine, should wear off apparently after 6 months on the med, 2 months to go!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 23:20:14	@stilgarg hmm thats a possibility.. gonna go check side effects list thanks

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 22:53:41	I've just looked back on what housework I've doing for the past 10 minutes and I swear I've just done an hours work in that 10 minutes!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 22:17:58	Okay, so maybe putting my entire iTunes library on shuffle was a bad idea, I have some dodgy songs on there lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 22:06:24	Tried my hardest to persuade hub to get a 100% mortgage but he wouldn't. Damn it!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 18:24:26	After getting rather fed up with those overseas callers we had our number changed, came live this morning and found out the number used to
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 14:31:01	Ooh washing machines finished, time for the next load!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 14:30:35	I have a little tornado in my flat!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 14:05:23	I do wonder how my husband comes to some conclusions. Been with him for 9 years and he still surprises me some days with his antics. Lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 13:42:11	@IamCarrieeeeee good glad to hear it! Got anything planned for the day?

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:52:05	my body is screaming out for sleep yet my mind wont give in, can see me spending another night of staring at the ceiling with my thoughts!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:50:05	@Broken_Jigsaw if its better for your sanity then maybe it is a good thing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:46:37	@Broken_Jigsaw stressed at him and he'd just respond with a very childish what ever!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:45:58	@Broken_Jigsaw he apparently doesn't hear my son cry at all, so sleeps all the way through, so he says anyway. he'd just accuse me of being
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:44:00	@Broken_Jigsaw he's good for a lot of things but when it comes to housework he wont pull his weight!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:42:54	@Broken_Jigsaw lol I say sleeping its actually laying there succumbing to the racing thoughts and ideas!! my mind is non stop at the mo.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:41:55	@Broken_Jigsaw ive been sleeping in my sons room as he wakes during the night and wont go back to sleep, hub doesn't "hear" him cry!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:40:23	@Broken_Jigsaw the problem is when I was working I still had to do it all. All he is interested in at the moment is his music making.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:38:05	@Broken_Jigsaw be cleaned properly and not some half hearted attempt!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:37:49	@Broken_Jigsaw do it tomorrow must be their favourite term, the problem is tomorrow never comes, suppose if I do it my self I know it would
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:36:45	the housework! tried leaving the housework for him but it just piles up so im still left to do it as get frustrated with the mess.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:35:14	all he does is go to work, he doesn't think looking after a toddler is hard work, and that thinks because im home all day I should do all
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:34:16	he didn't even come out and take over just left me to get on with it, and I didn't even get a thanks afterwards. hes left everything for rme
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 06:33:11	men why do they like to try you, I did the washing up earlier and he says oh I was going to do that, I said when he said tonight, yeah right

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 05:17:31	It's rather sad how a lot of people treat society don't have respect for others and then don't understand when the law comes down on them :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 05:15:12	Watching #skint on 4+1 and omg, that lad would've been out on his arse if he spoke to me like that.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 00:50:50	@Scarsarebeaut_ thanks its bugging me too, she's been in other films but I can remember which. Will keep searching!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 00:46:24	@Scarsarebeaut_ the sixx is a German website I think and hard to navigate. Tried search terms to find it but no luck, need actresses name :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-14 00:17:47	@Scarsarebeaut_ not sure, who's the actress, it's bugging me I recognise her but can't place a name :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 21:23:56	Have all this energy but my minds full of so much I'm just wandering around my flat not actually doing very much, can't concentrate for long
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 20:13:04	Neither of the letters I wanted to come today actually came, queue one disappointed me! FFS
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 19:57:26	@RayvenMental well actually 125k in the pic but still!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 19:56:19	@stilgarg ooh very healthy and tasty :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 19:53:49	@stilgarg cool :-) that sounds a good plan any ideas on lunch?

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 19:51:35	@stilgarg helllloo I'm fab thanks! You? It's sunny here but cloudy too looks like it could rain any second. :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 19:50:14	Least I saw they turned up & doing those blocks first as I get really disappointed if I don't get any post especially stuff I'm waiting for!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 19:48:18	See Im one of these sad people who sit at the window waiting for them to arrive. I love getting post but get more eager if got things coming
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 19:46:45	Most annoying usually the postmen do my block and the one behind first but today they are doing the 3 in front first, means waiting longer!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 19:44:16	@virginmedia many times they just keep calling, random times during the day, asking for someone who doesn't live here. They are scam callers
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 18:36:58	@quetiapineFella read on the tps website that they can stop cold calls from within the uk but overseas calls don't fall under it :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 18:03:59	@virginmedia hi looking for some advice we keep having scam calls from a number 0501. Does virgin block numbers if requested? Thanks
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:57:00	@quetiapineFella the tps website tells me my number is already registered :/ guess previous owners already did it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:54:52	@quetiapineFella lol that sounds good fun :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:53:45	@quetiapineFella let the peace begin :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:51:03	@quetiapineFella that's brilliant, will get it sorted today :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:50:21	@quetiapineFella thank you will get this sorted ASAP
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:49:21	@quetiapineFella that the scam they are trying to do wont work. May try saying I'm from a higher agency and that we are closing in on them!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:47:42	@quetiapineFella I tell them they have the wrong number and to stop calling then they ask if I have a pc and I tell the no I have a mac and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:47:00	@quetiapineFella yeah they are blooming annoying, they ask for someone else I presume previous owner of the number. Say they from Microsoft
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:45:06	@quetiapineFella thanks that will be very helpful :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:42:20	@quetiapineFella definitely need to do something, reading about 0501 and they are scammers calling about computer problems.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:38:58	@quetiapineFella lol that's a good idea!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:37:32	I'd deafen them the next time they called. Might used my sons toy trumpet instead that will do the job!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:35:43	I am sick and tired of some foreign idiot calling my number and refusing to stop calling. The number is 0501. I wish I had a whistle!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:24:45	@Irish_lass1975 lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:23:04	Keep getting calls from somewhere asking for someone else keep telling them not to call but they do. How can I stop it?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:21:32	@BarrassBrough true but I like the lamotrigine and my psych has said he won't add anything to it so it will mean a whole change of meds :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:18:27	Have a lovely day :-) pic.twitter.com/iDQX39tGbQ
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:16:42	@BarrassBrough mmm that sounds tasty!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:16:23	Wondering whether I should make cpn aware of my upness just don't want them to party poop and introduce an AP. might just leave it for now!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:14:12	@NatalieOxford Id imagine it takes some time to climb the stairs to the 13th floor. I'm only on the 5th almost dead by the time I get there!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:12:46	Am in a very talkative mood atm so I may fill your TL but least I have a pretty avatar for you all to look at :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:11:01	@NatalieOxford the worst, they constantly break down. Sometimes have to wait ages for lifts to get to my floor because others hold them open
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:10:11	@NatalieOxford oh yes, the smaller blocks have had a make over and look better but it hasn't been without trouble. Glad it's over. Lifts are
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:08:43	@Irish_lass1975 lol bet you was glad when he stopped watching :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 17:08:13	@safeinwater ah that's not too bad then. Thanks I might see what it's like this arvo and decide then.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:55:57	@Irish_lass1975 lol the bloke who plays him has many programmes on Cbeebies. Can tolerate so much then switch to Disney junior. Feel for you
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:54:42	Can someone make the clouds disappear and the sun come out I want to take my son to the park without getting rained on?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:53:35	@safeinwater hope the weather stays good for you and glad your good. I want to go out but there's some dark clouds so rain forecasted :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:52:19	@NatalieOxford local psych unit killed herself the same day of discharge.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:51:46	@NatalieOxford estate there are 3 more on a neighbouring estate which made national news a year or so ago when a patient discharged from the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:51:01	@NatalieOxford gosh that's really sad, it's terrible a tragedy has to happen before they do something. Of the smaller tower block in my
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:50:18	@safeinwater that's typical! I'm good thanks how are you? :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:49:38	@IamCarrieeeeee @chaosandcontrol @cheer_bear13 can understand your reservations, for me luckily it's not effected my mentalness.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:47:48	@NatalieOxford this is a shot of the tower blocks on my estate. pic.twitter.com/cBgLb9n0BF
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:47:20	@NatalieOxford wow, suppose London does have a high amount of high rise flats due to population. And that's an evil looking cloud too!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:44:56	@safeinwater I bet two will come at once. It's always the way! Hope a bus comes soon for you!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:44:19	@NatalieOxford country. I know through a news report that a very high percentage are out of work and in poverty :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:43:20	@NatalieOxford with young parent families as well as families with young children. Apparently it's one of the most deprived estates in the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:42:22	@NatalieOxford it's a good number, in my block that's the top floor, would be ok if we were at the top. My estate has 6 tower blocks filled
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:40:56	Blast wanted to go to the BipolarUk support group this month but it was last week, have to wait ti June now!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:29:59	Should get a letter through today from the psych cc'd in that's sent to gp. Don't need a script just yet but will do next week I think.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:27:26	@chaosandcontrol @IamCarrieeeeee @cheer_bear13 I used to suffer bad with pmt till I got on the right contraceptive pill, that helps alot!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:25:12	@nuttylotte thanks! Am a tad up so I'm sure it's gonna be a brilliant day :-D
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:23:21	@nuttylotte good morning!! Have a great day!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:13:32	I don't have bacon :( I guess cereal will have to do. It really doesn't compare to bacon however!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:12:10	Attention!! I want bacon!! That is all!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:10:55	That's bad... Just looked in the corner of my lounge and there is still a bit of Xmas dec stuck there. Why haven't I noticed that before? :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:09:28	I've got a hub and son who I love dearly, a roof over my head and food in my fridge freezer, everything else is a bonus!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:07:25	People like that you tend to keep a distance between you and them.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:05:57	To think just 2 years ago she turned on me because she had a case of the green eyes monster, then came crawling back with tail between legs!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 16:04:48	You just gotta laugh at the stupidity of some people, especially those who think they are better than all their friends. It's pathetic!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 15:21:26	And it seems its round two now, with shouting and banging. Oh joy!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 15:20:41	However as a bloke was being rather violent and smashing everything he could. I didn't want to get attacked. Think the police were called
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 15:19:05	Had to hold myself back last night from going into the stairwell and telling them to stfu and have some consideration for other residents!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 15:17:43	Joys of living in a tower block!! Want to move but it seems that's not possible, despite it causing stress and risk of relapse :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 15:15:45	Had a delightful night, at 2am this morning some neighbours decided to have a domestic resulting in smashed windows and damaged woodwork!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 07:08:18	La la la la la la la laaaaaa la la la la lala la la la la la laaaaa lala lala doo bee dooooo
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-13 06:14:26	Don't blame it on a friend when we know its you!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-12 22:51:15	I think the fact summers now disappeared is because I contemplated wearing a dress in the hot weather. Sorry about that :/

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-12 01:22:40	@NatalieOxford @brokenmind_ that sounds quite tasty :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-12 01:04:43	Haven't seen my husband all day due to him being at work, have had his company for 90 mins & he's now gone to his music studio! Bonus lol!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-12 01:02:44	@brokenmind_ and a bit of crunch to the noodles only works with chicken and mushroom however, ive tried other flavours and not good.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-12 01:01:58	@brokenmind_ well the toffee kinda melts and goes all chewy and the chocolate melts into the sauce, its add a bit of sweetness to the sauce
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-12 00:57:20	@brokenmind_ I like weird food :) I eat daim bars broken up and put in chicken and mushroom pot noodles lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-12 00:46:32	@brokenmind_ and chopped tomatoes, was pretty much it, didn't have any onions so used powder which added into the sauce.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-12 00:45:41	@brokenmind_ found the recipe to the curry, have to boil the sausages first then lightly fry them in the spice, onion and oil add beef stock
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-12 00:44:38	@brokenmind_ the curried sausage part was quite nice but the sauce was too oily. haven't got much in and searched sausages and tomatoes and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-12 00:37:09	hmm that sausage curry ive just homecooked didn't taste as good as I was expecting

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 16:57:40	@Prettybones1990 hey how are you? x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 16:56:54	@turquoisejulia lived to a grand age, even with many health problems, cancer finally got him, but he didn't go without a fight!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 16:56:22	@turquoisejulia Im prob becoming hypomanic, but actually want to train my body to survive on this amount of sleep, my granddad did and he
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 16:54:27	@Irish_lass1975 aww ty but its fine, I feel great, if this is all my body wants then its all its going to get lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 16:53:48	@turquoisejulia it at all lol, then again cant control most trollies lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 16:53:27	@turquoisejulia that's good that they offer that for healthcare, I know, I gave the trolly to hub when we went to London, could not control
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 16:52:12	My granddad had a saying before he passed away "i'll sleep when im dead!" Ive adopted that phrase, avg 5 hrs a night for passed few nights!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 16:49:32	@Love_my_Westie aww so cute :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 16:49:02	@turquoisejulia brought the biggest jar of jellybeans ive ever seen for a tenner, took me ages to eat through them!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 16:48:09	@turquoisejulia sounds a good plan, that's good so you can rest. Havent been to Costco here yet, don't have a card, went to one in London.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 16:37:11	Good Morning!! Have been up for a while pondering what to do for the day. Blasting out a bit of NOW 81, sons dancing away may just join him!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 00:13:07	@turquoisejulia seems to be less intense than a CTO.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 00:12:12	@turquoisejulia that cto's are better as they provide more support and care than a s117 aftercare, even tho they have to provide support it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 00:11:37	@turquoisejulia was talking more of cto's and section 117 aftercare, and about whats best after a long section 3 stay in hospital. agreed
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 00:08:26	the welfare check was with hub at his work, so police decided not to take me to the cells as no 136 suite at that time.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 00:07:40	>to say to avoid sectioning" Well never had a MHA assessment so not really, did narrowly avoid a S136 but only because I was safe at time of
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 00:06:24	her words "you know quite a bit about the MHA don't you?" me "yep, tho never been sectioned" her "guess its cause you know the right things>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-11 00:05:20	When I was with my cpn on Wednesday on the way back from the psych app, we were talking about the MHA and she was shocked at my knowledge.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 23:51:57	@will7201 lmao, ok, I will refrain from talking about my nice new pink laptop anymore ;)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 23:48:24	@will7201 lol, does the fact its pink make things any easier?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 23:22:36	my old laptop creaked and groaned when I used it, the harddrives made an awful sound when having to work. this laptop is so quiet!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 23:19:18	@Love_my_Westie get to choose which modules I want to study all the way through.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 23:18:49	@Love_my_Westie you could once you've reach enough credits ask for a qualification of certificate of HE in Open, im doing the DipHE open so

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 22:56:49	@will7201 lol wouldn't have a clue where it is, tried google for help and seems no ones experiencing this with the dvd player. its hubs job!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 22:51:25	@Love_my_Westie ah right, ive chosen modules that don't require going to tutorials, which modules you studying?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 22:49:18	I swear this bloody Samsung smart dvd player shit piece of crap is going to take flying lessons, keeps randomly changing input nowt sorts it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 22:31:45	@Love_my_Westie Ah right, I thought you was doing a full course. How are you finding it, im more nervous of doing the referencing wrong :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 22:11:19	@Love_my_Westie it maybe too many, but not sure :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 22:10:56	@Love_my_Westie Was meant to ask you, your doing an OU course how many credits are you doing for the first year? Ive chosen 60 and now think
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 21:55:12	Flicking through my ITunes I have found some rather shocking singles that I have acquired. Chris Crocker...
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 21:35:48	That's the same for me, Lamotrigine is brilliant for me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 21:32:38	@Love_my_Westie do you think Bipolar fits your symptoms or that BPD is right for you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 21:27:00	Bipolar Disorder Diagnosis http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-m1
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 19:40:18	right enough moaning about the dvla, I need some music ideas, fancy something new and different... hmm the mind ponders
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 19:39:17	for me, and give me so much independence. keeping fingers crossed but starting to give up hope with the outcome
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 19:38:10	maybe I shouldn't get my hopes up that they will give me a license, but will be devastated if they say no, as driving will open many things
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 19:36:35	the medical form last week. ive given up waiting for the post and hoping that it comes through, maybe tomorrow, hate that no post on sundays
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 19:35:35	how long does it bloody take the dvla to give a decision on a provisional license, im soo fed up of waiting now, I know old team sent back
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 19:34:52	@turquoisejulia in a blue moon that they are happening, so will just keep an eye on it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 19:27:48	@turquoisejulia ah right. will have to keep a check on them.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 19:11:06	@turquoisejulia suppose they aren't bad smells either, unless your really hungry lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 19:10:41	@turquoisejulia its really weird, ive had times where ive tasted lipstick, smelt smoke and other random things, do you take anything for it?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 19:00:09	I can smell a really strong smell of flowers, yet there are none in the flat....
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 18:46:23	@turquoisejulia that's good, ive just got a brand new laptop so transferring all the files, music, & photos. Back ups are needed regularly
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 18:41:20	@turquoisejulia yes definitely, I started to panic then
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 18:38:25	To touch as I destroyed the old one and lost everything on it :/ only hub can touch this one, which is fair enough really
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 18:37:35	As it turns out I hadn't transferred photos over to old laptop this tells me that they are on the external hard drive that I'm not allowed
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 18:32:57	@will7201 @turquoisejulia couldn't find them hoping that I put them back on the comp after reinstall of windows and I can now back up again
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 18:14:01	Ive lost a back up disk that I made from my old laptop when I formatted it last, its got all my photos on it need to find it!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 18:12:32	Darn it I want more raisins, don't think it would cause an fibre overload?? already had a very large handful already haha

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 18:10:36	wonder if the letter from my psychiatrist will come today the one im cc'd into that he sends to the GP. He diagnosed Bipolar but didn't give
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 18:09:20	I can still touch type and that's the important part. Still need practice but Im getting there with it!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 18:07:40	I am loving my new pink laptop, was concerned about the keyboard and having to get used to the buttons but there was nowt to worry about.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 18:03:29	have developed a slight addiction to raisins :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 17:51:56	well I was tidying and cleaning at gone midnight this morning, but still managed to sleep 6 hours. need to keep an eye on this for a while.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 06:28:11	starting to wonder if I've jumped right in the deep end with doing 2 30 credit modules starting October, hope I don't get too overwhelmed :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 05:41:23	@Prettybones1990 the triggering emotion causing you to be in distress. you are doing really well and should give yourself a pat on the back!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 05:40:29	@Prettybones1990 of physical sensations and any secondary emotions that you may recognise but not realise that they a secondary and hiding
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 05:39:12	@Prettybones1990 that's understandable and you're welcome, I guess with riding out the urges its about becoming aware as you were earlier
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 05:29:09	@Prettybones1990 what he was scared of. not sure if that's of any use for you, but its something that's always stuck with me and helps me. x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 05:28:16	@Prettybones1990 episode one character said they let fear control them for 5 seconds and that's all he'd let it have and then he got on with
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 05:27:27	@Prettybones1990 and then I count to 10 whilst controlling my breathing and the urge begins to fall. I used to watch Lost and in the pilot
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 05:26:14	@Prettybones1990 for me I let it rise whilst being mindful of it, see it at its peak, the point where you feel you absolutely have to do it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 05:17:44	@Prettybones1990 good plan to ride them out opposite action is good, I use that regularly. I will be around tomorrow if you want to chat :)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 00:46:30	Everything I say, talk about is always me getting stressed even more if its something he doesn't agree with. Gets blamed on being mental too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 00:44:50	Words he's now shouted at me for getting stressed, so I'm not allowed to be upset now. Its times like this when I really wonder about things
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 00:43:43	Things if giving the chance. He's talking like he knows her when in reality he knows nothing on her. And because I've gotten upset over his
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-10 00:42:47	He didn't live with my mother he wasnt brought up by her he wasn't abused by her yet he stands there and says she wouldn't have done certain

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 23:21:59	@Broken_Jigsaw I was hoping for a different brown envelope :/ one from the dvla with a conclusion about my provisional license. They must
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 23:20:25	@will7201 ranting about him helped, he won't change so no point trying to talk to him! I'm just going to eat his ice cream and enjoy it!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 23:18:50	And to add to it all my laptop still hasn't arrived!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 23:17:48	In what he's done, it's just me getting stressed and having a moan, heaven forbid I'm actually allowed to do something or have a moan!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 23:16:55	I've got to be glued to my phone and drop everything the second he calls or texts. And then he says your getting stressed and sees no wrong
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 23:15:57	The phone to me, why haven't you replied, did you get my text etc, usually it's cause I'm sorting out my son or doing some cleaning. Seems
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 23:15:00	Told him not to bloody bother making contact during the day then when he's at work. If he text me and I didn't respond he'd be straight on
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 23:14:02	When he calls he doesn't talk and all I hear is the bloody keyboard being tapped at it was after that i got the I'm at work thrown at me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 23:12:50	Get told "I'm at work you know I'm busy" which I'd expect if I'd bombarded him with messages and calls but I hadn't, it just annoys me that
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 23:12:06	My hub drives me up the bloody wall. Hadn't messaged him in a couple of hours as I knew he was busy at work so when he does ring just now I

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 20:09:54	Blooming brown letters, this was very thin so wasn't too concerned, it was only the end of year tax thing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 19:52:47	@turquoisejulia yes I could imagine as you could only do one home a day if having to stay all day...
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 19:41:35	Hate waiting for deliveries especially when the window is 8am to 9pm!! Can't do anything!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 18:51:30	@brokenmind_ id ask her to clarify could mean she's become a nun or something hopefully it doesn't mean she is going to make an attempt :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 18:49:57	That's really disgusted me if there are any girls who are in the same position I was in at 13 and this comes into force they need protecting
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 18:47:54	@stilgarg it is on so many level this really angers me for reasons of my own childhood :/

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 18:42:43	@freckles6127 your cpn is able to sort things out for you so everyone is happy with the situation. Sounds frustrating!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 18:41:04	@freckles6127 if your more comfortable having a depo then the psych should agree, your medicated then, no worry about not taking pills. Hope
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-09 18:38:53	I'm sorry what?! the age of consent should be lowered so the paedos can have sex with young girls without consequence. No no no!! Thats sick

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 22:37:42	A quiet night on Roundhay Wing (1/3) http:// youtu.be/De8SKJTVReQ
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 22:24:07	Psych said that the non bipolar issues I have can be sorted and "cured" he really listened and had read my notes, was reassuring.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 22:20:18	As I am stable on it and don't have a major relapse!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 22:20:01	Diagnosis but agrees that it can be worked on with CBT. He's upped the lamotrigine to 200mg and wants me on it no less that 2 years as long
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 22:18:44	Ok back from psych appointment he feels diagnosis wise Bipolar. Told him what I wrote here last night and he doesn't think it warrants a BPD
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 19:55:57	@will7201 thank you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 19:02:06	2 hours till psych appointment nerves are running wild. Cpn coming in with me. Not sure what's going to happen and I don't like the unknown!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 15:29:24	I dreamt last night I was making lemon drizzle cake but I messed up and needed to buy more lemons and even lemon curd but couldn't find any!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 05:22:50	@stilgarg thank you thats really nice, im feeling a bit better now x

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 05:21:18	@bpdprincessx thank you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 03:27:21	Going to go cry
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 03:26:19	Cpn "you respond differently to stressors and trauma, different to the abnormal responses usually seen" so im even more abnormal brilliant
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 03:24:15	Falling flat on my face, hard! Just want to run away from myself but im always going to be here no escape
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 03:22:35	Everyone's laughing now, they are watching you fall from that high place you put yourself on, and no ones there to catch you. Crash and burn
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 03:20:37	Feeling vulnerable tonight, taking everything personally, even things not directed at me. Feel like many are saying told you so, paranoid :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 03:00:13	I feel horrible, realising ive been fooling myself, psych is going to agree im sure
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 02:58:10	Well what i thought was the start of hypomania is actually just an irritable, agitated stressy day that i woke up like, wishful thinking!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 02:54:12	Heads aching have so many thoughts going on, confused and i guess scared. Have i been fooling myself?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 02:51:57	@WonderWhyWoman thanks :) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 02:51:46	@stilgarg having a rough time with diagnosis and symptoms, confused mainly, hows you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 02:48:44	I just dont have the right words to say anymore, ive said about deleting this account several times yet i wont because i need it badly.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 02:47:52	Crap and things that have upset people, i dont know how to support people anymore, its like thats been zapped out of me. I care i really do
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 02:47:12	Die, i want to see my son grow up, i just dont know where i stand with this disorder. I feel ive made many enemies on twitter by tweeting
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 02:46:17	Guess im so scared of this label, feel like a phone as to me i dont behave like some with bpd. I dont want to self harm and i dont want to
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 02:44:16	Professional wise are so judgemental of anyone with a bpd diagnosis any other diagnosis is sidelined and all they see if bpd.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 02:43:12	Here they won't hospitalise those with bpd diagnosis if the crisis is bpd related. Hopefully i won't get to the need of that, some here
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 02:42:04	I dont know where my care will lead if the bpd diagnosis stays, even with the bipolar, and what would happen if i needed inpatient cause
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 01:43:08	@bpdprincessx it is but i dont know if its due to the lamotrigine, baby brain, dissociation or just forgetfulness, its concerning. Xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 01:42:07	My cpn thinks ive dissociated but i dont feel im having any stressful events at the moment. She does feel there is some bipolar there too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 01:39:25	Tho i feel very aware of what was going on at the time i cant remember details later on, i cant remember phone convos either
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 01:38:19	Im suffering with a bad memory at the moment its gotten worse in the past few months but im forgetting what ive done several hours ago even
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 01:37:00	I perceive arguments and events differently to the truth, and i dont like to be judged but am judging and being very critical of others.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 01:35:12	I get angry and explosive and can suddenly flip, thought this could just be anger issues i apparently project my thoughts as others feelings
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-08 01:33:50	The thing that confuses me having bpd is that my behaviours are not the same. To hub has told me that i do fear rejection and gave examples
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 23:51:43	I think ive been running from something i can not escape, denying it plays any part in me, just dont think its typical which could explain!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 23:36:52	>> actually being very aggressive and irrational? Those with BPD does this link in with the borderline thinking or way of being? Thanks
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 23:35:15	Anyone struggle with recollection of events being somewhat different to the truth, like in an argument you think your being calm yet your >>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 22:52:48	Mixed leaf salad, cucumber and babybell cheese with a Caesar dressing is just lush, i want more but after 2 servings ive run out :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 22:51:28	Cpn app went ok shes coming into the psych app tomorrow and talking for me on some bits as my memory is shot and i wont remember what to say
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 20:20:54	If this is the hypomania i predicted was coming its not the nice happy ones i had last time this is agitated angry and raged!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 20:20:00	Feel like ive got bloody ants in my pants im so restless and snappy. Cant think straight too many thoughts. I want to scream so much!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 20:13:37	Can't delete via ipad takes me to mobile twitter grr fucked off even more now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 20:03:41	Definitely think its time to get rid of this account, its served its purpose.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 20:02:45	Im not ashamed, im actually very happy with my life! you don't like it oh well, not my problem!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 20:01:01	30 mins or so till the cpn arrives. I am in a very agitated mood so she'd better not try and feed me some cock and bull story have had it!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 19:59:42	Geez get over yourself!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-07 07:52:05	Think I've just wrote an essay which Im gonna give to the cpn tomorrow will make for interesting reading for her haha!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-06 03:29:11	If you know you deserve better, then don't stop fighting till you get better but remember perfect isn't real so don't strive for it!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-04 23:20:19	Anyone got the hotter than south Europe weather that was promised?? We have clouds and sun but its windy too so reduces the temp somewhat :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-04 20:08:44	I'm never going to learn to drive at this rate. So impatient hate waiting!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-04 20:07:41	4 weeks since DVLA wrote to me telling me they had written to my old psych, said max 6 weeks. I bet the medical is sat on his desk still :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-04 19:04:27	Where's this hotter than south Europe weather then?? Barely any sun loads of wind and cloudy, that wasnt promised!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:34:15	Just because you can't do something now, dont let it stop you because you just might do it later on. Some things just take a little longer!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:32:51	Didnt know i had, and i accept that there are just some things i cant ever do like sing! But that wont stop me from singing to my fave tunes
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:31:34	You know i know who i am, but there is still much im learning about myself, things i do, i shock myself with some of my abilities that i
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:30:33	Once i decide to stop tweeting, if ever!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:29:51	I know many dont read my tweets and i dont care, this is my documentation of the trials and tribulations i go through, will make a good read
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:28:13	Life doesnt have plus one, you can't rewind and start again, the previous hour may have been crap but the next hour can be amazing!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:26:10	I dont always see my potential when im under the black cloud, but even when there's rain, the sun is shining, just temporarily hidden!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:25:15	Hell i like and no one will hold me back. My husband is an extension of that free spirit, he encourages it. I suffer with highs and lows and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:24:25	I am what alot of people used to say to me "a free spirited person" again that drove her mad, i had my own mind and i did and do what the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:23:10	But i didnt, i have been my own person all along and that is the one thing she hated, she couldnt mould me to be a mini her!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:21:57	Maybe a bit too much on it, i realise im nothing like her, funny how living with her for 19 years i should have picked up some of her ways
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 16:21:09	In some of my darkest hours recently ive been debating in my mind whether im more like my mother than i care to believe but after thinking
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 15:54:38	@virginmedia problem sorted, problem within green box end of road and wires damaged. Thanks for quick work and great service!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 15:52:43	Oh yeah and ive hoovered too!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 15:52:32	Not yet 9am woken up by neighbours shouting, virgin media been and fixed phone line, and fire brigade has been out to a flat fire in my road
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 05:42:04	I'm exhausted like I've been really active, didn't go kayaking in the end as it got too late, it's like a wave suddenly engulfing me :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 04:43:54	Watching secret eaters and omg 6000 calories in one day!! Shesh
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 02:52:40	@kaycey55 will be tweeting a lot on Weds and will update twitter on the outcome of the appointment and what's said etc. got cpn on Tuesday
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 02:43:54	@kaycey55 that is true, guess will have to wait till weds to find out. Will be interesting.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:39:40	@amanda_stand @bpdprincessx and thank you will keep you updated on what happens on Wednesday :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:37:59	@will7201 lol I can't do that, for me being in someone else's car it's their car so they decide unless they give permission to change it :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:35:38	@amanda_stand @bpdprincessx me too, I'm so confused by it all and just want some clarity. I've had so many diagnoses these past 6 years :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:33:57	@kaycey55 yeah not holding out for miracles but hoping to find an answer of some sort :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:33:01	@amanda_stand @bpdprincessx things up for me once I see him on Wednesday, this psych knows me from 3 years ago so he knows me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:32:26	@amanda_stand @bpdprincessx it and I've queried it due to how I'm not showing any signs. It's confused me no end guess the psych will clear
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:31:04	@amanda_stand @bpdprincessx and depressions, I was giving a working diagnosis before I was transferred teams they hung the BPD traits with
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:30:22	@amanda_stand @bpdprincessx please don't argue :( I know you both mean well even if it hasn't come across that well. I have had hypomanias
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:23:33	@bpdprincessx @amanda_stand I guess with bipolar and BPD being similar eliminating some of the classic BPD signs can point towards bipolar x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:19:58	@amanda_stand @bpdprincessx I had worked with. The situation wasnt BPD related at all it was bullying and discrimination of my pregnancy :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:19:07	@amanda_stand @bpdprincessx didn't really get to know me, my last cpn only saw the troubles I had had with my last employer and friend that
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:18:32	@amanda_stand @bpdprincessx I have a working diagnosis of bipolar, I think the perinatal team I was with diagnosed the BPD wrongly as they
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:09:09	Just remembered the psych Im seeing on Wednesday misdiagnosed me with schizophrenia during a very stressful time was infact stress psychosis
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:07:02	@amanda_stand me neither this is why I'm going to query it at psych appointment. I may have had it at one point of my life but not anymore.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:05:22	@amanda_stand related psychosis only. :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:04:57	@amanda_stand don't feel empty, know who I am & have a sense of self. Mood lasts weeks not days, don't dissociate. Have anger and stress
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:03:56	@amanda_stand I don't which is why they've said traits but I don't SH, haven't attempted since 2010, don't fear abandonment or rejection
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:02:40	I was very impressionable, wanted to fit in. Which I know now isn't right. Of course why would anyone want to SH to fit in, but I did. :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-03 00:00:46	Late 2008 and since then only one minor attempt in 2010. I never self harmed to cope with emotions, it was purely because others did it and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 23:59:27	Is it BPD if you used to SH but only did it because others did and thought it was helping them so would help you? I havent self harmed since
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 23:51:34	Hmm just thought if cpn is taking me to psych appointment does that mean she will want to sit in with me? Will have to ask on Tuesday....
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 22:40:37	@Love_my_Westie charming hate when they do that doesn't validate you at all :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 22:14:38	@will7201 thanks and yes it is hard
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 21:52:00	@turquoisejulia minute appointment so hopefully the dr will be able to get a clear presentation of me and we can decide on meds.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 21:51:06	@turquoisejulia me too, with waiting for buses as well as actual bus journey it would have been a nightmare and with a buggy. Have for a 30
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 21:50:08	But am just going to try and believe that she forgot. Will voice all this on Tuesday.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 21:48:59	I think those things really should have happened at the CPA I had with old and new cpn. I am annoyed that my cpn hadn't put a request in
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 21:47:42	Situation is just that no one told me about the changes since 2010 and that my cpn didn't give me the CTT number I had to find it myself.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 21:46:55	I was only denying myself the appointment so for my own benefit I've accepted. The thing I'm actually upset about really with the whole
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 21:45:19	I was upset it was a justified upset. I don't trust my cpn as things haven't been right from the start But by refusing the lift there & back
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 21:41:01	I got so worked up & cried so hard I now feel sick. I don't like feeling like this. I just wish I was told the right things from the start!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 21:38:18	I've reluctantly said yes to cpn taking me and son to a psych appointment and home again. I need to see a psych and this is the only way :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 21:36:52	@turquoisejulia thanks I'm going to speak to cpn next week and be honest about how I feel regarding the transfer & what's happened.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 21:35:35	@Love_my_Westie that's what sort of happened here until I explained myself better then got an apology. Going to be having words with cpn.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 20:49:40	And a hour and a half travelling back for a 15 minute appointment. I was told by other team I'd see someone at a place 15 minutes walk away!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 20:48:15	Sat here in tears because it seems the only way I'm going to see a psych is if I take 3 buses spend over an hour and a half travelling there
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 20:24:32	If when whoever phones me back it better not be the cpn because I said I didn't want to speak to her gives me a load of BS I'm gonna scream!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 20:20:45	As I had guessed no request for psych app has gone in. I'm livid and am requesting a change in cpn.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 20:08:41	@stilgarg they don't care at all, this is why I discharged myself in 2010 hoped it would be better with the reshuffle but its worse :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:59:00	Really want to ring the CTT and tell them where they can stick it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:57:24	@stilgarg it's not like they haven't known I was being transferred they got the transfer request back in January. Glad your ok :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:55:31	Transferred to their team and no one could be bothered to tell me about the reshuffle or how it's changed since I was with them in 2010.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:54:47	The fucking mental health system here is appalling its got worse since they've changed how it works. They've known since January I was being
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:53:48	She's had two bloody weeks to put a request in and she can't even be bothered to call me back when I ask, I could have been struggling.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:52:48	If my cpn turns up on Tuesday and tells me she hasn't put in a request for a psych app I'm going to go flipping mental on her & kick her out
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:51:57	@stilgarg psych is still sat on his desk. Sorry to rant just frustrated. Really want a hypomania cause right now feeling high would be great
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:50:45	@stilgarg for me to see one, I'm also waiting for my provisional license to come through but betting the medical form the dvla sent my old
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:50:08	@stilgarg hi hope things are better for you now? I'm ok without a psych and a useless cpn that can't get her finger out and request an app
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:33:08	@virginmedia an engineer is coming out tomorrow to sort it. Guessing crossed wires?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:08:37	My tinnitus is really playing up today only in left ear tho. Blumming annoying!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 19:04:16	@Hopingforhope1 it's supposed to be activating, boost anti depressants, control mania and psychosis. For me it made me agitated as hell.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 18:38:44	Anyone with virgin media and had the experience of them randomly changing your home telephone number without notifying you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 18:00:42	Have decided to wear shorts anyone coming near me had better wear sunglasses due to the glare off my milk bottles legs!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 17:42:49	@Irish_lass1975 thanks :-)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 05:42:07	I'm more sleepy since stopping chlorpromazine than I was when I took it. How does that figure?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 04:52:28	Fed up of being accused of being in a mood state I'm not & hearing things wrongly. Bet the next thing he'll say is take the chlorpromazine!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 03:00:23	Reassessing a lot of thoughts, beliefs and judgements at the moment. I need to make some radical changes and soon, before something happens!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 02:23:28	@will7201 thanks :-) really pleased with it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 02:22:12	Some things baffle me no end.....
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-02 02:17:04	@will7201 it's Latin for seize the day.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 23:29:11	@brokenmind_ glad I could help :-)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 14:33:41	I have a very cheeky little boy smiling at me at the mo and also using my legs as drums!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 14:31:43	It's half 7 and already my neighbour is going off at her very young child, screaming and shouting at her. The walls here are paper thin :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 14:30:36	I'd laugh in the the face of some people if it were physically possible being miles away kinda hinders that a little oh well, ill just laugh
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 14:28:31	Ah morning, the sun is shining its a fresh new day, birds singing. Nature is gorgeous. Time to sweep away the cobwebs and open the curtains!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 03:59:12	I feel so sleepy, want a bath but not sure it's safe thing to do.....
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 02:33:20	@ALivingLie_ that's really cool!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 01:05:20	@bpdprincessx that's true, I can't put anything mental health related on Facebook so this is my escape x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 01:03:33	Ok so I've stopped the chlorpromazine I couldn't deal with the sun effects and making my skin itch with the heat. Hope to get psych app soon
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 00:59:58	@bpdprincessx as if no one is reading and then if someone does reply it's a bonus! :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 00:58:46	@bpdprincessx it is hard, my Facebook is for family and friends away from mental health but twitter is my escape. You're right!! Gonna tweet
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 00:53:13	@bpdprincessx glad your ok too, thanks I just get irritated that no one replies even to non mental related tweets x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 00:51:44	@chaosandcontrol see what eBay have to offer that's the best place to find those sort of items x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-05-01 00:50:08	@bpdprincessx I'm ok thanks but know exactly what you mean. How are you?

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-30 23:01:59	@nuttylotte ah right I stayed at the hotel flamingo oasis the entertainment was great food delicious was meant to go in 2011 but got preg

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-30 19:25:09	Hate my financial situation right now

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-30 05:14:24	Hmm maybe taking meds with alcohol isn't the right thing to do but screw being right and correct all the time that's boring !!!!!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-30 05:09:28	@NatalieOxford cheers lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-30 02:11:15	Got to love an ice cold Budweiser!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-30 00:49:13	Yep ok point taken!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-30 00:46:30	@Love_my_Westie oh no what happened? you ok?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 23:40:15	Anyone taking lamotrigine suffer with headaches weeks after starting the med?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 23:38:30	Why did something sound so good this morning but this afternoon seems ridiculous?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 23:33:16	Right I need a new laptop my current one is on its last legs its an Acer so want to steer clear of those. Any recommendations??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 23:32:18	Really weird my little finger on right hand keeps locking up, not a nice sensation at all :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 23:29:11	@brokenmind_ @alivinglie_ I did read somewhere that someone used nail clippers & snipped off bits of the carpet & hoovered to fluff it up.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 23:04:09	@brokenmind_ allowed to home dye anymore. My hub would rather I pay out £80 and have my hair dyed and cut professionally. I don't do it well
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 23:03:19	@brokenmind_ try Vaseline if you have any that's good for getting it off skin so may work for other things too. It gets everywhere. I'm not
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 23:01:14	@brokenmind_ guess waitin for it to dry will let you know if its gone,worse or better :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:57:17	@brokenmind_ read several tips on google, hairspray, soda water or vinegar are meant to reduce the stains with a little elbow grease.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:53:10	@brokenmind_ stops it from getting more ingrained in the carpet.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:52:51	@brokenmind_ it would work for you. As for getting it out of carpet I haven't a clue sorry, just don't rub it it will make it worse, dabbing
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:51:47	@brokenmind_ I used to use an old towel for dying hair stopped any drips however I was dying full head not part like you are so don't no if
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:50:50	Maybe I am in denial about having any BPD traits but that's my issue, and once I finally see a psych ill get things sorted once and for all!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:48:43	Definitely think its time to leave this twitter account for the hundredth time. No I'm seriously considering it now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:31:54	And mean it not say it in a jokingly way.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:31:25	I swear I need telling to shut up sometimes. I honestly really do, why can someone just have the guts to say hey you!! Shut up!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:30:13	Just had a doh moment thought I could hear my phone vibrating then realised I had my phone in my hands!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:28:44	Fish finger sarnie Mmmmmmmmm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:19:12	I should probably eat something hmm but what......
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:05:46	And with that thought I want to go back to days of just a telephone and ink and paper!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 22:04:41	Using a telephone for talking seems old fashioned now. Everything's online & with that its easy to ignore people you don't want to speak to!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 21:47:16	The service could actually get worse but this this is a whole new level of shit!! I've been let down its not much to ask for getting my meds
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 20:42:16	Can you tell I'm really not happy about how the services are run here, when I discharged myself back 2010 they where shit them didn't think
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 20:41:18	Think he was on the understanding I'd have a psych appointment pretty soon after being transferred. No one prepared me for the change at all
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 20:39:23	My meds wanted to give the new team a fresh presentation of me, bet he didn't think id be waiting this long for a psych appointment tho!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 20:38:46	Asked for an urgent psych appointment but it hasn't happened. Nah they want to see me struggle clearly, old psych didn't want to play with
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 20:36:17	I can do this on my own, I don't need anyone, no professionals no therapy. Even thinking of coming off meds they aren't do anything at all!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 20:08:48	I'm never going to get my provisional license Hate how long it's taking bet my old psych hasn't even bothered to do the medical form yet :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 17:34:45	And no not any sort of spider no not going there bloody petrified of the things. Wonder what the reptile shop has...goes to look on website!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 17:33:21	Seeing as I can't have a bat, it's cruel to keep them captive, I already have a corn snake what other pets could I have that are unusual hmm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 17:26:03	I wish I could have a pet bat they are sooo cute!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 17:23:22	Months to research and sort out stock, suppliers, promotion, where to sell etc. maybe hopefully next year will have it up and running!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 17:22:14	Like the idea of being my own boss but I need to make sure the stock I get I can sell and make a profit or its not worth it, going to take
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 17:20:00	Need to do some market research on the need for cheap beads and customer requirements, see competition on eBay and alike.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 17:17:16	Getting a familiar feeling definitely going to go with it as its a good feeling.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 17:16:04	@nuttylotte aw sorry to hear that. Hope the mht visit goes ok and you manage to get something to eat.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 15:41:32	@nuttylotte I'm good thanks. Going to have a day of sorting out and cleaning, washing etc. how's you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 15:20:00	Good morning everyone!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 04:16:17	@turquoisejulia wow glad you got it sorted and able to use dla to keep it together that's good use of it. :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 04:12:31	@turquoisejulia it's a good suggestion :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 04:12:12	@Irish_lass1975 think I'm going to write the complaint, if she's said that to me what's she said to other mums in similar situations :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 04:11:22	@turquoisejulia lol I can't afford a cleaner, but am going to do bite size chunks over the next week, that & start on my sons bedroom mural
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 04:09:32	@aweebithopeful thanks :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 04:07:56	@turquoisejulia that's a good plan. The reason I've not got into it is because other things have come up or I've forgotten lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 04:06:39	@Irish_lass1975 I am, got an address to write a complaint to just not sure it's worth the hassle and stress.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 04:04:40	@emmamarie1980 I'm not they show where I've been and that I survived. She's the one who should be ashamed specially being an ex psych nurse!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 04:02:06	@brokenmind_ yep she should, makes me think she was a shit nurse to change careers, isn't a very good health visitor either.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 04:00:17	@babyhart thanks she was a psych nurse before being a health visitor, glad she's leaving, really put me off health visitors/sure start.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 03:58:15	@aweebithopeful I know she was a psych nurse before being a health visitor!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 03:57:11	@bpdprincessx I'm not ashamed like you say they are war wounds. She's leaving thankfully, was a psych nurse before a health visitor!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 03:56:21	@brokenmind_ I'm going to, thankfully she's leaving the job, ironically she was a psych nurse before being a health visitor!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 03:55:24	For the last 4 days I've been saying I was going to sort out my craft room and 4 days I haven't managed to get to do it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 03:50:17	Cancelling the health visitor who told me to cover up my arms as any potential friend will judge my scars & that I should be ashamed of them
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 01:05:07	@brokenmind_ definitely say that's a zero grade that's what my hubs head looks like after I've shaved it for him. Don't look bad tho!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 00:40:28	I am addicted to frappes, frappacinos and iced cream coffees yum yum yum!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 00:39:05	@Profanity_Annie they are filming in my city soon, seen a flyer asking for contestants. Not brave enough to do it and be filmed!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-29 00:37:25	@Profanity_Annie @freckles6127 @alivinglie_ @nuttylotte @barmybelle I'd love to meet up with you all. You're all amazing and wonderful <3 x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 21:04:36	#PeopleIReallyWantToMeet the wonderful peeps I chat to on twitter, cause they are amazing!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 21:02:52	Haha having a staring competition with hub whilst he's dipping biscuits in his cuppa and he misses the cup altogether!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 21:01:41	@Profanity_Annie lol it's good to take a break ;)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 21:00:22	@NatalieOxford lol yes I can use rest as an excuse :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 20:37:10	@turquoisejulia phew feel better now :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 20:33:14	Right everyone stop cleaning!!! You're making me feel lazy!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 03:16:15	Enjoyed my Chinese too!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 03:14:07	I feel so connected to everything around me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 03:12:40	@stilgarg glad it went well I have looked into it but my nerves are getting the better of me :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 02:37:01	Ugh no no no that's just no #bgt
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 02:36:19	@stilgarg hey there how are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 02:05:34	Mmmm having Chinese for dinner tonight. Today has been a really really good day :-D
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 00:16:18	@Sexy_eyes35 glad you had fun together :-) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-28 00:11:47	@Sexy_eyes35 good for you!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 23:21:40	@Sexy_eyes35 oh lovely, some friend, doesn't hurt to send a text or quick call to say sorry not coming. Silence is horrible.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 23:19:07	@brokenmind_ don't blame you. Pintreast is more of a picture site I use it to gain inspiration from other crafters.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 23:16:52	@Sexy_eyes35 @love_my_westie what's happened?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 23:16:27	@brokenmind_ favourite interests etc and find people and pics/blogs that way. Many do blog on it, I'm kinda boring with it lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 23:15:24	@brokenmind_ my username is imaonegirlrevolution. I just reblog pics that I like, Disney funny cats sayings quotes. You can search for your
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 23:10:59	@brokenmind_ yes it is sadly its like some are bragging about it. I've stayed off it recently it was just too much.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 23:04:05	@brokenmind_ found tumblr to be very triggering with self harm pictures, there are many with BPD on there blogging their struggles.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 22:29:55	@autiepower thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 22:19:40	@turquoisejulia no luckily I had got home before that came down thankfully :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 22:17:51	Beads I brought today to add to the many I've already got!! pic.twitter.com/LzzAsI4tyB
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 22:16:18	@Fallingstar_x thanks I did was really good :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 22:15:58	@oxymoronic82 thanks I did it was brilliant :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 22:15:42	@turquoisejulia thanks had a fun time :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 15:53:10	Looking forward to later on seeing a friend I haven't seen in 5 years so excited I can't wait!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 04:16:44	Having a real early night and off to bed now, got a banging headache and need to sleep it off. Night every one!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 04:15:37	@brokenmind_ sun exposer side effects I don't like. When I was on 600mg my skin felt like it was bubbling even with sunscreen on.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 04:14:14	@brokenmind_ wow cloz is such a strong med to treat BPD, haven't heard it being used for that before. Chlorpromazine is good but it's the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 04:07:16	Back on chlorpromazine coming off for a few days showed it actually was working, now Ive got to build back the tolerance to the sedation :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 03:28:34	@WonderWhyWoman no probs hope you find something to treat yourself :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 03:25:20	@WonderWhyWoman theres another website http:// justfor5pounds.com similar website. Great being so cheap and guilt free!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 03:07:18	@WonderWhyWoman yep we think its bankrupt stock as its a case of when its gone its gone, must be why its so cheap!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 02:59:16	Have just found the perfect website, http:// everything5pounds.com brilliant for spending sprees!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 01:14:37	@brokenmind_ most definitely!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-27 01:12:17	@brokenmind_ twalking is very dangerous lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 23:50:20	@psychoticdancer I was on it for mood stabilisation, I couldn't handle the weight gain I had currently on chlorpromazine.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 22:23:10	@psychoticdancer same was 20mg the first time I took it no weight gain but serious sedation 2nd major weight gain and no sedation. Hate it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 22:21:31	I wonder if I can persuade my hubster to stop off at maccy ds on the way home from my sis n laws this evening hmm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 22:16:29	@turquoisejulia recognise me from I used to work in KFC in Shirley.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 22:16:12	@turquoisejulia KFC used to be isn't? I could be totally off haven't been to Shirley for absolutely ages. Had another thought where u might
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 22:15:38	@turquoisejulia ooh it's bugging me what used to be there before? Was it a clothes shop? If my locations right thats just down from where
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 06:45:58	@Scarsarebeaut_ no need to be sorry, anyone who expected you to support them whilst your struggling and dealing with this news is wrong hugs
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 06:07:13	@Scarsarebeaut_ you're welcome, fingers crossed it hasnt spread and your mum can recover and get in remission massive hugs xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 05:45:08	@Love_my_Westie ok. Be safe, keep talking if it helps/you want to hugs x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 05:43:35	@NatalieOxford months long, i either left due to depression or left because i felt i was better than people/starting adventures/got bored.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 05:42:45	@NatalieOxford the longest job i held was my last one, however being on mat leave for 6 months helped make the duration longer. Most were 5
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 05:40:52	@Love_my_Westie @sexy_eyes35 do, then talk with v about the pros and cons of doing it. Would that help at all?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 05:40:02	@Love_my_Westie @sexy_eyes35 upset you even subconsciously. Would talking about what you want to do help if you verbalised what you would
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 05:39:06	@Love_my_Westie @sexy_eyes35 can you write down and go through the past couple of days, convos youve had and see if anything could have
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 05:37:58	@Love_my_Westie get through this without doing anything harmful to yourself. Keep talking if you need to, please dont add to your scars
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 05:36:50	@Love_my_Westie it would be safer for you to comfort eat rather than cut and/or od. You said yourself youve done well without oding, you can
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 05:33:00	@Love_my_Westie your scars show how you have coped. V loves you no matter what, she sees past them and the beauty you hold. Your not a mess!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 05:23:32	Looking back most times ive left a job i prob was hypomanic, cant say for sure. Anyone else had difficulties holding down jobs due to bp?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 05:20:07	Ive just been thinking ive have at least 14 jobs since leaving school 11 years ago. I just cant hold down a job most of the time i get bored
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:59:48	@turquoisejulia I'll have to get off on central bridge and walk to ocean village that way as the first route 1 doesn't go pass OV anymore.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:53:31	@brokenmind_ that's good, once the CTT moves building it will be a 15 min walk to them too, tho I think outpatients are already there.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:51:22	@brokenmind_ the phrase if its not broke dont fix it comes to mind....
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:48:19	@turquoisejulia ill be getting a bus, but thanks anyway :) I'm really looking forward to it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:47:12	@brokenmind_ the only time you go to the now called community treatment team is to see a psych for outpatients.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:46:30	@brokenmind_ for the main city centre was closer and only one bus journey! Now they've put all 3 cmht into one and got rid of duty service!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:45:13	@brokenmind_ that's true. I used to have to get 2 buses and travel almost to the edge of the city to get to the cmht for my area yet the one
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:42:59	@brokenmind_ yep alot has changed with the services here and it's confused me as I'm used to how it was run 3 years ago.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:40:45	@turquoisejulia thank you sooo much I'm not going to get lost next Friday :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:38:29	@Scarsarebeaut_ I'm so sorry to hear this hope that its treatable. Massive hugs to you here if you need xxx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:36:19	@brokenmind_ I wonder if that's why they changed it, so if you need an urgent app they can get you one without top long a wait.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:17:22	@brokenmind_ me neither its ridiculous
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:11:57	@will7201 sorry to hear that. It used to be that we saw a psych depending on how well we were doing but now it seems its at a last resort :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:04:31	@turquoisejulia hey how's you, just a quick question but where is the college I've looked on the map and can't find grove house anywhere :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:02:33	@brokenmind_ definitely!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 02:00:20	@brokenmind_ I think they are only for limited time too :/ maybe save it for later...
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 01:58:52	I need to or I become acutely unwell, it's no longer on a monthly/3 monthly basis like it used to be :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 01:58:06	Those of you who see a psych, do you see them regularly like on a monthly etc basis? I've been told I'll only see a psych if my cpn thinks
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 01:55:32	@brokenmind_ lol why not they are too delicious to just leave in the fridge!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 01:54:46	Thankfully my trip to the GP wasn't a struggle like I feared it would have and my cpn is putting in a request for me to have a psych app.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-26 01:52:55	@brokenmind_ agreed!! Couldn't get enough of it very disappointed when I got to the bottom lol the caramel latte one is really refreshing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 05:13:05	I'm shutting up now and stopping with all the tweets. Need some time to think and work things out. Coming off twitter for a while again.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 05:09:07	@barmybelle @nuttylotte @brokenmind_ the only thing I have difficulty with is my anger, wondering if I have intermittent explosive disorder
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 05:08:22	@barmybelle @nuttylotte @brokenmind_ depression hits for a couple of weeks, then a period of stable mood before it goes tits up again.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 05:07:22	@barmybelle @nuttylotte @brokenmind_ I don't do that either, it's hypomania for 2 weeks then seem to level out for a week or so then the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 05:05:57	@brokenmind_ @nuttylotte for all. Then can sort out therapy. I'm leaning towards CBT to change my thinking rather than the DBT route.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 05:05:18	@brokenmind_ @nuttylotte thanks that really does mean alot, I'm fighting so hard to get a psych appointment atm to sort out diagnosis once &
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 05:03:28	@barmybelle @nuttylotte @brokenmind_ that's what I find confusing about the whole thing :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 05:03:10	@barmybelle @nuttylotte @brokenmind_ but you can't switch off BPD it's there all the time, between hypomania & depression I'm nearly sane :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 05:01:49	@Thewayimfeelin thanks your right it is.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 05:00:41	@Love_my_Westie that is true x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 04:59:26	@nuttylotte @brokenmind_ with my old employers and how they treated me, I think my reactions to that was justified yet I was labeled BPD :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 04:58:50	@nuttylotte @brokenmind_ thinking, I just don't think I have it and think my old psych was too quick to diagnose it based on problems I had
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 04:57:58	@nuttylotte @brokenmind_ I'm only ever suicidal when in a depressive episode. My moods last weeks rather than hours, I don't have b&w
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 04:57:01	@nuttylotte @brokenmind_ I just don't feel borderline I have confidence and self esteem issues alongside bipolar 2 disorder I don't selfharm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 04:01:09	Just been told I don't act or talk like a someone with BPD/traits what's your honest opinion do I sound "borderline" with my tweets??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-25 00:20:32	Thanks for the tweets I will respond at a later time. I'm too angry to be online at the moment. So taking some time out. I am safe and ok.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 22:58:13	Because I am doing good. I've had to block people and report people for dm's I've received. Don't like where I am don't fucking follow!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 22:57:28	Sorry not sorry for not being a full blown borderline, for wanting to do something and fucking recover. Some people have made me feel shit
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 22:56:14	I'm deleting this account, no one gives a shit, people unfollow me because I'm doing good & ignore me when I'm doing bad. That's fucked up!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 22:52:38	Cpn said last week shed sort out some prn for me and guess what she hasn't done!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 22:51:58	Haven't been with this team a month and I've been let down again & again. Supposed to be going up on the lamotrigine but nope not happening
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 22:50:14	I have fing had it with this mental health team, my cpn hasn't rung me, I have no psychiatrist. I'm about ready to discharge myself!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 21:17:46	Without taking it. Just hope my cpn will ring me this afternoon i need something sorting asap!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 21:17:15	Told them my medication runs out this week and isnt on repeat, which really bugs me, with it being lamotrigine i cant exactly go the weekend
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 21:16:10	Making a complaint about the receptionists at my surgery, damn right rude and their attitudes stink. I was very polite and she really wasnt!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 21:07:57	No post at all :/ only waiting for a psych appointment to sort out meds. Cpn meant to contact me about change of appointment and hasn't grr
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 20:30:58	@brokenmind_ thanks. There is no reason however for me to get one :/ just really hope that if a brown envelope does land it's from the dvla!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 20:25:33	I have this feeling that a brown envelope is going to land on my floor when the postie finally gets here. Can't shake it :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 04:24:42	@brokenmind_ @silentlyana it's on Netflix too I watched it about a month ago.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 03:18:52	Just had the best microwave spaghetti carbonara ever!! Actually it was the best carbonara ive ever had mmmm

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 02:40:20	@turquoisejulia I must of, it's amazing! Never thought we were going to see summer this year! Thought winter was here to stay! X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 02:34:02	@IamCarrieeeeee that's understandable, I'm now going to be staying away from twitter if I'm not doing good. I'm really good now How are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 02:12:22	This OU module I'm reading is very interesting, it's freely available on iTunes U along with loads of other free courses on various subjects
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 02:10:29	@IamCarrieeeeee hi noticed u have unfollowed me, sorry if I upset you with my tweets the last week or so, wasnt in the best place.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 02:02:27	@brokenmind_ it won't crash and will give you the full website instead of mobile.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 02:01:56	I've got sunburn!! Never thought it was going to happen this year!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-24 02:00:56	@brokenmind_ are you doing it through the Facebook app or safari? I've found sometimes a complete shut down of the iPad helps.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-23 23:47:17	@stilgarg thanks its my flowers my hub brought me last week, they smell so lush. Walk was great did me alot of good and son enjoyed it too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-23 23:41:44	@brokenmind_ no probs!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-23 23:41:30	Just had a lovely walk out along the shore with my son, even sat reading a OU module on challenging mental health!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-23 23:40:13	@brokenmind_ put some tissue on top and it should flush
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-23 19:56:32	@Welsh_Lil havent even spoken ever the the tweeter requesting to follow once and then get blocked!! Charming!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-23 19:54:36	Will say im not sugar coating or holding my tongue anymore, done that for way too long, being assertive and standing my ground!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-23 19:52:21	@will7201 most definitely :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-23 19:50:21	Its not my fault and i wont feel bad that some people cant handle where i am with my mental health. Have unfollowed a huge amount today!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-23 19:48:28	And found out one tweeter has blocked me for no apparent reason.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-23 19:45:36	@stilgarg hey im doing good, have a good time shopping!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-23 19:43:37	Just been through my followings to find some people have unfollowed me, somewhat shocked cause some i spoke to regularly have unfollowed hmm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 23:54:23	@Comfort_talks and thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 23:54:09	@Comfort_talks diploma in higher education open studies bit of a mix but it psychology and health and social based.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 23:46:50	Once the student finance England website starts allowing claims for part time tuition fee loans i will be an OU Student :-D
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 22:02:28	@autiepower thank you that's very helpful :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 21:32:16	@autiepower its more about applying than anything else, what do i need to give as evidence of mental health issue, the process is confusing
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 21:17:21	Anyone any good about disability student allowance??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 20:35:50	@stilgarg he's got tonsillitis and on antibiotics :( no worries about split tweets :) I want a Starbucks now you've mentioned coffee lol

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 18:05:41	Ive decided too that im going to stay off twitter when i am in a depressive episode, be proactive in dealing with it using skills etc.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 18:04:32	You can either be with me in my future or forgotten with my past.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 18:03:43	Its really sad that some people try to hold me back, but i wont let them, if people cant be happy for me then im leaving them behind!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 18:02:29	I am me, i go up i go down and sometimes im in the middle, but im also about getting on with my life, leaving the shit behind and living.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 17:36:15	I have enrolled on two courses within my trusts recovery college :-) Operation Taking Control has started!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 15:09:04	@turquoisejulia wanted to ask if you knew whether doing any of the courses at the recovery college would effect benefits?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-22 15:01:54	@turquoisejulia was there last night such a great and helpful service both MIU and OOH.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-20 03:02:36	Wish I could find similar people like myself in Southampton. They all seem to be hiding!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-20 01:05:44	@autiepower thanks me too :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-20 01:03:45	@stilgarg for a couple of week and this morning I woke up and it had lifted!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-20 01:02:16	@stilgarg I know it's taken me by surprise because yesterday I was feeling very low and still in the depressive episode that's been hanging
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-20 00:59:05	Well it's good that my depressive episode has gone but it went so quick it's taken me by surprise :-0

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 03:01:36	@Girl_Interrupt_ @turquoisejulia nope they are used to help you recoginise when your becoming unwell.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:59:49	@Girl_Interrupt_ @turquoisejulia wrap is really good and you can do a mini wrap plan too as well as the bigger one. Mine needs updating.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:58:21	@turquoisejulia @girl_interrupt_ that's great your colleuges are supportive. Southern healths website is down at the mo :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:53:11	@turquoisejulia @girl_interrupt_ that's fab :-) you got a wonderful break :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:50:33	@turquoisejulia @shft_recoveryco thanks will have a look at that :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:45:57	@turquoisejulia @girl_interrupt_ I'd love to do something like that, can I ask how you got such a position? The college isn't far from me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:42:15	@Girl_Interrupt_ @turquoisejulia I have no idea I will speak to my cpn about it tomorrow. Thanks for the idea.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:39:53	@turquoisejulia @girl_interrupt_ do you do it as part of CAST?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:38:02	@Girl_Interrupt_ @turquoisejulia wouldn't know where to start and think it would still effect my ESA due to the reason I was awarded ESA :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:36:30	@Girl_Interrupt_ @turquoisejulia thank you I see her at 1pm will update afterwards on what's happening. :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:35:48	@turquoisejulia @girl_interrupt_ I've given up wanting to work with the trust, I just don't have the stability to be able to hold down a job
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:31:25	@will7201 thanks, the rainbow was a sign that the darkness has passed and giving the rainbow to show the colour and beauty there is.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:30:26	@Girl_Interrupt_ @turquoisejulia I've only got traits of BPD rather than full blown as well as bipolar ii seeing cpn tomorrow.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:29:08	@turquoisejulia think its been a sign, the rain and dark clouds have passed and the rainbow is to show the colour and beauty in the world.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:26:17	@turquoisejulia I've only had moods that last weeks rather than up and down during the day like the criteria for BPD. :-/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:13:17	@Girl_Interrupt_ now I'm calmer I know what your saying is right. I have no routine and use many excuses for many things and I shouldn't.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:12:15	@will7201 thank you they did alot I'm so lucky to have my hubby.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:11:26	@Clare1305 thank you :-) hub said he sent them as a thank you for everything I do for him and to say he loves me and will always love me :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:09:49	@aButterfly123 thanks :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:09:42	@aweebithopeful thanks :-)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:05:24	I'm not sure what's happened but things are different with my mood, I couldn't possible tell you where my mood is right only that it's okay!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-19 02:02:31	@AnnieCarr1978 glad you're ok! Hugs x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 22:37:49	My beautiful flowers my hub has sent to me as a surprise. <3 pic.twitter.com/C9unzx2V2w
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 22:35:51	@Girl_Interrupt_ I'm just not stable enough to be able to do it. :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 22:35:25	@Girl_Interrupt_ cause me and potential co workers significant distress mentally and physically :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 22:34:44	@Girl_Interrupt_ I can't afford child care to be able to do that and it would effect my ESA as I get it on the basis that working would
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 22:25:49	@Clare1305 during the night, now my son sleeps all the way through the night I can take it again, fingers crossed the psych will agree.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 22:24:38	@Clare1305 yes at various times, took quetiapine during my pregnancy to keep me stabile which it did but came off it due to having to get up
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 22:19:54	@Clare1305 I'm currently on mono therapy of lamotrigine but I'm going to suggest to cpn tomoro that they add in fuloxetine and quetiapine.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 22:02:08	@Clare1305 @doesnt_matter84 mines always confused lol :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 22:01:49	@Clare1305 meds review with a new psych but don't know how long that is going to be I just need to deal with the hear and now for the moment
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 22:00:59	@Clare1305 @doesnt_matter84 justified and I'm trying to let it go, the depression has brought anger agitation and irritability waiting on
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:59:45	@Clare1305 @doesnt_matter84 probably, what doesn't help is I has the holiday from hell last week and got very angry at hubs family, it was
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:58:59	@MacMurphy42 cool that's good to know. ziprasidone isn't available here or I'd definitely be asking for it instead of the quetiapine.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:57:56	@Clare1305 @doesnt_matter84 why couldn't my brain just say it like you just did instead of long winding and confusing things :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:56:47	@Clare1305 @doesnt_matter84 yes I think it is that, mixed in with a depressive crash from a hypomania I had several weeks back :-/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:50:53	@SolentMind hi apart from mayfield nurseries what else is there in soton for supporting people now that Bedford house is no longer available
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:47:58	@Clare1305 @doesnt_matter84 run for the hills and makes me think I'm not acceptable when I'm myself or when I've tried to be someone else :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:47:28	@Clare1305 @doesnt_matter84 but I do think sometimes that others constantly tell me to be myself yet when I am and I have found myself they
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:46:19	@Clare1305 @doesnt_matter84 it's really disheartening and upsetting and makes me wonder if there is something wrong with me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:45:32	@Clare1305 @doesnt_matter84 sort of attitude that I have displayed in negative attitudes. But it seems no matter what I do nothing works.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:44:32	@Clare1305 @doesnt_matter84 I usually have a more positive attitude so the dont care one is more acceptance of others than stuck up stuff u.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:42:12	@Girl_Interrupt_ from gp and there is nothing else here available :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:41:54	@Girl_Interrupt_ have nowt here apart from a plant thing just up the road which is pants and boring tried it but didn't like it. No help
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:40:54	@Girl_Interrupt_ nearest mind is in a small town which takes an hour and a half and 2 buses to get too and considering I'm in a city they
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:36:58	@Clare1305 @doesnt_matter84 if I can get the bipolar stabilised then I know I won't have these thoughts because I have a dont care attitude
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:35:21	@Girl_Interrupt_ half it's beds, shut two units down shut 2 day centres and expects us to get on with it! It's crap and more need hosp now!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:34:08	@Girl_Interrupt_ for them to call you back if they ever do. Unlike some mh teams where there is alot of support this service here has cut
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:33:28	@Girl_Interrupt_ is no duty service to speak to during the day if cpn is unavailable, have to get the receptionist to call cpn and wait ages
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:32:46	@Girl_Interrupt_ just say use your skills and get on with it, the crisis team here is shit which is why I won't go with them. And now there
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:32:08	@Girl_Interrupt_ I couldn't care less about the mh team r/a me I discharged myself back in 2010 because they were useless. They actually do
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 21:00:07	Anyone had a lamotrigine, fluoxetine and quetiapine combo for bipolar? Did it help your symptoms at all?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 20:56:25	@Girl_Interrupt_ it's not that it's because they think once you have done the dbt that you don't need help anymore and fob you off
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 20:55:21	@aButterfly123 @nuttylotte @polarbear3127 friends lived closer, everyone's up north and I'm as south as it gets without going on the IOW!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 20:54:32	@aButterfly123 @nuttylotte @polarbear3127 her to stay away from me but she ignored them, our friendship is strong now. Wish my twitter
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 20:53:53	@aButterfly123 @nuttylotte @polarbear3127 the one friend I have did research BPD so she could support me better but people she spoke to told
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 20:53:07	@aButterfly123 @nuttylotte @polarbear3127 my hub is the only one to stick around, I've giving him ample chances to go but still he stays.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:31:57	@stilgarg thanks I'm trying to think what would be a good combo with lamotrigine, I've tried all mood stabilisers apart from valproate.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:30:51	@AshleySparklez the BPD traits plays up when I'm in a depressive episode like I am now, when Im stable or hypomanic they don't bother me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:30:07	@AshleySparklez could trade places with someone more in need I would. I think my bipolar meds need sorting and then I will be ok as for me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:29:33	@AshleySparklez suppose I should be grateful that I'm high up on the list for dbt again and that it should happen in a few months but if I
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:27:34	@AshleySparklez that's awful, sedate and your not an issue it clouds their perceptions even further doing that too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:26:49	@AshleySparklez if you need help its use your dbt skills and then left to get on with it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:26:18	@AshleySparklez I only have traits of BPD and have bipolar too. In the uk they think dbt is the be all to end all and once you've done it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:24:51	@AshleySparklez say be yourself then in the other they are trying to change who you are because it's not acceptable in their society!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:24:15	@AshleySparklez for the mh team to be happy I have to change who I am to fit in with their perception of a well patient, in one hand people
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:23:07	@AshleySparklez it was but its actually happening over and over. Seems like to actually make friends I have to change everything I am, even
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:21:57	@AshleySparklez thanks. It really doesn't help my issues and no professionals want to see it from my point they say its BPD thinking I wish
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:20:53	@stilgarg of stable mood then depression. The few weeks of hypomania is great but I know once I've come down its gonna hurt like hell :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:19:47	@stilgarg thank you I'm trying so hard I know I need something done with my meds I'm cycling every 6-8 weeks between hypomania then a week
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:18:40	@AshleySparklez said I didn't even have chance to fight my corner their minds were made up about me, and it's the same everywhere else :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:18:07	@AshleySparklez people don't though. When I went back to work after having my son new workers there had judged me based on what others had
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:14:28	@nuttylotte but since becoming mental I've been told I should be locked up and have the key thrown away. I have no family either.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:13:32	@nuttylotte mines due to outing my mother as a child abuser and all the kids from school albeit over 10 years ago spreading stuff about me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:12:33	@stilgarg it will lead to this so im stuck. Just want to be normal and not zombified on the sofa because of chlorpromazine :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:11:32	@stilgarg hey I'm feeling awful today depression is really kicking my butt and I'm snapping at everyone. I want my hypomania back but I know
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:05:40	Spread about stuff. I am unfriendable because people here don't want to be my friend. This is why I want to move away so much.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:04:48	Considering that alot of people know me but for the wrong reasons that bullshit people spread about me since school and also my mother has
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 19:03:53	Is it paranoia or truth to believe that every possible person I could be friends with in my city has been warned of me & thus steer clear??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 18:49:35	@WickedTheodora thank you cx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 18:13:20	@nuttylotte @barmybelle I need real life friends as well, at the end of the day phones iPads and comps can be switched off and I forgotten
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 18:12:22	@nuttylotte I am so I will be unknown.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 18:11:59	@nuttylotte when I die it will just be a service done by the crematorium no one will turn up because no one will know when I've died or who
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 18:10:24	People enjoy seeing me suffer well you know what that's fucking sick!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 18:10:02	Honesty if I was likeable then you wouldn't barely talk to me, people would invite me out, reply to me, but no one does.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 18:09:01	See I ask people why I'm not likeable and all I get back is people who barely talk to me say you are likeable blah blah blah well in all
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 18:07:46	And you can pretend I don't exist, but the fact of the situation is that I do exist I am here, you're just going to have to deal with that!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 18:00:18	@nuttylotte I can't even make new friends even when hypomanic. I am just unlikeable full stop :-(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:59:11	@nuttylotte them off your back and for some peace, cause once they've gone they won't care whether your doing what you said or not :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:58:21	@nuttylotte and if you say you have nothing planned they throw a load of "ideas" that you couldn't possibly think of doing but nod to get
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:56:19	Seriously I only have 1 friend I'm such a loser, no one wants to be my friend at all. Even fellow mentals don't want to know me. Im pathetic
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:55:06	On it due to using up all my national insurance contributions. I guess he's right about ESA, I'm just so sick of having just 1 friend
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:54:09	Hub says I shouldn't get a job yet that I'm not stable enough that I will be in and out of jobs and if I come off ESA that I won't get back
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:53:14	To force myself to get up and take some caffiebe pills and drink and energy drink, something anything to take this almost dead feeling away
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:52:22	Not life, this is hell. No closer to seeing a psych and sorting meds out don't even have a psych atm because of switching teams. I'm going
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:50:44	On the spot. I want to do so much but can't even move. My son is playing on the floor with his toys and I can't even play with him. This is
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:49:51	Something to contribute to society and not laying on the sofa with my eyes barely open because I'm zombified by chlorpromazine feel frozen
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:48:58	Being mentally unwell, sick of not leading a normal life I should just get off benefits and get a job even if its dead end least I'm doing
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:48:16	I get told to just do mindfulness or distract, like fuck off. I need some better support than that but there isn't any anymore. I'm sick of
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 17:47:18	Why do I bother when I try so hard to get well to be stable then my illness chucks my moods around. And because I've also got the BPD label
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 03:50:56	Feel fucked in the head by stupid thoughts on a downward spiral. Triggered and don't like being me right now :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 03:04:28	@AnnieCarr1978 @barmybelle section 135 similar to a section 136 only that with the warrant they can section you in your home.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 02:56:44	@AnnieCarr1978 @barmybelle that's likely to be a s135 hope your ok Hun hugs xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-18 01:55:27	@Polarbear3127 sorry to hear that, hope the stay helps you thinking of you!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 22:58:04	@BarrassBrough that's great your doing so well, I think it is the way now that they treat with lowest dose as not to over medicate save dosh
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 22:55:16	@nuttylotte I use cottage cheese in an baseless quiche (slimming world version) it's really nice
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 22:52:45	@Renacemento wonder if my craving for melted cheese actually played a part in the weight gain :/ it's sedating too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 22:51:37	@Renacemento seroquel is known for weight gain but it can be managed, I took it whilst pregnant and didn't put on much extra weight tho
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 20:39:10	@Renacemento maybe Effexor and seroquel combo would do the trick for you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 20:38:16	@skinny_the_minx adult to sort out the teeth so I persevered :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 20:37:58	@skinny_the_minx suppose really the answer is yes, as much as I hated it what kept me going was the dentist saying it would be harder as an
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 20:37:13	@skinny_the_minx well I don't look like goofy anymore lol I didn't have the traintracks had ones I could take out and tighten. Glad I did :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 19:27:12	@Renacemento tried all of those at various points in the past. All helpful just I'm sensitive to the side effects so had to come off them
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 19:25:56	@Renacemento carbamazepine/tegretol is good for impulsiveness and anger, Effexor for depression and seroquel is good for mood stabilisation
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 19:23:45	Im not watching the funeral not because of politics or because its her but because I've got better things to watch like Cbeebies with my son
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 19:21:09	@nuttylotte wish I was that lucky to find £200 in a drawer, can't save nowt my money gets spent as soon as I get it :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 19:19:32	@Renacemento it lifted my mood and kept it stable, I had to stop it due to the rare side effect from it which is lactating.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 19:00:02	@Renacemento Effexor is good but the withdrawals of coming off it are bad, definitely a slow taper off is needed.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 18:58:25	@skinny_the_minx that's really nice, I was forced back to school back to the Jaws taunts :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 18:54:15	@Renacemento zyprexa doesn't sedate me I was taking 20mg 4 times a day and didn't knock me out at all :/ just made me obese bmi of 30!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 18:52:58	@Renacemento because it made me gain 4 stone in a very short time and I'm still losing the weight from it from taking it 4 years ago!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 18:17:17	@Renacemento thanks me too xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 18:17:04	@Renacemento gosh no it's known as largactil or Thorazine. Wouldn't touch zyprexa even if my life depended on it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 18:08:15	Well cpn said she would phone me this morning to see how I'm doing and also speak to a psych, well I'm not holding out hope now :-/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 18:07:02	Darn chlorpromazine has left me feeling so out of it and sedated, that and a trapped nerve in my back I'm a barrel of fun today... Not!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 03:27:24	@autiepower thank you xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 03:27:14	@stilgarg thank you im fighting them its hard im gonna take meds least asleep i cant do anything x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 02:23:37	@Cmkisme thank you xx will take them after dinner least asleep I can't do anything :/ x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 02:21:50	@Cmkisme I'm fighting them couldn't do it until everyone was in bed as I'd be stopped. Might take night meds early to knock me out :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 02:20:38	Fighting hard to ignore them, very distressing. Was like this with the last depression. I know it will lift eventually only to return later
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 02:19:26	Can't get thoughts of the bridge out of my head. So many all saying do it :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-17 01:12:22	@brokenmind_ yey good for you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 23:31:12	@turquoisejulia thank you will have a read, and talk to my hub about having the extra support. x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 22:57:41	@turquoisejulia the same as the crisis team or different? Im confused with the whole new process and how things run now :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 22:57:01	@turquoisejulia i was told thats only for when cpn is off on leave or sick. Cpn mentioned getting AAT involved tomorrow if needed are they
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 22:26:02	Cpn phoned me, she's speaking to psych tomorrow about adding a med in dont know which one and is going to phone me in the morning.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 21:38:15	Now I remember why I discharged myself 3 years ago :( they are fucking shit and have got worse and I didn't think that was possible!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 21:37:34	Miles away from A&E to go there for help. Receptionist said she'd phone my cpn and get her to call me, bets in on whether she calls or not!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 21:36:10	I can't believe that the mental health team has nothing in place for emergencies anymore during office hours. I live on the edge of the city
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 21:25:03	What fucking mental health service doesn't have a duty system in place. I'm supposed to deal with shit on my own or wait till my app :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 20:13:28	@MyNocturnalSoul that's horrible how dare whoever said that say this am sick to death of people trying to degrade us like this :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 20:03:52	Don't you fucking dare tell me to hide my sh scars just to please every other fucker!! If people can't accept me for who I am then fuck off!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 03:53:36	@turquoisejulia yep had heard about Boston via twitter then went to bbc website to find out more and read the news there :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 03:49:59	@NatalieOxford hugs I won't watch it and now won't read anymore news but very sad indeed :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 03:48:53	@turquoisejulia I can't help it I need to know, prob a bad thing :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 03:46:39	@will7201 yes my thoughts too very sad :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 03:41:45	Just read something on the bbc news website involving children & and a pregnant mother, that & what's happened in Boston. Very upsetting :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 03:39:34	@bpdprincessx mmm yummy similar to what I have but with plain rice, I love saag paneer too it's my fav at the moment. Enjoy your food :-)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 03:05:35	@ItsJackOk yep and at least your not then arguing with the wii because you did a move properly and it didn't recognise it :/ good game too:)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 01:11:29	Went for a walk around to the shops with no jacket and just a strappy top!! First time for about 6 months!! #englishweather
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-16 01:03:17	Just so tweeps know I am ok!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 06:01:55	Off to bed, where ill try to stay :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 06:00:33	@JaneLyon123 my little toes are like Stubbs lol a plaster doesn't stay on :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 05:54:57	@JaneLyon123 it happens all the time on my little toes doesn't hurt coming off but the next day stings a little
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 05:52:05	Just pulled my little toe nail clean off :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 05:03:25	Would be free to end my life and put everyone out of the misery of having to put up with having me around. He wouldn't leave nor let me go!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 05:02:36	Tried very hard to make hub leave me today even said I was leaving myself not because I wanted him to fight for me but so with him gone I
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 04:54:00	@Polarbear3127 thank you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 04:52:32	@Polarbear3127 fingers crossed they knock me out all night so I'm not tempted.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 04:51:29	@Polarbear3127 thank you I will do that. I feel so unsafe :-(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 04:49:35	@Polarbear3127 I can't I feel so awful and that it's the best thing to do :-( I'm taking chlorpromazine in a min which will knock me out :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 04:43:29	I can't get the idea of going to the bridge tonight out of my head, hub is forcing a chlorpromazine down me. I'm a fucked up mess!! A* twat!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 03:42:46	Gotta love Budweiser!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 03:01:07	On the bud
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 00:18:21	Going for a walk with hub and son hopefully to calm me down, I'm so on edge anything can set me off :-(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 00:16:46	@Glass1ncision even half sedates me :( quarter wont do anything. Going for a walk with hub and son. So it may help.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 00:14:34	I should take some diazepam but I know it will make me sleep and I don't want to sleep. Need to calm down though.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 00:13:26	In the matter of 4hrs I've nearly destroyed my marriage, fucked everything up and tried to make an attempt. One royal fuck up
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 00:04:57	I'm an A class twat!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-15 00:04:14	@brokenmind_ hugs x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:48:19	@alittlevanilla but it reinforces that I'm unlikeable and life just repeats over and over. No one is going to like me for who I am :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:45:59	@alittlevanilla like me, just put up with me and are glad when I'm not around. That and the fact no one noticed I'd not been around online!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:44:55	@alittlevanilla what's triggered this off what the holiday from hell and realising that people who are supposed to be family actually don't

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:38:50	@bpdprincessx I'm not worried, I know it's going to happen just have to accept it

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:33:13	Said she wanted to do. No I have to live this life in continuous pain and hurt and mental anguish until my body physically gives in :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:32:21	Like a proper mental patient, can't succeed, can't be a proper mum or wife, why didn't my mother just throw me under the train like she
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:31:24	I can't fucking do anything properly, can't off myself, can't be happy, can't have friends, can't love, can't fit in at all, can't be nuts

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:21:34	Or maybe I should skip getting a job and just off myself. I know people will celebrate my death just like they have thatchers!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:20:35	Point that I relapse so badly that I finally off myself and reduce the population of this country. One less pathetic scum on the planet
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:19:39	What's the point no one reads my tweets anyway. I should do just as the gov want get off benefits get a shit job and then relapse to the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:17:58	Everyone's already proved I'm not worth the time or day. Stop with the false pretences that you actually care when I know you don't!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:16:43	Do me a fucking favour stop following me because we all know no one actually gives a fuck!! I'm used to get follower counts up that's all!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 19:15:17	Friendships/relationships its all a bunch of fucking shit. Seriously I know no one gives a flying fuck about me. Just use and abuse me go on

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 18:26:45	@autiepower the system here has changed & all the cmht have merged into one team too going to have to search the trust website to find it :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 18:20:22	I've just changed teams and my new cpn didn't even bother to give me any numbers to contact her or if I needed help, bloody great that!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 18:18:35	Good Morning well what left of it. Not even midday and I want a bud from the fridge :/ flat feels like a sauna today too

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 03:22:35	@Mindzview thank you for asking :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 03:22:25	@Mindzview so much relaxed and calmer now home tho I'm in a depression and very emotional
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 03:21:05	@bpdprincessx and I struggle to see things how everyone else has seen them. I also struggle to separate some vivid dreams from reality.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 03:19:03	@bpdprincessx yes often I see reality differently unlike psychosis it's more my perception of events is different to what actually happened
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 02:47:30	Omg that girls voice did not sound 11years old!! #bgt
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 02:26:18	This kid on #bgt is amazing!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 01:36:59	@Mindzview that's very true.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 00:59:59	@Renacemento finding it helpful tho still titrating up on dose currently at 100mg
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 00:59:21	@Renacemento have you tried lamotrigine it's weight neutral tho have lost weight on it. Takes a while to get to therapeutic level but I'm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 00:49:49	@Renacemento weightgain side effect wasnt worth it, I put on 4 stone with it :( quetiapine & carbamazepine are good too but had to stop them
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 00:48:05	@Renacemento I've taken many many meds over the years but have had co existing issues, lamotrigine really helps, olanzapine is good but the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 00:07:28	@Mindzview I'm sorry I had to write such a negative post, wish it was different :( my son did enjoy it tho thankfully
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 00:05:46	@Love_my_Westie yeah I noticed, you need to do what's best for you and vee. Bloody disgusting how they've treated you both x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-14 00:01:36	@Love_my_Westie saw the fb comments but couldnt reply at the time, your mother had no right saying what she did, wish i could have replied:(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 23:58:30	@Scarsarebeaut_ aww thanks :-) enjoy it when you have it x

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 23:27:09	@Scarsarebeaut_ im addicted to them, thats good that your allowed them :-) xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 22:53:47	Well after this mornings rant I'm feeling a bit better going to write a blog later on have neglected it a bit recently :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 22:49:20	@Scarsarebeaut_ me too the caramel frappacinno are delicious, silly costa version today was rubbish!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 22:47:08	@tinybabybutton you're welcome :) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 22:46:56	@tinybabybutton fingers crossed they'll do that for you. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 18:38:11	@tinybabybutton can you tell them this saying that sectioning will just hinder and put up barriers instead of helping? Will they listen?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 18:36:35	Just how kids are, is that really the case or am I "old fashioned" and expect manners maybe I'm expecting too much?! :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 18:35:22	Some truth behind it, I mean I was taught to wait patiently and not butt in conversations but my nieces butt in all the time, hub says its
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 18:33:34	During this mornings argument I said some rather horrible things about hubs mum and sister not sure if they were just said in anger or have
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 18:31:47	I'm addicted to iced caramel coffee had two on holiday and getting one in a bit, lush!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 18:30:48	@tinybabybutton I know, it's about being ready for it and if your not its going to be a tough time for you which can make you fight it all:(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 18:27:19	@tinybabybutton I've heard good things about Cotswold it's supposed to be a really good unit.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 18:25:49	@stilgarg this one really wasnt worth it, my son enjoyed himself which is the main thing but think next time shall just be hub me and son!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 17:48:53	@stilgarg it was hell, glad to be home, went to a haven park and it was rubbish argued with hub felt alienated by his family never again
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 16:29:20	He calmed me down and has changed the subject things aren't solved but I don't have the energy anymore to argue my point.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 16:26:32	@will7201 thanks will do
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 16:26:24	@housegarstang right! It's really annoying and invalidating.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 14:58:11	I don't feel like his wife anymore :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 14:57:29	Didn't even get a thank you for sorting out all the packing and making sure we had everything both going and coming back. Last holiday ever!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 14:56:11	He can't take responsibility for anything or make a decision it's always me who has to decide.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 14:52:00	He always says your getting stressed its your fault I got stressed at you because you got stressed first. It's always my fault.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 14:49:36	I'm not happy anymore this holiday has shown me where I stand and it's a cold lonely place.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 14:46:42	@turquoisejulia I should be used to it really this holiday has been the last straw I know now where I stand and it's a cold lonely place :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 14:45:13	It's ok for him to blame certain things on my mental health when it suits him but when I'm actually unwell it's an annoyance to him :-(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 14:44:16	Swear I just feel like telling him to take his son and go or rather I just pack up and go
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 14:42:25	He also expected me to go to bed last night and wake up this morning not depressed or upset/angry yeah if only it was that easy!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 14:41:05	Whilst I was away I got snide looks and remarks from hubs family when I told hub he said I was imagining it! Then didn't get why I was upset
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 04:04:50	I'm going to bed. One because diazepam has kicked in and two to stop me doing something stupid night and thank you xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 03:59:14	Why am I even alive, I've done my part now gave hub a son who barely wants to acknowledge me. Proven they are better off without me :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 03:57:34	@bpdprincessx thank you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 03:56:44	I'm such a fucking loner! Swear this world just wants me to off myself because it keeps throwing shit to drive me closer to the edge!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 03:56:04	I'm shy and I know Im unlikeable and that causes more shyness. I'm fucking alone here I have no friends. Seriously I only have my hub!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 03:54:25	Just want friends but people don't want to know Im excluded by everyone, people run away from me, alienate me, Im being friendly but I know
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 03:53:15	What am I doing wrong? I didn't ask for anything bad to happen but it does time and time again, it's got to be me no one is that unlucky!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 03:45:23	@will7201 thank you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 03:45:17	@Irish_lass1975 thank you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 03:33:56	@autiepower thank you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 03:28:25	Feeling very fragile :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-13 03:23:07	@ALivingLie_ thanks. I'm feeling really crap, not sure what's causing it or how to shift it, hoping for a decent nights sleep in my own bedx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-12 22:55:12	@mycuriousmind @scarsarebeaut_ thank you both, feeling a tad fragile at the moment feeling like no one wants to know me anymore :-( xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-12 22:53:27	@ALivingLie_ my son enjoyed himself which is the main thing. May just be the last holiday I go on with rest of hubs family which is sad :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-12 22:52:04	@ALivingLie_ aw thanks I'm ok the holiday for me was a disaster, felt alienated from the family, got a stomach bug had arguments with hub :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-12 21:37:02	Only one person noticed I hadn't been online on all social networks, bloody loved me!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-12 21:34:46	Oh and it pissed down most of the week! Not worth the money at all!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-12 21:34:02	Shit camp too nothing for kids to do and it was supposed to be a haven ha the swimming pool was boring and only arcades Caravan was nice tho
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-12 21:32:22	Holiday I go on with the whole family, snide remarks and made to feel an inadequate mother. Arguments with hub and got a stomach bug too!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-12 21:31:09	So stayed away from twitter a week, went on holiday which was a disaster, no one cares whether I fall of the planet or not, last bloody
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-12 21:05:10	@ALivingLie_ heya I've been on holiday got back today but thank you for noticing I hadn't been around hope your ok :-) xx

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 23:24:58	5 years ago today almost to the time I took a near fatal OD. I was saved by the amazing people in resus and ICU. I AM SO GLAD I SURVIVED!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 23:21:35	@Scarsarebeaut_ and she gave me a hug. I will miss her and hope to work alongside her one day :-) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 23:21:13	@Scarsarebeaut_ I didn't get attached to her as I know I wasn't to go to be with the perinatal team for long, she is amazing, didn't cry tho
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 23:07:23	Just said goodbye to my old cpn, she's amazing and I've really loved working with her, moved teams now and new cpn is nice but we shall see.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 16:16:23	@turquoisejulia lol me too it's cloudy here kinda hoped that by saying the sun shining it would persuade it to come out lol no luck lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 15:21:56	Gooooood Morning twitterland! Have a lovely day, good luck if its needed and hope the sun shines brightly for you :-D x

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 00:19:59	@brokenmind_ they will reduce your levels and give you some privacy. You may feel better now but maybe because of your recent admissions
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 00:18:58	@brokenmind_ could it be due to your self harm risk and that they are just being cautious, as much as its annoying hopefully once you move
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 00:15:19	@BarrassBrough sorry to hear that :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 00:14:57	@autiepower glad youve been able to get some work done despite the sedation from the meds Hate sedation especially when you have loads to do
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 00:13:55	@Mindzview everything!! Spring cleaning everything only did it 5 weeks ago but doing it again painting a mural on my sons bedroom wall later
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 00:03:01	@autiepower thanks :-D how are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-04 00:00:13	@autiepower thats a good idea, you can get small pots of epaderm over the counter. Im great thinks feel on top of the world :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 23:59:33	@Mindzview things are great im full of energy doing so much its amazing. Yeah the neighbours seem to be behaving themselves tho still noisy
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 23:58:45	@will7201 i feel for you i get tinnitus too, blooming annoying!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 23:54:01	@Mindzview thanks for your input I've very grateful for it :-) how are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 23:53:29	@autiepower do you have any epaderm I use it for excema as a bath substitute works really well then use dermovate afterwards.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 23:51:20	@Mindzview to finish. I get the ear worm song stuck in your head thing but this is different it's internal but sounds distant its weird lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 23:50:05	@Mindzview no worries thought my Internet was stopping the app from working properly on phone. It's like a whole song is playing from start
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 23:49:07	@autiepower thats ok no worries would rather know people can see my tweets and not reply than not see them at all, internets a tad dodgy lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 23:43:36	I'm starting to think that everyone on twitter cant see my tweets, not just this account but my other account too or everyone's ignoring me!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 23:27:21	(C) of song that repeats over and over, i mean like an internal Music player playing whole songs. Has anyone experienced similar?

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 03:00:42	I can't believe it's 8pm and still light out there ok night is coming and if it stays clear will be able to see the beautiful stars shining
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 02:54:02	I just my usual self that's what hub said he's the best judge of me, not high just me!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-03 02:52:50	Sat down but I can't keep still legs constantly moving, insatiable energy and needs, my heads buzzing, thoughts going ten to the dozen!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 23:27:21	#MentionADislike slow people, in cars on the path, talking. Your too slow for me move over let me pass & just spit it out what you've to say
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 23:22:56	Listening to old skool 1999 club music this takes me back!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 23:20:42	@SecretSchizo @will7201 @polarbear3127 ill always disclose, I stand in the face of stigma. I won't be beaten by it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 23:19:57	@nuttylotte definitely would love to see it, it's therapeutic in a way to do so x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 23:19:18	@nuttylotte thanks I've always used art or poetry to express myself arts great for saying what words can't!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:45:23	@Polarbear3127 @will7201 @secretschizo the job as it was bank work and I needed something more permanent at the time, wish I'd taken it now!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:44:41	@Polarbear3127 @will7201 @secretschizo yeah not many places will do that, I was hired by the nhs however after disclosing mh but turn down
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:43:53	@Polarbear3127 @will7201 @secretschizo was just boring retail shop work but for me after no work for 3 years it was an amazing opportunity.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:36:21	If a company doesn't like it's employees getting pregnant then hire men!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:35:50	@will7201 she's still working there atm but if she's forced to leave as they bullied me into leaving then I will encourage her to do so!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:33:08	If I still worked there I'd have been sacked by now or sectioned for smacking the prick and giving him what for, that place made me ill!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:31:42	It's a big inconvenience for that company and he's trying to tell her she has to work extra hours because he's taking a day off. He's a dick
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:30:44	My ex manager seriously needs putting down a peg or two, he thought he could treat me like shit but to do it to my mate who's now preggers
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:29:32	@will7201 @polarbear3127 @secretschizo what caused them to turn on me was me falling pregnant, that was the biggest inconvenience for them!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:28:34	@will7201 @polarbear3127 @secretschizo I told my last employers about my mental health, how Id been off work for 3 years they still hired me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:26:47	If it wasn't for gravity I'm sure I'd float away :-D they always said I was a free spirit.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:25:30	@zoe_bearx tell me about it I live in a tower block and my wardens dont do anything to clean the place just see them standing around smoking
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:22:00	I only spring cleaned 5 weeks ago but hey who cares I've done it again. It's times like this I wish I had a shower not a bath oh well haha
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:20:43	I could always sit in the middle of the lounge floor and close my eyes and pretend but that's not much fun. Maybe a gym membership is needed
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 22:19:35	Why is it the days i want to go kayaking a, hub is at work and b, it's too windy. No chance now to go before holiday it's not bloody fair!!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 19:32:25	140 characters is not enough. My brain can't comprehend the short space for all the words I have to say. End up having to make more tweets!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 19:30:42	Trying to force myself to sit for 5 minutes but I just want to keep moving, got so many ideas, I'm going to write a therapy book later!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 04:32:45	@Prettybones1990 thanks hunni just been doing some sorting out using all this built up energy xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 04:31:54	@Prettybones1990 heads just full of thoughts found a photo of me from 10 years ago and a letter to a psych from when I was 9 :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:58:17	@Prettybones1990 thanks will definitely take you up on that :-) my mind isn't able to take anything in at the moment it's a bit fast atm :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:56:36	@Prettybones1990 is drama queens or attention seekers which we are neither. And that adds to the stigma and poor treatment we get :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:56:02	@Prettybones1990 your spot on people just aren't willing to understand what we are going through which is really sad, all they see with BPD
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:54:57	@Prettybones1990 I've read through it but it doesn't really make sense to me either am sure it will when I do it in therapy x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:54:20	@Prettybones1990 sadly it does :( hugs xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:46:44	@Prettybones1990 I'm stubborn and i stick around. The interpersonal relationship skills of dbt will help with these feelings. Xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:46:03	@Prettybones1990 seem to meet them more than other folk and their hurt and betrayal stings more than usual. However you won't push me away:)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:45:14	@Prettybones1990 don't blame yourself for everything there are some nasty people out there unfortunately who are only out for themselves we
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:39:52	@ItsJackOk wow they are amazing too good to eat :-) you have a talent amazing :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:38:56	@CheekyMonkey75 @scarsarebeaut_ @love_my_westie @brokenmind_ @damagedgoods_ @barmybelle @bpd_zozo thank you :-) am here for you all too xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:35:41	But Im also doing something about it, mental illness wont hold me back anymore, my bp2 may stay but it wont dominate my life. Im in control!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:33:47	Wow looking at that photo of me 10 years ago & finding a letter to a psychiatrist when I was 9 showing anxious behaviour. Geez Im messed up!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:31:10	@will7201 it is there when depression hits, back like a nasty smell. Thanks you too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:29:03	@will7201 it could be other things depending on a persons perception of the drawing. But me for it was depression and hurt and pain.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:28:19	@will7201 the shadow is like the dark cloud that is always over you in depression, it is sinister, the negative thoughts feelings etc
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:25:43	@Prettybones1990 I'm sorry to hear people have let you down that's not fair on you. People should keep to their word if they offer support x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:22:47	@will7201 that was done 4 years ago art has always been a great way of expression for me & that was drawn to explain my mind no words could
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:18:28	@Prettybones1990 hey hope your ok hugs x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:16:13	My artwork - my impression of my mind pic.twitter.com/rdF10eTo5B

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 03:10:35	TW that moment you find a photo of yourself 10 years ago :/ pic.twitter.com/G18rySYp5n
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 02:45:15	Simply the best uhuh ;-D
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-02 01:31:16	deep cleaned the sink and draining board, every dish plate cup and cutlery going, cleaned the actifry, & cleaned the tiles too. More to do!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:54:52	@stilgarg @prettybones1990 have a PDF workbook too which is really helpful.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:54:25	@stilgarg @prettybones1990 I did it 5 years ago but just wasn't ready to take it on, still had all my files and notes so self taught and I
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:53:47	@stilgarg @prettybones1990 I've made a website on dbt and how I'm using it, want it to be a guide for others doing dbt or thinking of doing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:43:21	@brokenmind_ lol that's funny having two guys arguing over you ;) fingers crossed tomoro your taken off 1:1 and get moved closer to home fx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:41:17	@Prettybones1990 for treating many disorders. I used mindfulness in labour and it really helped loads.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:40:34	@Prettybones1990 that's understandable and great that your therapist isn't pushing it. I think dbt is one of the best therapies out there
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:33:40	@Prettybones1990 will happen when you're ready. I've learnt that myself you can't be forced into recovery if your not ready you just relapse
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:32:53	@Prettybones1990 you can and will recover the ed and BPD doesn't have to control your life forever. It's a hard journey to break free and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:30:01	@Prettybones1990 sadly there are probably some accounts that are like that. Having an ED is not fun, it's debilitating and life destroying:(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:15:16	@Irish_lass1975 thanks I wish it could be infectious just give some respite to everyone :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:12:00	@Irish_lass1975 just everythings been amazing this weekend, on top of the world. Had fun with my son and hub and never felt better.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:08:43	@Prettybones1990 I think your amazing for sharing the true ups and downs of having an ED ignore them we who really care will always follow:)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-04-01 20:05:51	@stilgarg taking my son to my sister in laws for the night a little later then having a night in with the hubby

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 04:10:58	@BiPolarQueen2 sorry for rambling never know really when to shut up and stop talking :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 04:09:48	@silentlyana hey glad your good, sounds a busy day for you. I'm good thanks :-) had a lazy day indoors running around after my son lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 04:05:57	@BiPolarQueen2 I fit the 5 criteria needed for a full BPD diagnosis. Black and white thinking, rejection issues, and anger are what I have.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 04:03:16	@BiPolarQueen2 I showed symptoms of many disorders hence the misdiagnoses I feel the Bipolar fits and the BPD did fit but now I don't feel
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 04:02:29	@BiPolarQueen2 last year when psych said full BPD and this last month he diagnosed Bipolar II as well. BPD is a tricky one to diagnose and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 04:01:21	@BiPolarQueen2 I was diagnosed with traits 5 years ago then was diagnosed a few years back full bpd then they said it was a misdiagnosis til
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:56:55	@BiPolarQueen2 and chronic feelings of emptiness. That's the 9 main criteria only 5 are needed for a BPD diagnosis.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:56:05	@BiPolarQueen2 rejection and abandonment fears, self harm, black and white thinking, mood swings, suicidal ideation, anger, loss of identity
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:53:52	@BiPolarQueen2 I hope the warmer and sunnier days come soon for you so you can get out and do something you enjoy :-) and your mood lifts x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:50:45	@BiPolarQueen2 that's great it's something other than just sitting there which we know makes us feel worse at the end of the day.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:47:23	@BiPolarQueen2 without really doing very much. Could that be something you could bring into your day?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:46:52	@BiPolarQueen2 my teeth, take meds, have breakfast open curtains to doing washing up, tidy lounge and Hoover Gives me a sense of achievement
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:45:52	@BiPolarQueen2 I've made what I call an opposite action list which has 7 things on it that I do every day, some are very simple like brush
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:45:07	@BiPolarQueen2 thoughts & feelings really does help me and changes my mood. Just doing and fighting all urges to just sit there really helps
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:43:35	@BiPolarQueen2 ok I understand, it may not be something that you would do but I find sometimes just getting up and acting opposite to my
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:31:40	@BiPolarQueen2 BPD and very recently diagnosed bipolar II.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:31:10	@BiPolarQueen2 go out and take a picnic or feed some ducks walk around a park. Its anxiety raising at first but gets easier the more you try
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:29:42	@BiPolarQueen2 that's understandable, definitely giving yourself time to grieve is a good idea. Could you choose a location to go to and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:28:11	My 4000 tweet is for everyone who is struggling It will get easier it wont always be like this Take each minute as it comes you can do this!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:24:13	@BiPolarQueen2 is it possible to get another dog or dog walk for neighbours to help you get out and give you something to do?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:17:55	@BiPolarQueen2 ah right do you have a lamp to help? Sending the sun to you for a few days we can share ;)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-31 03:15:33	@BiPolarQueen2 to talk about what's making you feel depressed its ok if not

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 23:40:54	@Glass1ncision yep it is indeed, amazon and ebay must love me lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 23:40:17	@AshleySparklez when the post man doesnt bring anything, like today and then got 2 days to wait because of the weekend its frustrating lol

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 20:49:58	@AshleySparklez I started finding myself by looking at what I truly like, hobbies, colours etc it takes sometime to do but is worth it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 20:45:51	@Polarbear3127 I don't know I think it was just talk on the radio program I talked about, @BPDFFS wrote a blog about similar too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 18:57:12	Its great discovering yourself. After trying to someone else for so long, being me is refreshing and i have a great new attitude.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 18:50:26	You may not like me but its not going to stop me! I will carry on!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 18:18:04	Being a parent with mental illness http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-lD
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 03:58:52	I'm exhausted since stopping doing housework should have kept going! Think I'm still suffering from yesterday's four hour walk.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 03:57:26	@stilgarg that's fab have fun with him :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 03:27:53	Good evening everyone how's you all and what's everyone up to?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 02:13:50	Said washing up and been to Tesco and come done a load of washing. Found some more self help books, and done some research too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 02:12:46	So I've washed up 80% of the dishes we had used everything, cleaned the sides, tidied the lounge, wiped down the glass table, packed away
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 02:04:41	@Polarbear3127 you haven't upset me :-) I'm still here
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 00:09:01	@Ermintrude2 most definitely! Think just one of them could last a year ;-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 00:07:37	@Ermintrude2 mmm probably need a spoon I can imagine it would be rather sickly too. Could have a comp who could eat it the fastest :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-30 00:06:32	Just done a load of housework place looks somewhat better now but still loads to do, can I have the energy I had 5 weeks ago please :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 21:18:48	@BPDFFS @acarerseyes I've put a link in a tweet I haven't listened to it after a minute into it as it got my back up. :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 21:16:12	@RayvenMental I haven't listened to it all the way through so don't know what argument is given, I got angered just hearing that we should:(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 21:13:44	This link is about should parents with mental health issues be vetted.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 21:11:56	Victoria Derbyshire, http://www. bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01 rg13q … from @bbc5live via BBC iPlayer Radio
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 21:09:32	@acarerseyes @bpdffs there's something on one of the bbc radio stations on Iplayer about how parents with mh issues should be vetted :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 21:01:37	We've just had tears here my son fell off the sofa and bumped his head he's fine just wanted loads of cuddles
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:33:37	@IamCarrieeeeee people controlling you that is I hate it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:31:14	@IamCarrieeeeee I can so relate to you on that one!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:28:07	@SmileyPeanuts @mynocturnalsoul omg you should chase them up that's awful care towards you
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:27:42	@IamCarrieeeeee same day she took her life :( I spent 10 days in that unit and never wanted to go back again.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:26:31	@IamCarrieeeeee I'm really sorry to hear that :( my local hospital was in the news a year or so ago discharged a patient with BPD and the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:24:07	@SmileyPeanuts @mynocturnalsoul can you ask for a second opinion?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:23:38	@IamCarrieeeeee that makes alot of sense with me. Am understanding better now what u mean about not needing hospital but still being unwell
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:21:51	@SmileyPeanuts @mynocturnalsoul whether its full on or shallow its still self harm and is still an issue :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:21:13	@MyNocturnalSoul @smileypeanuts like a bad mother- self punishment.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:20:56	@MyNocturnalSoul @smileypeanuts I hadn't self harmed for 1.5 years before I fell pregnant but when I had Pnd I wanted to harm due to feeling
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:19:30	@MyNocturnalSoul they do take you very seriously which is why I was admitted to the mother and baby unit.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:19:06	@MyNocturnalSoul the trust has changed a little but I haven't been with adult services for 2.5 years only the mother and baby service and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:18:20	@IamCarrieeeeee ok that's good to know. :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:17:13	@SmileyPeanuts @mynocturnalsoul my hub made me promise to my son not to self harm which actually for me is a good thing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:16:28	@IamCarrieeeeee sorry should have put Tw before that :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:16:06	@IamCarrieeeeee at school by my peers and several events afterwards. I never self harmed because I felt rejected it was for self punishment
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:15:07	@IamCarrieeeeee I'm with you on that one its not been something I've had issues with. Rejection yes but I believe that's due to being bulied
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:14:18	@MyNocturnalSoul admitted several times but they said no. Guess because I didn't act very often on my urges they didn't think I was serious
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:13:36	@MyNocturnalSoul I've never had to make such a contract. Maybe for you making that contract helped. My husband has asked for me to be
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:12:00	@IamCarrieeeeee fraud within this wonderful community :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:11:49	@IamCarrieeeeee haven't behaved the same way if you get what I mean. I know it effects everyone differently but I guess I'm feeling like a
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:10:45	@IamCarrieeeeee your right I could be, that and a few friends in offline who have had many admissions. Makes me question the diagnosis as i
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:09:26	@SimonOCnaimhsig various times in the last 7 years now they say BPD and bipolar 2.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:08:54	@SimonOCnaimhsig I understand what you mean about misdiagnoses I've been labeled depression, cyclothymia, bipolar, schizophrenia, BPD at
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:07:59	@MyNocturnalSoul me too I'm doing a full program soon apparently been self teaching and made a website to show progress and help others too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:07:12	@MyNocturnalSoul do you think it's your trust that's stopped you having admissions or just that you've never needed/wanted them?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:06:09	Asking for an assessment apointment with the new team psych talk about everything and see what they say
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:03:28	@SimonOCnaimhsig my trust refuse now to admit anyone with a BPD diagnosis unless there are coexisting diagnoses.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:02:20	I don't really have abandonment issues I only have rejection and anger issues now I don't think I meet the criteria for a full diagnosis now
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:01:04	Only had traits of BPD maybe 5 years ago I fit all the criteria but now I don't self harm my suicidal thinking is due to depression only
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 20:00:16	I'm prob waffling and stuff but I feel like I can't even BPD properly, maybe they are wrong and it's all bipolar not both. Always thought I
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 19:59:01	Bother us. And if they can't deal with you anymore they send you away out of county for years. Maybe I'm just high functioning or something
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 19:57:44	Trust is more supportive of those with BPD, for us here it's like oh you have BPD here's dbt and if your struggling use the skills and dont
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 19:57:04	To remember but they would never admit me even when I was very unsafe. I just had to get through it alone really. Seems everyone else's nhs
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 19:56:02	I know it's really good that I've only had 2 admissions but everyone else I know has had many, I've been with the htt more times than I care
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 19:53:57	Is it odd in that with being BPD I've only had two admissions no sections or 136 and one was to a mother and baby unit both for depression:/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 19:51:12	@brokenmind_ see your hands?

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 17:05:24	@Scarsarebeaut_ it could be said that you lack the mental capacity to make such a decision if the result is for suicide ultimately.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 17:03:33	The OA list gives a sense of achievement and focus when the day seems very bleak. Opposite action can lift and change your mood too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 17:01:17	My OA List includes making my bed, brushing my teeth, getting dressed, doing a load of washing, washing up, have breakfast and take meds.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 03:45:58	Lots to do but too little time.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 03:03:59	@IamCarrieeeeee @ladyem83 @furryous1 how did I know you were going to say that lol ;)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 03:02:06	@IamCarrieeeeee @ladyem83 @furryous1 that's cool I had the biggest crush on Paris and Kim :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 03:01:07	@Furryous1 @ladyem83 @iamcarrieeeeee did you see that? No and neither did you!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 03:00:09	@IamCarrieeeeee @ladyem83 @furryous1 that was a good movie too. Wasn't too keen on the latest Star Trek movie, my fav series is voyager
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 02:59:15	@brokenmind_ if I could I'd get up to you with a bag full of Easter eggs :-) xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 02:57:37	@LadyEm83 @iamcarrieeeeee @furryous1 the voyage home yes that's my fav Star Trek movie too :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 02:55:53	@brokenmind_ @damagedgoods_ @scarsarebeaut_ your welcome :-) xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 01:36:40	@Scarsarebeaut_ @damagedgoods_ @brokenmind_ I brought a purple top today and thought of Hannah :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 00:21:30	Another kick in the teeth for the disabled!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 00:21:18	But I've been told this is the case around the country with many local governments. A case of like it or lump it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 00:20:08	Plus how many will even be able to fork out the £50 in the first place ok they will get it refunded but its at least 3 weeks processing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 00:19:05	And why should those who now don't get the bus pass have to fork out £50 to the dvla just so they can refuse a license. It's too much hassle
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 00:17:25	Your not going to get a bus pass which means alot of disabled and mostly those with mental health problems are going to be isolated further!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-29 00:16:39	My delightful local council have stopped the local concessionary disabled bus pass so that means that unless you have high rate mobility
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 16:32:57	@brokenmind_ that's good thought my twitter app was playing up as some didn't get my dms. Hope your doing ok as much as you can in there x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 04:05:19	@Love_my_Westie i really dont get why people do that, its wasting their time not urs ignore any comments they are just a troll x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 04:00:51	I have changed my settings now so twitter should show me notifications from anyone.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 03:24:47	@Renacemento ah right I understand now, can you ask to be referred back to them, who ever said that was wrong you clearly need more support
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 03:16:07	@Renacemento to live their lives without bpd ruling their life, it may still be there but wont be in control. I believe in you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 03:15:08	@Renacemento maybe your just not ready at the moment, with the support and patience of a good therapist i believe many with bpd will be able
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 02:22:19	@brokenmind_ ps did you get my DM?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 02:21:56	@brokenmind_ aw Hun maybe it is just the case there are no beds for the moment I doubt they have forgotten you I know it prob seems that way
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 02:15:32	@brokenmind_ hope someone gets discharged or moved on so you can move back closer to home. Been thinking of you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 01:12:51	@stilgarg thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 01:12:32	@Gvulit when you are ready you may feel the same way BPD doesn't have to rule your life & also it may never go away fully u can live with it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 01:11:04	@Gvulit for me yes because I am ready now, 5 years ago I wasn't when I first did dbt, no one can force you to be ready either.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 01:05:22	I cant wait for the day when the psych will say you no longer fit the criteria for BPD, it will come i just need to work hard!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-28 00:49:38	Found a book i brought years ago called "Change Your Thinking" its CBT based but really good so far and has some really interesting points.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 19:23:50	I want to go out but I can't at the moment so typical!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 19:20:51	Good morning twitter how is everyone this morning? I'm feeling very much stable again after that episode which is such a relief.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 06:16:39	Off to bed now night everyone sleep well to those on similar time zones and have a good day/evening to those who aren't :-) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 06:06:49	Ah its David miliband not the other one, im useless with politicians
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 06:05:34	Ooh apparently miliband is to step down as labour mp....
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 06:03:02	@BPDFFS ah right ok, well its there for when she gets power to her phone :-) could you tell her I'm thinking of her please :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 06:00:37	@IamCarrieeeeee it'll be one of those random things you'll think about and burst out laughing for no apparent reason to others :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 05:59:41	@BPDFFS gosh sedate to quiet, easier night then :( hope shes doing as well as possible, have sent her a dm with my mobile number included.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 05:57:28	@IamCarrieeeeee the fact his name is Brian has also tickled me because at quick glance i read brain wankum snorts again
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 05:55:35	@IamCarrieeeeee its the best rude name ive seen for a long time :D lmao
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 05:51:24	@IamCarrieeeeee pmsl hehe #mature #honestly has one more look and snorts with laughter
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 05:49:27	My upstairs neighbours are having karaoke...... Actually sounds like cats meowing :0
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:44:41	@ALivingLie_ thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:44:03	@Irish_lass1975 thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:43:48	@Polarbear3127 you feel they need to be. May help to calm some of your anxieties, can you ask your wife to help you too?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:43:06	@Polarbear3127 ones your not certain about, may help you to see clearer and maybe the thoughts your certain about can then be challenged if
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:42:17	@Polarbear3127 can you rationalise your thoughts take the ones you feel most certain about and put them to one side and just focus on the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:41:15	@ALivingLie_ thank you, im really chuffed, hes the only psych ive had thats seen past the mental illness and understood me as a person :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:38:10	An asset to the team. Which left me buzzing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:37:26	As part of the mental health team. Told him i want to work with people diagnosed with BPD and use my experiences to help them. He said id be
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:36:29	My psych gave me a compliment today he said it was lovely to work with me and he hopes in the future i achieve my goal & work alongside him
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:33:07	@BPDFFS @brokenmind_ thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:32:14	@Polarbear3127 you ok? How have things been for you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:31:26	@stilgarg yes definitely i am very glad i didnt go through with the plan i had because i felt this was never going to end. I used skills too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:30:19	@BPDFFS @brokenmind_ and i think your both really nice which is why i followed you both, friendly easy to talk to :-) xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:28:56	@BPDFFS @brokenmind_ i think you both offer so much support even when you're battling your own demons, inspirational to say the least.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:27:12	Had some news today which could never have imagined considering the bad news we had last week. Cant stop smiling about it :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:25:08	@stilgarg im doing alot better than i have been coming through the episode now and had some wonderful news today which has feeling helped.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:24:27	@BPDFFS and im here alongside you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:09:42	Coming through the other side of this episode is tiring. Glad to be back on the recovery train though. Might be an early night for me!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:04:18	@BPDFFS i understand that fully i often feel unpopular and unworthy even though its no fault of my own.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 04:01:28	@brokenmind_ hope your doing ok and the ward your on atm is helping you. Thinking of you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 03:01:48	Gooooood Evening twitter how are you all?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 01:37:16	Hub brought mini marshmallows gonna have a hot chocy in a bit mmmm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 00:20:38	Having pineapple chicken for dinner tonight and the best thing is its going to be so healthy and low calorie as cooked in the Actifry :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 00:18:45	Will get off my soap box now
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 00:18:32	Being forced to declare I have mental health problems will only cause other parents to judge and exclude. A very very bad idea I think!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 00:17:47	If I want another parent to know I have mental illness I will tell them myself in my own time once I know they won't judge me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 00:16:40	Patient confidentiality and prying on people's personal lives, and increasing the stigma that people with mental illness are dangerous grrr
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 00:15:19	You can listen to it on the app now so not sure if you can too via the website. Surely being forced to disclose a mental illness is breaking
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 00:13:39	Vetted. So other parents know if their kids are going to be safe if round a friends who parents have mental health issues :/ it's angered me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-27 00:12:32	So flicking through the bbc radio app I find a program on 5live being aired April 1st saying parents with mental health problems should be>>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 23:10:43	Back on the recovery path http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-iU
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 20:19:55	Bets are on to what time if at all my psych phones me today he's due to call at 12:30 so we shall see I'm guessing 1:20pm!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 20:18:39	@AnorexiaDoll now that's an image I'd rather not have lol wonder if the guy is sat there thinking now this isn't going to fit me at all :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 19:00:11	@Irish_lass1975 hello and thank you xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 18:46:38	What goes up must come down. Newtons law!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 18:45:32	Guess thats what you get for making friends when in a confident energetic and outgoing mood state!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 18:44:22	Oh hello its me the person everyone was talking to a few weeks back and now doesn't acknowledge i exist, both online and offline :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 04:23:31	@stilgarg I'm increasing the lamotrigine slowly but may be increasing again as the pill effects it by reducing it by half Not sure what else
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 04:15:59	@barmybelle ok thank you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 04:15:36	Owwwwweee my son just screamed very loudly in my ear still ringing now :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 04:14:37	@IamCarrieeeeee ah ok I shall have to wait and see if someone retweets this person.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 04:13:54	@stilgarg Im going to be getting that one too as I have a working diagnosis of bipolar as I have been told today But like you I've read alot
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 04:12:18	@WickedTheodora grr that's really annoying thanks for telling me x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 04:10:42	If you have blocked someone on here does their tweets show on my TL if someone else RTs their tweet?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 04:08:24	Received the book BPD for dummies today wonder how much new I will learn :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 03:50:46	@IamCarrieeeeee lol ;)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 03:35:42	@IamCarrieeeeee what that I like handling raw meat or that I'd come and sort it for you ;)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-26 03:12:13	@IamCarrieeeeee i love handling raw meat if i were close to you id do it for you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 21:08:15	@MyNocturnalSoul its a battle of thoughts atm just want to unzip my body and step away from it all for a while
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 19:44:03	That's including the lamotrigine as it needs increasing due to being on the pill as well. I'm meeting new cpn a week Thursday.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 19:43:03	I'm to stay on chlorpromazine for short term only due to the sunburn effect and they will look into more longer term meds and go from there.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 19:42:03	Psych called hub and cpn called me. Psych is calling me tomorrow and cpn is speaking to psych before he calls me about my mood state.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 18:15:50	Got a strange craving for chilli con carne weird
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 05:35:21	@Nutty_Nat_Nat it's so hard and confusing :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 04:54:42	When will this end? I want to feel well I don't want these moods 8 days I've been in hell, for me they don't usually last that long 5/6 days
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 04:34:59	How can those two thoughts exist together?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 04:34:43	I love my son and husband I'm fighting these urges it's confusing I want to end things but I also want to live for my son I don't get it :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 04:19:25	Since almost setting fire to the cooker and producing a lot of smoke my sinuses are stinging and hurting :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 03:24:40	Ok now crapping myself I don't know what's gonna happen. She most likely won't even get the email, will still phone tomorrow just incase :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 03:21:06	@ALivingLie_ I don't have an appointment she said she will call me and make an appointment when she's off leave tomorrow, but will do that.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 03:16:14	@ALivingLie_ true I've sent an email now but the last one I sent her she never received so I don't know if she will get this one. :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 02:46:43	@SherieneHannah I'm going to ty x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 02:46:35	@ALivingLie_ that's true and it is her work email I'm sending it to going to go for it and face up if it goes tits up :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 02:41:58	To email cpn or not she said I could but I don't know if over stepping :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 02:41:02	Oh ok that's fine I won't bother next time
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-25 02:10:12	@WickedTheodora could you ask for the daily script to be processed at a pharmacy near where you want to go?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-24 22:25:27	Can't nap need to look after hubby as he's rather poorly at the moment :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-24 22:01:57	I'm going for a nap if I can slept about 4 hrs last night!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-24 22:01:30	Everyone gets what they want except me. And it's true I bet out there someone is wanting me to suffer time and time again. Yeah my mother!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-24 21:59:50	I'm asking for someone who actually wants to give a shit! My back is already up with new cpn bet it's cause I have the BPD diagnosis FFS

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-24 15:02:37	Well that's clear I didn't take a chlorpromazine last night cause getting up early this morning and actually could and should have now :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-24 15:01:10	Even if by some miracle we do get out on the water in a bit I'm fucking agitated might just drown myself. Fucking fucked up freak that I am!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 19:35:13	@Polarbear3127 try for the moment to listen to some loud music through headphones whilst controlling your breathing deep breaths
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 19:29:33	@Polarbear3127 sounds impossible to you right now but it is true. What helps you when you feel overwhelmed like you are now?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 19:28:57	@Polarbear3127 I am very much real, I have my own family and they too are real, the Truman show was only a film and not real. I know that
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 19:28:01	@Polarbear3127 can you ring out of hours ASAP I'm very worried for you and feel the best way you can protect your family is to get some help
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 19:11:26	Might have giving the bloke a headache banged the receiver a few times before hanging up!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 19:10:32	Grr I don't know where they get my number from but India can fuck off thinking I have a computer, I have a laptop which I rarely switch on!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 19:07:20	Asking psych to add chlorpromazine full time to my meds as its really helped, still got a way to go to get back to stable but this is good!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 17:19:01	@brokenmind_ did you get home safely?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 16:30:37	Half a chlorpromazine and i feel like a drunk zombie! And hungover to without an oz of drink :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 02:07:16	@AngeC76 least I don't have to put up with him much longer as moving teams very soon.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 02:05:33	@AngeC76 yep cpn said before that he's forgetful well he can't be excused for that this time! Im making a complaint first to cpn then higher
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 02:03:24	Hid the 4 page letter I wrote last night might destroy it, but might keep it just incase. I don't know :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 02:01:50	@MerryMadness land me in hosp for a short while Need to get through the weekend for Monday and speak to my cpn she's been on leave this week
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 02:00:49	@MerryMadness glad it's been good for you. It's a relief when you have a good week/s. thanks I'll get through somehow just hope it doesn't
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 01:58:50	@MerryMadness my mental health has been somewhat bad this past week I'm very agitated. I hope it will go soon. How are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 01:57:52	@ALivingLie_ it is treatable with therapy it may not go completely but with the right skills you can live with it how dare she say that!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 01:55:55	@MerryMadness good evening to you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 01:55:10	@brokenmind_ well living in the arse crack of Britain we tend to get a lot of rain, it barely snows here and when it does its silly amounts.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 01:53:55	So how's everyone on twitter this evening?? Excuse my rants I'm rather annoyed with my psych right now :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 01:52:48	Good bloody job I have out of hours. I hung on yesterday knowing he was going to call and he hasn't now I need to survive the weekend :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 01:50:57	@brokenmind_ no snow just rain rain rain :( when's it spring? Don't think we are having it this year!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 01:49:43	You would write in your diary to call. The fact I rung duty yesterday in tears and feeling very suicidal means absolutely fuck all. Thanks!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-23 01:48:54	Well fuck you psych I'm not believing any of this bullshit that your forgetful we phoned and you just bloody didn't call back despite saying

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 21:00:01	See now moods lifted full of energy thoughts still whizzing around I'm on a bloody roller coaster can't get off and don't know what's next!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 17:35:56	Im pathetic
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 16:11:46	So many negative thoughts whizzing around my head non stop I'm on edge
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 16:06:45	Im never going to get better its only temporary then back to square one. Depressed or agitated/irritable/angry any happiness is short lived!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 15:48:04	Could not bloody sleep and when I did I had vivid nightmares of a man hurting my son. Can still see his face now :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 07:08:56	Instead of filling tweeps timelines with my crap im gonna try sleeping. Im safe. Night
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 07:07:58	Im just not worth it, thats been proven.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 07:07:31	Holding on for tomorrow will speak to psych, ooh wont do much not phoning them. Hope psych helps me, hope he phones me. Doubt he will.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 07:05:47	I wrote a letter i truely hope will never be read but fear it will :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 07:04:54	Guess you cant force happiness even faking it doesnt mean its true. Im broken desperate hate i made the promise tonight to not do anything:(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 07:02:30	@CheekyMonkey75 im struggling my past tweets say it all :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 06:16:43	Im torn, should ring ooh really but scared too. Cant do anything so not worthy of their support. Really fucked up everything for me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 01:47:00	@stilgarg yeah the couple i read were funny.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 01:39:18	@stilgarg thats good to hear, :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 01:38:31	@stilgarg just did a google search and read some lol

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 01:31:04	@stilgarg license.it wet and rainy here. Hows your day been?

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 01:29:26	@stilgarg had a bad night and day but spoke to duty and really helped im doing better now had stress related paranoia which has gone from
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 01:21:24	Can def say with thanks to M i am feeling a lot better, she skills coached and validated me and listened
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 01:10:24	Feeling somewhat better, the news yesterday triggered off something. Thankful i didnt act on urges.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 00:14:24	Ok i need some help here. I want to make a self soothe box what do i need to put into it??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 00:01:02	I need to make a self soothe box, ive not an idea how to or whAt to put in it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-22 00:00:11	My "paranoid ideation" is stress related she said and should ease once the stress is gone.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 23:56:09	Had a tough day, been on phone to duty who spent an hour or so listening supporting and advising, im to ring out of hours if needed.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 15:47:21	Dream last night of eating my meds, chewing them and disliking the taste but carrying on anyway. Why in my dreams do I have the courage??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 15:43:57	@unspokenlie thanks :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 15:43:32	It's better all round that way. Least my son won't grow up with a nutcase for a mother!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 15:42:48	He will grow up hating me, he will I know he will, I don't want him ever to be my carer!! Just wish hub would take him and just go.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 15:40:34	Don't think I can cope with this anymore. It's not fair on my son to have a mum who's happy and energetic one week and depressed the next.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 15:35:48	How bloody depressing!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 15:35:14	Underlying mood disorder won't ever be that can only be controlled with medication. So later on in life ill prob need new liver and kidneys
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 15:34:25	And lows, sick of BPD sick of this mixed mood shite sick of just surviving. Who was I kidding ill never be well even if the BPD is cured the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 15:33:16	Might ring my psychiatrist later and ask if he has a pill that can completely wipe me out. Sick of feeling then not feeling sick of highs
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 15:32:15	I fucking don't know why I bloody bother. What's the point I always end up back to this. It won't last they say no but it comes back again!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 15:18:28	Oh look it's another morning another day for people to tell me how fucking useless and worthless I am! To disregard everything I say. Humph
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 03:55:47	@mycuriousmind but i do know about them ive known for a while but this is the cherry on the cake of it all. It needs to stop! Why me?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 03:53:53	If you're watching me right now i want to know why, how long have you been watching and when's it gonna stop?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 03:52:18	@mycuriousmind i dont know who is watching me or why they are letting me know they are watching me but i wish they would tell me :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 03:50:17	All about music effecting mood and stuff, its not coincedental its happened many times before. I am being watched i just dont know who.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 03:49:25	And people can stop watching me, i write a piece for the website about how music effects our moods and on my sons TV program's is an epi
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-21 03:48:20	Ya know what fucking go do one, fed up of this shit now
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 23:34:40	TW Wasn't just my mother that was arrested one of her boyfriends was too. Never made it to court CPS deemed not enough evidence :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 23:32:50	Fuck that's just put a spanner in the works on my good mood. I feel guilty for reporting her but also relieved that i stood up against her.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 23:29:13	Omg just remembered on the 12th march it was 5 years since my mother was arrested for child abuse :-O
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 23:25:45	Argh just noticed eyebrows need doing bit haven't a clue where my tweezers are :/

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:21:04	@Polarbear3127 how are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:20:57	@Polarbear3127 hey im abit all over the place mood wise meds have been sorted up to 75mg lamotrigine and psych is calling hub on Friday.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:19:54	@DamagedGoods_ i can imagine, hopefully you will get a call soon x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:18:54	@Love_my_Westie wow hun, i dont think being on just liquids is that healthy for you really are you getting enough vitamins and nutrients?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:17:55	@DamagedGoods_ doesnt curb the anxieties really.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:17:45	@DamagedGoods_ it plays on the rejection fear too that they dont care, which rationally they are prob just busy sometimes they forget but
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:16:38	@WickedTheodora be safe, talk on here, even if its venting just scream, i will try to reply if i think i have something constructive to sayx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:15:35	@WickedTheodora your mum means well but you need the pros help, i could say dont harm but if your going to nothing will stop you but please
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:12:27	@DamagedGoods_ hate waiting for call backs makes me worse.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:10:37	@WickedTheodora duty on your behalf then pass the phone to you once contact has been made?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:10:03	@WickedTheodora clap really hard it sounds silly but can really help. Controlled deep breathing count to ten. Can you get someone to phone
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:09:16	@WickedTheodora breathe through it can you hold something with texture to help bring you to the hear and now, if not squeeze your hands or
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 22:06:43	@WickedTheodora im the same my ends nov time so i will need to reapply under pip, very scary that thought, my esa runs out then too :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:59:52	@WickedTheodora hopefully its good news for you brown envelopes are the worse things.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:55:28	Anyone else feel today is dragging??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:54:38	Hopefully when current cpn gets back from leave a meeting will have been made and I can transfer from specialised services to adults FX
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:53:17	I wish my new cpn would get in touch with my current cpn so they can do a transfer & CPA meeting with me then get me on the dbt course ASAP!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:52:00	@WickedTheodora might just be a notice of amounts increasing I've had two recently with just that x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:45:44	I have no idea whats going on with this budget I don't really want to know right now what ever happens its taking from the poor for the rich
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:44:29	Going to take that away from me. Btw this is general venting not aimed at anyone. I'm also fed up of being judged because I can't work grr
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:43:24	I'm not sorry and I won't apologise for being myself, it's taken bloody ages for me to find my own identity and ill be damned if anyone is
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:42:24	I'm not sorry Im doing well in my recovery I know it doesn't seem it this past month but I'm sure I have a mood disorder coexisting with BPD
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:39:06	@SherieneHannah ask reception for the cmht managers name and postal address. Then write a letter of complaint. PALS should be able to help
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:06:51	@SherieneHannah omg that's really wrong can you complain to the cmht manager about your treatment?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:01:44	@WickedTheodora walk in may be a good idea they can't exactly turn you away then someone will have to see you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 21:00:56	@SherieneHannah oh charming really gives you hope. You're worth help and can get better their attitude stinks xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:57:13	@WickedTheodora *hugs* you can do it x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:56:39	@brokenmind_ that's rather random lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:56:24	@SherieneHannah me because she said well stop wasting my time, I made a complaint and she actually got the sack as I wasn't the only one :0
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:55:38	@SherieneHannah I get like it too :/ I've found telling them their tone isn't helping me helps but once I had someone put the phone down on
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:54:20	@WickedTheodora I understand Hun but they aren't going to know your in need unless you call them :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:53:33	@SherieneHannah tell them you don't appreciate being spoken to like that x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:53:07	@SherieneHannah I understand its disgusting they think they can treat us like crap because we have mh problems, try to be assertive to them
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:51:39	@SherieneHannah ok well I'd ring them on Friday morning if they haven't called u, sometimes you need to keep on I've found.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:49:20	@SherieneHannah can you ring them and chase them up?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:49:05	@WickedTheodora ps your not pathetic at all. Your struggling and in need of support right now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:48:43	@WickedTheodora phone the cmht back up & demand to see someone like u said its not ur fault she's off they should have someone in her place
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 20:06:47	@barmybelle I'm not sure the amount prob around £25 but will definitely get charged oops
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 19:31:16	Just doled myself up to make myself feel better, not going out till this evening but its helped a little feel more confident about myself.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 19:29:53	Feel guilty about it all really now, can only say I can account to £500 I don't know where the rest went :0
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 19:28:59	Oooops overspent on credit card now am over limit not sure how much by yet credit card company will soon let me know! £1000+ in a week oops!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 17:26:18	Fucks sake fucked off today angry agitated and fucking irritable like I was at the weekend.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 16:20:54	My mood http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-e2
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 07:17:12	Dont judge my insanity when you wouldn't last an hour in my shoes. Go be normal, be boring!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 07:08:37	Listen to infected mushroom the gathering album, rave music!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 06:29:27	@Polarbear3127 hope it helps you and the side effects go soon :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 06:21:47	Anyone know if an off duty police officer can still detain you under s136?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 05:18:14	@unspokenlie dont be hard on yourself it took me 6 months before i started to get it and now 5 years on i still struggle sometimes.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 05:14:51	@Girl_Interrupt_ ah right aww hope the pain eases soon for you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 04:20:10	@Prettybones1990 yep gives you the extra things needed :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 04:14:26	@Prettybones1990 yeah thats not good at all. High calorie intake isnt going to help with weight loss at all.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 04:12:48	@Prettybones1990 ive been drinking alot of diet energy drink so im prob contradicting myself, but it helps me alot during the day x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 04:08:47	@Prettybones1990 for me to help me lose the weight safely. Diet drinks are full of additives and sweeteners
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 04:08:05	@Prettybones1990 i agree, I've been following a low calorie diet but i was really overweight, and the diet i was on is designed personally

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 02:04:09	@stilgarg used the inhalators first for a couple months then gum and then nothing took me 3 months to roughly quit, best thing i did.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 01:56:19	@stilgarg smoking is hard to give up but it can be done, ive been smoke free 3 years now

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 00:38:27	@Love_my_Westie aww it will be worth it soon :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 00:33:29	@Love_my_Westie im goood ty hows you??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 00:07:00	@barmybelle did me and i was only in for 10 days.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 00:06:30	@barmybelle if the ward your on makes you feel very safe you can get institutionalised very quickly making home life harder to adjust too:(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 00:03:14	Im still in bloody shock about my weight loss, i cant believe it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 00:02:15	@brokenmind_ positive about things you really want it, but when the service lets you down who can blame you for wanting to say screw you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 00:01:32	@brokenmind_ health service by you are really failing you right now, i just hope you get the funding i really do, when your feeling more
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-20 00:00:50	@brokenmind_ no it doesn't but whilst you don't have the support and skills to cope of course your going to lean on the drink. The mental
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 23:59:11	@brokenmind_ i do believe in reincarnation and have had that thought many times :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 23:58:07	@brokenmind_ i understand why hun im not taking that away from you, i get its a safety blanket for you :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 23:56:07	@brokenmind_ achieve your dreams, start by accepting that i believe in you and others too, and you will eventually start believing it urself
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 23:55:23	@brokenmind_ your enemy really, sorry if out of line just an observation ive made. You're worth so much more and can do so much more you can
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 23:54:29	@brokenmind_ the drink as it really doesn't help you at all and alot of the admissions youve had lately you had a drink before hand, it is
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 23:53:30	@brokenmind_ nope nope nope you're not at all, your trying to cope with the bpd the best way you can, my suggestion to you is stay away from
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 23:52:32	Yesterday flew by today has dragged a little, been rather boring really!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 23:51:20	@brokenmind_ you may not believe in yourself but there are many here who do believe in you, me included!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 23:49:48	@brokenmind_ no you are not weak, you can get well and beat this, hopefully you will get funding to the retreat and start on your recovery.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 23:10:02	OMFG i knew my old scales werent working properly but ive actually lost 25lbs since xmas day! Thought i was stuck at 12st when really 11st 2
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 23:07:55	@IthinkIamCarrie been doing it since i was 16 ;)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 22:27:57	Feel like i could talk for England to anyone who wanted to listen, i reckon i could keep a convo going for a long time right now!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 22:25:41	I really shouldnt worry at all, i mean if she didnt like what i said or was offended they she would have said something.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 22:24:51	Im sure its just confidence issues, i mean 3 years ago i couldnt even pick up the phone and make such a call, they know its all new to me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 22:23:55	You know that feeling that you get when you feel you may have said the wrong thing even tho person your talking too knows your a tad odd :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 22:01:20	@Polarbear3127 hope your psych gets back to you soon, and can help you with the meds situation, fingers crossed for you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 21:59:37	My niece wrote to me, and i cried at her letter.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 21:57:01	@Polarbear3127 I'm ok got bit irate with an eBay seller earlier but just had a letter from my niece which has made my day, how are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 20:09:56	Was hoping to wear the jacket tomorrow evening, but i guess now i wont be need to rethink outfit now, bloody nuisance!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 20:08:23	She better not be playing games with me, shes chosen the wrong person to fuck with, i will make sure she never uses ebay again!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 20:07:24	She hasnt sold anything for 5 years according to her feedback and then it was all negative i didnt find out till afterwards.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 20:06:02	Rule of eBay, dont mark an item as dispatched unless you have physically posted it, i swear this stupid woman will get a mouthful soon!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 18:37:53	@stilgarg thank you and you too. :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 18:33:06	@stilgarg true, yep feeling stable this morning :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 18:18:03	@stilgarg dont blame you weather like that is awful, glad your stable :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 18:08:15	@stilgarg how are you today?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 18:08:06	@stilgarg hello, im feeling alot better today, no snow here thank goodness, but looks like it could rain soon, not good as need to get to GP
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 17:22:36	@Nutty_Nat_Nat extra £20 so phoned them and paid the extra £20. I got that item for £20 :-) brilliant!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 17:21:49	@Nutty_Nat_Nat on amazon, they must have refunded my payment because they didnt have what i wanted in stock, got offered better item for
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 17:20:52	@Nutty_Nat_Nat just recalculated i know whats happened, primark has gone through but the increase in my balance is due to a sellers mess up
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 17:11:39	@Nutty_Nat_Nat maybe like you say primark will show up tomorrow, but surely it would have at least come off my remaining balance?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 17:10:21	@Nutty_Nat_Nat the statement. I spent in primark on sat got auth number on reciept so it went through but thats not shown on the statement.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 17:09:25	@Nutty_Nat_Nat but ive just paid my phone bill and that came off straight away before that the card was last used Sunday which is shown on
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 16:20:01	How is it yesterday my credit card balance was £188 roughly and today is £312 with no credits to the account visible. http:// Comfusaled.com
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 15:58:59	Need to go to the GPs later to pick up my script hope the rain holds off. Fingers crossed!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 15:56:41	@IthinkIamCarrie probably its Sod's law :) you'd think in this day an age that they'd be able to give you an hour time slot :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 15:54:48	Had one hell of a rough night tho i excepted it, physically feel better this morning. Wish i had a punching bag need to release this stress
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 07:00:42	maybe its the dodgy eggs i ate earlier lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:59:11	i dont know where this clarity has come from, what has changed since a couple of hours ago but its good, its positive and i like that alot!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:58:15	I can choose to make tomorrow the best day ever, I can choose to let BPD thoughts take over and not use skills. I can choose to take control
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:57:18	I have control of the pen I write my future every day is a clean slate of paper no one/nothing will ever control my pen i have a firm grasp!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:55:53	i accept that i can not change the past, that the past doesnt define my future, that is unwritten. I take to the future like a pen to paper.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:54:27	@barmybelle hello :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:53:34	3 years ago i was in self destruct mode, self harming daily, overdosing, on/off with the crisis team, encounters with the police, wasnt good
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:52:06	prob doesnt say much given my tweets these past few days but when i say that compared to 3 years ago, this is heaven a dream almost
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:50:35	whilst things havent been too good for me these last few days, life is getting better and is currently the best my life has ever been :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:49:29	what i want is what ive got - westlife brilliant lyrics http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=WPUN9v Gy5iU …
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:39:03	@Polarbear3127 can you take some?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:37:53	@Polarbear3127 can you take anything for sleep and get yourself off to bed?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:33:45	@Polarbear3127 thats not good, is there anything that helps during this time?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:32:37	@Polarbear3127 hopefully the aripiprazole will start to work soon for you and provide you with relief
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:31:27	@Polarbear3127 but thats when i got the weight gain, puffiness and "the olanzapine look" but at that time i was on 3 anti psychotics too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:30:02	@Polarbear3127 yes 20mg is the max of olanzapine thought in the states ive seen higher but thats off label. I was on the max and not sedated
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:28:57	@poppyshakes yeah they did it was good to see what they are like off screen, made understanding their characters better too x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:26:37	@poppyshakes yes i did the only thing i didnt like is that they showed it before the last episode and it had a bit of spoiler in it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:22:16	@poppyshakes yes i agree, ricky played derek so well was a brilliant series.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:20:39	i dont feel very well, think the eggs i ate earlier werent good :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 06:20:09	@poppyshakes it made me cry too, i bawled my eyes out at the end, brings a lump to my throat now thinking about it.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 05:36:16	@Polarbear3127 when i was last on olanzapine i had no sedation but gained almost 4 stone :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 05:34:43	@Polarbear3127 thats good to know, for me i need mood stabilisation anti depressants dont do it make me suicidal and ive tried almost all AP

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 04:58:08	So yeah being brave and using a pic of me as my profile pic, dunno how long it will stay up.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 04:33:41	@Polarbear3127 system so i can see me needing higher doses, thinking about the olanzapine just dont want the weight gain :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 04:32:57	@Polarbear3127 how are you finding the lamotrigine at that dose? Im on the combined pill which reduces how much lamotrigine gets in my

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:58:17	@Love_my_Westie thanks :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:58:00	@IthinkIamCarrie yeah I'm a little yellow fish by little trees I think they're called on there plus many others :-)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:45:09	@stilgarg restless energised and excitable at the moment was on edge and irritable earlier still got some of that now
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:44:20	@BoredAndBonkers disturbed sleep is horrible an doesn't help with the restlessness either.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:42:12	@BoredAndBonkers how's you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:42:09	@BoredAndBonkers rather on edge was feeling blah earlier now energised restless and feeling excited. Psych has increased lamotrigine.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:40:04	@BoredAndBonkers hopefully they won't take your license away from you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:38:32	@stilgarg yeah I've been on so many and am sensitive to many too, I refuse to put on weight and can't be sedated too much cause of my son.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:36:18	@BoredAndBonkers I'm waiting to hear if they will give me a provisional licence it's agonising waiting! Sympathise with you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:34:47	@BPDFFS congratulations :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:34:00	@stilgarg abilify to try and curb it but its done this instead
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:33:47	@stilgarg the low weight gain/non sedative effects but it just messed me up causing this mood state since sat, was going low so took the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:32:27	@stilgarg if ami/sulpride didn't cause the lactation issues I'd take that but I can't handle those side effects. I was on abilify because of
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:25:59	@stilgarg thanks still titrating up so not at right dosage for me yet. Psych was in about olanzapine but I didn't want it at the time.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:21:41	@stilgarg yeah increasing the lamotrigine to 75mg and psychs supposedly phoning hub on Friday to see how i am doing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:18:08	@stilgarg yes it is great to chat to others who know what it feels like but also good to be aware of your limits :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:03:06	Gotta say i, looking good today and slimmer
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-19 01:02:16	@brokenmind_ they are annoying but just report them

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 23:44:51	@Polarbear3127 the lowest dose of it now to see if it may help, psych is supposedly calling hub again on Friday but doubt he will.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 23:44:14	@Polarbear3127 got ahold of psych increased lamotrigine to 75mg, he wanted to add in olanazapine but i didnt want it. But wondering about
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 22:00:08	I have spent £900 this past week, but feel guilty for every penny spent
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 21:58:03	@stilgarg from when I was IP he took an hour max for ward rounds as split them mon and Thurs so he should be free this arvo
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 21:57:05	@stilgarg he's useless got a very poor memory so you have to keep on at them to get him to call. Which is why hubs phoning as I can't do it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 21:49:22	@stilgarg feel crap can't get hold of psych hub keeps trying :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 21:41:01	Had another brown envelope only to tell me increase in rates and about pip, my council tax has gone up £2 a month to £98 #hatebills
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 20:04:23	@Polarbear3127 feeling rough,my moods dropped, cant get hold of psych, just want to sleep. Hows you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 19:36:43	So psychs doing ward rounds at the mo, hub left a message for him to call him, who wants to bet that he doesn't call!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 19:28:00	And as usual its hard to get ahold of my psych!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 18:26:06	Mind is alot calmer today, feel little doped up from the chlorpromazine but it is dissipating.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 07:23:41	im off to bed night all x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 07:17:16	@Polarbear3127 thanks need all the luck i can get
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 07:15:58	@Polarbear3127 my psych wont agree to it, he will just say come off it and increase the lamotrigine hub is phoning tomorrow to sort out meds
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 07:13:29	@Polarbear3127 ah right well hopefully a slow titration wll help against the side effects and be benefical to you
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 07:11:52	@Polarbear3127 maybe clozapine in the next step for you as scary as the med is it may be the one that really helps you
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 07:11:17	my poor husband has had an earful from me today, verbal abuse, even a threaten of divorce, how hes still here beside me beats me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 07:10:04	took a chlorpromazine to try and reduce this agitation and irritability but its not doing much, hoped it would sedate me but no
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 07:08:44	@Polarbear3127 that must be so scary for you, how come you changed the meds in the first place olanzapne not doing anything for your symptom
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 07:07:45	@Love_my_Westie cool :) bet you wont want to get off it once you have it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 07:07:22	@Polarbear3127 thats not good at all, hope you can see your psych very soon

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 07:01:46	@Polarbear3127 sorry to hear that, heres to a better week for us!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 06:36:12	@BoredAndBonkers i sympathise im so sensitive to meds, it is a long ole journey to get the meds right :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 06:34:13	@BoredAndBonkers tell me about it, sometimes tho the side effects just arent worth it especially when they effect your every day functioning
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 06:32:39	@AshleySparklez gosh thats a handful :( sorry to hear that :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 06:31:44	@BoredAndBonkers ive had to stop it, its made me agitated, irritable & very angry, hub is phoning psych tomorrow because of current mood :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 06:28:33	just want to say to anyone reading my tweets at the moment, just ignore me i'll most likely be ok in a weeks time.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 06:27:41	@Scarsarebeaut_ aww thank you, brought tears to my eyes, im not going to do anything for a couple of days see if this mood state changes xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:55:08	i want to be back to how i was 5 days ago, when mood was more settled and i was using skills brilliantly and well everything was ok
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:53:58	@amanda_stand thanks :) i dont have him for much longer as changing teams :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:52:41	@amanda_stand yep hub is phoning psych tomoro for me as im likely to be a bit harsh towards him, i dont like him :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:52:01	@amanda_stand its ok thanks anyways
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:51:43	@amanda_stand been on it several times before and not had the reaction ive had today and yesterday
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:51:17	@amanda_stand its an anti psychotic used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar and as an add on for depression
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:50:37	@Scarsarebeaut_ i dunno whats right just feel so unliked again thought things were going great

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:46:44	@amanda_stand i have co existing depression but trying to distingish between bpd low and going low in depression :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:45:12	can you get mixed episode like symptoms after 2 days being on abilify?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:44:48	when does a bpd low mood become depression?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:43:43	@Raznay84 i dont really want mine but its the only contact i have of some people
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:42:35	@AnnieCarr1978 nah, not for long anyway, :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:42:01	@Raznay84 the thing is on facebook its mostly peple i know in real life, family, a few friends, life just repeats thoughts reinforced
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:40:08	@Raznay84 nah your right it is,
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:39:21	way no one gives a shit, online/offline/professionals im just a hopeless case maybe they should have locked me up when they had the chance
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:38:35	@Raznay84 and those on facebook? i wont believe that, its just cause its me, i go through periods of doing well then doing crap and either
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:37:45	yep at the end of the day you just turn the comp off and forget about those "inside" it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:35:56	@Raznay84 i thought that i had made some friends but i guess i was wrong, guess at the end of the day you can turn the comp off and forget
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:32:18	@Raznay84 think i just need to leave it a while, thought i had friends on here, but i guess that was only my perception :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:29:52	maybe its time to give twitter a break again, this time maybe for longer
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 05:23:11	knew i was only a last option friend one to fill the gap
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 04:51:34	Just poured my heart out to hub cried coming off abilify its evil and made me a bitch from hell in two days. Hes phoning psych tomoz
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 03:24:26	Am sure its the abilify causing me to be so irritable so off that i come, out of ideas now for AP as the rest make fat or lactate :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-18 01:56:41	I'm try so hard maybe that's the problem. I want to get well, feel like I've lost the support from hub as long as Ido what he wants its ok:(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:57:23	@Renacemento thanks send *hugs* back x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:50:00	feeling somewhat calmer, im not sure if the abilify is making me feel this way but i need to persevere with it and try to get used to it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:48:12	@stilgarg thanks for the chat :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:26:00	@stilgarg ive heard of it and had one session years ago, ive been referred for urgent DBT therapy as its the one that will help the BPD
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:22:19	@stilgarg im on lamotrigine and abilify have only just started taking abilify on a full time basis as it was only prn before, they do help
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:18:00	@stilgarg my husband is most of the time, i dont speak to my family and hubs family have their own issues right now so i cant lean on them
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:14:07	@stilgarg my cpn did see me in my "high" mood and was concerned but i was 5 days into it by then and i came down a few days later
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:12:59	@stilgarg mood stabilised to "normal" for a week and now has dipped i feel low but not despairingly depressed, not sure if typical bpd moods
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:12:03	@stilgarg im not sure whats caused this dip, i had a week of high energy, productiveness and needing less sleep a few weeks back then my
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:09:13	@MacMurphy42 thank you, trying to make heads & tails of things but also feeling a tad rejected here on twitter most likely just perceived :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:06:17	@stilgarg isnt helping either
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 23:06:09	@stilgarg thanks i wont give up but just feel really upset and trying to use dbt skills to help me figure out things but my irritable mood
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 22:48:30	ill shut up now nobody wants to read my dribble
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 22:48:10	i actually thought that i was doing well, but now i think the BPD was tricking me, ive lost all the confidence i had.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 22:46:18	feeling very "borderline" right now but it doesnt help that my thoughts are reinforced yet again and that hurts a lot
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 22:44:48	how is it for a few days people show me kindness and validate me then a couple of days like im treated like i dont exist. way to help me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 22:38:39	i feel so agitated on edge, argumentative, ragey, tense i want to punch something laugh and cry at the same time,
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 22:36:20	i cant decide if what im feeling is justified or just imagined. i do feel invisable however
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 22:32:20	going to like me but i actually just wish people would say hey i dont like you, you know be honest and all that. maybe thats too much to ask
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 22:31:45	im feeling really invalidated right now and really feel my interpersonal relationship skills are useless, i know i need to accept many arent
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 22:12:06	he cant even be bloody polite to me great lessons for our son, and when i pull him up about it im suddenly getting stressed and irritable!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 18:59:23	Refuse to allow the gloomy weather to infect my mood!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 16:25:52	Today is going to be better, took half an abilify at 9pm and no drowsiness this morning which should mean I'm not irritable rest of the day!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 16:22:26	@Scarsarebeaut_ wow thats amazing you're a hero :-) xx

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:19:23	@Love_my_Westie I'm thinking about that I am tired now, not got any energy to do anything. :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:18:40	@Love_my_Westie useless at calling back. Not ill enough to present to A&E and don't really want to do that anyway. Ill just suck it up :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:18:02	@Love_my_Westie think I have a mood disorder on top of the BPD. I think my lamotrigine needs increasing but cpn is on leave now and psychs
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:17:14	@Love_my_Westie thanks Hun I just think I've hit a depression should only last a few more days hopefully they usually do. Really starting to
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:16:18	Achieve anything and ill just feel even worse, but late to drink the vodka as taken meds :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:15:33	I really want to self destruct but there is no point ill just hurt myself and hub won't get any pro help not that I want it anyway it wont
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:14:15	@Love_my_Westie he is what stopped me then and now I can't leave so can't do anything :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:12:50	@Love_my_Westie I have a very high bridge where I live.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:12:08	I feel fucking shit, moods really dropped and now starting to wish I'd gone with that impulsive urge earlier when I had the opportunity!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:11:07	Well isn't that just reinforcing my thoughts and beliefs. I'm not bothering anymore. Don't care about keeping up the positive facade anymore
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:05:52	Well least I don't think I've done anything wrong.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 06:05:24	Went from feeling really positive this week and getting positive attention because of it to now nothing with me not doing anything wrong :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 04:15:22	Cooking chicken tikka masala in the Actifry smells so good :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 01:52:36	That bisacodyl had better help against the side effects that I'm getting from lamotrigine! As it's stopping me in my weight loss journey :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 01:00:50	Used skills to get through difficult thoughts radical acceptance I'm pleases with myself and how I coped
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 00:54:33	Back home from town had a bit of urges on way to town as have to go over high bridge but told myself they're just thoughts and that's all.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-17 00:08:35	@Love_my_Westie cool enjoy your dinner x

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 18:51:01	@Irish_lass1975 ps is under agreement with psych if I felt I needed to take them more often.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 18:50:18	@Irish_lass1975 I was taking it on prn basis but going to take regularly now ur suggestion is a good one I think I will do that tonight ty x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 18:37:57	I took an abilify last night as I was feeling rather bluh & this morning it's left me feeling so tired/sleepy maybe take it earlier tonight
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:19:46	right im going to sleep, night all x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:14:30	@DamagedGoods_ my cpn said it today and since then its all gone to pot for me :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:12:12	@Hopingforhope1 @WickedTheodora i take lamotrigine and aripipazole and its really helping AD's did nothing good for me
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:11:00	@Love_my_Westie yay :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:10:52	@WickedTheodora yes your body is used to the higher dose it needs the higher dosage now
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:09:58	@Love_my_Westie aww so happy for you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:09:43	@WickedTheodora @Hopingforhope1 ah right well thats a good thing, hopefully it will stay that way
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:08:29	@WickedTheodora risk for od is that right? so i guess htey are being cautious
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:08:08	@WickedTheodora wow your body is used to the higher dosage the 100 isnt going to do very much at all, but i remember you saying there is a
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:06:41	@WickedTheodora @Hopingforhope1 sorted then you have no hope in dealing with the bpd
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:06:24	@WickedTheodora @Hopingforhope1 they need to forget about the bpd for the moment because until the undelying depression and anxiety is
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:04:09	@WickedTheodora low dose Q is useful for sedation only not for mood stabilisation
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:03:42	@WickedTheodora i get that bit, my psych likes to only do one med at a time to see which is working and what isnt
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:03:02	@Hopingforhope1 @WickedTheodora its disgusting how they think everything is because of the bpd when its not
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:01:58	@WickedTheodora for a second opinion from another psych within your team?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 07:01:44	@WickedTheodora if the depression just isnt shifting then its unlikely to be a bpd mood swing and more a depressive disorder, can you ask
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 06:59:54	@WickedTheodora disorder as well then that needs treating seperately and not the same as bpd sadly some psychs dont see it or do it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 06:59:22	@WickedTheodora some psychs see the bpd label and then think all bpd are hospital seeking and that hosp wont help but if you have another

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 03:56:55	@Prettybones1990 distress tolerance radical acceptance, trying to deal with perceived rejection but not sure how :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 03:43:22	It's hard to try and use skills on situations that are repeat what's happened in the past and confirm thoughts.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 03:33:23	@ZenCaitlin @oxymoronic82 thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-16 03:32:48	Use skills use skills use skills, it's only a thought doesn't mean it's real or happening.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 05:33:00	Anyone have any experience with cyclothymia? I'm interested in the high mood, is it definitely hypomania or hypomanic like symptoms??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 04:15:42	Brought a pair of size 16 jeans in George and they fit I'm soooo chuffed considering 6 months ago I was a size 20!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 03:55:07	@Prettybones1990 interpersonal relationships it seems the most complicated in the self help book I've got.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 03:54:29	@Prettybones1990 thanks I've self taught mindfulness and done it in hospital which really helps, for me the main module I'm finding hard is
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:59:55	@Prettybones1990 transfer back to adult services.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:59:43	@Prettybones1990 I'm currently self teaching waiting to start the dbt program as with a mental health team for new mothers and waiting for
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:16:14	Lasting about a week a couple of weeks back, cpn was slightly concerned but as I had some insight she said to keep an eye on it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:14:57	With the mood swings side of BPD how long does the high mood usually last? I ask because I had an energetic high productive less sleep mood
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:10:29	@Prettybones1990 it's making the leap of faith and taking the positive step forward, but it's also about being ready & not forcing yourself.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:08:55	@IthinkIamCarrie people diagnosed with BPD. Help give them encouragement and inspiration to know they can and will recover :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:08:14	@IthinkIamCarrie thanks it's such a good therapy and I'm now making a website to help teach others and skills coach. I want to work with
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:05:18	@IthinkIamCarrie a hard and long journey but sooo worth it. I could have a job within the mental health team after finishing dbt :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:04:44	@IthinkIamCarrie teaching in the mean time which is really helping doing some inner searching too, found out some interesting things. It is
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:04:05	@IthinkIamCarrie things have clicked inside and I don't want him to learn some of my behaviours, I'm waiting to do dbt program and self
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:03:24	@IthinkIamCarrie yep I fought it for several years refusing to accept diagnosis did start dbt in 2008 but wasn't ready since birth of son
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 01:02:03	@emmamarie1980 yep I guess some radical acceptance is needed
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:59:42	@IthinkIamCarrie most definitely a good thought to keep close when feeling disheartened/anxious.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:58:45	@emmamarie1980 it's good to know in one way that I'm not alone with these feelings. Now they are recognised its time to work with them :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:57:39	@IthinkIamCarrie I guess building confidence in ourselves takes some time, you will get there :-) you come so far and doing so well :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:56:29	@IthinkIamCarrie don't have to act on them. Whilst I have the thoughts I won't act on them, will continue as much as its scary on my journey
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:54:37	@IthinkIamCarrie don't be ashamed of your anxieties, I think it's a natural part of the journey for us. I guess they are just thoughts we
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:51:19	@IthinkIamCarrie yes it does you explained it better than me :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:43:18	That is what is causing my issues right now im concerned that ill lose my BPD identity despite getting my own, it's kinda all I've known :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:42:23	I know that the fear of recovering and becoming separated from the BPD is frightening after all I've suffered for many years and I think
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:41:15	Question: does anyone have issues with wanting to self destruct when people they know and care about have and just feel like giving up??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:39:58	Doing some retail therapy this evening, as lost weight and need new clothes that fit for holiday in 3 weeks time.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:38:06	I don't want to call her though to find out feel it would be a waste of call and could take her away from someone in need She'll let me know
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:36:09	Haven't heard from my cpn since a week ago she was trying to get hold of my new cpn from the CTT to transfer and do a CPA wonder if she has?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:33:29	I've been so determined to be positive and thought I acting positive it would help and it did for a while. I need to pinpoint the problem.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-15 00:32:10	Today I've not been feeling very positive actually the last couple of days I haven't been around on here and I guess it shows.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-13 02:59:36	Right im off to build the chest of drawers im aiming for an hour tonight not like last night!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-13 02:58:55	@brokenmind_ its worth suggesting again when you see your psych, its been so good for me and allowed me to work on the bpd without the mood.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-13 02:58:08	@brokenmind_ thats cause halo and lorazepam shut people up in hosp. :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-13 02:56:20	@brokenmind_ can say that being on lamotrigine and prn aripripazole as well as the pill has really helped me alot with being stable mood
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-13 02:55:17	@brokenmind_ they think Q is the best drug ever at the mo, olanzapine used to be the favourite before it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-13 02:52:38	@brokenmind_ that meant to say could you not the other way round
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-13 02:52:23	@brokenmind_ aripripazole is used for mood stabilisation, but there is the gastly olanzapine thats used, you could ask for a mood stabiliser
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-13 02:48:07	@brokenmind_ aripripazole is supposed to be weight neutral,
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-13 02:46:06	@brokenmind_ that is crap, i guess with so many playing now the wins are lower amounts suppose its a couple of packets of fags/backy tho :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-13 02:44:11	@brokenmind_ keeping everything crossed for you! You deserve to win!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-13 02:41:54	@brokenmind_ now your talking!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 21:07:15	@ALivingLie_ thanks and yeah you're right, :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:50:15	Why is it the day i find out my credit increase has gone on my card early its bloody too cold to go out & my son wont keep his hat/gloves on
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:29:34	@nuttylotte have you tried ebay, i used to get loads of craft materials on there before hubster banned me because i was spending too much :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:28:33	@nuttylotte thats ok and ah right, im useless with prices id probably under charge :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:17:38	@ALivingLie_ yeah i was devastated at first but i know shes ok and doing well shes being assessed by psych and hopefully starting on new med
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:13:14	@WickedTheodora ive had weekly scripts and hated it i cant imagine what daily ones must do, suppose it gets you out for a little while tho
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:11:11	@WickedTheodora thats there duty of care which is annoying but they have to do it :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:10:44	@WickedTheodora helpful changes.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:10:26	@WickedTheodora hopefully during this admission they will be able to assess and help you properly and not just discharge with no decent and
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:09:27	@WickedTheodora yep they need to make sure you don't do it again :/ same was for me with an amitriptyline od.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:08:45	@WickedTheodora yeah i agree 25mg is useless after 600mg, guess they have to take the od risk on board :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:07:56	@Love_my_Westie your doing great hun :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:07:33	@WickedTheodora dont seem to do much for you, for me i either didnt respond to anti ds or they made me very suicidal.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:06:44	@WickedTheodora still quite a low dose, hope it helps you and lifts your mood, keep lamotrigine in the back of your mind especially if ssris
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:03:53	@WickedTheodora apparently lamotrigine and aripripazole are a great combo im on both but the aripripazole is only a prn atm.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:03:19	@WickedTheodora lamotrigine is a mood stabiliser more used with bipolar but is effective with unipolar depression and low doses bpd.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:02:29	@nuttylotte and time spent making it i guess. Sorry not much help :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:02:03	@nuttylotte thats a fab card btw, would £3.50 be too much, ive not sold any of my cards so dont really know how to price, work out materials
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 20:00:00	@WickedTheodora thats a good point, have you ever tried lamotrigine? Its really helped my depression and allow me to deal with the bpd.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:57:49	@WickedTheodora have anti d's worked in the past for you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:57:00	@Love_my_Westie omg
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:37:41	@brokenmind_ thats great news for you keeping fingers crossed :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:36:13	@WickedTheodora oh hunni im sorry that has happened, hope you get some s17 leave to go to the cup final :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:31:58	@ALivingLie_ thats great :-) im doing ok have come to terms about niece and written her a letter going to see her in a couple of weeks time.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:29:48	@ALivingLie_ thats fab its always good to get off the ward and some fresh air for a while x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:29:12	Distress Tolerance http:// battlingbpd.org/what-is-dbt/di stress-tolerance/ …
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:25:21	@ALivingLie_ controlled breathing may help, worth a try anyways and if it doesn't help then least you have tried. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:24:27	@Love_my_Westie ah right five minutes or ten i dont think it would take longer than that :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:17:17	@Love_my_Westie within a minute.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:16:52	@Love_my_Westie aww yeah that will help she cant be upset with you give the card first :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:15:20	@ALivingLie_ does counting to ten and controlling your breathing help at all in these situations?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:14:35	I have my credit increase already applied and paid for drivers license, want to go shopping this arvo hopefully weather will be ok fx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 19:12:11	@ALivingLie_ I guess proving to them that your safe and well enough to be out of hosp will get you discharged, are there any ot groups?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:59:57	@Love_my_Westie think alarm = app it may help :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:58:37	@ALivingLie_ yep I totally understand with my admissions Ive been ok for the first week then just want out luckily Ive got out after 10 days
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:57:21	@Love_my_Westie I do love to share :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:57:00	@Love_my_Westie I can't promise as my memory is pants but if I remember will tweet you around 5:30 ish to remind you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:55:46	Have the song "if you're happy and you know it clap your hands" so singing it to my son whose clapping along with me and laughing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:48:48	@Love_my_Westie woooohoooo :-) yay :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:48:30	@WickedTheodora you're welcome :) x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:47:06	@Love_my_Westie ah right would softening the crusts and removing then covering them help to reduce the discomfort?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:46:20	@WickedTheodora didn't have a message Hun just my name x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:45:57	@Love_my_Westie be honest with her tho, she may be disappointed but she knows you and will support you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:43:04	@Love_my_Westie ouchie have you got anything cool to help reduce the sting. Ill get the laptop sorted eventually (I hope lol)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:41:54	@WickedTheodora hope everything goes well today for you thinking of you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:40:54	@ALivingLie_ as much as you dislike being there do you think it's helping you to get well?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:39:31	@Love_my_Westie heya nope it's really peeing me off now some updates have failed so manually downloading and installing I want to scream lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:37:35	I'm now in day 3 of trying to sort my laptop out albeit it's not been all day these past 3 days but Im getting bored now just want it sorted
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:36:11	@ALivingLie_ don't blame you, your informal they can't stop you ask for an advocate who can stand for you. They are treating you so wrong.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 18:27:20	@ALivingLie_ if they feel your a danger to yourself they could place you on s5(2) or s5(4) otherwise you can self discharge.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 17:27:44	@ZenCaitlin i could try to get him to do that but he is so stubbon that if he doesn't want to do it he won't, i will persevere however :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 17:23:24	@ZenCaitlin thanks, yeah radical acceptance is a hard one when he says he doesn't want to radically accept i tell him he's being wilful lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-11 17:05:57	I got told off last night by my hubster because i DBT'd him to quote "would you piss off with the DBT and Radical Acceptance stuff!!"
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 23:28:02	Why can't computer things be simple formatted and installed windows but can't get online as the drivers need updating grr
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 21:00:51	@WickedTheodora you're welcome :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 20:59:50	I have radically accepted the situation with my niece. Written her a letter and told her we still love her and that she hasn't let us down.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 20:57:13	@WickedTheodora yes you can, and we are here alongside you helping you along :) keep fingers crossed that you get the outcome you want x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 20:54:58	@WickedTheodora positive can really help. Thinking of you and hope the admission is a short one or they allow you out to go to the cup final
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 20:54:08	@WickedTheodora sorry to read youve been sectioned you still on a s136? Hows hosp being for you? Keep next sunday in focus having something
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 20:40:39	Hospital and was running around trying to find the right reception for me and screaming the name of my new cpn I ended up be sectioned in it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 20:39:48	Had weird dream last night that me and hub had massive row and i left with son, he then got son and i went to a really posh modern psych >>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 20:22:35	@Irish_lass1975 your welcome and thank you :-) xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 20:20:38	Happy mummy's day to all the mums :-) may you be spoilt like you deserve to be :-) xx

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 07:33:30	Come on laptop you've been on 6 minutes remaining for ages finish already!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 07:24:20	@Love_my_Westie fingers crossed it is waterproof
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 07:21:16	@Love_my_Westie should be ok if you wipe the surrounding area with a damp cloth and when washing hair put a carrier bag around it to protect
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 07:19:13	@Love_my_Westie they could be the least damaged areas whereas the rest is being protected to give the best chance of healing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 07:18:28	@Love_my_Westie try to resist the temptation it could get infected and you don't want that :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 07:13:54	@Love_my_Westie ah right that's good then.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 07:12:25	@Love_my_Westie aww is it painful it sounds as if it is. Have you any burn cream??
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 07:09:09	@Love_my_Westie I'm doing ok bit tired but hopefully the back up will be finished soon and can go to sleep how's you? X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 06:31:01	@Love_my_Westie I'm still here backing up laptop been on my other account @BattlingBPD :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 03:32:07	Actually gonna give up on the OU idea once I'm deemed well enough to work and have a job I will think again. No point making myself stressed
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 03:30:37	@brokenmind_ think its just saying out some silliness into your life I could be wrong tho :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 03:11:32	Well as myself Im thinking into the future like 6 months down the line about doing an open uni course anyone know how it will effect my ESA?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 03:10:22	Need some advice about ESA and the open university. I got ESA on the special descriptor if found fit for work would be danger to others as
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 02:43:01	@Love_my_Westie keeping toes crossed too :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 02:42:28	@Love_my_Westie that will be good if you can!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 02:41:34	@Love_my_Westie but even they are £80!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 02:41:23	@Love_my_Westie think a new battery is needed and most likely the cause of slowness if that's the case after formatting I shall by new bat.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 02:39:26	@Love_my_Westie I don't hold out much hope for mine it only powers up if plugged into mains and runs sooo slowly Can't really afford new one
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 02:37:22	Going to be formatting my laptop later on the hope that it runs faster, best way to clear the rubbish from it too. Hope it works fx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:48:20	@Love_my_Westie good slogan!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:47:59	@Love_my_Westie keep their opinions to themselves and just do their jobs!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:47:44	@Love_my_Westie there is but when it effects duty of care and professionalism that's the issue at my A&E I basically want to tell them to
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:45:49	@Love_my_Westie do talks and presentations and go to A&E and fight the stigma.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:45:23	@Love_my_Westie trusts consultancy and support team once I've completed the dbt course to help staff who are treating BPD and teaching dbt &
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:44:01	Told my current cpn that I want to change the way A&E staff here towards self harmers and frequent patients, I'm going to be joining the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:42:14	@Love_my_Westie that's good that they are so good with you need more A&E staff like that. Icu staff are amazing too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:38:12	@Love_my_Westie girl I went up with as support didn't they treated her like a liar and an attention seeker it was disgusting.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:37:42	@Love_my_Westie that's brilliant. My A&E the staff are horrible I've been there for others as well as myself, tho I had good experiences the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:36:48	@Love_my_Westie glad they were good some are so judgemental.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:33:28	@Love_my_Westie the truth look and I haven't self harmed for 3 years. Guess they will always think like it :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-10 01:32:57	@Love_my_Westie it's a valid excuse and could of happened that way, I know what you mean tho even now I get the I'm not sure your telling me

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-09 00:14:29	@Love_my_Westie thats a shame the business closed, physical shops are becoming obsolete due to eBay etc as you can get it cheaper online.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-09 00:13:34	@brokenmind_ they should stop at your request.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-09 00:13:12	@brokenmind_ when they next call tell them you want to opt out of these calls and if they keep calling you will complain under harrassment,

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 20:14:58	@Love_my_Westie team which is basically hospital at home team aka crisis team. So they all access rio and get files instantly.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 20:13:28	@Love_my_Westie to read your files, my trust has it but think its part of the reorganisation they doing as we no longer have cmhts but CTTs
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 20:12:42	@Love_my_Westie i know there is a program that alot of trusts are using called rio which should make it easier for those involved in ur care
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 20:07:30	@Love_my_Westie yeah should be easy for her to do so, does your trust put all files on the computer system now?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 20:06:12	@Love_my_Westie ah ok, guess maybe she wanted to know how sw1 helps you with crises and distressing situations etc.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 19:45:18	@Love_my_Westie ok i will suggest having something small as breaky does let your metabolism start and helps you to lose weight.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 19:44:06	@Love_my_Westie the anger and frustration is definitely justified.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 19:42:41	@Love_my_Westie having a glass and just sitting down and giving yourself 5 mins allow yourself to cry notice all the emotions your feeling,

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 16:42:02	@kezzy1975 @living_as_if @poppyshakes @wonderwhywoman @wickedtheodora thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 07:22:39	@AnnieCarr1978 no its fine because its really short acting sometimes two dosages are needed may just have more side effect bitter aftertaste
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 07:21:30	@DamagedGoods_ @Prettybones1990 your welcome **hugs** xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:59:20	@DamagedGoods_ im glad i have :) me neither this is definitely hell we have to live with xx

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:54:12	@DamagedGoods_ ok weve all done that, hope they kick in for you soon so you can get some sleep and rest. xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:52:35	@DamagedGoods_ phew, just trying to knock yourself out so you dont have to feel so of thing?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:51:20	@DamagedGoods_ just seen your previous tweet have you taken an od?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:47:37	@DamagedGoods_ it is evil, but letting it win and defeat you by hurting yourself is making it stronger. you can beat it and destroy it :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:46:26	@DamagedGoods_ btw its ok i understand that your struggling right now and its difficult to listen to anything when in distress x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:45:21	@DamagedGoods_ reason to be upset, especially when someone you were with is going on to do what you dreamed. id be pissed and jealous too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:44:38	@DamagedGoods_ its ok but actually it is valid, you didnt ask to become ill this illness robbed you of your dance career and that is valid
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:42:24	@DamagedGoods_ reason to be upset. so try to be easier on yourself.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:41:43	@DamagedGoods_ whilst smoking does help have drinks of water inbetween cigs as your throat may get dry. your distessed and have a valid
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:38:03	@DamagedGoods_ if you can do that it might take your mind away from the distress your feeling at the moment.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:36:54	@DamagedGoods_ how about for 2 minutes just clentch your fists as hard as you can whilst doing that notice the sensations in your hands.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:35:56	@DamagedGoods_ @Prettybones1990 im glad that you have her to help calm you down :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:32:44	@DamagedGoods_ feel like you are, what have you done in the past to reduce the feelings of intense emotional distress that your feeling now?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:32:01	@DamagedGoods_ look after yourself and take things one step at a time, say to your friend your happy for her even if right now you dont 100%
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:31:22	@DamagedGoods_ im sure deep down you are but right now your grieving because of what has happened, emotions are running high. you need to
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:29:49	@DamagedGoods_ sorry for the essay, if you want me to bugger off for a while i will just want you to know that i care and am here. xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:28:39	@DamagedGoods_ wanting to harm yourself is the disorder talking and the intense emotions can you do anything to help reduce these emotions?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:27:51	@DamagedGoods_ should allow yourself to feel the emotions you are feeling, dont invalidate them, they are normal reactions, however the
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:27:16	@DamagedGoods_ grieve for expereinces that have passed by for what ever reason. it is hard when others are achieving what you wanted and you
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:26:44	@DamagedGoods_ see the rational side to it later when your not so much in emotional distress but also remember this you are allowed to
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:26:15	@DamagedGoods_ its ok i understand that me being all dbt like right now may not be what you want to hear but im saying it anyway so you can
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:25:22	@DamagedGoods_ expertise and time, moulding them and guiding them through the mistakes you may have made in dancing. that is amazing
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:24:22	@DamagedGoods_ too old? maybe teaching isnt what you were supposed to do but it is what you are doing now, you are giving others your
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:23:29	@DamagedGoods_ point to carrying on with life even if right now you can not see it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:23:13	@DamagedGoods_ woah hang on in there, youve been through some tough times but doesnt mean tomorrow is going to be shit, there is always a
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:21:45	@DamagedGoods_ is that a fact that you cant achieve it or just negative thinking? your teaching dance now and that is an amazing achievement
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:19:02	@DamagedGoods_ wrong you will be, you are someone now dont ever give up dreaming or hoping. you will achieve. look how far you have come!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:17:44	@oxymoronic82 thats useful to know thank you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:16:20	@nuttylotte hmm strange i thought all avatars were static, gonna be watching them now
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:15:39	just remembered tomorrow i increase the lamotrigine to the next dosage in titration, hope the lack of side effects continues :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:12:36	ok so i think im getting tired as i could have sworn i saw tweeps avatars move :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 06:03:13	@Love_my_Westie thats good, fingers crossed for you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:59:14	@Love_my_Westie fingers crossed for you, i havent heard of it before, is it similar to a gastric but your hypnotised instead of surgery?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:56:09	@Love_my_Westie will power to get you back on track :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:55:57	@Love_my_Westie thats ok, its at that point you need some skills coaching to help with increasing your mood and positivity then work on your
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:54:02	help too to spur you on, i dont mind giving you some encouragment, if you feel you are slipping or tempted to binge.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:53:34	@Love_my_Westie thats good. one of the main points of healthy weight loss is having will power to stay on track, but having a cheersquad can
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:51:07	@Love_my_Westie thats good sounds like you have plans and are getting everything under control :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:49:51	@Love_my_Westie that might just be the best plan of action for you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:48:50	@Love_my_Westie so all temptation needs to be taken away from you. but still need to find a healthy fix for your chocolate craving.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:44:18	@Love_my_Westie to pick up a handful anyway?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:44:02	@Love_my_Westie your on to something there, pay like 10p for a cube just to curb urges but would you be tempted if there was a box of cubes
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:40:35	@Love_my_Westie thinking you have eaten a huge bar.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:40:22	@Love_my_Westie lol i know they are tiny but it might just fix your craving for chocolate, eaten very slowly you can trick your mind into
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:39:16	@Love_my_Westie yes moderation is fine, as previous tweet says dont deny yourself things or you will crave them more.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:38:41	@Love_my_Westie maybe its not about denying yourself the chocolate but only having a small amount, like buying a kids size choc bar
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 05:36:33	@Love_my_Westie do you have anything else chocolately in? how about some cereal?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 04:22:14	have come to terms with the situation with my eldest niece and no longer feel im to blame for her actions. just hope she is getting help.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 04:19:45	feeling content at the moment, massive difference to a couple of days ago. have my youngest nieces staying tomorrow night :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 03:24:38	@Love_my_Westie thanks :) have changed it to purple now :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 03:01:33	@Love_my_Westie oooh how'd you do that, ive still got the default blue
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:50:57	@Love_my_Westie meant to ask how are you getting on with metrotwit? Im using it and finding it very easy to use having the pop ups are great
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:49:50	ugh ive got writers block
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:17:51	@WickedTheodora paisley is a tad far for me but sending virtual hugs your way *hugs* x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:14:04	@brokenmind_ thats annoying you may be able to ring them and ask for it to be changed back to weds
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:12:16	@brokenmind_ also it will give a date on how long you have been awarded it, it will also name the professional which looked at your esa form
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:11:40	@brokenmind_ good plan, you can phone the jobcentre and ask for an esa50a which will give discriptors of why youve been placed in the group&
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:10:16	@ukschizophrenic according to my local newspaper there is a smog from europe that is coming over to the uk, my city has been foggy all day.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:08:07	@brokenmind_ two different things.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:08:00	@brokenmind_ ah right, could be that your payment day is changing. but you know what the jobcentres like what they say and what happens are
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:05:33	@brokenmind_ sorry i was assuming youve been placed in a group
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:05:21	@brokenmind_ when i got told i was in support group i had backdated money go in first then my usual payment a week later
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:04:17	@brokenmind_ could that be backdated money and your actual esa go in on a weds from after that date, im guess congrats are in order :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 02:01:18	@brokenmind_ http:// thefullfacts.com/esa/forum/view topic.php?f=22&t=1066#p4456 … this should help
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-08 01:59:23	@brokenmind_ it usually goes on the last 2 numbers of your national insurance number
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 23:26:33	@Irish_lass1975 that is a good idea one i may just do :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 22:56:27	@MacMurphy42 personally anything is better than leftover pizza :/ yuk
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 22:53:12	dammit watching jamies 30min meals and want a steak now
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 22:49:36	wow thats good :)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 22:12:31	@Love_my_Westie thats really sweet thing to do. best mental health workers are off their trollies :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 22:10:53	@Love_my_Westie sounds like a down to earth sw lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 21:52:22	@Sectioned_ thats great news have you request the esa50a so you know what descriptors you got the support group? and how long for?

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:31:48	@Love_my_Westie if you really dont want to get dressed could you watch something online?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:30:13	@Love_my_Westie thank you thats good to know :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:29:44	@Love_my_Westie could you try acting opposite like when getting the choc milk? What would you like to watch?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:28:12	@Love_my_Westie yes its all from my interpretation of DBT/bpd and understanding of advice that can help others.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:27:12	@Love_my_Westie that is true as long as you can get through.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:26:18	@Love_my_Westie ps thank you for the re tweet :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:25:31	@Love_my_Westie fingers crossed they refund it and it goes into your bank asap, money rationing is horrible :(

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:23:17	Im going to share my website link for anyone who is doing/waiting/wanting to do DBT it is being added to daily http://www. battlingbpd.org
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:21:46	@brokenmind_ wow thats quick
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:21:14	@Love_my_Westie lol she is a rebel good that shes going to call you back too
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:20:37	@brokenmind_ most likely wouldnt have had these last two admissions, they need to restart th therapy for you i think.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:19:58	@brokenmind_ you will just be in and out and they will use it as an excuse not to restart your therapy, if you still had that i think you
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:19:19	@brokenmind_ is that before you get to crisis point/s136 or once your at that point? To me i dont see how that will help you in the long run
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:07:07	@Love_my_Westie you should do and try not to worry you thought you was doing the right thing by paying
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:02:31	@brokenmind_ thats understandable, is there anything in place to avoid another short term admission other that the crisis team?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 20:01:12	@brokenmind_ how do you feel about that?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:59:46	@Love_my_Westie that's good, they could have made it more clearer for the reader however :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:44:21	@Love_my_Westie its not applicable where you live, just causes added stress which could be avoided :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:43:54	@Love_my_Westie definitely contact the bank and the department who sent the letter you should get a refund, why send the letter anyways if
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:42:45	@Scarsarebeaut_ @brokenmind_ i agree, cant add anything except hope it goes well and the doc listens to you, fingers crossed for you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:38:54	Told her about my DBT website and have giving her the link shes going to look at it later on :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:38:00	Cpn phoned told her about my niece she told me im not responsible for her and its not my fault, she said shes proud of how ive coped with it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:35:31	@Love_my_Westie okies
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:35:24	@Love_my_Westie :( is it painful when it happens?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:34:18	@Love_my_Westie ouchie i can tolerate tongue bars against teeth but if someone clicks their joints i cant stand it can barely stand my own.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:31:43	@Love_my_Westie cringing just reading that lol

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:23:35	@Love_my_Westie thats a good plan, act opposite to what your wanting to do, try without thinking to just stand up then once up you might as
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:22:44	@love_my_westie oops missed out the word enough then
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:22:07	@Love_my_Westie to go on without eating junk food.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:21:54	@Love_my_Westie so a binge would cause you anxiety, how about eating some healthier foods or having a sweet drink it may give your mind
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:20:00	@Love_my_Westie thats good hopefully she will get your email and call you soon.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:19:26	@Love_my_Westie thats good fingers crossed it stays that way for you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:19:03	@Love_my_Westie would having a small binge be a problem for you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:18:19	@Love_my_Westie your social worker is that still an option?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:18:05	@Love_my_Westie the urge then your more likely to do it. But im not judging you, its your way of coping. You said earlier about contacting
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:17:20	@Love_my_Westie usually do so that it doesn't cause as much damage, i say this because as much as i could say dont do it, if you can't fight
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:16:47	@Love_my_Westie aww bless you, i try to help as much as i can. I hope you don't end up oding too but if you do could you take less than u
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:15:42	@Love_my_Westie ouch thats a tad stinging on the wallet, its £25 here.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:14:53	@Love_my_Westie ah ok ignore previous tweet lol, hope the diazepam helps you and reduces this mood making things more manageable for you x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:14:04	@Love_my_Westie either as it goes up after a certain time :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:13:46	@Love_my_Westie if there was no pay meter then it should be free, but double check with the council before paying the fine and dont leave it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:11:17	@tiggy_87 thank you :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:10:43	@Love_my_Westie if the carpark was free then i would contest the fine if not could you ask this friend to pay some of the fine?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:07:54	I am in a really happy mood my son took his first steps this morning :-)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:07:25	@Love_my_Westie well im around, whats been happening today, read ur tweets about a fine and feeling negative, would you like to talk at all?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 19:04:18	@Love_my_Westie ****big hugs****
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 17:24:36	@WickedTheodora hope you managed to get some sleep last night xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:34:59	im off to sleep, didnt realise the time. night everyone xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:32:41	glad you have IHTT invovled, can you lean on them and speak on the phone to them when distressed? or write the samaritans an email ranting?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:29:57	@WickedTheodora low, even if for a short while. i hope you can repair your friendship.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:29:27	@WickedTheodora yes life happens but to ditch you when your in a low place thats not fair. is there anything that helps when your feeling
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:27:06	@WickedTheodora be and maybe when calm re follow. your allowed to be low and negative, maybe give it some time and they may come round.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:25:48	@WickedTheodora ah right thats understandable as well. no your right that was cruel to do that, should have just unfollowed and let things
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:25:04	@WickedTheodora thats understandable that you feel hurt, but maybe need to re evaluate if they were real friends in the first place.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:21:42	@WickedTheodora silliest thing so it cant be traced back to you so you could rant on that if you didnt want to rant on twitter anymore?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:21:11	@WickedTheodora ranting space, if people dont like your tweets then they dont have to read them. could you get a blog and name it the most
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:20:22	@WickedTheodora havent been online all day but i guess if youfollow alot of people its hard to keep up :/ and your twitter is your private
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:19:25	@WickedTheodora i get paranoid too, feel like people dont want to know me anymore, as for twitter it is annoying when no one notices that
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:18:26	@Love_my_Westie am using it now and its realtime no need to refresh and mentions pop up in a little box to the right hand side.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:12:23	@WickedTheodora might ease your feelings of no one noticing you. hope that makes sense :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:11:33	@WickedTheodora corner just to make sure people know your still around. supose that depends on who your with and whether you want to be seen
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:10:44	@WickedTheodora maybe you werent forgotton about just that no one said anything as you were busy. maybe next time pop your head around the

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:00:57	@Love_my_Westie oh no maybe there is someting in the settings that changes it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 08:00:24	@WickedTheodora depends, how do you feel about it? thats what really matters :)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 07:42:31	@Love_my_Westie see if that helps solve the issue.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 07:42:18	@Love_my_Westie hmm i have no idea then, ive not used anything like that, the only other suggestion i have is to download an older version.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 07:34:22	@Love_my_Westie it could be the browser you are using.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 00:56:27	one of the best things about making a dbt skills website is that Im self teaching skills and understanding them in my own way :)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 00:52:33	@brokenmind_ defintely the worst they can say is no, but it may set the wheels in motion for them to sort something out more longer term.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 00:40:31	@brokenmind_ yes I agree with you. your struggling in the community and need intensive support can you push for the unit you wanted to go to

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 00:27:33	@brokenmind_ yep that it is, but has it helped at all, worth your time going in?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 00:24:57	@brokenmind_ hellllllllooooooooooooo!!!!!! how are you doing?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 00:24:39	see this is why i want to become a cpn myself so i can give patients exactly what they need and not let them down like the MHS has me.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-07 00:22:13	@Scarsarebeaut_ your right she may have, think im coming to terms with it, tho seeing her pictures on facebook is upsetting at the moment :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-06 21:35:33	@Scarsarebeaut_ my niece got sent to prison yesterday, im heartbroken and blame myself, i failed her and her mum, i was supposed to help :'(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-06 20:26:46	@Scarsarebeaut_ could fix her because i saw me in her behaviour. Everyone is saying this would have happened sooner or later anyway. :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-06 20:26:09	@Scarsarebeaut_ thank you i will be just need to get over the shock and come to terms with it, i got too emotionally involved and thought i
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-06 20:25:20	@nuttylotte i just hope she gets diagnosed and gets the help. I think i got too emotionally involved thinking i could fix her :/

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-06 20:08:49	@nuttylotte i believe but in a secure hosp wing of hmp. I feel like ive let her down because i was helping her, but not good enough clearly.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-06 20:07:33	@nuttylotte its just a huge shock never thought she'd get sent down, but the place shes in will help her, shes on remand for mh assessment
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-06 20:00:03	Since yesterday's news my moods just dropped, i cant stop thinking of my niece, i just hope she gets the help she needs. Tears wont stop.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-06 19:43:31	@Polarbear3127 its ok not stupid at all, means it gives you more energy, more motivation to get on, unlike some meds which zombify you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-06 19:42:40	@Polarbear3127 lamotrigine and prn abilify.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 06:22:44	@SherieneHannah thats ok not sure if youve seen my previous tweets but Ive made a DBT site which Im still adding to http:// battlingbpd.org
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 05:56:46	@SherieneHannah there are sveral on google, just search chain analysis and the first 4 have documents you can download x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 05:45:50	#bpdchat just wanted to let others know of my new website called http:// battlingbpd.org advice on DBT and coping with BPD.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 05:24:41	#bpdchat our friendship is now very strong, even though some fb bpd groups told her to end the friendship she still wants to know.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 05:23:58	#bpdchat i fell out with a friend due to bpd thinking, she knew of my diagnosis so did some research to find out how she could support me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 05:21:58	@Love_my_Westie #bpdchat most mums know when something is up and when to "check up" glad you have your mum to support you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 05:20:58	@BPDFFS #bpdchat thanks. I know if it wasnt for him i would either be dead or in a long term unit. He has saved me in many ways.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 05:19:22	@Love_my_Westie #bpdchat yep. Sometimes its over the phone as he is at work, he tells me when its a good idea to take prn and to use skills.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 05:17:26	#bpdchat but now knows when im having a bpd moment and let's me get on with it. He helped me to stop self harming and find safer outlets.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 05:16:24	#bpdchat when im distressed he helps me to rationalise things, calm down, he talks to me, listens, lets me vent He used to walk on eggshells
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 05:15:02	#bpdchat my husband is my rock ive been with him 9 years he knows me better than myself! Hes been through the worst and still stands by me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 04:58:26	@Clare1305 yep you'd think they would have it sorted but they dont seem to. Hopefully an update will appear soon to rectify it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 04:39:10	@Clare1305 tho saying that just thought, have you tired searching the issue on google see if anyone else has the same issue & has solved it?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 04:38:26	@Clare1305 hmm very odd, thats what worked on ios. Sorry cant really suggest anything useless with android :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 04:36:44	@amanda_stand @clare1305 @love_my_westie oooh that would be fab yes please, will dm you my email addy :-)

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 04:21:03	@Clare1305 is it iphone app? If so if you go into settings within the app you may find the notifications are off.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 03:53:36	@WickedTheodora i dont know your situation with Dave but is he be a bad egg you just cant let go of no matter how much you try?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 03:52:50	@WickedTheodora never be sorry for who you are. Would i be right if i said your negative because experience has taught you to think that way
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 03:49:09	@WickedTheodora confused about how much you want him in your life? Btw vent all you like.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-04 03:48:17	@WickedTheodora maybe a misunderstanding on his part, your feelings towards him and the frustration sound very much part of your BPD and you

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-01 23:30:04	Its not self damaging. Apart from last nights impulsive £120 hairdresser bill ive not been spending. Im not sleepin much but heyho.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-03-01 23:27:26	My cpn thinks i may be getting a tad high. I reckon its just the high that BPDers get and even though Ive been like this 5 days its good.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 19:57:02	@brokenmind_ ah ok, have you spoken to your cpn about ur hungover chats once sober to see how much made sense?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 19:51:39	@brokenmind_ remember what you want to talk about?

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 19:47:56	@brokenmind_ oh dear well hopefully considering last night was a great night your cpn will be understanding to you turning up slightly drunk
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 19:46:46	@Love_my_Westie ok fair enough, how did it go with your gp?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 19:45:39	What not to say to someone with Mental Health Issues http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-H
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 19:39:38	@brokenmind_ of water! It will flush some of the hangover out. Glad you had a good night!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 19:38:53	@brokenmind_ i think you made the right choice to go out last night despite the hangover this morning, you kept yourself safe. Drink plenty
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 19:31:26	@brokenmind_ do you drink coffee? Even tea may help. Sounds like it was a good night last night!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 19:06:07	@Love_my_Westie ah right, could you dispose of any tablets left? Are you sure they are definitely ami and not something else disguised?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 19:05:08	@101Distractions it is and really unfair on the guy she went on a date with. Glad im not alone on that judgement of her lol
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 04:35:06	@brokenmind_ hopefully apple will put it on the ipad 2, but good u have it on ur phone too, wouldnt suggest jailbreaking it either its not
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 04:31:41	@brokenmind_ only a couple of year old but apple havent put siri on ipad 2 yet, not sure if they will.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 04:02:16	@Renacemento have eaten an clemintine and a chewable vit c :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 04:01:30	@brokenmind_ i prefer the who's version but even so an epic song!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 04:00:45	@ItsJackOk thank you me too i dont deal with physical illness very well.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 04:00:03	@Thewayimfeelin have eaten a clemintine and a chewable vit c today i hope it helps.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 03:59:28	@ItsJackOk thank you i will try that.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 03:59:04	@brokenmind_ yes my ipad 3 does.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 03:42:21	Anyone got any remedies for getting rid of a cold, i have taken paracetamol combo cold tab, got lozenges, drinking loads too, anything else?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 03:25:56	I am a person who is trying to recover, im struggling and have many relapses but im trying very hard to ride this rollercoaster through.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 03:22:49	Seem to be losing followers very fast today. Hmm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 03:18:48	Feel like im having heart palpetations. I also feel very nausous and achy.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 03:03:16	Is going to be able to stop me. No one is going to stand in my way. God help them if they do!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 03:01:47	They dont need me or my ideas, fucking hate when people take my ideas. Well ive got plans and i will be putting them into action and no one
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 03:00:25	And they havent done so was supposed to have been done by now. Again my idea something i wanted to do and someone else has nicked it. Guess
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 02:59:27	Just realised my health visitor and sure start were supposed to set up a meeting so we could put the mental health for mums group to a panel
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 02:41:20	Some RL friends just cant be happy for me at all. Always trying to destroy my happiness or drag me down. Need to forget about them!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 02:39:55	Your not keeping me in the cycle that your happy in, im going places and you can either join me or be left behind. Your choice!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 02:36:49	I am me, dont like me well fuck off. Im not changing for no one but myself. Some clearly cant handle what I say!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 01:56:26	Watching last nights panorama, a minute in and im already angry!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-30 01:24:45	@brokenmind_ would it help to ask what exactly they think your doing really well with and that your struggling with the praise right now?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-29 23:48:22	@ItsJackOk ive been on 900mg, it knocks you out something rotton tho the hungry feeling subsided.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-29 23:30:18	@kezzy1975 it is, ive been on olanzapine twice the first it just sedated me and no weight gain the second time no sedation just weight gain.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-29 23:29:07	I really fancy sweet waffles, icecream and chocolate sauce. Mmmm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-29 22:55:11	@kezzy1975 i agree, when i was on lithium at first i had the same problem. I hope it helps you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-29 22:39:53	@kezzy1975 its good stuff but can cause the opposite effect:/

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-29 20:59:30	If its one thing i cant stand and thats having a cold it renders me useless and nowt helps just have to ride it through till it goes.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-29 20:57:29	@brokenmind_ she validating you and giving you the time of day, she sees more than the bpd/avpd your a person not an illness.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-29 18:33:20	Anyone want my cold? Comes with a runny nose, sore throat dry mouth, sneezes, blocked sinis, headache, crackly ears and upper body aches.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-29 18:31:30	@brokenmind_ no probs, only takes about 10 mins to install and update.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-29 18:29:53	@brokenmind_ go to settings, general, software update and then install it does the rest itself. You should be on ios 6 the update is bug fix
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-29 18:26:16	@brokenmind_ you have an iphone right? There is an update to the ios and with that a facebook app update.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-28 00:39:45	@barmybelle @ithinkiamcarrie scared she thought she was going to die, even wrote a will during the treatment. Something to do with how fast
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-28 00:38:51	@barmybelle @ithinkiamcarrie watching my friend have the parvolex put me off ever oding on paracetamol and needing the treatment, she was so

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-26 20:05:40	Considering im on a 1200 cal diet, the curry alone was about that. Im not eating any more food like that again. All food will be homecooked!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-26 20:03:49	After losing 7.5lb ive gained 4lb i feel such a failure. This isn fair i worked so hard, think it was the curry i had the other night urgh!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 07:23:17	@brokenmind_ ok, it def sounds like you need something more than chlorpromazine to help with your mood.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 07:20:33	@brokenmind_ ask your cpn first, ive been on all the mood stabilisers apart from valproate as im not allowed it, they do help with mood.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 07:18:13	Wonder what he would actually do if i told him he wasnt coming into my home.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 07:15:16	Maybe if he turns up i should refuse to allow him to come in, when i spoke to him nearly 2 weeks ago i was really rude to him he deserved it

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 06:56:08	@brokenmind_ thats ok fingers crossed it helps and doesnt irritate your skin more.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 06:50:46	@brokenmind_ no probs :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 06:49:19	@brokenmind_ ah ok, with the sudocrem try it on a small area first see if it helps before covering your whole arm with it.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 06:32:49	@brokenmind_ you are far from the worst person in the world. I think its def part of the bpd as well as low self confidence and esteem.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 05:49:17	@brokenmind_ make you a bad person at all, not in the slightest. Your trying to cope with your emotions the best way you can at the moment.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 05:47:33	@brokenmind_ whoever said that clearly doesnt have a good understanding of bpd. And yes i think you are unwell at the moment but it doesnt
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 05:45:59	@brokenmind_ they dont like us its their problem, but alas its not as simple as that if it were we wouldnt have the worries.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 05:45:22	@brokenmind_ trying to fit in with others that we change ourselves to suit them, when we shouldnt actually be caring what anyone thinks if
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-24 05:44:47	@brokenmind_ low self esteem and confidence causes those anxieties, i have them all the time, & i guess as part of the bpd we are constantly

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 20:13:32	Fear - fuck everything and run or face everything and recover!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 20:12:51	Reverse effect act opposite nothing changes if nothing changes.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 20:09:47	I could do so much if i just stood up. This sofa has me glued. Low mood weighing me down. Feel heavy suffocating. Wishing for so much more.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 17:45:19	A year ago today I was admitted to the specialist psych mother and baby unit. It saved my life and gave me my bond with my son.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 03:56:11	@BPDFFS im good thank you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 03:54:57	@ItsJackOk no probs, ive taken photos of a disused hosp near me several years back, was so creepy there did several visits & noticed changes
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 03:52:43	@ItsJackOk have you had a look on 28dayslater its about urban photography lots of photos on there of disused hosps buildings.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 03:29:54	@brokenmind_ yum! Enjoy every bite! :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 03:23:03	I hate the C word there is no need to use it in every tweet!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 03:20:27	Some people are so nasty!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 01:19:28	@DamagedGoods_ thats really nice and your eye is very pretty!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 00:10:13	The Overdose 2008 http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-A Very Triggering!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-23 00:03:29	@brokenmind_ YAY!! :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 23:04:37	@brokenmind_ oh no can your sister come and pick you up?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 22:37:25	@brokenmind_ yay thats brilliant! Really pleased for you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 22:33:37	@brokenmind_ keeping my fingers crossed for you! Sounds like its more a hinderance than help now for you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 22:09:27	@brokenmind_ hope the doc grants you leave and you get to go home.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 20:12:30	I hate this time of year anniversaries coldness rain snow give me spring and summer any day. I want to get out on my kayak and just paddle.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 20:00:26	I feel somewhat agitated/restless want to do something but dont know what or where to start.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 05:44:44	Jan -27th to 2nd Feb is a very hard time for both me and hub. Going to be very tough, need to keep an eye on early warning signs of crisis.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 05:01:04	@cackiesmum she should have been placed straight into support group on basis of being in hospital never should have needed medical.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 04:10:57	@cackiesmum that sounds about right for medicals tho a slight chance she may get a group does sound like she will end up having to appeal :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 02:27:26	@BPDtainted omg hun hope she is ok and the police catch the person. *hugs*
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 00:26:49	Why doesnt anything happen quick enough, keep expecting too much from myself, nothing is ever fixed over night. I seem to forget that daily.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-22 00:02:32	@brokenmind_ glad to hear it, finally theyve listened to you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 22:50:16	Just watched last weeks casualty and it was tough, very tough to watch.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 22:46:12	@brokenmind_ they should have woken you but glad that the doc is coming back to see you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 21:19:07	Living at the ass crack of the country means we get shit amounts of decent snow. Its all slush here now but still bloody cold!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 21:14:42	@brokenmind_ thats disgusting treatment, you deserve better. I am disgusted with how psych patients are treated in hosp for physical probs.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 21:11:48	@brokenmind_ but it cant be left to go septic either. Hope someone is able to look at it and treat it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 21:00:56	@brokenmind_ have you had your arm looked at yet today?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 18:24:15	My Story. Part One Very Triggering http:// wp.me/p2QPtY-u
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 16:56:54	Needing matchsticks today me thinks surviving on 4hrs sleep due to unable to fall asleep and son waking at 4:15.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 16:49:25	@barmybelle good morning!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 13:50:39	In a foul mood the heatings messed up & its so cold causing my son to wake at 4.15 & not go back to sleep meaning im now awake. 4 hrs sleep!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 06:30:24	@kezzy1975 thank you your welcome to use it to help you to express yourself better if you like :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 06:23:05	@brokenmind_ good night
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 06:22:22	@Glass1ncision yes it is a shame, more needs to be done with their training to avoid the stigma and treatment they give to BPD sufferers.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 06:01:47	@amanda_stand #bpdchat was really good to be apart and join in great to hear others advice :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 06:00:32	@TheRealSupermum :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:56:54	@TheRealSupermum hi me again, caused by the abuse and neglect i suffered as a child.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:55:45	@Glass1ncision im glad that you have good proffesionals involved in your care and recovery.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:52:26	@TheRealSupermum thats a fab thing to do :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:51:27	@brokenmind_ glad a nurse has had a look at it, more chance you will be seen tomorrow and have it sorted.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:47:56	@amanda_stand #bpdchat about my behavious and areas id like to change.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:47:33	@amanda_stand #bpdchat explained my behaviours/reactions how id like them to treat me what i expect from them pointing out things id noticed
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:44:48	@amanda_stand #bpdchat http:// rayvenmental.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/dea r-clinician/ …
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:44:14	@amanda_stand #bpdchat I wrote a letter which is in my blog to the professionals about what I want from them in order to help me help myself
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:42:37	@TheRealSupermum im really sorry to hear that. its deverstating.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:41:58	@TheRealSupermum Sadly i have experienced that too :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:39:33	@glitteratty @amanda_stand very true this is so ething i have learnt very quickly i was relying on others too much, i need to take control.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:38:25	@Clare1305 @amanda_stand well its true you are an inspiration to us all. :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:37:40	@brokenmind_ keep on at them throughout the day until they do it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:36:52	@TheRealSupermum hi I have had a silent miscarriage at 12 weeks was heartbreaking for me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:34:52	@brokenmind_ thats good hope that it actually happens for you too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:34:24	@amanda_stand @clare1305 #bpdchat yes very awesome indeed x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:31:59	@Clare1305 @amanda_stand #bpdchat your welcome :) and thank you too :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:29:34	@amanda_stand #bpdchat yes for me it was talking to @clare1305 and hearing how she had helped herself recover, inspirational :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:26:54	@brokenmind_ which is wrong you can be helped. I fully believe you can and will recover with the right support and help from the cmht
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:25:54	@amanda_stand #bpdchat yes it does, gives me inspiration to help myself as well instead of waiting on the NHS to help me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:23:59	@amanda_stand #bpdchat what gives me hope is knowing others have recovered and that I can recover too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:22:59	@brokenmind_ i think its more the bpd stigma and they are judging you on that, which isnt fair on you and not ur fault one bit.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:19:32	@brokenmind_ could you write it down and give to your dr. i hate it when nurses change for no apparent reason towards us
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:16:20	@WonderWhyWoman #bpdchat thats fab advice and one i really should listen too as well.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:14:26	@brokenmind_ do you know when your ward round will be next week? could you bring up your treatment then and complain too?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:10:11	@Clare1305 @amanda_stand thank you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:09:45	@brokenmind_ hope that your arm gets looked at soon def sounds like it is infected.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:09:26	@brokenmind_ it sounds like you need something to help to stabilise you. keep on at them, sorry to hear your admission isnt helping atm >
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:07:52	@amanda_stand thanks suppose another could be that this is the first time im joining in #bpdchat instead of watching.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:04:41	@amanda_stand #bpdchat I did some deep cleaning which havent done for a long time.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 05:03:43	@brokenmind_ yes i imagine it does. can you ask for something to help lift your mood like a mood stabiliser or something instead of doping u
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-21 04:50:38	@brokenmind_ could be that your becoming used to the chlorpromazine i was on 600mg at one point and all it did to me was make me burn easier
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 22:02:01	@Nutty_Natty82 posts on my views about meds, news, benefits etc. x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 22:01:18	@Nutty_Natty82 im just blogging about what happens to me, my everyday life struggles with bpd and health issues and now going to add some

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 20:13:50	Has really put me in a foul mood. He woke me up at 10 because he needed the loo and wanted me to watch our son. Grr its fucking selfish!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 20:11:32	Really unfair, i let him have a bath in peace yesterday, even tried bribing me to go out i mean ffs you can go out on ur own. Pissed off
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 20:09:53	I wanted a bath in peacebut no he couldnt take his son out for a walk so i cant have a bath. Case of either we all go out or he goes alone!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 20:06:52	@Thereishope2013 as your account is protected only those who follow you can see your tweets.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 06:40:14	@WickedTheodora they should do in a few days once twitters sorted the background stuff.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 06:33:56	@WickedTheodora mine went pretty quickly when i changed my username even replies to tweets now dont link to my account.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 03:01:55	Anyone fancying a read theres only about 8/9 posts atm http://www. rayvenmental.wordpress.com
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 03:00:23	Really must get into blog writing more this year!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 02:59:09	Not sure who likes my sons toys more hub or son?!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-20 02:45:40	@Polarbear3127 yes it would me too plus the other side effects are not worth it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 23:10:42	@BPDtainted @renacemento think i may start doing that too!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 23:08:39	@Renacemento @barmybelle i thunk the thyroid is so sentitive to any change that anything can disrupt its workings.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 23:07:37	@Polarbear3127 i have a friend with paranoid schizophrenia and she tried several anti psychotics including clozapine which didnt help her.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 23:04:39	@Polarbear3127 ah right guess with you not wanting hosp she doesnt want to risk needing to section you clozapine isnt the miracle drug tho
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 22:22:59	@Renacemento me too especially when it hit the floor with a thud too, only been in support group since november last year they said a year.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 22:18:06	Nearly had a heart attack through the post was a brown envelope from DWP!! Opened it to find invitation for a WFI if i want to do it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 06:47:49	Righty im off to bed as been up since 6am. Good night and be safe!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 06:45:38	@Renacemento @barmybelle next blood test in two weeks as she wants to make sure its not the carbamazepine giving false results.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 06:44:52	@Renacemento @barmybelle on carbamazepine. Gp reckons its been working overtime for a while though, will have to see if theres any change in
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 06:43:51	@Renacemento @barmybelle well none that i know of. Ive only recently got borderline results on thyroid since coming off of lithium and being
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 06:42:59	@Renacemento @barmybelle i know my bpd comes from the abuse and trauma as a child, i think meds have killed my thyroid as no family history.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 06:40:57	@Polarbear3127 i recommend that you ask for a second opinion on meds if your psych isnt willing to change you to one you feel will help.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 06:34:54	@Polarbear3127 maybe its not about changing your beliefs but more understanding them and living alongside them.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 06:31:37	@Polarbear3127 depression cyclothymia bipolar schizophrenia currently they its depression and borderline personality disorder.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 06:29:35	@Polarbear3127 you can ask for a second opinion and have you been offered cbt or anything to help challenge the thoughts/delusions?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 06:28:09	@Polarbear3127 ive been on 8 different anti psychotics and not once has clozapine been mentioned, ive had different diagnoses too as well.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 06:16:01	@Polarbear3127 you are allowed to choose your medication. Some psychs dont like it but research the meds and see if you feel any would help.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 05:57:57	@brokenmind_ good night hope you have a peaceful night and sleep ok.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 05:57:05	@TheRealSupermum yes it is, its about care & mobility fill the form based on ur worse day and get evidence from your cpn/psych to back it up
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 05:31:41	@Polarbear3127 have you tried aripripazole its not sedating weight neutral supposed to work great with lamotrigine.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 04:10:45	@Renacemento im using my fitness pal app to monitor what i eat and to lose weight lost 6lb in a week and a half.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 03:29:38	@Renacemento its a sad one :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 03:10:53	I will never take olanzapine again even if my life depended on it. That is the most horrid med ever discovered!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 03:09:22	Psych meds have made me obese, i lost healthily two stone then fell pregnant and literally ate for two and put weight on again.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-19 03:07:10	Doing now if i hadnt made the promise to hub and son to never cut again, hard promise but determined to keep it.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 21:36:51	Hate seeing people i care about hurting and not being able to do anything to help them.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 21:35:23	@brokenmind_ you feel worse and could make things worse for you.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 18:21:09	@brokenmind_ hope they pass the message on and your cpn gets it before your appointment time.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 17:40:36	@brokenmind_ can you phone her and say come to me? Or a closer place to you like gp?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 17:39:30	Grr i hate when theres a time frame 8:30-12:30 i get up at 8 and now its 9:40 and still waiting could have had a bit more snooze! Typical!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 17:37:41	@brokenmind_ i understand that, bit annoying spesh in the cold and havin to go out whilst she has a car and can drive in the warm to you!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 17:08:39	@brokenmind_ speaking to your cpn voicing all concerns, what lead up to last night and taking things a minute at a time if you have too.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 17:07:27	@brokenmind_ some things may be a little screwed right now but nothing is fucked. Your definitely not! Just struggling right now. How about

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 17:03:41	@brokenmind_ could u tak the chance to go voluntary? I wonder if you didnt go to see your cpn you would have a welfar check done or similar?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 17:01:43	@brokenmind_ ah right why the cells is there not a 136 suite in ur area? I can understand why you went to go to your parents now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 16:59:46	@brokenmind_ go but obviously its your choice. About the water can you pop to the shop and get a bottle or two eithe to drink or clean with?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-16 16:58:33	@brokenmind_ is it due to facing ur actions or the possibility you could end up sectioned? Talking thru things will help, i think u should

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-14 07:26:04	@Scarsarebeaut_ kids pretended to like me only for laughs just to screw with me, my mother pretended to care only when i was of use to her.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-14 07:11:38	@Clare1305 thanks
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-14 07:11:27	@Clare1305 cause no one responds to me or if i tweet them im ignored. Just feel the world would be a better place without me in it.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-14 06:40:14	One thing ive come to learn is that im alone no one wants to know me, the world rejects me consistantly.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-14 06:32:00	>> and im very confused about it all. I dont know what to think. Just sat in tears.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-14 06:22:02	@Nutty_Natty82 thats what my mother wanted boys. Sadly it seems when a parent doesnt want you they make it very obvious :'(

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-12 23:50:39	@brokenmind_ how much drink have u got left? Would u go out for more once its run out? What would u do if the shop refused to sell you more?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-12 23:49:24	@brokenmind_ how about calling out of hours or crisis team, could you do that? I can see ur really struggling would talking help?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-12 23:45:47	@brokenmind_ eventually u will sleep whether u want to or not and the after effects will occur, denying urself sleep is making u worse.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-12 23:39:12	@unbalancedAbby heyhow are you havent seen u around on twitter x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-12 23:30:47	@ButtefProject hi

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-11 22:06:24	Major breakdown this morning said some really hurtful things. Psychs brought cpn appointment forward to mon/tues waiting on call. Calmer now

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-11 08:09:05	My soul will wander tonight through dreamland the happiest i am is when im asleep.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-11 08:06:46	Sleep i can escape this world, live my dreams have freedom. Peace
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-11 08:05:35	Once broken nothing heals the same again.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-11 08:04:32	Sleep usually changes my mind on some things, but if tomorrow when i wake up i feel the same now then some things are going to change.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-11 07:55:50	Just because i have BPD doesnt mean im a bad person in fact i try so damn hard to make sure im not. You have reinforced my thoughts tonight!

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-08 03:53:30	To trend or spread its promoting the wrong message and adding to the stigma of self harm!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-08 03:51:13	> yet tomorrow will wake up and think what have they done, maybe pressured by others its wrong and not what social networks should be allowd
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-08 03:49:58	There are girls out there right now who could be SH because of this trend who have never SH before but think they are doing the right thing>
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-08 03:44:56	#cutforbieber you have got to be fucking kidding me! Self harm is not a fucking joke or lifestyle. This is disgusting that its even trending
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-08 00:46:06	Not paranoid anymore its just a glitch apple have with the calender how much of a twat do i feel!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-08 00:42:44	World cant be ending as it lets me click on the rest of the year, but why not March, very paranoid here.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-08 00:41:15	Getting suss my calender on my iPad wont let me click on March it crashes everytime. Hmmmm
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-08 00:37:28	Cpn phoned, stopping carbamazepine and shes speaking to psych on weds about starting lamotrigine and aripripazole. She gets why im stopping!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 23:14:24	I want my hair back this is horrible, its so thin, just sit here and its falling out before me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 23:10:21	Phoned cpn 20 mins ago, she was on the phone, left message for her to ring me back. Hope she does soon, hope im not forgotton about.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 23:04:27	Anyone taking lamotrigine and aripripazole combo? Is it helping? Thanks
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 23:02:43	@AnnieCarr1978 oh no whats up? Do u wanna talk?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 20:46:30	Thats it ive had enough of losing so much hair im stopping the carbamazepine and i dont care what my cpn or psych think, this is rediculous!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 08:21:22	Am off to bed before my son wakes, though i actually hope he will sleep through the night again.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 08:15:17	@kezzy1975 was it helping at all? I do think u should let ur team know what uve chosen to do, but i do understand about the weight gain. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 08:06:06	@kezzy1975 was hard to come off. The highest ive been on was 900mg and that was hell coming off even with another sedative AP to replace it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 08:05:08	@kezzy1975 yep, you can get it on prescription at a higher dose but its sold otc at 20mg. I was on a low dose whilst preggers 50mg. Still
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 07:57:14	@kezzy1975 its known as sominex otc and can get from boots or other pharmacies. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 07:56:02	@kezzy1975 have you been more thirsty or drunk more? I cant say if its a side effect as i weened off quetiapine at 35 weeks pregnant. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 07:53:58	@kezzy1975 too and for insomnia have you tried otc promethazine? I recommend it, Zopiclone can really lose its effect quickly, i found out.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 07:51:54	@kezzy1975 having crackers or bread by your bedside will help for any morning nausea, drink sips of water throughout the day to help with it
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 07:45:57	@kezzy1975 which of the withdrawals are effecting you the worst, is it anything you can counteract with something else just for the moment?
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 07:42:43	@AnnieCarr1978 @nutty_natty82 saw your tweet from an hour ago, sorry i missed it, sorry you feel the same. Hope ur ok? Xx

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 07:16:02	@Scarsarebeaut_ good night hope you have a good night x
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 07:15:10	@kezzy1975 when i withdrew from quetiapine i found giving myself quater of a tab for a few days helped with the effects.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 06:27:22	Have bravely changed my settings so my ac is unprotected. Hope that with doing so im able to join in with chats and people can see my tweets
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 06:19:13	@Nutty_Natty82 @Elphaba1877 one will find me on here, only some of my friends have twitter and barely use it so never followed them. Xx

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 06:02:17	It is hard being me, no one can tolerate being around me so either ignore me/pretend i dont exist or make my life hell through many forms.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 06:00:00	@Nutty_Natty82 sorry its upset you, im really upset at the mo, i tried joining in with the bpd thing and got ignored confidence is shattered

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 05:53:02	Me she told her bf's to abuse me and rape me, she allowed it to happen, she neglected me, she destroyed me, she is the reason im this way!
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 05:51:47	I fucking hate my mother shes the one whose made me like this shes the one who made sure no one was nice to me, she told the kids to bully
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 05:50:44	I get shown an ounce of kindness and it leaves me seeking more. But no one wants to show
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 05:43:20	You know ur truely alone when even people who u thought would understand u just pretend you dont exist.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-07 05:38:34	Dont think my twitter is working properly, failed at trying the join in with something well thats that then.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-05 23:01:12	Like white paint over blue, my past is seeping through. I can not escape and can not paint over with more white.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-05 23:00:22	Im running away from my past, from everything that happened and trying to live my life as if i was born yesterday.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-05 22:58:23	I wonder if im trying too hard, im spliting myself up into many parts to please different people & and losing who i am completely.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-05 22:55:28	@Nutty_Natty82 thanks, trying to use some skills i was giving but its very difficult, im waiting for therapy but that could be months away.

409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-05 22:45:41	With people have convos because i feel i wont have anything good to say that will be interesting for the other people. So i keep quiet.
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-05 22:44:33	Thinking by making me feel if one person has rejected me and it was clear they did, then everyone else mustnt like me Im too shy to interact
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-05 22:43:26	It to me, just wish i had the knowledge to stop it. Feel rejected by people on here, and its effecting me big time, its changed all my
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-05 22:42:17	I really do want to be somebody different, this what i am now is robbing me of everything, guess i have insight tho to see its the bpd doing
409341288	RayvenMental	2013-01-05 22:39:05	Nice left out of something else again. Makes me feel so unwanted, unliked.

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-20 07:36:53	Should go to bed, cpn is coming at 9:30, need to be presentable for when she arrives.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-20 07:09:21	I guess the fact ive been in hospital since then, offically a nutter needing medication and see a shrink regulary scares them.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-20 07:07:23	The liklyhood is they just dont want a mental person around them, it scares them, funny they were fine with the mentalness two year ago.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-20 07:05:48	Anyways drink, a crowded bar, loud people, definitely not my scene. Need to be mindful and all that of my limits.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-20 07:03:56	@brokenmind_ im stumped then, hope you find out how to do it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-20 07:02:10	Wasnt given any details of meet ups etc though. Prob best i dont go wouldnt want to be the unwelcomed guest in all that!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-20 07:00:53	Wasnt invited out for xmas drinks until the event was mentioned infront of me, guess it was a oh well we'd better invite her now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-20 06:59:33	Just remembered something from today and remembered where i stand in the supposed friendship ring, about a mile outside it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-20 06:57:51	@brokenmind_ have you looked at settings and added the keyboard to the list of keyboards?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-20 06:15:59	Ugh its rained all day and still bloody raining. Its december its meant to be snow!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 23:49:41	Wow 2 days in a row ive been into town, tonight wont result in a complete meltdown and all that happened last night is forgotten about.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 07:00:35	It sucks to be me. Seriously i should come with a 100mile excusion zone. Tho to some people that zone already exists.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 05:38:39	Thats how quick happiness fades. Whats the point fighting years for it if someone can take it away in seconds.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 05:35:44	Bet whilst im here feeling like crap he sure isnt, least the tears have stopped for how long i dont know.

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 04:08:40	The bpd making me think i wasnt wrong and then become submissive and think im always wrong. That scares me alot
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 04:07:18	But least i think i know when someone is wrong and trying to pull a fast one, what if after therapy i think im cured and think it was all

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 04:01:03	Feel incrediablly guilty and invalidated, that even breathing is wrong, and im supposed to just get over it within 5 minutes, that its not a
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 03:57:10	Maybe my father was right i am on the same path as my mother and it will lead to pain and loniness. Prehaps thats whats destined for me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 03:54:55	BAH FUCKING HUMBUG!!!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 03:28:21	So i wanted a treat, guess im not allowed that
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 03:27:43	Damned if you do and damned if you dont.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 03:27:32	Been outside on my own going further than the docs for the first time in months, but as soon as i do im shot down for spending on me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 03:26:25	Feel like i now shouldnt have anything for xmas, and that i should just buy for my son and hub.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-19 03:23:48	Whats the rational thinking, been made to feel guilty for buying myself things from my son for xmas, i feel like i should take it all back.

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-16 02:41:54	Got my esa85a thru today, giving reasons to why i was put in support group and prognosis of medium term review equalling 12 months.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-15 16:07:46	With 10 days to xmas i need to hold myself together. Get back on my meds and get some bloody sleep, if thats ever possible.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-15 16:04:27	I dont have time for a crisis right now!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-15 16:02:42	Dunno if its the combo of not enough sleep and being 4 days off my meds but i feel so low. Clearly something chemical as well as the PD!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-15 15:29:05	A wide awake 12 month old who needs watching, so matchsticks and coffee it is today then.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-15 15:28:24	So tired, even with taking a diazepam last night i didnt get off to sleep till after 1, then it was broken sleep thru the night and now have
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-15 07:04:27	Of tossing and turning. And now have a child who is refusing to sleep. A husband whose clearly pissed at me. I just wanna throw the towel in
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-15 07:03:27	Fucking done in, havent slept properly since taking that damn imipramine its fucked my sleep up and i can not fall asleep until least 3hrs
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-15 05:29:17	Love idiot abroad
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-15 03:10:54	Ah so the carbamazepine was doing something to stablise my moods am def getting my meds tomorrow. Lesson learned.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-15 02:31:57	Crying from hearing the news from america, those poor innocent children, there are some sick fucks, and before xmas too. So sad.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 06:10:20	@Clare1305 sounds a very good plan!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 06:07:32	@Clare1305 ok, thats a shame that noone got back to you. Hope u find a job to suit you :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 06:05:48	@Clare1305 is thereanything like that which you could volunteer for? If thats what youd like to do of course :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 06:05:01	@Clare1305 with mental health issues eventually and there are several organisations here for young people, which i hope to become a part of.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 06:03:31	@Clare1305 are there any organisations working with vulnerable people you could enquire about voluntary work. I want to work with 18-25s
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:54:00	@brokenmind_ lol yep that would work too!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:53:41	@Clare1305 thanks, could you volunteer for a charity or organisation in ur area in ur spare time, to give you experience for a paid job?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:49:51	@brokenmind_ could you say your flattered but a relationship is not what you need right now/ or already seeing someone?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:45:05	@Clare1305 i was working in retail doing the job of five people. Yeah i hope surestart will say yes to it, will find out after jan 2nd.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:41:53	@Clare1305 id be using the group too as well as helping other mums. Id love to work in mental health but have to be stable before i can:/
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:39:45	@Clare1305 im going to help run a support group for mums with mental illness alongside the health visitor, if surestart give the go ahead.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:38:29	@Clare1305 i was working but it made me very ill so i had to give it up. I really want to work but have accepted right now i can not instead
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:31:51	@Clare1305 courses on cv prep and interviews preparing for work really.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:31:22	@Clare1305 to, the gov say the support group is for those who cant work unlike the wrag where the gov expect people to look for work and do
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:29:38	@Clare1305 in the support group you get the highest amount of money, but dont have to go to the jobcentre or look for work unless you want
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:25:23	@Clare1305 thanks :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 05:08:09	@Clare1305 im good too, had a early xmas present from the DWP been put in the Support Group for ESA, has taken a huge weight off of me. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 04:55:45	@Clare1305 just a tad. How are you?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 04:54:08	Actually did a chain analysis on my own last night, really helped considering i havent done one in over 4 years since i quit dbt.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 03:25:10	@brokenmind_ its ok not a problem. Main part of esa if in the wrag is just under £100 a week and support group is £105.05 a week.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 03:22:49	@brokenmind_ it is confusing, fingers crossed you get the result as i have
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 03:21:59	@brokenmind_ medium or high rate care you will get a disability premium on top of your award.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 03:21:04	@brokenmind_ i think wrag stands for work related action group. Prob on income related, which if your placed in the support group and get
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 03:12:36	@brokenmind_ look for work, and if your claiming contributions based its not time limited to a year, unlike the wrag is, you get more money2
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 03:11:24	@brokenmind_ its the main part of esa, either wrag or support group, in the support group ur not subjected to work focus interviews or to
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 03:05:56	@brokenmind_ use the guides i sent you too, and you may not have to go for a medical, i didnt, got the news today straight to support group.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-14 03:03:25	@Clare1305 really!? They have a book for everything!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-13 21:16:10	Im still shocked at the phonecall today, but very thankful i dont have to face atos face to face.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-13 18:51:31	@EscapingEntropy thank you, im so shocked. X
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-13 18:27:39	CHRISTMAS HAS COME EARLY!!! Just had a call from DWP Im in the SUPPORT GROUP for ESA WITHOUT A MEDICAL!!!!!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-13 06:29:06	A smile is the best accessory i can have. Tonight i go to bed wearing a big smile :D
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-13 00:19:32	Nobody cares when your doing well! FACT!! But then why should they your getting on living your life how you should be!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-12 23:38:44	My P45 came through the door today, kinda finalises things now. But where one door shuts another opens!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-12 23:37:30	I cant believe how clear things are looking for me, in my head i feel calm. Have a way to go yet but Im not giving up. Ive got a purposs now
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-12 23:35:37	Its not on, i need to be more assertive and stand up for myself. And i will do, whilst keeping a safe balance.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-12 23:33:32	Take a nice long jump off a short pier. My nice attitude will get me far with my career, but when people use it to walk over me thats when
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-12 23:31:54	Im stopping wanting to be like others, ive got several goals to pursue next year, im me no one else and if anyone dont like it, they can go
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-12 22:17:37	So ive decided to go med free, i dont conform. Im doing this my way! Normal people dont need meds and neither do I!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-11 22:37:29	I wanted to help those friends but they cut me off, maybe afraid of the possibilities i dont know. Really sad though :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-11 22:34:50	Ive lost friends in the mental health world because they didnt like that i was moving forward, recovering, taking responsibility of myself!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-11 22:31:23	I have a purposs to being here, its such a strong feeling, i was meant to go through the crap ive been through in order to help others!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-11 21:42:32	Been told not to self analyse my past but it helps so much.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-11 21:30:24	Place for me and i feel at peace with those things, going to be very alert to my evironment today for possible triggers.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-11 21:29:02	Some events that would usually have sent me spiraling. I must be managing my emotions better, somehow, i know somethings have clicked into
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-11 21:27:42	Need to find the trigger that sets off my low mood in the evening. For the past few days ive had quite a good mood through the day despite
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-11 21:13:24	@brokenmind_ ive read all payments due xmas week will be paid the friday the week before.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-11 21:10:56	@GiveMeABlade if u go to hosp for treatment its iv parvolex, which causes a rash, sweating, high pulse rate to name just a few reactions.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-11 04:16:39	I cant do anything properly!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-11 04:16:03	So my bloods came back borderline hypothyroid but cause im taking carbamazepine which can give false lows i need another test in 3 weeks :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 06:56:23	@Clare1305 lol yeah that might help! Bagpips what am i like!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 06:54:49	I wonder how one learns to play the bagpips?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 06:32:24	I have two halfs i need cutting into a whole.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 06:08:17	Just need to act as confident as i sound.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 05:56:31	Im gonna go down in history, kids will be learning about me in lessons!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 05:54:40	Im going somewhere, im gonna be somebody, aint nobody gonna hold me down, and just fucking try to.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 05:53:13	im gonna scream fuck you to everyone. Im a one girl revolution and im gonna fucking change things in this sodden world. Just you watch me!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 05:32:46	Well glad that shits over with for another year!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:59:45	I feel sick.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:59:06	As much as i hate my mother she was right about my father I refused to believe her and made up some fantasy dad that ive learnt doesnt exist
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:56:25	@Clare1305 thank you much appreciated xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:55:53	Did, that i will end up causing pain and seperation. My mother was abusive neglectful and self centre, she was a slag too, im not my mother!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:54:38	The hurts kicked in from what my father had to say this morning, he accused me of being my mother and said i will treat my family how she
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:51:37	@Clare1305 thanks :)
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:49:49	I cant even be ill right!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:49:01	Last od was 2010. My last hosp admission jan this year into mother and baby unit for post natal depression before that 2008! Im pathetic!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:47:26	How can i be a true bpder if im not self harming or acting on suicidal thoughts, someone questioned that when there are no fresh cuts and my
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:45:34	I dont self harm anymore because i promised my husband and son i wouldnt, i wont attempt suicide cause it will cause pain. I live for my son
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:42:59	@Elphaba1877 thanks x
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:41:17	Well that clearly didt last, fucking moods, i hAte it, hate myself. I really might just isolate myself, im invisable already
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:39:53	I feel fucking stupid. No one cares what i do, whT positives are happening for me, or the negatives, tweeted earlier how i was feeling good
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:37:20	All my creativity has gone, cant be arsed to make anymore cards
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:34:13	@Clare1305 i dunno i started following other bpders thinking id make friends or something but forgetting we share the same illness :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:27:50	@Clare1305 think ive done what i always do, imagined there was a friendship or something there when clearly there wasnt.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:26:02	Give me Pink Floyd, Black Label Society, Dream Theatre, Ozzy Osbourne any day, thats my choice of music!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:23:09	Dont care who wins crap factor now, it all sounds the same shit!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:22:29	@Clare1305 i get clearly ignored when responding to people, and my tweets get ignored too. I just give up.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:20:04	This is fucking shit. Its like everyone in the world knows me but avoids me like the fucking plague. I respond to people and get ignored.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:13:47	Huge feeling of rejection right now from the twitter community.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-10 04:11:41	Dont see the point to twitter anymore
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 23:26:37	Its moments like this that i wonder if im actually mentally ill, im sure reality will hit later, but for the time being im enjoying this!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 21:35:44	Good mood today despite this mornings issue with the sperm doner! My home is the cleanest its been ever, now to keep it this way!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 21:31:24	RIP Sir Patrick Moore such a legend!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:24:22	This and him. Sorry to fill your timeline up with all this but needed to vent a little to someone. Thanks for reading.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:23:40	Loving father but ive just been left dissapointed, but i have learnt alot about myself, and can make possitive changes to my life because of
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:22:44	Lot more sense to me now. Id put my father up very high in my life, and when i found him, i thought my dreams would come true, id have a
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:21:52	And resolve whatever conflict i had with him. Thats my father all over, running away, not trying to work things out. Things make a hell of a
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:20:22	Obvious that he had no time for his biological grandson. He said my thinking of how a family works is wrong and that he wasnt going to try
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:19:09	That actually mother was right about him. Dont think he liked that! Told him how abandoned i felt by him and he ignored it. Said how it was
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:17:35	Somehow, he sees me and sees my mother, told him i wish i hadnt found him after all those years which is true i wish i hadnt, and told him
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:16:30	Hasnt responded to me. I wasnt going to reply but with his first text he said he was worried about my family, like im going to destroy them
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:15:35	Getting divorced and that im not a child anymore. I am an adult with my own mind. I think for myself. I think he got the message then as
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:14:43	It wasnt working and that his tatics and games wouldnt work on me that i remember the arguments and games that where played when they were
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:13:38	And basically my life will be repeating theirs! Told him im not my mother, my marriage is strong. Told him if he was trying to hurt me that
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-09 18:11:24	Woke to some texts from my father saying im just like my mother and i will end up in pain and seperation, suggesting my marriage will fail
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-08 21:23:20	@SherieneHannah do you have a walk in centre you could go to or else failing that go to a&e thats disgusting they expect you to wait.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-08 00:37:14	Sad about the nurse and the circumstances surrounding her death. Hope she is at peace now. :( RIP
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:48:03	I think for the first time in my life ive found a part of who the heck i am. I have some identity!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:47:16	Life isnt what society says it should be, childhoods arent magical. Realising somethings right now, tears are flowing.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:37:52	Im going to make a difference i have many plans, im not giving up cause im no quitter!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:36:12	My mother is a undiagnosed BPD i learnt alot of my behaviours from her growing up. She wont ever change. I want to recover.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:31:49	My question is why did they have kids, why bring us children into their world when they werent willing to change their ways to adapt for us?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:28:16	Im doing it. My family may have abandoned and rejected me but i have my own family now thats all i need. I dont need them anymore.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:27:14	I wasnt asked to be born, but here i am trying to make heads and tails of what the hell happened to me. Its hard its painful its scary but
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:24:20	None, my mother basically said we didnt want to see him again. I feel like that confused child.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:22:44	Right now i feel confused, i cut the relationship off as an adult this time, i have full comprehension on what im doing, as a child i had
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:20:30	My home anyway. My mother off shagging anything, we were passed off to neighbours and the family tha was around. Its no wonder i have issues
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:18:12	Things, he didnt want to, he spent as much time away from home at work, avoiding us, avoiding th family dinamic which was barely existant in
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 22:15:49	Its not like he was even a proper dad right from the start i mean, his computers were more important, he never played games or did fatherly
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 21:07:17	For the second time in my life ive cut off contact with my father. I dont know how to feel right now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 17:10:43	And that im finally getting the right treatment, and therapies!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-07 17:10:07	Prob the news yesterday that im going to be running a support group for mums to be and mums with mental illness in the new year has helped!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-06 21:14:09	@DamagedGoods_ wont they eventually find out u have bpd anyway? She must be going by experience tho with prior patients, its very sad.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-06 21:09:54	After my huge panic monday Christmas is back on. Hate miscalculations and stressing out for nothing. Felt awful & had a horrible bpd moment!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 04:44:27	@SherieneHannah do it. I know you can, it will get you help hunni. Xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 04:43:40	@SherieneHannah right now. Its hard making that first step, picking up the phone and staying on the line when someone answers. But you can
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 04:42:56	@SherieneHannah night and go from there, that should get the convo going for you, and give the crisis team a clue on how things are for you
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 04:41:50	@SherieneHannah ok, how about, hi im calling because i dont know what else to do, i need help and im scared. Then maybe explain about last

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 04:35:35	@SherieneHannah do you have the option to text them? How about writing down exactly what you want to say to them before you ring? Xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 04:32:19	@SherieneHannah gives you a handful of courage, you can do it xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 04:31:22	Why is it that if something goods not happening now, i forget that it ever happened before, and get very angry about it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 02:48:28	Cant wait for #ImaACelebrity tonight i hope Charlie wins!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 02:47:42	Our future will become our past, so dont regret tomorrow yesterday. Make each day count/what you do today or tomorrow you may regret later!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 00:24:33	@SherieneHannah its ok its hard to believe right now but it will pass eventually Not particulary helpful i know but gives a shimmer of light
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 00:13:12	@SherieneHannah ok sounds a good idea, i used to do that. Keep reaching out though, its scary feeling like you do. Xx

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 00:03:46	@SherieneHannah can you say to the crisis team, that you have given hosp a thought and actually would like to go in, they see you need that
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-02 00:00:13	@SherieneHannah confusing for you to why your feeling this way?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-01 23:59:57	@SherieneHannah says you have bpd, could it be that ur actually experiencing a depression rather than the lows of bpd and thats why its
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-01 23:59:14	@SherieneHannah what about just going in for a few days and speaking to someone on the ward who maybe able to help you to find out. Ur bio
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-12-01 23:55:03	@SherieneHannah would a stay in hosp help? You need a rest by the sounds of it. What would you say to someone feeling how you do? X

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-28 20:17:37	>> i dont use them anymore, i refuse their "support" so belittling and degrading. Rather be on my own!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-28 20:16:47	#crisiscare is very poor in my city for those with bpd or reoccuring crises. They simply dont care with fed up voices over the phone. >>

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-28 04:43:18	Im alien to my emotions but even more to those of others. How can someone care about me, im mean seriously, its comical!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-18 05:10:06	I admire jarmene's courage.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-18 05:06:11	Hopefully that 1st coat of paint is dry and after xfactor i can do second coat. Need to start that mural asap. Its gonna help distract me!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-18 05:04:51	Chocy phily really doesnt taste that good, i tried it as love chocy spread but it was foul.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-18 04:27:19	I say it every week but Rylan to go home!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 21:00:00	@brokenmind_ it can be done ive quit for 2.5 years now, i was very dependant on them.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 16:52:13	I look at images of self harm now and are no longer triggered by it, i know this is a good thing but know the urges will still exist for me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 16:47:00	Have a wonderful day!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 06:01:49	When children are losing their mums to cancer and children are dying of illnesses beyond their control, its not right nor fair!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 06:00:38	I FEEL GUILTY FOR EVERY SUICIDE THOUGHT IVE HAD
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 04:37:41	Im such an emotional wreck right now everything is making me cry.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 04:08:10	I hate you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 03:39:15	Watching children in need.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 03:01:17	Oh and esa didnt get paid today but instead monday they said cause they recieved it late, not my fault royal mail is shite!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 02:56:03	I got cheap baileys and it tastes so good, its my self soothe treat because its so weak in alcohol volume that i couldnt get drunk on it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 01:00:38	Going up to tesco for snacks and dinner, and cheap baileys.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 00:57:16	@brokenmind_ well its your own choice which you decide to do, but try and think about the aftermath of vodka. Friends is always good.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 00:54:30	Im such a hypocrite, need to follow my own advice. :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 00:53:50	@brokenmind_ thats good, finding happy good things to do will cheer you up.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 00:43:44	@brokenmind_ can you do any of the classic distractions, that the crisis team suggest, or ring out of hours? Have you any hobbies?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 00:34:18	@brokenmind_ completely fall apart but in honesty your only hurting yourself further, and you dont derserve anymore hurt.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 00:32:55	@brokenmind_ what would that gain you apart from possibly more scars and a section if you lost control completely. I understand the need to
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 00:31:38	@brokenmind_ i think its a good idea, even if ur cpn isnt at fault the receptionist definitely is and deserves to be complained about.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 00:30:24	@brokenmind_ thats awful, surely they have her mobile to contact her and get her to just ring you, that receptionist sounds bloody awful.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 00:21:29	@brokenmind_ good luck hope you get through
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-17 00:18:32	@brokenmind_ hide the bottle and dont think about it, you know drink doesnt do you any good, can yountry phoning one more time?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 23:59:49	Suddenly had a wave of calmness overcome me, hope its not the calm beforemthe stop, either way im going to enjoy it whilst it lasts.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 23:35:59	Feeling so negative at the mo, dont want to bring anyone else down, thats not fair. Gonna stop tweeting for a while if i can :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 23:32:20	@brokenmind_ my cpn said when feeling awful or angry scared etc to do the oppisite, but its just not that easy.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 23:28:47	@brokenmind_ i dunno but i do it alot, :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 23:26:31	Havent moved much from my other bed the sofa today My sons been busy playin with toys on the floor Feel such a bad mum #bpd is destroying me

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 18:05:25	I feel so alone i need to talk to someone outside of the situation and who isnt a professional.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 16:56:07	I want to cry so hard this isnt fair
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 07:15:01	Think ive got another issue with esa not being paid again, i sent my fit note off, same time i sent my esa50 off, :( more stress.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 06:59:34	People wont get hurt and relationships wont get ruined.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 06:59:13	Hard for me and i see no way of it improving right now, so im blocking everyone i can out, they are safer from my explosive anger that way.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 06:58:31	Off cause they constantly change. I struggle with traumatic situations and i catashophize things but i know the worse could happen. Life is
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 06:53:39	I want to have friends, i want to have people around me but im too scare of being hurt. I might be denying myself friendships but i cant go
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 06:52:49	He stands by me thru everything, i push him away show allthe classic black and white bpd and still he stays. I dont understand it tho, why?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 06:51:30	I want to get better for my son and husband. I cant believe ive been married 6 years, most men would have run as far away as possible by now
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 06:18:28	Need to work thru the side effects got a pounding head ache, tho could partially be stress related.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 04:02:38	I want to cry but im fed up of crying
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 00:06:18	Is there anyway of cleaning ugg boots other than fabreeze, my feet stink after wearing mine, im not throwing them away still in good nick
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-16 00:04:38	@brokenmind_ my friend has that treatment regularly, they do it for punishment of bad behaviour and stick her on 1:1 shes just got off it.

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-15 07:11:06	Just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming. Gotta love Dory!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-15 06:51:05	Bad treatment, i deserve to be hated, hurt, abandoned. I have all my life thats why people have continuiosly done it to me.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-15 06:50:22	I spent ages psyching myself up to admit the truth and i feel kinda let down with the outcome, i know its the best outcome but i deserve
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-15 06:49:25	I told the truth today and half expected to be shouted at, bollocked, cpn reject me, but instead it was shrugged off kinda a is that it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-15 06:40:51	Id actually love to get picked to choose the balls for the lotto, then actually have a decnt win with those numbers. Oh i can dream!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-15 06:17:12	Its supposed to be a way of release without the dangers of self harm and suicidal urges, time will tell, hope to get it published one day!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-15 06:16:19	Writing this semi autobiography story is triggering but i can make the characters do what i want to do without me actually harming myself.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-15 04:12:31	Watching DIY SOS Children In Need always get emotional over these shows.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-15 03:50:23	A huge weight has lifted off of me, but still feel so shit.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-15 02:18:15	Saw cpn, she thinks everything is BPD based and is getting me a psychologist ready for the transfer of teams, and right therapy.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-15 00:17:10	No cpn yet still waiting said shed be here at 4, typically late
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 23:40:16	Shes supposed to be transferring me back to cmht but hasnt yet im sick of waiting Fuck it im discharging myself, and get gp to refer me back
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 23:38:47	Clearly not fucking worth seeing or being helped. Im going to lay into her when she fucking arrives This aint fucking on why is it always me
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 23:37:38	Her office is 30 mins away but she is on her way! Im fuming with her, not my prob shes busy and we arranged this appointment 2 weeks ago!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 23:36:08	Cpn rang 5 mins before appointment to rearrange, told her i need to see her and she got snarky with me cause shes busy! I mean wtf!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 22:30:06	I want a bottle of vodka just to drown myself in
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 22:26:53	Else wants to put the effort in to helping me. I cant do it alone. Im broken, i want to act onmy thoughts.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 22:26:10	Does, no one wants to be around me long, and now cpn wants to cancel i think ive just lost it all, i cant cope whats the point if no one
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 22:25:15	I went into a specialist mother and baby unit. No one cares at all about me, leave me to the side lines brush past me, abandon me evebryone
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 22:24:29	How reading stories of ill or hurt kids reduces me to a blubbering wreck so i now avoid it all. How my bond with my son was only made after
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 22:23:27	My head all that i can remember of it, due to be sedated. No body understands that i cant watch or read anything about pregnancy or birth.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 22:22:36	No ones ever asked me how i coped with my sons traumatic birth, why i dont want anymore children, how i replay the labour and birth over in
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:58:07	Missed a call from cpn wants to rearrange, argh i cant do it, it has to be today or never, gonna pretend i never got the voicemail!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:45:36	@brokenmind_ in my home its true but we do do curry sauce instead.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:44:43	@brokenmind_ i know, i love the crunchy bits too they are my favourite.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:43:47	Myself but that will leave me with no one and no help,
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:42:57	Feel like he didnt take my hub seriously when they spoke monday, clearly doesnt understand the downward spiral im in. Just want to discharge
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:41:45	Bloody typical, apparently if u go on to a mood stabiliser like carbamazepine now you need bloods done first. So im waiting and waiting ....
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:40:50	Lovely psych again said monday he would arrange a blood test for me with gp as he wanted certain tests done and ive heard nothing since
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:39:40	@brokenmind_ yep im in southampton and they stopped it years ago :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:33:27	Im really on edge at the moment, im close to breaking down, i hate this, just want today over with. Im a mess.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:26:51	Nobody cares about us, life isnt about living anymore its about being rich and powerful and there is nothing we can do about it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:24:53	Be run their way and no one elses. And yet those is major need have to fight fight fight for everything, we are trodden on and squished.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:23:37	Are getting together, life on this planet wont be killed by a asteroid it wil be by the hands of power mad dictators who feel the world shud
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:22:25	Have taken place this year. The gov are crippling the poor and wanting a society of no state payouts, high ranking people across the world
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:21:23	Maybe the world ending isnt in means of a catasphophic disaster, but in society and living as we know it, look how many fights and mini wars
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 21:03:56	I feel so anxious i want to run away and hide
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 20:05:19	In a foul mood.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 19:27:53	4 hrs to go till my cpn arrives, this is d day, im shitting it, if the worst happens then im fucked completely. I need help and need it now!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 07:29:29	@kezzy1975 thats good.

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 07:13:13	not looking forward to tomorrow but know its for the best.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 06:53:10	@kezzy1975 they are check the counsellor directory she may be on there, or type her name into google and see what pops up.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-14 03:11:33	These mood shifts are driving me nuts, one minute im ok the next im angry then sad, hate not being in control of my emotions.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 23:18:58	I hate this feeling and how others have made me feel consistantly over my life time!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 23:18:23	Blood test before i go on carbamazepine again, but ive had no call to arrange test. Feel like im worthless & untreatable, not worth seeing
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 23:16:53	Seeing cpn tomorrow, scared to see her worried of the outcome, want to complain that nothing gets done psych was gonna contact gp about >>
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 23:15:49	Feel like im cursed, like im meant to have constant shit all the time. Never any good, never get what i want.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 21:48:18	Royal mail is bloody shit, guess no post then today, im waiting on parcels, theyd better not been lost! I wont be happy!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 21:47:35	@brokenmind_ thats fab, baby steps, but im sure your not about to let a challenge defeat you!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 21:36:24	@brokenmind_ agreed, id love to work, just a shame that right now i cant, have u thought of doing a OU course or something like that?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 21:34:38	@Atomic_TS definitely!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 21:06:52	@littlemixremix im sure she will soon, xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 20:56:57	@littlemixremix i truely understand, it is very sad, but i dont think it will be forever. Xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 20:53:57	@littlemixremix the only friend who has ever cared is your sister!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 20:53:03	I seriously need to lose weight, still havent lost my pregnancy weight, its been a year now! Almost, and have added to it. Im so unhealthy!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 20:50:51	@littlemixremix i used to think that, now i have no friends because i got so fed up with them i walked away from them x
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 20:49:55	@Polarbear3127 unless ur on a cto i dont think ur legally obliged to take them.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 20:44:13	Hmm that double dose of chlorpromazine has left me whacked, not doing that again, dont care what my psych says!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 20:37:00	@Polarbear3127 if you relapsed which maybe likely it could result in a section if u were too unwell to go willingly.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-13 04:37:54	Bugger i really wanted that no fear hoodie, outbid right at last second grr

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-12 19:42:47	Truth will set you free right??

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-11-07 07:13:34	Nobody cares what u think feel they want to see you suffer 24/7 is what the voice in my head is screaming right now. Maybe i should listen..

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-29 19:24:04	My mental illness is like looking through cracked glass, the picture is still there just distorted now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-29 17:54:24	Bloody pissed off at myself and myforgetful brain. Forgot to ask about getting my notes plus other things i was gonna say. Psych was late 2!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-27 07:13:22	Should also go to GP about constant clicking of joints and pain in said areas. Fear being classed a hypochondriac :/ been months like this!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-27 07:11:04	Should probably go toss and turn for an hour before just dropping off to sleep and my baby boy deciding to whimper and waking me up!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-27 07:10:01	Friday Night Dinner is actually quite good
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-27 07:08:54	Just realised ive stopped smoking now 2.5 years.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-27 06:07:09	@unbalancedAbby yep keep knocking it, said bit more than ouch last night and the pain lasted for ages too :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-27 05:58:34	I used to be anorexic many years ago, since then my weight and size has gone the other direction. I just want stable moods and weight!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-27 05:55:19	My head hair is falling out yet my arm hair growth has increased fml, bald hairy thing!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-27 05:54:14	Have a big bruise on my arm from catching the door handle last night, really really hurts!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-27 02:36:10	So i phoned the psych in the end and was a 5 min call like i said it would be!! On Chlorpromazine low dose for now see how it goes.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-26 17:31:07	My sleep is so erractic, i go to bed just toss and turn and when i start to drift off my lil boy wakes up crying #fml still nothing from mht
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-26 04:36:41	Virgin Media are actually shit. I currently have no home internet, using 3g, hmm only been a customer less than a week!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-25 21:17:35	Geez it would prob only be a 5min call anyway.....
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-25 21:16:41	Still no call from the psych. Why cant i be normal what ever that is and not require such services. Failed by mental health services again..
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-25 19:01:23	Just reinforces the belief that im meant to experience hurt and abuse all the time. The only one consistant in my life is my hubby!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-25 18:20:35	@littlemixremix sorry i didnt reply last night i fell asleep. Am having a tough time at the mo, my feeling good didnt last long :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-25 05:21:16	If ur gonna do something or say ur gonna then bloody do it makes me lack faith in the professionals and they wonder why there r trust issues
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-25 05:19:39	Last thursday. Now psych hasnt called im feeling rather worthless and prob reacting in a proper bpd way but its darn annoying.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-25 05:18:24	Feeling really frustrated by psych, cpn phomed me to say he would call, and yesterday was angry that no body had since she requested it >>>
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-25 03:41:41	Sexist pig
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-25 00:20:28	Guess who hasnt called?

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-24 22:48:00	Psych is supposed to be ringing me at 4 30. Bets are on for what time he actually calls.......
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-24 22:47:01	@brokenmind_ fingers crossed for you that you get the leave you desperately want. X

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-22 21:09:56	I must have been so bad in a previous life to be enduring the suffering i am now. They say karma gets you eventually!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-22 21:08:41	Suicide is not an option for me. Every attempt would be thwarted/saved. Im meant to suffer at the hands of everyone!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-22 21:07:16	My punishment in life is to live death would be pleasureable and im not allowed anything good, just to be hurt and abused by everyone.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-22 21:06:05	Noticed my name is walking disaster yet my picture is a fish, the two dont go. Oh well oddness is my speciality.

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-22 21:03:40	And the shambles of mental health services if ur gonna say ur do something bloody well do it dont leave me hanging ha theres a pun there!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-15 19:18:00	Its stupid but the only reason i wont call my cpn is because im scared she will have me hospitalised. Not doing that again!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-15 19:14:28	Maybe the supply teacher years ago was right i bring it all on myself, its all my fault!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-15 19:13:49	Shouldnt be but i am sorry my social phobia stops me from doing socialable things
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-15 19:11:24	How the hell am i supposed to be a good role model for my son regarding forming friendships when hes gonna see his mum doesnt have any?

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-12 03:19:11	The time, wont look in the mirror hate myself so much. Understand abandonment and rejection so much more now. Social anxiety thru the roof!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-12 03:17:39	This depression has destroyed all creativity and motivation. Havent gotten dressed in 4 days, only eating one meal a day, want to cry all...

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-06 04:44:53	Looking through random peoples friends lists all the profile pics show happiness i feel so far away from it right now.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-05 18:25:39	Thats the last time i answer a withheld or private number!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-05 17:39:59	Omg
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-05 05:06:38	8 day headache doesnt seem to be disepating but by withholding pain killers am i inflicting pain on myself?

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-04 04:18:44	Guess who gets talked about lots but never actually spoken to with the respect she deserves. And people wonder why im so distrusting?!?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-04 04:16:57	Well thanks for asking, i'll be sure to remember the lack of!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-04 03:18:29	I dont like this feeling, very frightening its gone past that edge
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-04 03:17:00	Im scared
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-04 02:56:40	Well thats clear, i cant hack this anymore, i really cant im destroying everything
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-04 01:40:50	The trial begins....... If this doesnt work im officially untreatable and therefore fubar, heck i am already but seriously will be!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 23:29:24	An experiment tonight, i hope it helps something!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 23:27:22	Food for thought that last tweet.......
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 23:26:46	If i had a physical illness would you give me a get well soon card? Most likely! But i have a mental illness would you still give me a card?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 23:13:53	I dont care
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 21:12:10	@jannyj67 no a website called dailystrength, so horrid :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 20:53:49	Some woman has just real pissed me off over the missing girl, blaming the parent slagging them off gave her a right mouthful so judgemental
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 20:52:34	If u hadnt guessed im fucked off
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 19:30:55	Well its offical i have EUPD on paper and everything :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 18:10:37	Cant stop welling up thinking about April Jones i really hope she is found alive & well Cant begin to imagine what her parents r going thru
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 04:02:24	If i ever injure my left arm full of self harm scars to the point it needs amputating ill quite willingly let it go, hate those scars!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 03:59:23	Social anxiety has lost me many a friend but so has judgemental thinking, im alone its gonna stay that way.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 03:33:47	Why the hell even how can someone be jealous of me i mean seriously you'd want this existance? Id trade anyday if i could!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 03:32:10	Fucking mental
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 03:31:09	Cant get the image of driving a knife into my skull out of my head, its really scary and frightening.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 03:29:55	I must have been so evil in a previous life to be suffering this badly now
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 03:29:03	Havent felt so low in a long time and only have twitter for my venting as everyones judgemental on fb and i might just tell them to fuck off
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 03:27:51	Maybe its best though
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 03:26:47	Maybe its paranioa but that confirms things really in my eyes. Thanks ive done fuck all to anyone, that one idea wont leave my head........
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-03 02:36:10	Tired in dream i release mental anguish torments my soul waking bring much pain and hurt hatred and anger sworms my body destroying who i am
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-02 06:25:45	Think i need to cry, need to release but my body wont allow :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-02 06:21:00	If i was self absorbed and all me me me you'd probably like me more but cause im actually caring you walk over me instead.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-02 04:38:03	Think i have social anxiety disorder it fits me perfectly more so than bpd traits!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-02 04:14:42	Dont know where i stand in social norms, i dont drink smoke do drugs etc even the crazies dont want to know me :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-02 04:10:13	Pah well even if someone was reading my tweets they dont care, im ok its the same story ill always tell because no one will ever know me!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-02 02:54:10	Feel rough as hell, no one really gives a shit, im envied & hated for nothing thats my fault treated like shit for it too. Is not fair!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-10-02 02:51:23	5 days with a migraine still not over it, nice way to spend holiday from work.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-30 19:59:18	The past is a nice place to visit but certainly not a place to stay!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-30 04:04:48	Well Jackpot Joy thanks for the free £15 knew i wasnt going to win a penny from it though! #ripoffmerchants

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-30 00:39:34	i actually want to rip my head from my neck anything to stop this pain, it cant be a migraine cause i can look at the screen still!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-30 00:34:56	oooh sorry for having a fucking headache. the tv seriously doesnt need to be that loud!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-30 00:22:42	oh and it doesnt help when ur hubby is playing Skyrim up so loud it makes the surround sound vibrate the room!!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-30 00:21:57	this continuous headache/pain/electric shock sensation is gonna kill me, ive had enough of it!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-29 19:56:08	Well that just changed my mood!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-29 17:44:14	Woke up in a pissy mood. Fucked off with these head shock episodes i keep having!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-29 05:42:21	@brokenmind_ im guessing its something to do with breast cancer awareness there is a new one every year.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-29 03:48:34	It will never end, for madness carves its own reality.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-29 03:46:03	In decay of fallen madness, fear overrules the mad become the majority, run run for insanity is catching no one is safe not even you!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-28 17:00:42	Fat = resting ur iPad on ur stomach and the fat is able to open apps for you!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-28 05:44:15	Always nice when the one person who hope would be sympathetic isnt and seems fed up of the "moaning" despite knowing ur scared shitless!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-28 04:39:53	Ugh another brain attack episode
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-28 02:36:11	@brokenmind_ hope a&e can help you and you get the support you need xx
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 20:51:03	Tongue tied and twisted just an earthbound misfit!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 20:10:11	I have a neice and nephew ive never met, a nephew who probably doesnt remember me and although ive found pictures of them thats all i have!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 06:27:11	@littlemixremix dont worry looking young will be great when ur older, im 27 and still get id'd for alcohol!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 04:59:05	These brain shocks, the pain, dizziness dejavu episodes are tiring, gp wont do nowt i think its bpd stigma and attention seeking stigma!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 04:57:11	Is it too much to ask for some stability. I recognise somethings not right the lithium isnt doing anything. Gonna phone psych frustrated!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 04:54:30	Had a week of pure lovely mood i felt normal i felt like i want to feel all the time. This this is hell its not normal not me i dont want it
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 04:51:55	Fuck stupid bloody brain, why fucking why grr, all postivity all anything actually has gone out the bloody window. Moods completely crashed!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 03:30:18	The barriers are up as far as friendship is concerned. Fed up of hurt and trust being broken!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 03:28:09	@mentalpause35 its sad we deserve friendship as much as anyone else and deserve to be treated nicely too within the friendships.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 03:06:51	Im 27 and apart from my hubby and son i have no one. :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 03:05:03	I need to make new friends but dont know how :/
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 02:50:50	No one wants me as a friend anyway!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-27 02:38:24	Realising you actually have no proper friends...............
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-26 21:43:50	This may be triggering but worth a read for those who are suicidal especially the younger members of (cont) http:// tl.gd/jeag67
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-26 20:41:18	Small steps lead to big achievements!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-26 17:14:39	Dont mess with me today im seriously in bitch mode and i will not hold my tongue!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-26 01:04:31	Ive been a victim of stigma too often. Dont judge what you dont know. Live one day in my life before you dare critise me!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-26 01:02:26	Friendships are a constant battle with idealisation/devaluisation. Just cause i smile outside doesnt mean im ok inside im crumbling!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-26 00:59:57	I cant be mad... I hold down a job have a marriage/child seem to fit in society. Secret is i struggle with my job had to work at my marriage
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 22:57:57	I may not have the building i want for my home but i like my home, my family are crazy but i love the, and the friends i have are special!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 22:56:18	Dont expect me to change because u dont like something, ive spent my life changing who i am to please others now im letting me shine!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 22:55:08	Dont lie to me, im sick of being lied to sick of knowing im not worth the truth. In every aspect of my life at the mo people seem to lie!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 22:52:50	Some people just dont want to help themselves regardless of who it hurts!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 21:50:33	U have ur whole life ahead of you! But dont blink cause it will go fast & before you know it 10 years have passed with nowt to show for it!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 21:44:39	Being scared of enjoying something new stops people from doing new things making life changing choices. Uve made ur comfort zone too comfy!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 21:41:41	Help rejecting complainers!!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 21:41:04	Some people want to be just how they are despite claiming they want to change, they love the attention!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 21:38:30	What an boring existance! Pah so much i want to say but i know when to shut my mouth..... For the moment anyway!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 21:27:39	Grr some people annoy me on here!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 16:32:10	@Atomic_TS im a little teapot short and stout here is my handle and here is my spout!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 16:11:36	@Atomic_TS right okay!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-25 16:09:52	@Atomic_TS it dont it looks sunny!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 23:32:17	@littlemixremix aww sending cyber hugs for you!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 22:43:20	Looking forward to tonight!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 22:04:57	Remember you only live once this is your life do with it what you must but remember there are people out there dying for a life like yours!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 22:01:53	Regret nothing, learn from your mistakes, do what you love and love what you do!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 21:59:08	I want to go through life doing what i love and being happy getting to the end regretting nothing!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 21:57:37	I want the devil to know when im awake and think oh shit shes up!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 21:56:30	Every day is a new challenge a new way to stand up against the world and say yes im here im ready what ever you throw at me i will handle it
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 21:55:04	Treating yourself, self soothing is a way of nurturing your inner child, calming the anxious scared inside you. Comforting & caring for you!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 21:53:07	When your depressed or feeling low, doing some gentle exercise is fab. Skipping on the spot is a fav, just pretend you have a rope and jump!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 21:50:17	You are beautiful!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 21:48:52	Life isnt going to be easy but embracing each day with a positive attitude helps to lift the shadows of yesterday and make tomorrow do-able!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 21:46:08	If your progressing in something and someone tries to hold you back, they are jealous of your achievement & scared that they will be alone!!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 21:40:25	Just be you, anyone who doesnt like you for you isnt worth the friendship!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 21:39:52	Dont be fake because then everything is built on this fakeness and when u want to be you again, you cant!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 03:59:25	Noooo the poor groups!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-24 03:35:28	Wow

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-07 22:58:01	A disfragmented mirror the pieces a million and one, just wont fit back together.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-07 22:00:00	Maybe reading about my diagnosis will help me to understand it better and help my friends to understand why i behave the way i do. Hmmmm

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-07 00:40:44	Crazy isn't being broken, or swallowing a dark secret. It's you, or me, amplified!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-04 04:56:32	I know you think you understand what you thought I said but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-04 04:54:29	It is wise to keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-09-04 04:52:26	Holding on to anger is like holding a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one getting burned!!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-07-17 14:32:58	Woken up to seeing things clearer, true colours have been shown now. I was a fool to believe that things would be different.

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-07-14 05:45:28	In dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-07-14 05:44:18	The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with caution.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-07-14 05:43:54	To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-07-14 05:43:03	We must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-07-14 05:42:40	Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, when one only remembers to turn on the light.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-07-14 05:42:03	It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-27 04:39:39	@cackiesmum im glad you have the support. It can be lonely, the EDU might have a family/carers worker too who can support you.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-27 04:37:02	@cackiesmum if they feel she isnt benefiting for it.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-27 04:36:05	@cackiesmum i hope it will help her too. The PCT wouldnt have funded her if they didnt think she was ready for recovery and they can stop it
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-27 04:34:04	@cackiesmum going backwards but its part of the recovery process. Have you got support for you? Someone to talk to/off load?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-27 04:32:26	@cackiesmum with the psychological issues behind the ED and help her to challenge the ED thinking. She may fight it at times and seem to be
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-27 04:30:30	@cackiesmum change is very scary for ED's when its become a way of life and coping without it will be very difficult, the EDU will help her
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-27 04:28:58	@cackiesmum your very welcome. Its the anorexia that is doing it, shes torn between wanting to recover & the anorexia telling her she is fat
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-27 04:06:13	@cackiesmum very good things about it and it has a huge success. I wish you and your daughter all the best.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-27 04:05:09	@cackiesmum thats fab im so pleased for you. I hope your daughter gets the very most out of it. If she is going to cotswold house ive heard

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-25 04:19:44	Spoken less than 10 words to you ever and you make a judgement on me based on others opinions!? Charming!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-24 05:52:56	If you upset me even in the slightest ill hate you but an hour later you could give just a half smile & ill love you again! Splitting hurts!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-22 20:29:16	Now its just a case of waiting.......... Oh how i hate waiting!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-22 07:57:40	Always searching never finding :/

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-17 04:14:45	@cackiesmum thats fab news from what i hear PCT funding doesnt take too long. If they think she is going to recover they will fund.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-13 18:11:45	@cackiesmum the cmht should be helping. Can u contact the cmht manager and speak to them directly to find out why they wont help?
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-13 17:57:22	@cackiesmum if shes under 18 she wont but camhs should help. U could get her sectioned in regular psych ward then transfered.
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-03-13 03:13:17	Fed up with my cpn saying she'll do one thing then doesnt bloody do it & doesnt even communicate back to say why grrrr just let me struggle!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-01-11 20:18:42	She stands alone defending her name when all that she's done is be who she is well is it so wrong to be who we are?

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-01-11 05:30:45	Great I hate feeling like this, I thought it had gone. Yet right now Im back to square flipping one!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-01-09 05:10:27	Im starting to think a career as a psychologist/therapist is the way forward with photography as a hobby/part time career choice!!!

409341288	RayvenMental	2012-01-08 03:05:45	To rebuild you must first fall apart but glue may repair the break but cracks will still show!
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-01-08 02:07:11	Im seriously falling apart! Joints and muscles ache am constantly fatigued and have constant headaches :(
409341288	RayvenMental	2012-01-08 01:08:21	Could have got my tragus done today but chickened out as scared of the pain yet have been thru labour!! Go figure!!
