148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2015-11-27 18:42:40	@EE also will the online complaints form be removed - it's very frustrating to know the method I was told to complain with is defunct
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2015-11-27 18:40:32	@EE sure, how do I go about raising another complaint? Can I do it online at all?
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2015-11-27 18:33:07	@EE it's a very long complaint and the whole thing has been exhausting and anxiety ridden so submitting again feels impossible
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2015-11-27 18:32:30	@EE why is it that I was told to fill that form in to complain previously & it's on the website. Is there no way the info can be transferred
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2015-11-27 18:19:25	@EE I made a formal complaint online last Tuesday I've not had a response
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2015-11-27 18:16:36	@EE well I called a couple of times and they said it was going to be processed and they had sorted it but that was over a week ago
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2015-11-27 05:22:51	Still having trauma with @EE still no refund on my delivery charge and the online contact/complaint form is down #custserv #customerservice

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2015-11-09 19:03:48	@EE this seems a shambles now. I don't understand why service has been so poor and EE cannot locate their devices
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2015-11-09 18:56:45	@EE also the DPD number EE gave me this morning is only an automated system so I cannot get through to them either
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2015-11-09 18:55:59	@EE uunfortunately I already have and they advised they couldn't track the handset. The store number isn't being answered at all
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2015-11-09 17:25:19	And to add insult to injury I can't get through to the store it's meant to be at to find out if it's been delivered. Argh! #ee #badservice

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-10-08 01:17:43	@MancZombie I have had some bad reactions from my scarring from when my bipolar was bad, but now that people know
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-10-08 01:16:47	@MancZombie some do. To be honest it probably explains a lot of my behaviour to some people. Some people have been negative, but very few.
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-10-08 01:10:03	It's something that can be lived with an managed, but is serious and scary at times - being open about it saved me #BipolarAwarenessDay

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-15 05:42:04	Hey I just realised it's nearly my mental breakdown anniversary! Nearly a year since I was signed off work - crazy #bipolar
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-15 05:40:43	@John_Northants no not yet dammit. I'm going to invent the opposite of a heated blanket then I'll be fine
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-15 05:39:57	So that was a crap thing I did today. Love reliving my mental health history to judgemental healthcare professionals #doctors #mentalhealth
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-15 05:38:38	@Beard_face_bo in what way? For your soul/health?
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-15 05:38:05	Seriously they had no idea what they are from and they are 6 months old. Where's their MH awareness training now #selfharm #scars
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-15 05:37:19	And to make it worse the fuckjng receptionist made a remark about "what happened to your arm" on the way out. Nice training. #mentalhealth
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-15 05:36:14	Meeting with the Dr was a waste of time. Made me speak about my self harm only because he saw my scars not because it was relevant
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-15 05:35:02	@John_Northants I'm taking my skin off then

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-14 07:15:10	@Beard_face_bo I'm not sure. Probably because I scream at him to turn films off when I fall asleep for that reason
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-14 07:09:12	@Beard_face_bo to tell my partner we needed to buy ice hockey stickers for the car. Still to this day he mocks me. Fuck knows what I meant
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-14 07:08:58	@Beard_face_bo it could be an experiment. I fell asleep to mighty ducks and woke up during my dream
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-14 07:05:33	@Beard_face_bo that's good too!! I can't do that I end up dreaming about what I'm listening to and it gets weird!
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-14 07:03:42	@Beard_face_bo that's a good idea. A friend of mine listens to gardeners question time and that bores her to sleep!!
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-14 06:59:25	And work tomorrow, fun!
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2014-07-14 06:57:16	@Beard_face_bo normally I read the news until I doze off! I think it's because everything is quiet my brain goes into overdrive, x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-23 18:28:25	Ok so I did the right thing, but still feel sad. :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-23 18:27:51	@Aaronton yay! Did good come of it? x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:53:19	@brainsinajar @Aaronton I didn't cry at Bambi, but my Mum did, never seen Watership Down. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:48:13	@brainsinajar @Aaronton Beer is vile, football is boring, and cars are just...cars. Carry on with LOTR and crying :) x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:35:26	@DONJunior85 Yay! I like being talked to, by non-creepy people. I don't find you creepy! It would be perfect. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:34:02	@Aaronton @brainsinajar we won't judge you. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:33:07	@brainsinajar @Aaronton he's a complete douchebag. I don't care how nice his voice is. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:29:16	@Aaronton @brainsinajar I don't wanna cry :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:28:21	@brainsinajar @Aaronton oh god yeah, it will crumble you .x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:28:11	@Aaronton @brainsinajar It was a bit of both, good intentions with a power hungry fuel. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:27:55	@Aaronton @brainsinajar I cried at that D: x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:27:25	@DONJunior85 Yes, that is why, to convince you of my sincerity. :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:23:49	@brainsinajar Omg, I was just like I LOVE YOU MARLEY. Anyone who has a dog cannot not cry at that film. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:23:23	@Aaronton @brainsinajar it will make you sob, I don't cry at many films, and dear god...it's so sad. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:22:14	#imoldenough to not know any better :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:21:27	@DONJunior85 Well I didn't want to talk to this person, but his friend pretty much forced me to D: I WOULD TALK TO YOU :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:21:01	@brainsinajar @Aaronton Omg...Marley & Me is so sad D: x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:19:55	@Aaronton @brainsinajar you are so freaking adorable. Damn that Balrog. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:19:10	@brainsinajar @Aaronton I love it man, it's my favourite book ever, and the films are epic. WE AREN'T AFRAID TO SHOW OUR EMOTIONS! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:17:53	@DONJunior85 It's quite hard in bars though. Aww thank you. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:17:40	@Aaronton @brainsinajar I love LOTR, the end of Return makes me cry! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:17:15	@londonlipgloss @brainsinajar ahahahaha. I don't have any gems like that D: I even dated a skater boy at 16...god...x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:14:42	@brainsinajar Can we do that? We should. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:14:34	@Aaronton <3 x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:14:21	@londonlipgloss MCR I hated. Nirvana are incredible, I'm glad I went on to develop good taste in music. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:11:08	@Aaronton then I will stalk you. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:11:01	@DONJunior85 I discovered how hard it is to talk to really tall people whilst they are standing the other day. I could stand on a stool. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:09:58	@londonlipgloss @brainsinajar MCR Tees. I was more Kurt Cobain than that, and death metal. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:06:27	@Aaronton I think I love you for typing that as a response. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:05:58	@brainsinajar Same, man. Then I was a indie kid. Wrong wrong wrong. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:04:54	@brainsinajar I think about what I looked like at that age, I was vile, it is most wrong. Everyone should experience teenage awkwardness. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:01:51	@DONJunior85 I would only come up to her knees. She's so adorable and awkward, I'd just stare at her. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 07:01:27	@brainsinajar Same, she looks like 18, tall and slim. No awkward teenage years. We should fix this. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 06:55:12	@DONJunior85 I love her <3 x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 06:54:57	@brainsinajar Murder for slutty cousins. Or like...jail. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 06:51:36	@brainsinajar Same, but mine is 15, and hates fat people for no reason. And catholics. I feel for you. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 06:47:58	@DONJunior85 not yet, I'll watch it tomorrow. Is it good? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 05:39:08	@helen_xxxx Because men are useless unfortunately, and also arseholes. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 05:35:27	my dog is chasing a bone bigger than her head round the living room. It is very very adorable. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 05:34:12	@helen_xxxx what have they done to you :( ? x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 05:23:39	Someone cut my hair. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 05:13:17	I need the anniversary Urban Decay liner set, but I can't afford it :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 05:04:14	A team time :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 04:56:19	@helen_xxxx my friend had a spare ticket to go a few weeks ago but I couldn't make it. Gutted, the album is so so good! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 04:53:29	The Little Comets album is amazing. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 04:23:11	@londonlipgloss you hate hipsters, I love you. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 04:21:33	I am going to turn my friend into a red head tomorrow :D excited. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 04:04:51	I need someone to shave the side of my head :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 03:52:05	I have always wanted to shave my head...x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 02:56:48	@DONJunior85 Maybe. Might go busking soon. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 02:47:43	@DONJunior85 I do :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 02:43:51	I wish I could write amazing lyrics. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 02:32:31	@DONJunior85 Quite tired, but otherwise alright. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 02:07:03	@DONJunior85 the texture. Yuck. How are you? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 01:45:07	@DONJunior85 yes, even though I don't like them. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 01:09:06	@Aaronton @brainsinajar We can't train to be Cesar Millan :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 01:06:10	Every food should come in nugget form. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 01:00:31	@Aaronton @brainsinajar I think so, but I doubt they have a psychology degree but instead an animal behaviour one. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:53:16	@Aaronton @brainsinajar Psychology must have taught me something about brains! Yay being able to do stuff. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:50:50	@brainsinajar @Aaronton I CAN HELP WITH THE SKULL THING. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:46:46	@brainsinajar @Aaronton That would be useful! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:41:28	@Aaronton @brainsinajar I am, they wouldn't give me a degree in Hayley Studies :( Don't worry psychology is made up too. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:40:06	@brainsinajar @Aaronton What the fuck is that, that sounds like a made up course. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:39:33	@brainsinajar @Aaronton Ahahahahaa. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:25:52	@brainsinajar @Aaronton THAT IS THE DREAM <3 X
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:23:25	@brainsinajar @Aaronton Beautiful amazing bullshit. I should do this. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:20:37	@brainsinajar @Aaronton and I have psychology, so imagine the bullshit reasons I could put with it. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:15:11	@Aaronton @brainsinajar Maybe, fuck this degree, I'm going to do art ;) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:09:21	@Aaronton @brainsinajar I bet I can :D also N'AWWWWW. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-22 00:05:00	@brainsinajar @Aaronton I don't care that much. I'm probably going to get a 1st instead ;) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-21 23:59:03	@brainsinajar Not proper research, but it counts for something. Better than gluing stuff. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-21 23:49:38	@brainsinajar Disgraceful. Fine art is bollocks, they just glue shit to walls and make up crap reasons for it. At least we research. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-21 23:45:16	@brainsinajar We still get a science degree somehow! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-21 23:34:13	@brainsinajar My timetable was busy 1st year but I am 3rd year now so I am barely in. Physics is a proper subject though :p x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-21 23:18:01	@brainsinajar Also I do psychology, it's a fake subject. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-21 23:17:46	@brainsinajar That sucks. I am only in around...8 hours a week anyway. What year are you in? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-21 23:17:17	@GeorgeBray The Cock pub in Northampton has a charming car wash they cleverly named the Cock Wash. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-21 23:15:09	@brainsinajar Yep, apparently it's dissertation week, but I have one tutor who never cancels lectures. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-07 08:53:08	@Aaronton @brainsinajar that is how the superbowl should be. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-07 08:48:20	@Aaronton @brainsinajar I'm sure it's exactly like that. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-07 08:45:49	@brainsinajar @Aaronton they have different music for the teams, music if there is an elongated pause and a banana mascot. Amaze. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-07 08:28:09	@Aaronton @brainsinajar I am praying this pizza will get me through the rest of this awful experience. Stupid americans. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-07 08:12:44	@DONJunior85 Yeah I presumed the latter but not the first. I hope not a combo of the two, that would be most odd. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-07 08:08:06	@Aaronton Yeah it's horrible. I am doing uni work at the same time, it helps. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-07 08:04:34	@Aaronton it is odd. They stop and start so much it sort of just makes it awful. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-07 07:53:33	@Aaronton Fun times. I hate how the clock always stops in this game. I could be in bed before 1am if it didn't. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:47:39	@Aaronton I do! I have it on wii and xbox. Xbox is better though. I'm always up for air guitar. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:45:47	@brainsinajar My dog eats spiders, but jar opening is a good one. Oh and sex. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:45:26	@Aaronton Sure man. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:45:19	@BronwenPhoenix I have no insight into romantic relationships when I am involved. I just presume everyone hates me!! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:44:37	@brainsinajar What is wrong with them. I hate them, but they are warm and their height is useful to me. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:43:34	@Aaronton Hahahaha, that is exactly what friends do! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:43:17	@NizInFrance I'm sad :( I can't seem to cheer up. My douchebag ex Jaime is talking to me, I hate it, it brings back everything. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:42:03	@BronwenPhoenix Good :) Love has fucked me over lately, it's not good. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:41:30	@Aaronton thank you. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:40:07	I want to eradicate #7millionbeliebers but they all have beiber fever, and that kills. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:38:33	Why do the men in my life like to just be ARSEHOLES, and then epically nice. Idiots. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:38:03	@Chris_McB hahaha Coronation Twitter Street, what is that!! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:37:20	#ifyouonlyknew that I will probably always have feelings for you, despite the fact you broke my heart. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:34:41	@BronwenPhoenix Who said all this rubbish?! That's just fucking rude. Bless you :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:32:30	@BronwenPhoenix I can be your online friend? What's up? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:31:51	Oh and now my ex is online. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:31:25	I need a friend :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:21:53	it's really windy outside. Scary. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:20:39	@DONJunior85 Not one of my finer moments. I'm all about the symmetrical asymmetry, so you'd have to have the opposite leg off :) hot. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:15:32	@DONJunior85 Seriously, check that arm in the morning, or they'll chop it off. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:15:14	@DONJunior85 haha I did that once with my foot. I went to the shop, drove to work, slept there, then drove myself home before going to A&E x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:08:25	why did I just weigh myself again #insane x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:08:15	@DONJunior85 Bless! That sounds awful. It might be the size of a balloon in the morning! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:03:05	@NizInFrance I know. I know a girl who looks through boyfriend phone and fb. So fucking crazy. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:01:57	@NizInFrance It's not exactly attractive. I don't know why they think it is. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:01:07	@NizInFrance I know. The arsehole ones are just ANNOYING. urgh. I don't get why they do it!! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 08:00:08	@NizInFrance I know. It's horrid, he's a nice guy, but he just doesn't get it. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:59:32	@DONJunior85 Green! That is not good! :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:59:08	@NizInFrance creepers are terrifying. Mine keeps coming back, even after telling him twice. I saw him out, he kept trying to hug me, urgh. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:58:15	@NizInFrance @the_only_cam That is really horrid. :( I am not surprised, I know how creepers can be. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:55:48	@NizInFrance @the_only_cam that is vile. I'd bleach him in the night and then set man eating ants on him. And then set him on fire. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:54:28	@NizInFrance @the_only_cam I would have never gone out again. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:53:44	@NizInFrance @the_only_cam WTF, restraining order. I had a creeper after he literally observed me in the pub for 10 minutes. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:51:29	@DONJunior85 What!!? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:49:17	@Aaronton @NizInFrance @the_only_cam he does, but in his pants. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:49:03	@the_only_cam @NizInFrance I wish there was some way to prevent them. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:44:27	@the_only_cam @NizInFrance I attract them too, creepers are a special breed, attracted to the nice, and slightly crazy girls. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:42:05	@NizInFrance @the_only_cam Creepers are damn persistent :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:34:40	@NizInFrance Urgh, I'm glad you've told him. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:34:08	@NizInFrance you having creepers again? #creepingonyourtweet x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-04 07:31:24	I just went to a jam night. I sang a bit, in public on the mic. Scary. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 19:21:31	I can't move out of bed, I know it's cold out there. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 19:00:26	#ifyouonlyknew how much I loved you. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 18:57:58	I need someone to come snuggle in bed with me between the hours of 10 and 2 when the heating goes off. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 18:39:22	omg, I'm ill. Feels like some small mammal is sleeping in my brain. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 09:23:49	Sleep time. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 09:12:25	@Aaronton Some people. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 09:08:13	@Aaronton he's also exceptionally nice. That just makes it worse. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 09:07:46	@NizInFrance Omg. Who are they for :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 09:04:23	@NizInFrance SONGS. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 09:03:39	@Aaronton I know man. Get this, grade 8 in piano, and self taught from the age of 12. Plays the accordion too now, he is in-sane x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 09:00:35	@Aaronton true. He is ridiculously talented. Two classical grade 8 awards and a grade 7. Ridiculous. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:56:32	@Aaronton it did have no windows though. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:52:03	@Aaronton nice. I never used ours. My friend now works in the music department at the 6th form. He has an amazingly musical office! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:45:33	@Aaronton My 6th form was awesome for music. We used to have to sneak into the hall to play the piano at my school before that. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:37:02	@Aaronton Haha, I remember practice rooms. My mate is a grade 8 pianist so we used to have epic fun! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:32:45	@Aaronton then we would go and chase the cows in the field next door :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:32:29	@Aaronton Lol, I love that. God we used to play band in my friends stables, he was damn rich. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:27:22	@Aaronton nah jack of all trades, master at none! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:25:43	@Aaronton Not really. Jack of all trades. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:20:53	since @Aaronton since we are doing random musical histories, I shall do mine! I have been in choirs since I was (cont) http://tl.gd/8ig6bb
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:17:46	@Aaronton Shit. Didn't last long, guitarist and bassist didn't drive which was handicapping and my drummer is hard to get hold of! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:14:37	@MizzWorthy I'm sure you will, you seem to have your head screwed on. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:12:45	@MizzWorthy There is a lot to be said for just manning up and dealing. You have to do the upset thing too though or you go crazy. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:11:58	@Aaronton aha, see my drummer actually sucked and was hard to get hold of, he also stole his friends drum kit. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:08:11	@Aaronton YAY drums. Are you incredibly hard to get hold of. I went through a few drummers when I had a band, they are elusive as fuck. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:06:12	@MizzWorthy Then the only way is up. Sometimes we hit rockbottom, and it's shite, but at least the only way is up. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:03:35	@Mcruxboy :D hello, how are you? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:03:21	@helen_xxxx That's silly. Surely then they'd be bored and move on. It's always stupid games man! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 08:02:24	@Mizzworthy you have to be pissed off for a while, it is the rules. I am more than sure you will be fine, it is (cont) http://tl.gd/8iftfv
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:59:54	70 followers!! HELLO :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:59:04	@helen_xxxx Haha, I am just awkward to a stupid extent. Then if they do like me, I run away. Ridiculous! Soppy is adorable. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:58:27	@MizzWorthy Ah yes, I saw that. Not cool I hope you are ok. Men suck to an extreme extent. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:56:40	@helen_xxxx I'm doing the whole "but does he like me" thing. I have no insight into these things! How are some girls so damn collected. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:50:33	why am I so useless with men the minute it moves beyond the friendship zone. :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:42:21	@Aaronton Dear god. That was awful. Me-sa Jar Jar...SHUT THE HELL UP FISH BOY. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:37:13	@Aaronton bastard...absolute bastard. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:33:43	@JamieSkelton AHA. See like that. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:30:13	@NizInFrance @the_only_cam nothing wrong with the shorties. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:28:22	@Aaronton Some are unofficial. I know Crocasaurus is by the megashark company though. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:27:35	I make Morrissey jokes hoping someone will understand them, I know they won't :( #wastedpuns x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:19:19	@Aaronton O.m.g. Excited. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:14:46	@Aaronton Damn I'll have to torrent it tonight. It looks amazing. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:09:30	@Aaronton yeah, it's the sequel :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:05:17	@Aaronton I just have to say...that film is beyond amazing. I can't wait to see mega shark vs crocasaurus. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 07:03:04	@DONJunior85 Yay misery. I came to the conclusion if I'm going to be miserable, I'll at least be thin. It wasn't one of my best decisions. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:59:48	@NizInFrance YAY :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:53:58	@DONJunior85 Aren't you like a million feet tall though. I have strict goalposts. Bit miserable having to move them again. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:53:09	@goldntonsils Lol see I find the opposite! It's a case of wanting what we can't have! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:48:54	@goldntonsils I'm short though, so petite jeans for some reason are sized smaller in general which makes no sense!! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:46:16	@goldntonsils See it just depends. I have trouble as I am between sizes so I have to either go big or muffin top! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:43:12	@goldntonsils it depends on the shop. Topshop is ridiculous for it. Don't go drastic, honestly, it's a slippery slope. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:39:04	@goldntonsils Yeah I am loads of different sizes. 12 isn't big though!!! The difference between a 10 and an 8 is ridiculous though. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:36:17	@DONJunior85 CHANGE. Shhhhh. I'm sleep deprived and sick. I also might move the goal posts once I change them. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:34:23	@goldntonsils What size are you now? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:32:16	I want to be, anarchy. Plsthxkbai x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:31:49	@goldntonsils Be careful though and listen to your body. It's easy to get carried away with it all and weight loss is not worth that. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:29:47	@NizInFrance Ahaha nice. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:29:21	@goldntonsils God you are tall. So around 1500-1700. But it is miserable and soul destroying calorie counting. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:26:55	@goldntonsils What's your height? I'd say between 1300-1700 depending on your activity and age. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:23:10	@goldntonsils To be honest, not in a healthy way. The easiest but soul destroying thing is calorie counting then you can eat what you like x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:21:02	@NizInFrance Hahaha. Doodling is the way to learn evidently :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:18:30	@DONJunior85 Thanks. One lb until I get to 8.7 then it's on the 'home run'. I'm scared I'll get there and change the goal posts though :/ x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:16:57	@NizInFrance I don't even bring a notepad anymore, I just doodle on it. I'm a crap 3rd year, no sense of urgency. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:16:04	@NizInFrance god if I ever had any of the stuff for my seminars I think my tutors would faint. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:14:43	I have officially lost 21lbs. Only 8lbs to go until big goal :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 06:09:52	Hello twitter, how are people this evening? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 05:42:40	Also I realise it is secretly Ukraine, but 1. Russia sounds better 2. it was part of the epic union of soviet dealings. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 05:42:08	Why shouldn't you wear Russian underwear? Chernobyl Fallout. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 05:41:20	My eyes feel like they might fall out. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 05:16:59	@NizInFrance It's onset is so sudden. I am cursing lots. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 05:16:39	@MarriedtotheMoz Yes I know! every time I've stretched I seem to be shocked by the healing related itch though. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 05:09:44	@MarriedtotheMoz I've tried. Still itchy :( It's just what it does, I seem to forget that it needs to heal and thus the itch returns. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 05:07:14	@NizInFrance Good. But seriously, I'm going to die of itchiness. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 05:05:50	@londonlipgloss I did! It's very good :) . This is AWFUL though. I stretched up again a few days ago, dear god, it itches. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 05:05:17	my ear, it itches. I've cleaned the bastard, but it won't stop. WHAT MORE DOES IT WANT FROM ME. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 05:02:02	Omg, my ear is so fucking itchy, damn stretching. Arghhh x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 04:56:49	@DONJunior85 ahaa, sex puns. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 04:00:28	@_Grey Yeah I guess so. May I ask what sort of stylist you are? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 03:56:37	@DONJunior85 Only if I get it tattooed in mirror image. I think I'm going for lower hip/side area. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 03:55:42	@_Grey Thanks. I've always wondered, because I'm scared that as much as I want my arms tattooed, that I might miss out on jobs. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 03:54:11	Ok, now I have decided where to put it, I'm dead excited for this tattoo. Hurry up March. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 03:50:04	@DONJunior85 I can't pull off an arse tattoo anyway. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 03:35:52	@_Grey you said you were moderately tattooed, has this ever effected your ability to get work? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-02-03 03:34:59	@DONJunior85 I would, but it's not easily covered. I need somewhere I can essentially hide it. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-25 06:21:29	@londonlipgloss Cheers. I've started stretching mine but I'm not sure how big to go with mine. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-25 05:40:12	@Aaronton it's better than her singing again. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-25 05:36:58	@Aaronton it has that woman from SClub7 in. That gives me some cheap lols. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-25 05:28:04	@Aaronton I know but I can't be bothered to change it. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-25 05:14:21	I'd forgotten about primeval, x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-25 05:07:18	@londonlipgloss out of interest, how big is your ear stretched to on your photo? x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-25 04:46:27	@goldntonsils it hurts a little, but nothing unbearable. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-25 04:45:40	@helen_xxxx Not very, less than waxing, about the same as plucking. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-25 04:45:23	@DONJunior85 it helps tame unruly eyebrows. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-25 04:44:18	@goldntonsils It's better than waxing/plucking. It's a little sore, but mine look nice, they didn't make them too thin, just tidy :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-25 04:41:05	I had my eyebrows threaded today, its a very odd experience. One I evidently thought I should share with you. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-24 05:22:56	I was a douchebag at 14. I spelt cutest 'cyootest' WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-24 04:47:25	#Iwantyouto dump her and come see me ;) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-24 04:43:54	@DONJunior85 True but stalkers are quite creepy in general as they are stalkers, so regardless of their sexiness may still be unappealing. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-24 04:37:05	@DONJunior85 Ahh, that's ok then. Unless you like being stalked, but then being rid of her wouldn't be good. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-24 04:33:42	@DONJunior85 I thought you'd already lost her? Or do you have lots! #MrPopularity x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-24 04:05:22	@brainsinajar Yeah it's ridiculous. I hate it, but at the moment it seems to make epic sense. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-24 03:52:03	@brainsinajar It's ridiculous. It makes no sense at all. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-24 03:50:13	@DONJunior85 I am, it's ridiculous. I look like a big fat heifer. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-24 03:46:00	I have no idea why I think being thin will fix everything, but I feel like it will and at least if it doesn't, I'll be thin. I'm insane :( x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-23 20:37:28	@DONJunior85 Funny :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-23 20:34:37	@DONJunior85 it's just the gangsta way of speaking, missing letters out and stuff is dead hardcore. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-23 20:34:09	@DONJunior85 The attic might hold something that does. More likely it holds vinyls that can't be played. Sad times on #vinylsunday x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-23 20:29:26	@DONJunior85 Ahh I understand now. That seems like a huge part of the week to be 'gangsta' x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 18:17:16	@DONJunior85 I messed my voice up singing drunk karaoke. Nothing sounds right :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 08:27:44	@brainsinajar I had long hair, but I looked like Brian May. It wasnt good. It's just hair though, it grows back! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 08:15:11	@brainsinajar I can't grow mine, I'm too inpatient! Mine is frizzy and curly when longer too :( short hair is also healthy! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 08:09:23	@brainsinajar lol! Mine is a little shorter now but, I love the short hair, it's easy. Long hair you can do pretty things with though! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 07:59:30	Happy Saturday!! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 07:59:17	@brainsinajar bleach is a killer unless you want a pixie cut every time. I'm sure it will be fine, hopefully! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 07:57:48	@brainsinajar my hair bleached out to bright orange this time but I was lucky the dye covered!! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 07:56:39	@brainsinajar same. You will have to grow the henna out unfortunately. Start back at brown and just work up the levels gradually instead! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 07:55:30	@DONJunior85 I keep trying to record new YouTube videos too, but I can't do that either :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 07:53:53	@DONJunior85 I wish I could get a good one. Maybe I'll try tomorrow :) it's nice and pink! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 07:46:33	@DONJunior85 good, I wouldn't like to hear of any burnt body parts. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 07:44:53	@brainsinajar did you say you use henna? You can't bleach that out :( I'm sure you'll look fine dark, but I'll mourn for your copper hair. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 07:28:55	@brainsinajar don't do it!! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 07:02:44	Black Swan was epic if triggering. It is a stunning film. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 07:01:18	@DONJunior85 I've burnt my ears a few times, it's very unpleasant. Yeah they tend to be less hot. I guess that's good if you are clumsy!! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 03:54:23	That drunk rendition of War on Tuesday has crippled my voice completely! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 03:53:44	@DONJunior85 maybe their fingers, toes and ears as they don't open enough to grab arms. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 03:52:58	@DONJunior85 it's worth getting decent ones. Cheap ones go scummy. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 02:46:13	@DONJunior85 also, Cloud Nine's are apparently good and they are a lot cheaper than GHD's. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 02:44:41	@DONJunior85 You might have found another purpose for them, like...toasting sandwiches. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-22 02:44:01	@DONJunior85 GHD's! x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 08:30:33	@_Oodledoodle I know how sucky it is. I was with someone for years, we'd had feelings for each other forever, and now he's vanished! :( x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 08:24:49	@_Oodledoodle I know that feeling. If it is meant to happen it will, but you just have to be careful. We all have one of those I think :( x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 04:36:22	@MizzWorthy sounds good. Semipermanents are the best for bright colour. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 04:13:16	@MizzWorthy yes I think so. If you would risk it, you could bleach shampoo it then put the colour on. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 03:48:47	@Mizzworthy Mine is over really light blue from my last dye job. I used to use a semi perm colour called Napalm (cont) http://tl.gd/89aq4g
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 03:42:06	@MizzWorthy you can see Vermillion in this video. It's more orange than it looks, but you get the idea http://youtu.be/4Kd1eJqR5xQ x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 03:35:06	@MizzWorthy I did use it, I think my pic is Pillarbox Red, which is more pink based. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 03:31:56	@MizzWorthy I'd really recommend Directions Vermillion Red, it's very orange based. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 03:23:22	@NizInFrance An ironic one? Maybe I should. Or a moustache. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 03:22:04	@NizInFrance Hahahahaha, it IS. I am like one wrong fashion move to being a hipster. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 03:20:57	I'm a dickhead. It's fucking amazing. Also @NizInFrance is amazing. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 03:20:39	@MizzWorthy I'd whack a semi-perm colour over that, it will bring out the red really nicely. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-21 03:18:42	@NizInFrance I had to comment, sorry. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-20 02:42:29	hahaha mother told me my ear stretch won't go back. I'd be more fucking worried about those tattoos. She is most confusing at times. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-20 02:29:12	@DONJunior85 Exactly. If I am allowed to flash my upper thigh and stomach at work, they aren't going to give a shite. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-20 02:25:50	In better news, I have Pepsi Max. This is good. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-20 02:24:27	You can't even see my tattoos normally! If I can wear a bikini to work I don't think they will care about tattoos. ffs. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2011-01-20 02:22:40	Apparently with a nose and ear piercings and tattoos, I won't get a job. wonderful. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 10:00:31	xfactor and shows like it have bred IDIOTS who appreciate crap music. Stupid shows. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:59:30	@AaronAndYou I know, but 16 seems so long ago. I will be graduating soon, and when I was 16 I was just starting AS...seems so long ago! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:58:40	I found this on the #2010memories .....AWFUL!! DAMN YOU XFACTOR: iRock1Direction: #2010memories becoming a fan of One Direction.<3
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:55:07	@AaronAndYou Nope. 4 years man. I feel OLD. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:54:26	if I could learn Back to the Old House on guitar, I could die happy. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:53:46	@AaronAndYou that doesn't count! I'm 21 in 6 months but it doesn't make me 5 years older. Cheater. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:52:24	@AaronAndYou I'm 20, it says you are 16 that makes 4 years! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:52:03	why am I not asleep. I hate insomnia...x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:51:35	@DONJunior85 Good night. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:51:27	@AaronAndYou youth! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:49:20	@AaronAndYou Damn the youth of today! Cd's are superior in all forms. It's just not the same downloaded. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:47:11	@DONJunior85 It's not as sore. Just stinging. It could be because I have my glasses on and not my contacts. It's nearly 2am. urgh. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:46:43	@AaronAndYou There is nothing like buying a cd and the joy when you first get to play it. Mmm heaven. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:44:23	@AaronAndYou Artwork, cd covers, booklets, the cd itself, having it to hold and to keep instead of just a file on a computer. <3 x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:43:55	@DONJunior85 Sore. It's not good. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:42:00	@AaronAndYou no way man. Get C.D's physical copies of music are far superior. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:41:37	@DONJunior85 You didn't. It just does suck. It seems easy, but it's not. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:38:52	@AaronAndYou no way man! Buy cd's they are amazing. It's the only way. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:38:26	@DONJunior85 Nah, it's crap as you just think about food all day, or sleep and ruins your ability to digest food. Not cool! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:29:12	might blog an end of year post...x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:28:50	God I miss sleeping. So damn bad. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:26:37	@DONJunior85 that is true, but I am horribly unfit, that's why I don't eat, it's easier than exercising. Damn that's lazy. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:20:27	@DONJunior85 Nice. Fingers crossed then ;) but then I'd have to run. That seems hard. Harder than just sitting here and doing nothing. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:17:40	Could it be I like you...you're not right in the head and nor am I and this is why, this is why I like you. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:15:59	@DONJunior85 it could have been. Yeah but I'm not going to really walk, maybe I should train for it. Might be good for me. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:12:26	@DONJunior85 I think I promised my uncle I'd run the 2012 marathon...damn wine. Good times though, swim swim. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:08:32	@DONJunior85 why would you do that? sounds silly, and active. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:05:14	@DONJunior85 Nah, I'll be fine, it's above freezing. Plus my hair would be a mess, no state for meeting anyone. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 09:02:28	@DONJunior85 it's cool. I can swim. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:58:45	@DONJunior85 nah, also, it takes a 100 years on the ferry. I might walk. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:56:34	Belfast sucks, someone come get me. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:36:44	Stop. NEW ORDER TIME. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:27:31	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx Strangling or early finish, great choices. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:19:13	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx it's quite horrific considering the best offer is 2 minutes. This tweetup is definitely off. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:18:30	@DONJunior85 @Chris_McB @helen_xxxx who are you trying to convince? Us or yourself? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:16:01	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx Sex hour. I would do the men finish first thing, but you know, it's been done now. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:12:42	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx ok we must have a watershed on our minds, it hits midnight and the sexual banter emerges...x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:12:18	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx they can't finish anything right. ;) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:09:05	@Chris_McB @helen_xxxx @DONJunior85 lies, not bullies. Just brilliant and beautiful. You started this, we are just finishing it. ooer... x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:06:17	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx this is not bullying, THIS IS BULLYING. See the difference; caps lock. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:03:43	@DONJunior85 @Chris_McB @helen_xxxx of course, :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:03:31	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx but can you make a spectacular come back? I think not. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:01:40	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx fucking North. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 08:01:25	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx Sexism. Big man. Trust he'd be in the kitchen judging the levels of manliness displayed earlier. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:59:27	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx Fuck that man, you just admitted defeat. Not cool. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:57:02	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx he doesn't care, he fuelled the fire and can't cope with the burn. Dis-a-pointing. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:53:23	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx If you can't keep the pace, don't dip it in. It just leads to everyone being disappointed. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:50:47	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx dip it in and run, when do you go home and cry to yourself? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:50:07	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx Man up banter boy. You started all this. You couldn't handle a tweet-up. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:45:27	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx Like a sex offender kit, complete with underage child and cameraman. #toofar ? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:44:31	@Chris_McB I was going to mention that. Win all round. Except I'm not a child so surely, not appealing? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:43:43	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx damn, I'm actually 13. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:42:06	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx do you just use it to lure in young children? Or is it one you lured in earlier? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:41:42	wow, @SuicideGirls did an interview with Genesis P-Orridge, I'm impressed. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:40:14	@Chris_McB @DONJunior85 @helen_xxxx Photoshop does wonderful things, it also stops the police catching him. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:39:32	@Chris_McB I am sorry for dashing your tweet up hopes. I'm going to be blind by the morning anyway. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:37:58	@Chris_McB @helen_xxxx @DONJunior85 this just sounds bleak, on many many levels. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:37:04	@DONJunior85 I got it in both...x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:35:50	@Chris_McB So tweetups. So the awkward conversation you get with internet dating, with no sex to make up for it? You see why I am dubious. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:32:48	@DONJunior85 this would have to be some acidic jizz. I might be blind in the morning. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:32:29	@DONJunior85 @Chris_McB @helen_xxxx Or we'd all be fat aging pedophiles. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:31:23	@DONJunior85 I don't think jizz would burn as much. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:30:58	@Chris_McB @helen_xxxx @DONJunior85 Internet dating is tragic. If you don't get sex, what on EARTH is the point. Tweetup...seriously? wtf. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:28:56	@Chris_McB No sex. I'm out. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:28:39	@helen_xxxx @DONJunior85 @Chris_McB The next level, of what. Loneliness? Seclusion? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:27:59	@DONJunior85 Oh you have a dodgy wrist from wanking too much. I forgot. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:26:37	@NicelyNeurotic @helen_xxxx @DONJunior85 what the fuck is a tweetup. Sounds fruity. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:26:13	@Chris_McB I fucking love the term Twitter four-way. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:25:27	@DONJunior85 Damn. Current? Probably my dissolving eyes, but I have a sea of black bruises on my leg from going out. I think you win. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:24:53	@Chris_McB @helen_xxxx @NicelyNeurotic twitter ruined my life in the real world, thus, I know no one. At all. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:23:21	@DONJunior85 I just whacked my knee on the door too. Injury top trumps? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:22:06	@Chris_McB It's that what Twitter was invented for? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:18:40	ok so that moisturiser I got in my eye is slowly eating away at them, I'm going to be more blind in the morning than usual. Fuck. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:17:49	@DONJunior85 Aha, that's good. I managed to get moisturiser in my eye, I think it is blinding me...not good...not good at all. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:16:34	@Chris_McB What constitutes an indie person? I'm not sure I fully qualify. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:13:27	@DONJunior85 haha. This place is crazy. The chippy though is called Cod Almighty and opposite a church. Amusing. Still no place like home. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:12:38	I am nothing like my family, none of them. That makes me feel very very odd. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:11:12	@Chris_McB Dirty fucking indie kids :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:10:34	@DONJunior85 Better than Belfast. My cousin said catholics pronounce the letter "H" differently. I need to go home, so bad. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:05:49	@DONJunior85 Nah, no transport. Boo. I am doing that tomorrow at home :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:03:08	@DONJunior85 stop showing off, mine leave me :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:02:55	I never realised Paramore were such God people. For some reason that puts me off even more. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 07:02:14	@DONJunior85 Yes. Most annoying. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:56:09	it gets to around 11pm and twitter dies...it's very bizarre and annoying as I don't sleep! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:51:39	Bieber, sorry, I'm pretty sure no one cares though. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:51:16	Justin Beiber is a sin. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:48:17	I just got moisturiser in my eye. I fail at life. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:47:03	@AaronAndYou That's good, I increase awkwardness by speaking too much. It's fantastic. I would hate to be 16 again...poor soul :p x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:44:22	@AaronAndYou Oh my gosh I am weird beyond belief, but at 16 I was tragic. I am an awkward mess, this is endearing I have been told! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:42:52	@Chris_McB <3 Xfactor is the bane of my life. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:42:10	@DONJunior85 At least he has a had a career, but he is just a 16 year old manchild. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:41:30	@AaronAndYou Also my life is plenty interesting :p x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:41:13	@AaronAndYou I was awkward and ugly at your age. Only now am I mildly cool. Age is good man, you grow up and nothing seems a huge tragedy. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:37:07	There's a book on Matt Cardles 'story'...why... He's won xfactor, he sang in pubs before that, he has no career prospects. Done. Twats. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:35:07	@AaronAndYou Haha, I don't think my life is interesting enough! How on earth do you do it. Maybe I am just getting old...at 20. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 06:33:27	@AaronAndYou you have a ridiculous amount of followers, and you are like...16. How is that possible! Mine keep unfollowing me. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 04:34:32	@AaronAndYou Macaroni! It lightens that place up some more. I went on a grey summers day, it was like being back in time. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 04:27:10	@AaronAndYou Lol good times. I only went to Macclesfield all I saw were hills, sheep and industrial bleakness. It was amazing :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 04:23:39	@AaronAndYou that sounds mildly wrong in my head. Are there forests up North? Or just industry towns? #naivemidlander x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 04:19:14	@AaronAndYou How about necks of woods? Different matter :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-28 04:17:02	@AaronAndYou definitely. I was up in that neck of the woods for the Joy Division exhibition. Epic. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-21 01:42:51	Stop coming onto Facebook chat, it incises me to talk to you when I know I shouldn't. You are not being thoughtful, go and shag your gf. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 08:39:41	Ahahaha just heard the dog downstairs howling in her sleep, cute :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 08:35:11	@DONJunior85 Northampton has Alan Moore. I've met him, and I saw him in my local Morrisons. Thus my copy of watchmen is signed :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 08:27:30	@DONJunior85 yes i agree. I however am going to read Watchmen as it is before 3am so I won't sleep :) night. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 08:22:59	@DONJunior85 Oh dear lord...really? I'm going to forgive that on the basis of the time. Macclesfield is fucking bleak though. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 08:20:06	@DONJunior85 Very very true, also you have Macclesfield home to Joy Division. Elton John is playing here...we lose in terms of music. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 08:17:27	I am debating opening my parents wine and getting drunk on my own... #loser x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 08:15:49	@DONJunior85 It's awful. Still, we have sun and less Northernness. We do however have a shoe museum, with an elephant boot. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 08:11:38	FECK OFF CUP :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 08:10:14	I could really do with cracking open a bottle of wine getting drunk and making horrible horrible mistakes :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 08:08:50	@DONJunior85 haha. It's better. Trust me. We don't speak funny, and occasionally we see the sun. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:57:15	@DONJunior85 I feel that was a bit harsh. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:57:04	@DONJunior85 Damn the North and it's all year Arctic conditions. Being midland is better than being NORTHERN :D x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:53:33	ahh I need you @NizInFrance to talk me out of saying hello to dick head. Please be home soon :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:52:43	@DONJunior85 It is so true. It never stops raining up north. It's a fact. Like there are 10 million bicycles in Beijing. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:46:39	@DONJunior85 Ha. Northampton's shite so I avoid being associated with it. It never stops raining in Blackpool but then it is North. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:42:31	@DONJunior85 Oh. Damn cities. Poor burnley. Yes I have, it's always like hell. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:42:07	@DONJunior85 no, not really. I don't consider myself a born and bred Northamptoner as my parents are from elsewhere. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:40:58	@DONJunior85 Oh dear. Blackpool is bleak. I will not be tangerine for long, I am taking steps to prevent it. Rival towns, pfft. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:34:54	@DONJunior85 In your blood? Are you tangerineists? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:33:17	I hate you ethics form, with ever fibre of my being. Yes. EVEN THAT ONE. #ethics #dissertation #psychology x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:26:02	@DONJunior85 thank you. Tangerine. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:22:58	I love having better spelling and grammar than my ex. As horrible as he made me feel, I at least come across intelligent in messages. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:19:08	@DONJunior85 I don't rate myself. In other news, my hair is turning orange. I no longer feel festive :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:17:16	Argh whyyyyy ex GO AWAY. I'm lonely, BUT I DON'T WANT YOU. Neghhhh x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:13:44	@DONJunior85 ahhh see it works! I knew I studied psychology for a reason. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:11:18	@DONJunior85 Ha, I use it as a ploy to make people like the shitty songs :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 07:03:16	I'm ridiculously tired, and I need a hug amongst other things. I have got to start seeing someone. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 06:36:01	still doing this damn ethics form. Le sigh. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 06:30:48	how did I forget about texts from last night! So much procrastination :D x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 05:58:11	I hope someone likes these damn videos, I've killed my voice recording them. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 05:57:11	whyyyy did I delete them! damn my idiocy. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 05:51:37	ok I lie, I'm posting two, I deleted some by accident and can't get them back and I'm too tired to do them again :( x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 03:14:37	Watch HP 5. Umbridge reminds me of every idiot teacher and bully I had. Evil. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 03:10:19	Parents going out. I'm going to listen to the Smiths and play guitar until it hurts :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 03:05:54	Ahaha can't watch Harry Potter without thinking of Dolores from AVPS. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 00:39:11	nap time fail. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 00:15:08	I'm really tempted to go for a nap. Despite the fact I've had 7-8 hours sleep which is generally a lot. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-20 00:09:46	@DONJunior85 Oh dear. I've planned a tattoo and a haircut. I've also discovered the MVI has reliability and convergent validity. Joy. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 23:57:10	@DONJunior85 Good :) Xmas songs are annoying. I have been writing about nothing for an hour, might plan my spending of my student loan. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 23:49:16	I want another tattoo, I feel at least I am wasting my student loan on something long lasting. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 23:48:48	@DONJunior85 It's amazing. My cover, not so much. I might listen to the buzzcocks until I die. Which might be soon, x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 23:43:28	@DONJunior85 best. song. ever. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 23:43:02	You're an orgasm addict. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 23:16:09	apparently I started writing songs around 1am last night. Would explain how shiteous it is. Why does insomnia not produce my best work? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 23:03:40	Damn I am hostile today. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 23:02:36	I really couldn't give two fucks about convergent validity. Does anyone care about convergent validity. No. Fuck you psychology. You lose. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 23:00:57	@DONJunior85 I'm dead inside? Ethics forms are shite. It's not like I want to perform lobotomies it's a questionnaire. Worse than death. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 22:56:37	ethics forms are like death, but more painful. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 22:52:21	Good thing I wanted to spend my Sunday researching the reliability of psychological scales. Fucking arsing hairy tit balls. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 22:48:58	I hate ethics form so much. Gone are the days when you could mess with your participants. Damn psychology, you sold out. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 22:47:35	@DONJunior85 Definitely. I am doing ethics related things, it's most dull. Procrastinating was much more fun. Sundays are shite. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 22:42:11	@DONJunior85 too cold. I would freeze important parts off. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 22:36:31	I need to find something better to do than read blogs and do nothing. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 22:15:06	hello cold weather. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 20:14:08	I hate this part of the country. No snow, and yet all my friends can't get back from uni, so it is still shit. arseface. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 19:08:50	I am going to see (hopefully) 2 of my good friends today :) please snow stop and get @nizinfrance home so I can see her! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 10:16:45	As great as being single is, my regret is that I couldn't hang on until summer when warmth was not needed as it is now. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 10:09:21	thinks I'm in a time warp (again) last 30 mins have vanished. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 10:08:50	@DONJunior85 Nice one, so you'll be drinking until about 11am. Goooooood times. I did that but it was summer and daylight was only 4am :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 10:04:44	urgh sneezing fit, and it's uber uber cold. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 10:01:47	@DONJunior85 you should drink more, it makes life bearable. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 09:57:04	@DONJunior85 you'd be there for hours. I'm disturbed from the experience and I didn't win bingo :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 09:52:35	I'll never look at Bruce Willis in the same way. #chatroulettebingo x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 09:52:12	right bed. Chat Roulette bingo was not worth the mental scarring. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 09:28:23	AHHHHH CHAT ROULETTE BINGO HAS ITS RISKS. #scarredforlife x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 09:13:54	@DONJunior85 Over 40's chatrou bingo has started again. You need to try this, it's amazing. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:58:23	writing songs, writing songs :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:42:57	urgh I need to buy hairdressing scissors why does no one I know own any. Stupid undercut, stupid hair growing :( x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:41:48	@NizInFrance I can't wait to see your face and have a catch up, I miss yooooou. Twitter doesn't cut it. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:40:19	@NizInFrance I do like to win :) x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:38:40	@NizInFrance Good :) I won't say anything, until it blows up, or he speaks to me. Which may be the same thing. Still, grr. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:36:00	@NizInFrance Also, is it bad I want his relationship to blow up in his face. Not to benefit my sex life but instead because I told him so. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:35:26	@NizInFrance nice use of the word compound. I want to slap his face for being a general liar, and not taking my advice about ex's. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:30:05	@NizInFrance That dickface whoreboy is online, talk me out of talking to him please, as I am stupid and don't trust myself. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:14:13	@NizInFrance that's ok sweetie, the trains are full of bollocks at the moment, avoiding said bollocks is important. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:12:20	@NizInFrance Not good :( tomorrow, you shall eat lots. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:10:11	I'd kill many many people to be able to afford a #sugarpill palette right now. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:08:51	@NizInFrance it's really noisy though. I've stopped eating them. Weekends make me so hungry for some reason! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 08:02:20	@NizInFrance Lol. Poor dispenser has been left empty. Mum only buys m&m's so she can steal them out of there :) omnom. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 07:58:00	I was meant to put these M&M's in my dispenser. Eating them outright seems to cut out the middle man. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 07:56:17	my poor dog is rolling her face on my carpet as my room smells of nail varnish. Oops. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 07:53:00	@cosmetic_candy headbands, clips, and sweeping what is left to the side. Hair grows around 1/2 inch a month, so it's a waiting game. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 05:55:41	@DONJunior85 Um a bit, it isn't hugely snowy. Good thing you've been drinking, or it would be cold. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 05:49:13	@DONJunior85 It was amazing. We tried over 40's bingo, but then it crashed. I have an interesting life. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 05:41:36	@DONJunior85 No beasts, a few tiddlers. I didn't even win at penis bingo. A part of me has died tonight. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 05:36:55	@DONJunior85 It's horrible. I've seen around 1000 ugly people and twice that many ugly penises. I feel drinking would ease the pain. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 05:32:23	@DONJunior85 Yep. Chat Roulette bingo is not good. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 04:58:32	me and an friend are chatrouletting until we find each other. This can only end badly. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-12-19 02:36:04	I was stupid to get my hair all cut off for winter. But then I did try to grow it in summer. Damn my lack of season appropriate hair. Brr. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 07:25:21	@MizzWorthy that's good then, it should stick a bit better :) x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 07:04:18	@MizzWorthy Definitely. Are you bleaching before redding? x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:53:01	@MizzWorthy yeah, you have to! Red hair is seriously good fun. It gives you a taste for madder colours though. I'm heading turquoise now. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:47:58	@MizzWorthy problem is you might fall in love with it! With regards to the nurse thing I worked in the NHS and saw so much crazy hair there!
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:45:37	questions questions. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:44:28	@MizzWorthy you can do & with shampoo. It's up to you, I find using the dye directly ever 2-3 weeks just gives it it's life back a bit more
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:41:03	@DONJunior85 but I fear I have started something I cannot finish. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:40:27	@NizInFrance you ok? -hugs-
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:40:14	@MizzWorthy Good! It's a bit of upkeep, but just top the colour up with a semi-perm colour like Directions (its like £4) to keep it red! :D
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:36:30	@MizzWorthy saw your red hair post, and wanted to say DO IT. I loved mine, you are never too old for it, and it looks fab on everyone :)
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:34:54	@DONJunior85 Ahaha that jokes not funny anymore. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:30:57	@DONJunior85 I don't have any in mind yet. It's getting too late for me to think of associative innuendos! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:25:59	@DONJunior85 Morrissey innuendo good times. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:22:43	@DONJunior85 nothing better than morrissey puns and innuendo. And not so innuendoed innuendos. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:16:46	@DONJunior85 Hahahaha. No worries man. Most of my conversations end up crass, says a lot about me :/ x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:11:37	@DONJunior85 Depends how good you are, the better you get the more fingering is required from both hands. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 06:08:03	@DONJunior85 Maybe even more so. More plucking. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 05:54:30	@EyeOfAaron Good, I wouldn't expect anything less. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 05:47:47	@EyeOfAaron trust me it could have been a lot worse! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 05:43:55	@EyeOfAaron Exciting. x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 05:15:40	@DONJunior85 Haha definitely especially in terms of the head to body end! I'm average at guitar. I would love to learn bass. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 03:44:47	@DONJunior85 the neck. I didn't realise until I played my friends which was slimmer and thus easier! x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 03:01:36	playing you have killed me on guitar, due to the amount of barre chords and my ridiculously wide guitar, it has killed me. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 02:57:19	@EyeOfAaron If it's anything like WoW it will just make you want to die. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 02:47:05	@EyeOfAaron would it work? Or would I just become more nerdy. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-22 02:42:39	As I live and breathe you have killed me, yes I walk around somehow, but you have killed me <3 x

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-21 21:45:35	@NizInFrance It's comforting if 11 or 1 passed without an accompanying 11 it would be odd. I've only started to see the 1:11 though

148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-10 23:32:39	@Nizinfrance it is stupid, but I can see why they are doing it, as Universities now have no money it's a much deeper issue than fees
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-10 23:29:57	@Nizinfrance for me it should be an issue of removing 'cake' courses, and making people think for themselves, not being driven by the gov.
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-10 23:27:59	@Nizinfrance surely it will make the degree a valuable commodity again in the jobs market and not just a bit of paper everyone has
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-10 23:24:54	@Nizinfrance at least people will want to be at uni and not just do it because they dont have to work for another 3 years. x
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-10 23:24:35	@Nizinfrance it's stupid the whole thing, they are protesting against fee rise, which is bad, but in the long term may be good
148718702	NicelyNeurotic	2010-11-10 23:22:06	@Nizinfrance check it out. Protest gone stupid. I'm doing a blog on it today as I am RILED. x
