320980946	roseyleeee	2013-06-24 22:34:19	If I love someone why do I still have fears? Not everyone wants love and that's my fear. I wonder if there is a perfect love? #love

320980946	roseyleeee	2012-01-09 09:33:12	@nullfuture in my last tweet I said scripting I meant sculpting. To make that pliable choc you need corn syrup. I will need to practice. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2012-01-09 09:11:27	@nullfuture I've been looking at recipes for scripting/moulding chocolate. I can make, create & artistically decorate a 4 ft cake. Can't I?

320980946	roseyleeee	2012-01-02 01:29:02	@Zoe_Smith It's probably a good idea not 2 start with a rottweiler as a first dog. Yorkshire terrier? They shake & look constantly petrified

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-22 06:21:46	There is a program called Hoarders on Bio. If you have Sky just search for it. I have watched a few so far & its ok.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-22 06:10:16	@Zermatschen I always wonder whether there's a link I.e a very clean parent may lead to a child who is comfortable with mess & vice versa??
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-22 06:03:17	@Zermatschen @EscapingEntropy Indeed. A real spark of hope for the chap. xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-22 06:02:43	@Zermatschen I liked that little piece. Nice, to the point. It must have been difficult at times hun. xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-22 05:50:50	@Zermatschen i hope its not too late I could see his anxiety at the soggy papers in the garden. He seems so lovely. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-22 05:44:05	@Zermatschen it might be an idea but judging by his reaction to the therapist/psychologist I'm just not sure he's ready. Or its too late??
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-22 05:41:22	@RA_Fairy If you outlaw a fellow villagers based on aesthetics its shows little of the community spirit the busy bodys speak of. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-22 05:37:39	@EscapingEntropy @Zermatschen Yup. He's not causing harm to others/ animals. The guy seems quite easy going. My only concern is his health.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-22 05:31:27	@Zermatschen Agreed. His neighbours are behaving like children. The guy needs caring and sensitive long term help. Not a bloody fence. xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-22 04:41:46	I MUST have a a better day tomorrow. I've felt pretty stressed for couple of days. At least i don't feel as achy & crap as i did last night.

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-09 10:00:21	@nullfuture come on. You are going through a particularly shitty patch. Never say never re blog, book etc Your words mean a lot to some peep
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-09 09:57:36	@Truthaboutcrazy Your telling me. It's odd. It's trying to be more streamlined I think but its confusing :S
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-09 09:55:28	Well sexcetera was exciting tonight. Take me to party cove!!! #bigboatsmallpenis #maybenot
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-09 06:54:06	@YouMustBeMental I loved HOW 2. Awesome show. I learnt loads from that program. Shame ive forgotten everything. *goes to find it on ebay*
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-09 05:13:06	@nullfuture You could consider sedatives - Diazepam, lorazepam, temazepam (sleepy), flunitrazepam (rohypnol) etc etc Maybe see your psych?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-09 01:57:27	@AngelDisturbed1 Sorry for being slow. Had therapy today. Learnt a few things as usual. Bit grumpy & mood a bit flat at times. How are you?

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 07:52:12	@nullfuture ok will let you know :) I can't entirely rule out whether Neil has organised something for us to do. #strangerthingshavehappened
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 07:50:35	@crazywhisperer Happy Birthday!! It seems we share Birthdays fellow twitterer. Its my birthday in 10 minutes time here in the UK. xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 07:45:34	@nullfuture It will no doubt just be another day of picking up mess after the boys. SSDD.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 07:31:58	@nullfuture Its ok but patience has fucked off and left rage and temper in control. I literally don't have time to tell myself to calm down.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 07:30:09	@higgy365 haha. I don't really want surgery just wish i was more naturally endowed. How r ya? x
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 07:11:09	@nullfuture I am a grumpy bitch. Went shopping AGAIN today nearly screamed my way out of 1 shop after being hassled by an assistant for help
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 07:09:14	@nullfuture After several up and downs in my chest size (baby, risperidone etc) they seem to be a bit deflated (bit like me really).
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 07:02:45	Currently watching- The Worlds most Enhanced Woman... and Me on DMAX+1 *wants bigger boobies (will never have surgery though)*
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 06:57:53	@meerkatarmy *goes back to the Next website and reconsiders all the things* xxxxxxxx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 06:57:09	@nullfuture by floor do u mean literally the floor? I find comfort in the floor during times of great sorrow & pain. #thefloorsunderstanding
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 06:53:12	@meerkatarmy The old manic me would have bought all the things!!
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 06:52:23	@meerkatarmy Hahaha. I'm pretty close with most of my family so I don't mind seeing them again. Just feel self conscious due to weight gain.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 06:47:27	@meerkatarmy There's plenty of wee boys clothes i would buy, but I'm looking for something to wear to a Sunday meal out with family. Jumper?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-07 06:43:22	Logged into my Next clothing a/c. My credit limit is £2200. Not bad 4 someone with no job! It was £6K. Shame i can't find anything i want :(
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 08:03:30	@yourelate4tea Triggers are tricky little vermin. Its difficult to avoid them too. It can be terrifying & u can feel like u have regressed.x
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 07:57:09	@yourelate4tea I don't really have a clue unless it mental monthlies but a little worse than usual due to christmas stress. I'll be ok hun.x
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 07:54:31	@nullfuture I like it. very cool and quite wintery. xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 07:49:05	@yourelate4tea In the mean time heres a big ((((((((((((((((((((((((((hug))))))))))))))))))))))))
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 07:48:24	@yourelate4tea ...appreciate how painfully hard the road to recovery can be. Getting out of certain ways of thinking is hard. Hope it eases.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 07:46:02	@yourelate4tea I'm more chilled out after a bath. Had a grumpy/ragey day myself. I'm not really qualified to talk on ED but i can really...
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 07:41:43	@yourelate4tea Whats up hun?? xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 07:36:06	@andbenrow That's not good hun. I understand why they got SS involved (with me) but it shouldn't be used as a threat due to MH. ((((Hugs))))
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 07:27:59	@andbenrow The help they offered was one to one confidence building with the Surestart team. Also stuck me on supervised parenting 24/7.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 07:26:18	@andbenrow It was shit trying to fake 50% at least of how i was really feeling. I was lying to my CPN most days i saw her. Yet it paid off.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 07:13:05	@andbenrow I did it and so can you hun. Then you can breathe. I swear that all social services did was raise my stress and anxiety.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 07:08:50	@mindofmedusa sending some warm good luck vibes for your disability exam. Xxxxxxxxxx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 04:54:38	@nazzied ok hun. Sounds good.Xx

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 03:44:04	@nazzied was wondering if you were free on the 9th?? Hoping to go for a little meal out.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 03:37:27	Well I've bitched, moaned and raged my way through the day. Objects have been flung across rooms. #fail
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-06 03:36:00	" @Oatmeal : Horrible Cards http:// bit.ly/tJx0oO " <-- These cheered me up for a minute.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 18:05:13	@nullfuture I'm a grumpy, angry goose at the min but okay I guess. Not really a reason for it. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 18:01:57	@HovellingHermit Hey Herm! How have you been? I've been quite neglectful of twitter. Doesn't mean I don't care though :)
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 17:56:16	@nullfuture yep I love #TheWalkingDead I watched it on Saturday. How r u today?

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 09:45:56	@nullfuture wow, quick response. I figured u would be asleep > wrong. I was right about the little girl being in the barn in walking dead :)
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 09:40:46	@nullfuture I gave up with it. I bought my dad the dvd so can watch it anytime. How's you? I'll b asleep by the time you reply. Xx

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 08:02:09	@higgy365 Woah. I know the nerves feeling. Really uncool, but like u say once the initial hello, who r u thing is done then things r easier.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 07:53:14	@higgy365 Well I've never randomly met a fellow tweeter. I try to be open to new things. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 07:45:50	@higgy365 Your ok. I don't find it creepy. Your very kind and sincere. You live in northampton? There's a teen chance of a tweet up. Eh?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 07:35:31	@higgy365 Haircuts are always hit & miss with me. Altho its a guaranteed miss if I cut my hair. I'll be ok hun, just need straightening out.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 03:42:28	@bonaaar Aaah!! What a lot of hair!! I was just a twinkle in my fathers eye back then. Very cool pick. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 03:36:30	@bonaaar Are you the lad with the curtains (haircut)? Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-05 00:23:21	In one hour and with a pair of scissors I have massacred my fringe. Hairdressers tomorrow it is then...
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-04 23:01:33	This is sad. Young lad being bullied. Nuff said -- Whats goin on.. http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=TdkNn3 Ei-Lg&feature=share … via @youtube
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-04 09:11:35	@higgy365 no problem :P I like to inform people of these things. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-04 08:08:05	@bey0ndinfinity_ I found it harder 2 sympathise with wurtzel in the film, but at times i could relate. I couldn't fault the acting though. x
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-04 07:46:52	@YouMustBeMental As with most book to film adaptations a lot of the story was simplified.It is worth a watch but dont expect too much
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-04 07:43:29	@YouMustBeMental The films cast can't really be faulted but u feel cheated by the end. They created some depth but then cut the story short.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-04 06:12:24	@YouMustBeMental Sure, will do hun :-) Not too bad so far, pretty accurate. I only managed 1/2 -3/4 of the book. C Ricci is good so far. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-04 06:06:51	Watching Prozac Nation by Elizabeth Wurtzel. This is after trying to read the book 3 or 4 times. Christina ricci's tits 2 minutes in. #info
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-04 05:21:09	@andbenrow I feel like this a lot. I just feel useless. My words are not interesting and my life even less so.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-03 21:24:49	Uuuuggghhhhh! Must. Try. And...... tweet. #Effort
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-03 18:32:27	@meerkatarmy fuck me, I'm not awake. I used there instead of their twice. #shootme
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-03 18:31:02	@meerkatarmy oops I didn't mean sex I meant because of there homosexuality. There are very strong personalitys.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-03 18:27:45	@meerkatarmy not really. It's just a personality stereotype that you don't get on with. You don't dislike them because of there sexuality.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-02 06:27:33	@blissfulblues @yourelate4tea Hahahahahahaha. #graveyardnails
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-02 06:24:41	@blissfulblues @yourelate4tea My nails are sad neglected and broken creatures. Wish I had the talent and patience :)
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-02 06:23:26	Sometimes in life just getting thru the days is enough. If i think about where i am (in life) Vs where i want to b, i feel sad. I am on hold
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-12-02 06:14:55	@yourelate4tea They are the coolest nails i have seen in a while!!! Awesome (i'm jealous). xxxx

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-29 04:46:54	@MindCharity @officialtulisa My Dad had a breakdown which led to Bipolar. As a child it was hard to understand. I thought I was to blame.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-29 04:19:01	Huge congratulations @serialinsomniac Absolutely well deserved. Enjoy the rest of your stay in London.*Mwah* Xxx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-29 04:17:49	@MindCharity @serialinsomniac Its one of THE silliest, silly blogs I've ever read. It brings new meaning to the word silly. Silly = Awesome!

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-28 05:49:18	@bullfrogr Do you have a therapist hun? It's clearly shaken you up a little. I used to have similar issues but now I'm comatose in my sleep.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-28 05:40:47	@kidsunshinee a fellow twitterer has told me its a bit pooh so i think i'll spend my pennys on something else. Sounds cool tho. #mooninmyroom

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-28 03:46:51	@Bigdawny1 thx hun. It's not about the cost. It's the inconvenience and the whole why?? They're worth nothing all scratched like mine were.

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-26 02:17:49	@Zoe_Smith aah yes. Bluerrgh. Yet people still try and tell us cats are very clean and hygienic.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-26 02:11:48	@Zoe_Smith I am pretty sure cats have a better diet than us mere humans (ignoring the half decomposed creatures they devour).
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-26 02:09:13	@Zoe_Smith at least you'll have a glossy coat/hair and maybe you'll be more agile and live longer??? #Iams

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-24 06:50:40	@RA_Fairy I can't wait till 3 yr old is big enough to play with proper lego. Haha the things I will create!!!
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-24 06:49:13	@LastSalmonMan Hahaha. You don't take us seriously anymore. You treat our friendship like a cruel joke :P
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-24 06:46:37	@LastSalmonMan argh I don't hate people that easily.... your stuck with me I'm afraid. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-24 05:34:40	@meerkatarmy thx Lex.3yr old loves Xmas trees. They mesmerise him. One day he will learn what this silly day is all about... twinkly lights!
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-24 05:24:48	@Fifi_lafret Thanks hun. Kids eh? Not really a huge fan of the present thing (xmas) but I do like the decorations. Mainly the lights tbh :)
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-24 04:31:07	It's a bit early but 3 yr old wanted a Christmas tree. So the best I could do was make one from megablocks.#http:// twitpic.com/7iik2c
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-24 03:49:09	@Zoe_Smith Haystack comes to mind! I tend to decimate the dining table when I'm on a mission too. #lifeisnottidy

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-23 09:04:25	Good night all. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-23 08:52:28	@nullfuture sorry that was the wrong link. Still cool guys tho. They are quite funny bids too. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-23 08:50:57	No idea what happened there. This is the right link to Paramore brick by boring brick and Airplanes. http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=cbu4jP 9JPRY&amp;sns=tw …
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-23 08:27:56	Great cover of Paramore- brick by boring brick/Airplanes. A little injection of fun too. http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=B5I-eQ qg55A&feature=youtube_gdata_player …
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-23 03:33:08	@meerkatarmy @Zoe_Smith I think exactly the same. We're often put off going A & E because we haven't had a heart attack or broken a leg.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-23 03:01:07	So tonight Matthew I will be a ragey, angry mess. I have perfected the art of slamming throwing and shouting. Almost as well as a teenager.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 10:01:20	@nullfuture ah well, I'm starting to struggle in making sense. Too many sp's. Just have a little think. Will talk tomorrow. Night night. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 09:58:34	@nullfuture Sometimes its the straightforward things that throw us. They don't fit with how we think life should be. This causes us grief.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 09:56:26	@nullfuture You say yourself you were a sensitive child. People think that MH ways stems from MAJOR trauma like Rape or violence. Not always
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 09:53:46	@nullfuture my therapist links my behaviours/feelings to obscure things that happened yrs ago. Some strong beliefs are born of simple events
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 09:48:37	@nullfuture Yeh 17 is a child. Still vulnerable emotionally. Who knows if there is a connection but there is something.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 09:45:35	@nullfuture For a young person I can imagine he was a hero to u & heroes do not die. Teens dream of immortality even suicide doesn't scare
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 09:41:17	@nullfuture That's a very tough thing for any child to see. Was it perhaps that event that has affected you so deeply Re age of death.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 09:25:47	@nullfuture Senna died aged 34. Did you watch the race when you were a child? Any significance? #clutchingatstraws :(
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 07:24:56	@Bigdawny1 It's a channel 4 doc. Will be on 4od. Def worth a watch but at times may make you angry and unsettled. Xx have a safe journey hun
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 07:20:19	Very profound and moving programme. Many issues raised relating to how family's deal with crises and trauma. #Weneedtotalkaboutdad

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 01:32:37	@mindofmedusa and my IBS is anxiety driven so a card would be good. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 01:31:25	@mindofmedusa I could really do with a card that I can use to inform shop keepers of my IBS so if I'm caught short I can use staff toilets.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 01:18:55	@yourelate4tea i'll make 8 fake accounts then?? :-)
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-22 01:16:37	@AliceSmurf that's fine I leave mine out for a week sometimes right next to the kitchen so it ends up smelling of curry, chilling, stew etc.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-21 07:53:42	@Clarentino_ thank you hun, I'm just getting a bit tired of crying at everything. I'm sure I will be fine. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-21 07:41:03	I keep getting hit with waves of intense sadness. I'm crying at the drop of a hat & I can't blame mental monthlys. Oh well gotta keep going.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-21 06:47:34	@jermec Hope tomorrow goes okay for you hun. It will be interesting to see if ECT can cure MS. Let's hope eh? Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-21 06:38:12	@Estellastar1 brought me here. Wish there was something i can do. Its just so de( @YouTube http:// youtu.be/aZUVFRAyl_I?a )

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 08:37:40	@yourelate4tea See her more regularly again. See my psych, socialize more and avoid stress etc. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 08:15:24	@yourelate4tea I hope your treatment helps you. I can imagine its going to be really tough. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 08:14:07	@yourelate4tea Just some sort of anxiety saw Cpn & she thinks I'm in a low. I'm on meds and I've been low before so i'll be ok. Thank u tho.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 08:03:39	@yourelate4tea I'm a bit bluerrgh but dealing with it I guess. Distraction is always good though. How are you hun? Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 07:51:32	@yourelate4tea I watched it too. So sad with the older couple :( & Ruth being pregnant :) Wonder what they'll have to do about her meds tho?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 07:27:57	@BiPolarQueen2 oh sorry hun. That's a bit odd of twitter. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 07:26:13	@nullfuture Wow had no idea u are watching a caine film. He should just stick to typecasting, sadly that's what he does best. He is a legend
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 07:12:12	@nullfuture yup agree with you on the accent. Sean connery is about as good as Michael caine when it comes to accents.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 07:04:50	@nullfuture I'm liking it but it is very sad. Move over Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson is my new fave. Loved him in Schindlers list too. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 06:20:12	I feel like I am shutting down, just stood in the kitchen and stared for who knows how long. Going to watch K-19: The Widowmaker to distract
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 06:02:10	@BiPolarQueen2 she is gorgeous hun. Never thought I would have a cat and now I have two. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-20 02:17:32	@EstellaStar1 Good luck, hope they can help #smashsma

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-19 22:32:52	@HovellingHermit Yeh I know, he's always like this at wknd's though, because daddys about. Just knocks me back a little.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-19 22:00:50	Kids are quite mean sometimes..3yr old just said, "I don't need you ANYMORE mummy!!!". In a very matter of fact voice. #sad #low
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-19 19:49:48	@Zoe_Smith Not that I would want it. Sounds a bit yuck!! Zzz

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-19 08:31:28	@nullfuture No, but she made it sound easy. My friends r either miles away, busy or ill. Plus im a boring grump. Who would want my company?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-19 08:10:49	@nullfuture I'm ok just bluerrgh. Stupid Cpn blathering on about getting out and seeing friends. Ffs. I dunno??? How are you? How was rugby?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-19 07:39:52	Pah, I feel rough. I don't want a cold. My Cpn in her wisdom has declared me in a low mood. The cure given is for me to socialize more. #fail
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-19 06:16:27	@SkirraCorvus I used 2 love a pint of that when I did a lot of walking in the lakedistrict. They had it on tap up there! #missalcohol

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-18 05:20:47	@Fifi_lafret Evening. My husband has to wear something spotty at work tomorrow. He was hoping I had some spotty socks he could borrow. Nope.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-18 04:56:13	@JojoMHC thank-you. I know what you mean about feeling alien sometimes. I like doing art/craft type things. Just wish I had more ideas. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-18 04:43:27	@yourelate4tea :) Thats pretty extensive. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-18 04:33:23	@BipolarTweets alcohol causes me to cycle quicker and I'm not a nice person to be around when hungover. I don't mind your questions hun. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-18 04:31:30	@BipolarTweets I think there a quite a few people on here that do drink on it. I have been off alcohol since April (only had 2 drinks since)
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-18 04:29:07	@BipolarTweets the dose right for me. I also ended up in hospital because I didn't stabilise quickly. I am good enough now tho.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-18 04:27:18	@BipolarTweets ... felt sick, stomach upset and my stress levels went through the roof. Had to go on beta blockers. It took ages to get...
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-18 04:25:09	@BipolarTweets Well I had tome off carbamazapine very rapidly due to low white bld cells so had some withdrawal. I got dehydrated quickly...
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-18 04:22:22	@BipolarTweets Since the beginning of August. The first few weeks on it were rough but its okay now. Works well enough.

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-12 01:47:36	@yourelate4tea Aaah well. To be fair we've all had a dodgy hair cut though. It's the cause of all my hairdresser anxiety. Lol
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-12 01:39:53	@yourelate4tea I have a good friend @ra_fairy who had a similar style once but It worked because it was cut well and shaped.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-12 01:35:29	@yourelate4tea The more I look at it the more I wonder if she's indecisive & she didn't know what she wanted, so had both. #elementofgenius
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-12 01:18:49	@yourelate4tea hmm, I see what you mean. Maybe it was half price. Half cut = half price??? #iammeansometimes

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 19:15:42	@spiderabc1 It was a different life back then, so its hard to relate & understand completely but yes I am very proud of all their efforts.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 19:11:10	Palindromic moment.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 19:09:53	* I'm crying* Armistice day weirdly reminds me of my Nan who died in Feb, she served in the Wrens & the RBLegion came 2 her funeral. #weird
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 18:58:36	Placing bets on how many questions 3 yr old will ask during the 2 min silence. He will think I'm weird for not talking to him. #dilemma
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 18:56:12	@meerkatarmy @Zoe_Smith but thats not to say that is how all creative people act while manic. Everyone's different. #igetangry
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 18:51:34	@meerkatarmy @Zoe_Smith With mania a creative person would probably just throw paint over the walls and get angry with a pencil
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 18:49:06	@Zoe_Smith @meerkatarmy The creativity comes from the core of the person and not the illness.hypomania gives a creative person more 'juice'
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 18:33:16	@Zoe_Smith @meerkatarmy like I said I like that bit in relation to lex's issue with family but agree with you on how it can be stigmatising.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 18:30:46	@meerkatarmy @Zoe_Smith I liked it because it relates to Lexs family's crap attitude. Sometimes family's do need to be told the obvious. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 18:28:57	@spiderabc1 Yep, happens every time. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 18:26:04	@meerkatarmy Hahaha. Best one I've seen though. I still can't understand why I had the diagnosis for 6 mths? I bet your fab with little ones
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-11 18:21:37	@meerkatarmy Very good. It was lovely at the end, "they can be good with babies". (((((hugs))))

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-09 02:58:06	@yourelate4tea Yeh it is ironic considering I felt I was going to have a heart attack and my heart rate was over 120. #loldrugs

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-07 04:41:14	@Zoe_Smith Yep I know you wouldn't drink (as much) if the alternative (sober) was better. Do what you need to do hun ;) X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-07 04:35:12	@Loiner07 It's ok hun. Therapy has really helped put perspective on it. I've managed to shift the blame from me onto the psychotic illness.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-07 04:30:30	@Zoe_Smith I do understand. I really cannot remember if I had nightmares while using it. It's a blur. Hope the wine helps. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-07 04:29:00	@Loiner07 It would have been fine if I hadn't had a 4-5 wk old baby and stressed hubby at home. I'm fine though there only shitty memorys
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-07 04:24:21	@Zoe_Smith well the idea is that zopiclone gets you to sleep and phenergan/promethazine keeps you asleep. I understand if you dont try it.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-07 04:06:36	Fuck, bad memory's resurfacing. They involve me drinking, pissing & puking in a graveyard while swearing at God #threeyrsago #mentallyfucked
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-07 03:59:44	@Zoe_Smith Unfortuanatly i was very mental. It was scary and i can't remember side effects. It really does work though. x
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-07 03:56:05	@Zoe_Smith I took it a while back (3 yrs ago exactly) (phenergan) alongside zopi & huge dose of Q pill. I slept. In the end. It works...

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-07 00:01:08	@CarrieHolroyd @serialinsomniac @SBorderline Absolutely agree with you there. It induces a I'm going to crap myself feeling & a knotty pain

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-06 04:24:34	@serialinsomniac 100% agree with you. It affects nearly all plans I make. It disrupts socializing at times & it can be painful:'(
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-06 04:22:45	@nullfuture Hahaha. Him. I just left everyone & went back to the car with him. In the car he was fine & we watched the last ten mins.;)

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 22:06:26	@Zoe_Smith Thank fuck for that. Really good news. Hope she recovers well. @meerkatarmy
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 19:42:26	@disguised_wings That's ok hun. It's all because my cpn came round & expressed that she feels I need to remain on meds for quite a while
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 19:38:30	@higgy365 tried to put a gun to her own head. It all shows what mentality they have been forced into. I think we r seeing their true nature.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 19:36:26	@higgy365 Hell when mere had no option and zombies were banging down the door he hacked off his hand. Oh & when Andreas sister got bit she..
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 19:23:00	@higgy365 To begin with I genuinely thought Otis had given up his life. Just goes to show what the stress of zombies chasing does to a man:)
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 09:14:56	Night night @disguised_wings thx for the advice. I hate the way I think. It's almost sabotage. It won't happen this time. I hope. X

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 09:00:32	@disguised_wings Absolutely. Scary as hell sitting in a meeting with my parenting ability being judged based on my MH. I needed it tho#sucks
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 08:56:58	@disguised_wings Absolutely, my boy is my anchor & main reason I take the meds yet I still have these thoughts & questions. What if? Maybe?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 08:52:59	@disguised_wings your absolutely right there. I can be stubborn at times. I was proper lying about taking my meds and wouldn't admit defeat.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 08:51:18	@disguised_wings Yeh. I've been there. I had child protection involved for 6 mths. Why? Because I stopped my meds. All clear on that now tho
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 08:41:37	@nullfuture There are many reasons as to why I want off meds. It's odd and selfish. I want to lose weight and I don't feel like me :(
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-11-05 08:36:38	Oh and here's where i become stupid & i consider stopping medication or reducing... just to see if i am who i am. #aminormalnow #curedbymeds

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-29 19:38:30	@meerkatarmy agreed hun. We can see this issue with all charitys. They pick up the slack from our still bureacratic government. The end ;)
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-29 18:58:59	@meerkatarmy @madsmark1973 Had no idea that you served hun. Surely that means we need to fight and get more help for ex service People?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-29 18:55:24	@meerkatarmy @madsmark1973 ok. I am well aware women serve I have many good friends in the RAF. sorry if I didn't say service people.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-29 18:51:28	@madsmark1973 yep me too. It doesn't mean I agree with every war/ conflict etc but I do feel the troops & ex servicemen need support. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-29 18:42:02	@meerkatarmy @madsmark1973 They also help serving troops. I just feel that while our troops & ex service men need help, I will buy poppys.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-29 18:33:21	@meerkatarmy @madsmark1973 The royal British legion does not directly support war, it supports ex-service men & women http://www. britishlegion.org.uk/campaigning/po licy-statements--news …

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-29 04:42:51	@BiPolarQueen2 The film isn't 100% accurate. To be fair films never are but the real experiment is still scary. Xx

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-29 04:26:33	@sad_piglet Sounds equally as interesting may have to find that on repeat. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-29 04:25:18	@BiPolarQueen2 Yup. It's so interesting yet damn disturbing. To think in 1971 this really happened! As I said I studied it a little but wtf?

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-29 04:13:16	I'm watching 'The Experiment'.I learnt a bit about it in psychology. It's seriously as fucked up as I learnt it was. Zimbardo your a nutter!

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-28 03:36:24	@meerkatarmy No no no no and no. More like carry a knife to cut their bollocks off or a pepper spray to blind them. #Empowerment

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-16 16:33:13	@bonaaar well that's impressive! Although I am easily impressed with anyone's ability to run more than just to the bathroom & back to sofa
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-16 16:28:40	@bonaaar :D
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-16 16:26:30	@bonaaar what will you do when you get there?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-16 16:21:51	@bonaaar see that's ok. I am concerned my anxiety is going to go mental when I am all the way in. Hahaha. Could be interesting ;) Xxx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-16 16:17:55	@Zoe_Smith and to be fair @nullfuture s dogs were only barking and sniffing and jumping. #nogrowling #dogscanbescary

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-16 05:23:47	@davoisme can't wait either way.:)
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-16 05:18:07	@davoisme EPIC NEWS! :D Finally get to find out if the probe reaches the other aliens and they all get rescued. Also revenge is sweet.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-16 05:11:14	@davoisme yes compares directly with the apartheid era. #racialsegregation
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-16 05:01:57	@davoisme Yeh I always get upset for the prawns. Poor vickers too. Always laugh about the cover up "sexual activity" "dangerous".
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-16 04:59:54	@higgy365 oooh. I need to get me those comics. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-16 04:27:03	Watching #districtnine AGAIN. Aliens called prawns that r obsessed with cat food, based in a refuge camp in South Africa never wears thin!:D

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 17:31:25	@Lynda_Jones I am not trying 2 b ungrateful but I don't need that much praise 4 talking t u. I was only trying 2 help #itdoesntmakemeawesome
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 17:24:02	@Lynda_Jones Do not take it seriously hun. Please don't. Oh dear, I am rubbish at fixing things.:(
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 17:17:24	@Lynda_Jones NO definitely not laughing at you. Not at all.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 17:13:48	@Lynda_Jones a little is better than nothing. Have a few hours twitter break and come back when u can see it all for what it is:) (((hugs)))
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 17:11:56	@Lynda_Jones .. doesn't make what they did right. You juat have to try and look at it another way.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 17:09:51	@Lynda_Jones yes I think I saw that. Like I said tho everyone uses twitter for different purposes. They have their own problems. I know it..
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 17:07:04	@Lynda_Jones your not a freak hun. Your just not entirely well. Bpd is a hard card to be dealt. It's what you do to change that can help.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 17:02:48	@Lynda_Jones twitter differently. I get twitter paranoia sometimes but I just try and hold it in nowadays.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 17:00:37	@Lynda_Jones Don't think I'm all hard. I would be gutted if someone I cared about unfollowed me after having an off day. Everyone views...
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 16:57:43	@Lynda_Jones hard for us mentals to please people. Hell even us mentals can't please mentals sometimes. Hahaha :s
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 16:55:58	@Lynda_Jones your not always like this, you can be funny, helpful and sweet. No normal person is perfect all the time which makes it doubly
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 16:51:13	@Lynda_Jones possibly because of the rejection u have felt in all past relationships. It all merges and becomes amplified. You r v sensitive
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 16:43:06	@Lynda_Jones I care about u and I don't give up on people. people are all so different what they like and don't like is different too.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 16:41:04	@Lynda_Jones your a bright woman, you know people care about you. That doesn't mean everyone in the world cares though. That's life.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 16:39:00	@Lynda_Jones honey, please just Stop. Calm for a few seconds. Take one deep breath.(its too hard to do more than one sometimes) think....
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 07:15:39	Good night all. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:59:55	@Aliquant I like it, but it depends on how much alcohol is in it. Nice and juicy. Mmm Mmm #iwantbrandynow
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:58:47	@meerkatarmy gnite lex. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:56:00	@nullfuture I know its not a case of trying 2 save everyone (I'm still gonna try save u), but sometimes all I do is moan or groan & complain
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:53:11	@notyetdefeated its funny you should say that. I was thinking something like that the other week #itinvolvedsellingmywares
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:51:11	@nullfuture trouble is I may be who I am now but when my mood swings its like I become someone else. Blinkered. Really hard to help everyone
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:48:36	@Aliquant hahahahahaha *continues to chuckle* Hahahahaha :D
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:39:45	@silkywings hahahaha something herbal? St johns wort? Sweet dreams. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:36:07	@Aliquant Hahaha i'd like to take whizz once more before I die. #onelastepicbender

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:24:18	@meerkatarmy @youshouldsee just take risperidone. Worked for me. Hahaha #justtryingtohelp :D

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:22:36	@Aliquant It may sound stupid but when/if bipolar goes dormant I am gonna take up drinking again. #letthegoodtimesreign #parttimeofcourse
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:18:33	@nullfuture Hahahahahahaha :D
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:17:12	@nullfuture I think its lovely and very sweet that people think I am fab. Trouble is unless I know why I am fab it is hard to understand it.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:15:21	@serialinsomniac goodnight. Hope you get some good sleep. Xxx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:14:06	@Lynda_Jones goodnight hun. #lyndajonesrocks

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 06:02:45	@Aliquant Hahahahaha Yeh! *droolsabit* I do ask myself why I choose not to drink anymore sometimes. #fearsthemental #ilovealcohol #imissrum
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 05:43:44	@nullfuture @Lynda_Jones I argue the point too. Definitely much to be gained from reading your tweets.(((((Xxx)))))
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-15 05:37:42	@Lynda_Jones Not all the time. Hahahaha. Sometimes I get an inkling but mostly my self esteem is on the floor. Mania lifts me up a lot. Xx

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-07 17:01:32	@Zoe_Smith last time I went to a zoo I stared into a donkeys eyes and nearly set it free. Husband stopped me. Possibly won't be going again

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-07 03:05:30	@Lynda_Jones Yeh i figured that... hence the no killing rule. My utopia is so flawed yet it gets me through the day....
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-07 03:03:57	natural selection is a bitch. So back to my utopia where even the completely handicapped survive because only good things happen in my world
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-07 03:02:20	Yeh i dont think my world is real and it will never last long. #wearealldodos
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-07 03:00:50	Sitting around imagining brand new worlds where its ok to be bat shit insane is never a good thing. I have already invited a no killing rule

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-06 20:51:53	@Lynda_Jones no apparently it is me. If its me then why would my plan be so bad? It's not suicide, but to them it may as well be.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-06 20:47:33	@meerkatarmy that's going to be some bloody good viewing. Hope it happens.;)
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-06 20:46:15	@Lynda_Jones the pos are also that it shows how much disbelief in my abilitys to function as a person they have. I know where I stand. #fail
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-06 20:41:14	@Lynda_Jones the positives are if I pretend I am ok and forget my plan, nothing will happen.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-06 20:39:24	@Lynda_Jones I told my parents of a plan I have. Let's just say they got upset.3 yr old was mentioned a lot &him being taken off me.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-06 20:32:32	I'm trying not to fuck everything up on a daily basis but I appear to be doing so. Feel rubbish. #low #womanflu

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-06 17:33:29	@nuttylotte wow. That's brill news hun. No two ways about it. I suggest you don't take vodka in a Pepsi bottle to a kids party tho. Hahahaha
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-06 16:51:00	@Teppotastic I agree. Not a fan of Apple myself but the man made big things happen with tech.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-05 21:00:01	@nuttylotte ffs. Bunch of muppets.(((((((hugs))))))))
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-05 20:51:33	I imagine a utopian world all the time. The harsh reality of this one fills my head with grief
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-05 20:28:19	Sometimes I am filled with a sense of my own importance but most of the time I am aware I am nothing.*weeps*
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-05 20:26:29	@nazzied oh hun. Burying things doesn't work. Hope you are REALLY ok. Xxx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-05 19:49:08	@Lynda_Jones my therapist is pretty awesome but she cant help family without seeing them. I just want to be who I am.

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-05 02:39:51	@Zoe_Smith i guess we just try our best and sometimes tooooo hard and sometimes we just cant do anything. #parenting #tryingourbest
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-05 02:38:24	@Zoe_Smith Iget ya. Everything going wrong is probably down to my epic parenting which involves ignoring, stressing, catastrophizing, crazy
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-05 02:36:17	Tomorrow i need to get up before 9am ( thanks q pill) and go to see GP (who i dont know well) discuss various ailments & then get to therapy
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-05 02:34:00	@Zoe_Smith Kids eat a hell of a lot worse. If 3yr olds rubbish eating habits don't improve soon he will be eating NOTHING by the time hes 5.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-05 02:30:05	@Zoe_Smith It sounded pretty ok. fruit = raisins, innocent fruit squeezie calcium- babybel + munchbunch drinky+ salt and stuff = frazzles

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-04 22:37:51	@nullfuture Dont worry. If you worry about it, it will never get aired and you'll never get your thoughts out there. I am sure it'll b fine
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-04 22:36:26	@Lynda_Jones bit of the same i guess. Trying to get on with the world when i feel like fucking it all off as a bad job. xx

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 23:10:38	@Lynda_Jones who/what is applying the pressure? No need to hide the mental on here. Although its easier only to show the tip of the iceberg
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 20:47:03	@recoveryandback or why let their drunk selves piss in bus shelters? I've seen it many a time in kettering. #drunkpunks
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 20:06:43	@Lynda_Jones hey! *waves very gladly* and *hugs compassionately* missed u on here. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 19:47:49	@nullfuture @Zoe_Smith and I am the horribly nervous mother giving her what she wants and not what she needs. Well said null.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 19:38:56	@nullfuture damntricks that's kinda what I was thinking but ran out of space to say. #greatminds
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 19:34:56	@nullfuture you could use the bread and chutney as a base. Sprinkle a mix of cheese and bake it in the oven like pizza bread. #randomrecipe
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 19:32:27	@Zoe_Smith sending you something. Don't know what, but something you find comforting. #drugs #hugs and #mugsoftea
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 19:30:28	@nullfuture ah ha goats cheese not camembert. sorry. I like goats cheese in small quantitys. Especially when warm etc
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 19:26:44	@nullfuture yum apart from the one thing that looks like camembert. Xxx swap that for equally smelly Roquefort and its win win. X
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 19:23:54	@Zoe_Smith its hot here and I am still wearing my scarf and cardi and jeans. #comfortthing #bodyhangups
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 19:21:24	@sad_piglet I remember completely random things like that. Sorry you now feel dodgy tho. Xx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 19:04:57	@Zoe_Smith maybe have cake later when I have forgiven myself for the fried breakfast I had. #fail
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 18:57:38	@bourach @Zoe_Smith excellent use of magic trick there.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 18:56:23	@sad_piglet is this thing per chance something to do with your dodgy tummy #exlax (((((((hugs))))))))
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 18:52:40	Now dressed and am dissociating myself from myself. Fine now. #depressed #bipolar #personalitydifficulties
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 18:50:24	I have washed & weighed myself. Raged, screamed, threw stuff. Felt guilty. Wrapped myself up in huge scarf naked on bed crying. Internalised
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-10-01 18:41:36	@Zoe_Smith I am now imagining you walking around nekkid with just rainbow wellies on #randomimagination

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-30 13:45:45	@GamerBipolar there was a time that I thought the same. Then work, marriage, life and 3yr old changed that. Would never say no to a toke tho

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-27 16:29:45	@Zoe_Smith my theory is that they have messed with my chemical balance way too much and the weight gain is depressing me further
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-27 16:25:05	@nuttylotte I have no idea what will happen but at least I will know how I feel. As of this morning I am only taking lithium
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-27 16:23:14	@Zoe_Smith and I no longer want to take chlorpromazine/largactil so we agreed.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-27 16:21:44	@Zoe_Smith cold turkey with anti psychotics tho. Psych agreed to it and even suggested it re olanzapine. #happydays
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-27 16:20:30	@Zoe_Smith a lot of the meds were stopped ages ago but I didn't want to throw them out. Staying with lithium and ditching antipsychotics
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-27 16:12:53	Need to dispense of this lot today. May rescue the lithium for the time being. The rest could kill several people.... http:// twitpic.com/6rb381

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 23:18:02	@Lynda_Jones you do deserve people being nice to you, you have done only positive things on here. Just the gesture was enough for thanks

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 22:38:53	@Lynda_Jones i was being a little sarcastic. You know what mums are like, "Have you done this?, dont forget that " I have had it all week

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 17:45:00	@madsmark1973 i do that sometimes not for the purpose of getting mental but to try and calm the smoking down
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 17:43:36	@nuttylotte also i get confused as to what constitutes a spammer or wrong follower
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 17:24:57	Really must stop attracting spammers or weird spammers. Everyone i follow i love but i dislike spammers. xx

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 14:56:14	@nuttylotte that's quite epic. #lotterocks

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 14:47:10	@GamerBipolar bugger, thats not good. Citalopram had a good go and destroying me too. It didnt help i am allergic to it.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 14:44:59	More #FF @uselesscpn @Bipolar_Foodie @bourach @bonaaar @madsmark1973 possibly more but my mind is not letting me think. Xx

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 14:40:23	@GamerBipolar mainly due to efficacy levels vs side effects etc most older drugs are chemical labotomys
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 14:38:39	@GamerBipolar they really do tend not to prescribe typical anti suckotics. More likely the atypical- olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone etc
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 14:15:50	@GamerBipolar largactil? Dunno chlorpromazine seems 2 be quite clever 2. Haliperadol? Typical (first gen) antipsychotics r good at shutdown
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 14:13:03	@Zoe_Smith absolutely. I am wanting to get everything done in the morning because the afternoon and evening could be awful #damntricks

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 13:52:17	@nuttylotte thx hun. I do understand that people don't necessarily have to like my art. It's how I feel about it that counts. Much love 2 ya
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 13:48:37	I want to do something creative but my brain feels blank and mushy. Possibly meds but I dont know????
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 13:45:33	@nuttylotte after u have done a piece of artwork do you sometimes find yourself creatively drained for a little while after #frustrated
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-23 13:43:33	@nuttylotte *waves back all smiley* marginally better sleep still randomly waking at 4 but much easier to get back to sleep

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 15:07:21	I might just eat breakfast cereal for breAkfast lunch and dinner. May lose weight that way #hatemyfatbody
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 15:05:53	@nuttylotte absolutely had it I went up to 4mg for a day & then gave up and weaned mysf off. Hence visit 2 hospital. Have you told psych doc
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 15:01:22	"Gooooooooood morning vietnaaam!"
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 15:00:45	@bipolarparent ((((hugs))))
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 14:13:33	@nuttylotte genius idea with gloves. I'm sure someone suggested that before. Olanzapine doesn't make me foggy anymore. Seems to be working
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 14:10:38	@nuttylotte yes I weaned myself off risperidone with disastrous effects last week. It really does do fuck all for sleep.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 14:00:58	At least I can Screw my,hands up more by cleaning aggressively. Yay
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 13:59:56	Shit fucking nights sleep. High mood is dissolving thanks to lithium increase and shitty olanzapine. Think I got two hrs good sleep. Uggh.

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 05:11:01	@mycuriousmind have decided not 2 clean tonight but will aggressively clean again tomorrow. Hands have been cleaned & creamed just red now
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 05:07:22	@RA_Fairy got rid of it by replacing it with thoughts of guinea pigs that and taking night time meds & ringing useless hospital. How r u?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 04:37:18	@mycuriousmind my god I know the feeling. My hands are cracked and bleeding from cleaning. It's not enough.((((((hugs)))))))
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-18 04:32:55	@nullfuture party went down well. Ollie loved it. I took plenty of meds. Now feel like shit.

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-10 00:52:55	@nullfuture pretty sure your low rate just indicates good fitness. Panic if below 30.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-10 00:48:03	@nullfuture wish mine was that. I felt blood rushing and heart pounding again earlier....
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-10 00:06:20	It's really hard to unleash the crazy when on lithium and other random meds. Fact. Must rectify this problem...

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-09 05:02:06	2yr old is watching pocoyo on other phone. @stephenfry sounds incredibly cute narrating it. More appropriate to watch than stickmen I think.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-08 19:57:22	@nullfuture huge hugs for you. Sorry u feel shit.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-08 16:45:47	What to do today? That is the question in my mind.

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-08 03:02:01	@Zoe_Smith i'd rather be mental and safe than mental and unsafe. At least if you show willing to co-operate they may not section you. :(
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-08 03:00:11	Now i am soothing my weight gain issues with a white chocolate chip cookie because it really will help (for all of 5 minutes). :(
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-08 02:46:45	@myuntidymind the worst part is i am now sitting here trying to decide whether or not to have some sort of dessert in the form of icecream
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-08 02:45:16	@roseyleeee yeh i did say stupid. It was meant to say "quit medication". ugggh

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:45:30	Gonna struggle to sleep tonight. Many require someone to fetch my meds from kitchen. #cannotbearsed
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:44:16	@nullfuture shows how much confidence I have in the belief in what I am thinking is correct tho. Terrible memory born of bad concentration.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:42:38	@LyndaBPJones thx lynda. I cannot believe I missed it by 2 tweets though. #petty #Nevermindbeingweird
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:35:40	@nullfuture it was that gynecomastia thingy I was saying about earlier... http:// en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecomas tia …
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:29:25	@nullfuture I have decided to get those skull candy earphones. They must be better than standard HTC. Surely?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:23:44	@nullfuture no not at all but cascada doesn't sound half as good when I am sober...
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:22:45	Now on my 1002 tweet. Missed 1000. Doh. I have figured out how to use the twitter app properly to locate my profile. Damn memory issues.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:18:04	@nullfuture hahahaha true.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:16:45	For anyone hurting... I am sorry if this hurts your ears. @nullfuture thought of u http://www. youtube.com/watch?feature= youtube_gdata_player&v=B3ZsLI5O_UA …
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:13:32	@Fifi_lafret it was @meerkatarmy that originally posted I was meant to do it as an rt. Hope she gets the best kind of help.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:13:10	Lalalalala. Eerily ok. Why? What manner of "fine" is this weird shit?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:10:01	@meerkatarmy Not sure if its a good or bad thing?? Really, really hope its a good thing and the fab psych is helping her. Xxx
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 06:06:58	Figured out the follow back thing by searching for my profile. Job done albeit probably the difficult way. Who knows???
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 05:58:11	I appear to have forgotten how to use android twitter app. Err seems I can tweet but how do I follow people back?
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 05:56:38	@nullfuture will give it a go. Not entirely convinced but I have to admit overall I am feeling a little better despite low dose #notasmental
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 05:53:44	I can't remember half the things I have done this evening but am still alive so all is well. Had a better day overall though.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 05:52:00	@nullfuture but overall today has been much better than expected. All the better with seeing you. Good distraction.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 05:51:07	@nullfuture just keep flipping out and going panicky then switching off and being fine. Done it a couple of times this evening. Am ok now.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 05:30:45	Oh bugger. Just got a reminder of why I need the risperidone upping. #stillabitmental
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 05:25:05	@higgy365 was meant to be done as an rt. I hope she gets the best help.

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 04:27:31	@roseyleeee was meant to be done as an RT helen. silly girl!!
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-07 04:25:23	@nullfuture sounds like a quote from my dad. Advice on dealing with docs etc dad always says "keep quiet and say nothing"

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-03 06:01:11	@mycuriousmind music is an amazing stop gap for meds (sometimes). good distraction.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-09-03 05:31:25	@mycuriousmind Yeh know the feeling. Some sort of ear defender / thought defenders required. Or drugs?

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-26 04:25:22	what to do what to do? I guess trying not to catastrophize over anything for the rest of the evening would be a good start? V ridiculous day

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-22 07:15:46	@mybipolarlife I think we most definitely do care. Unfortunately its a matter of, 'what can we really do to help?'. Sadly not a lot. #wecare
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-22 05:09:44	@meerkatarmy who knows? I guess we most definitely won't be the same again but i would like to be able to cope with stress once more. #tired

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-18 06:08:02	@meerkatarmy this is my downfall also. Many a good cup of tea/warm drink/warm meal has not been drank or eaten due to faff-a-lot-itus.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-18 05:59:21	I am sorry if the only tweet i have mustered today is about hot milk going cold. But its the frustration of it, pure rage it has caused me.

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 07:04:25	@roseyleeee u realise at this point that talking 2 yourself like this will get u nowhere? to type it means u r thinking it so no need 2 type
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 07:02:21	@roseyleeee maybe you are just projecting your own feelings of sadness & how you would feel onto how your mother actually feels #selftherapy
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 07:01:00	#rantability mum bought 2 boxes of doughnuts and enough french stick and fiillings for tea but sister just acted weird & went home. Mums sad
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:55:18	sister spent all day in kett with my neices and nephews @park but we phoned her at 5 & she said she wuld only pop in and c us for 30mn
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:50:20	#family we live an hour and a half away yet rarely c my sister. i love her but my mum misses her immensely it makes me sad to see mum upset
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:46:14	@nullfuture it was probably the one person you admired/loved or love the most that didn't give you a hug when you needed it most. #upsetting
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:44:14	@nullfuture indeed less said about that the better. it disturbs me. I am already dealing with this problem as we speak. heads a mess
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:42:59	#family i went from sad 2 angry 2 crying all because i think my sister upset my mum by only staying for 20 minutes b4 going back 2 wisbech
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:39:47	@nullfuture hell i was going to give you some sort of therapy spiel but i figure you already know with your wisdom #notenoughgoodhugsaschild
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:38:35	@nullfuture i like the idea of a hug or at least i would like 2 enjoy a platonic hug, but it often makes me feel awkward & uncomfortable
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:36:11	@nullfuture this idea seems 2 b a recurring theme for u. hugs seem 2 hold great importance for u. yet i am a cold person when it comes 2 hug
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:33:09	2 yr old gone bed... he got upset when i took phone from him. daddy laughed, 2yr old said this "little man falls off cliff and goes all red"
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:28:43	@nullfuture so you didn't go on tour.. you must be feeling utterly shit. This saddens me further that you are there and i cannot help you. x
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:25:55	@nullfuture whatever coping may be.. i don't understand this business of learning self help yet apparently we need to be helped by NHS still
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:24:36	@nullfuture its all ominous... she pretty much insisted she came next week i did argue against it as i really want to try & cope on my own..
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:23:31	@nullfuture did as she said, still a mess, crying at random things, laughing inappropriately, thoughts are bad (ridiculous even) #nevermind
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:21:32	@nullfuture yes things have been interesting 2day. Cpn came, she saw she suggested i go to get my mum and take diazapam regularly....
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-06 06:20:02	My 2 yr old is still not in bed just caught him watching this on youtube using daddys phone http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=Cx3RGJ AXxuA … #verybadparenting #fail

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-05 06:51:03	@nullfuture p.s. i adore my cats. #justsaying #shutuphelen

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-05 06:45:50	@nullfuture I do genuinely love my animals and wouldn't be without them... just wish i didn't want to destroy the things i love the most.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-05 06:43:58	@nullfuture his friend dies also because he believed in all that captain america stands for... followed him into dangerous missions and died
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-05 06:40:19	@nullfuture Captain america saves loads of people but in turn gives up the love of his life... (similar to the start of http://www. imdb.com/title/tt079636 6/ …
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-05 06:37:10	@nullfuture too much that was sad in that film... just tried to tweet it and gave up. I will save this...
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-05 06:29:36	@Zoe_Smith but it may not help as i don't give good hugs. #awkward Still trying 2 remember why i got so upset & found certain bits hilarious
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-05 06:26:28	@nullfuture i am a cat & dog person. Not sure i have a preference anymore though as am used to cats now. I still worry i will kill them tho
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-05 06:22:10	@Zoe_Smith Thank u 4 hug. Not sure its deserved. 2 be fair if i could physically hug u i would...

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-05 06:14:32	@nullfuture my friend found me strange... he didn't think it was sad. I found it so terribly sad, i don't want to spoil it for you though...
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-05 06:12:58	@nullfuture @Zoe_Smith someone has to stand up for cats at least. although i can't talk... i chased 1 of my cats with a knife once... #mad

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-04 04:40:41	@nullfuture in no way am i saying all mental is bad but the stuff that affects our kids and ability to function can go and do one. #foulmood

320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-03 23:15:09	... and i truly believe the Golden retriever could be ideal. A) we have a young child B) we have sensitive cats C)pups r more malleable
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-03 23:13:03	So... i have now started the phase of trying to persuade my husband that a Golden retriever pup would be a good idea. We always wanted a dog
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-03 23:11:27	@CarrieHolroyd yes i watched a bit of angel, i agree cordelia was definitely better in that with her "special" visions. bless her.
320980946	roseyleeee	2011-08-03 22:52:17	@CarrieHolroyd it was an absolute favourite of mine back in the day.. favourite characters were spike and giles. cordelia did my head in
