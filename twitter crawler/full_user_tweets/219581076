219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 04:02:51	@Cyclowarrior i actually agree more motorist do need a change in attitude.also towards other motorists
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:59:03	@Cyclowarrior ppl dont realise how difficult big vehicles are to drive.
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:58:44	@Cyclowarrior I also own a bike lol, was winding up the anally retentive earlier, too easy.
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:55:42	@BONVANCHOVEE @transcotland @PedalScotland @KeithBrownMSP give it rest now its beyond boring now
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:54:59	@Cyclowarrior for the record I detest bad driving just as much in particular mobiles and tailgaiting
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:54:11	@Cyclowarrior ..red lights, jump on and off pavements puttin pedestrians at risk, who squeeze thru traffic on ur blind side then shout at u
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:53:31	@Cyclowarrior its the cyclists on the roads that put themselve in danger that annoy me, I have no problem in general, the ones who run..
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:50:16	@Cyclowarrior agree
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:48:48	@Cyclowarrior bear in mind when we r travelling at spped theres turbulence which could sook him under the vehicle
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:47:34	@Cyclowarrior not right into the next lane but enough to give and others a fright
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:43:44	@Cyclowarrior btw fyi that was roughly my positioning when he suddenly swerved, nearly going underneath, still my fault tho?
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:42:28	@Cyclowarrior @HighwayCodeGB okay, but as i said sudden movement not possible to slow these things down quickly you know
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:37:02	@Cyclowarrior clearly never driven a large commercial vehicle then and what IS ample space iyo
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:24:50	@Cyclowarrior hwen ur driving a very vehicle at 50 mph how easy do u reckon it is to manouver, especially when uv already left ample space
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:18:43	@Cyclowarrior okay then its always the motorist your right
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:13:21	@Cyclowarrior @MrHappyCyclist yeh and other scenarios, i.e duel carraigeway just approaching bike plenty of room he veers out...
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:09:26	@Cyclowarrior @MrHappyCyclist ive seen many cyclist in positions where cars have had to move into a dangerous position to avoid them
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:07:47	@CyclingMikey dont quite think Id lose my license for this thread lol maybe I had done it then yeh no doubt but as if that would happen.
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:06:06	@Cyclowarrior @MrHappyCyclist not necessarily mate.
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:05:29	@CyclingMikey when was the last time you failed to obey a traffic signal, or blind sided a driver squeezing thru traffic dangerously
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:04:50	@CyclingMikey not financially viable to race around and I take very good care of my vehicles. not saying i creep over now and again....
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:03:45	@Cyclowarrior @MrHappyCyclist plenty of good drivers too
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:03:24	@CyclingMikey as ive stated clearly if you had read the whole thread from the start it perfectly clear it was all in jest with a cyclist ;0
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:02:17	@CyclingMikey In my opinion its dangerous as your low down and hard to spot more so in bad weather. NOT ignorant at all its my opinion
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 03:00:26	@CyclingMikey what because you only read half of the thread and got carried away, some assumption to make.
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 02:59:16	@CyclingMikey and pay for the privilage
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 02:58:53	@Cyclowarrior @MrHappyCyclist LOTS of cyclists put themselves in danger
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 02:57:49	@CyclingMikey no points at all. 20 years clean license. And Ive never had an accident on my bike either ;0
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 02:56:56	@CyclingMikey I pay to use my car on the public highway its pretty simple stuff
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 02:55:42	@CyclingMikey lesson not required.
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 02:54:51	@CyclingMikey ..and I do share the road with many like minded motorists who I will agree ur contraption is dangerous compared to a bike
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 02:54:01	@CyclingMikey I thought a bicycle had 2 wheels. not my tough luck I have a nice comfy bmw that keeps me nice and dry on route to work..
219581076	simobhoy	2012-09-17 02:53:07	@CyclingMikey so I pay to use the roads..

219581076	simobhoy	2011-09-01 22:38:29	@ahmebertiee LB looks quite good, but were still lopsided Wilson is the only half decent CB we have now and have virtually no cover there
219581076	simobhoy	2011-09-01 22:36:22	@ahmebertiee I would actually catogorize lennon as a yes man now!!
219581076	simobhoy	2011-09-01 22:35:56	@ahmebertiee sorry if im being a bit sensitive but im still raging at lack of ambition shown by the club AND lennon for not bein ballsy

219581076	simobhoy	2011-09-01 22:22:45	Is Peter Lawell trying to hide his own signing failings by having a dig at Rangers? Stop trying to appease the Celtic fans PL we see thru u!

219581076	simobhoy	2011-09-01 22:14:19	@LadybirdFi Scots uni places should be firstly offered to students educated in Scotland. If English dont like lobby the government.....
219581076	simobhoy	2011-09-01 22:10:32	@bbc5live @ladybirdfi why dont u just leave the scots uni places to the scots?? and lobby ur own government as u lot voted them in!!!!

219581076	simobhoy	2011-07-15 18:00:45	@HortenseOlquin5 Nope ive decided the iphone 4 is bollocks compared to motorola atrix
219581076	simobhoy	2011-07-15 17:58:04	....same old rubbish BB design, poor build quality and slower than a week in the jail.
219581076	simobhoy	2011-07-15 17:56:34	..but software/firmware wise the atrix tops the 3 closely followed by the samsung! New blackberry they sent didnt even get turned on....
219581076	simobhoy	2011-07-15 17:55:10	...personally iphone 4 comes bottom of review list! Atrix and galaxy s are way more powerful and user friendly, all 3 look and feel similar.
219581076	simobhoy	2011-07-15 17:54:15	..idea, sent me i phone 4, samsung galaxy 2 and motorola atrix to play with before i choose my 24 mnth contract, and I must say that...
219581076	simobhoy	2011-07-15 17:53:03	Motorola Atrix, is like having a laptop in ur hand, very powerful, leaves the iphone 4 and BB lagging way behind. T-Mobile have the right...
219581076	simobhoy	2011-07-15 17:51:35	Well if ur looking for a new mobile I heartely reccomend the motorola atrix way better than iphone and a million miles better than blackbery
219581076	simobhoy	2011-07-14 06:30:56	@HIEHamilton and even managed to get us a jeep limo to manhatten for price of a taxi! they were sooo good to us!!
