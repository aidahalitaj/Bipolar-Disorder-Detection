16253011	patientanon	2016-12-18 01:51:02	Pissed off: someone stole my bike out of my Storage Locker in my Building. Never going to ride again due to #epilepsy but was going to sell.

16253011	patientanon	2016-12-13 04:42:26	There are so many many True Crime TV shows from the US. Right now it's refreshing to watch some on BBCC. BBC (Canada.)
16253011	patientanon	2016-12-13 04:26:09	@madblack65 CANNOT wait for my bandages to be changed! They're all messed up. Might tear skin not ready. #seconddegreeburns
16253011	patientanon	2016-12-13 04:19:21	@Feeling_low @FionaArt / Thanks for the inclusion, as always. Also, @madblack65 please note my inclusion here as well.
16253011	patientanon	2016-12-13 03:26:58	I should try some tea. See if that helps. I can manage that with my undamaged right arm. At least no grafts needed. #seconddegreeburns
16253011	patientanon	2016-12-13 03:21:57	I find I'm still having cognitive deficits from all the falls from #Gabapentin . Post-concussion Syndrome still? Plus arm. #seconddegreeburns

16253011	patientanon	2016-12-11 10:55:11	Thanks for the Like @DysthymicDad . "Frosty the Snowman" came on next. It was done in 1969 Durante doing more voicework.
16253011	patientanon	2016-12-11 09:17:40	Watching "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." Made in 1964 and narrated by Burl Ives. THE. BEST.

16253011	patientanon	2016-12-07 05:43:33	My sister and I are talking again. GP knew nothing. No hospital records sent. Surprised to see me holding plushie. Rough shape. Hugs for me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-12-07 02:23:24	Have now been rejected from only family members I can (could) talk to. Mom and Sister. Not telling them about medical issues.. Unless fatal.
16253011	patientanon	2016-12-07 02:15:27	Working on Blog Post but hard. Need to keep my arm straight and rested.
16253011	patientanon	2016-12-07 02:12:43	On accessible transit to GP. Have plushie under coat snuggling my neck. Can't say more #Aspergers than that. *going to sob with GP*
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-29 06:12:17	Waiting for ride home. Telephone appt. Tomorrow. I'm tired. Love to all.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-29 06:09:53	Forget crying and falling apart in Hospital Neuro's arms, she grabbed me first. Held me tight and tried to calm me down.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-28 08:23:23	That's all can write. Have to keep arm straight after they came to charge bandaging today. All
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-28 08:18:07	All that appened, still happening, HUGE #PTSD item in my life. I look at everything, cry. Think of it, cry. Feel intense pain of the burn...
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-28 08:09:27	@SweetBlackElsa Thanks for the Life again and yes, I saw from your Profile we're both on the Spectrum.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-27 05:48:12	Thanks for your Likes @SweetBlackElsa . It means a lot that you came by to say something. It does. Things are very bleak now. Life is awful.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-27 00:46:49	Been home for 2 days after hospital stay? Fell again today. Managed to protect my head. Burn take forever to heal. Hurts! Crying lots.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-25 01:23:17	"Karen! I'd like you to meet..." I look up as my Attending finishes: "YOUR TEAM." Seven Doctors! First out of my mouth? "Holy SHIT!"
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-25 00:52:55	Thanks for all your Likes @RachelRoams . I love you and @BBCWorld ? Give her some love, too!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-24 22:25:54	Still here. No breakfast so more tests. Try different drug. Take mine later as in ER. Try sleep. Said how new felt tonight...? Is 2nd Fave.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-24 16:01:13	The Paramedics forgot my shoes and coat!!! It's winter here! How do I get home? Burnt PA! Frozen PA! Pissed off and tired.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-24 15:56:42	Still here. Realized what was on my arm, size of a softball flattened was a second degree burn. Burn Specialist coming. Staying overnight.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-24 08:30:27	Back down to 200mg gabapentin. Dangerously ill. At ER now. All will be normal, course. Falls banging my head 50+/2days? Hallucinations...
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-21 22:14:28	I think it's the #Gabapentim it I had to mess with it the first t
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-20 02:37:55	I'm a Freelance Writer and Photographer. I don't think anyone would buy my first Script. But who knows? @TeamTaylorLautz @ConstanceZimmer
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-20 02:34:55	Actually, serious question. Who wrote the Script? I've written everything but and want to do that. @TeamTaylorLautz @ConstanceZimmer

16253011	patientanon	2016-11-20 02:18:53	I was wondering if you'd take the bait on that one! Next up, I'm putting it in my Calendar on my Mobile @TeamTaylorLautz @ConstanceZimmer
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-20 02:11:19	Awww, thanks Dru. You have a great weekend too!@DruCrawley @patientanon @Coopsgreenteam @Debbie_L_Moore
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-20 01:52:20	@cactusian Thanks for the Like too @csjensen68 . I'm not getting whatever you write through Twitter; only Gmail. Messy. Like my life! LOL.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-20 01:41:14	@loonydepartment Okay, just an idea. My mind was just shooting everything I could think of that might help. Blah, blah...I'm good at blah.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-20 01:30:21	@bellanatale2004 xx to you back.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-20 01:29:39	@bellanatale2004 I already know my area, a short area south where I do business. I used to live there! But what if I'm lost and clueless?
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-20 01:22:55	@bellanatale2004 Hi, huns, thank you so much. I've always been at home for all the vision losses but what if outside?
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-19 06:45:46	Oh no! Taking hours to email Psychiatrist. He's from NZ. Seeing his patients there. Can't recall departure. Cancel? There? You ok? In email
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-19 02:37:48	Only here because have to make phone calls to Doctors, and email Psychiatrist. I love that. I can email him. Later. Tired.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-18 08:56:47	Think because of not wearing dark, protective eyewear hardly at all today. Let's pretend you're not visually impaired. WHAM! YOU ARE NOW!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-18 08:46:57	Dammit! Lost vision again! In part. Must time this, or when lost completely? I'm still going out though. Use "designer" crutches.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-18 06:38:15	My Eyes! My Eyes! I need to get to the @CNIB Shop ASAP. Antinauseants! STAT!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-18 05:47:33	@RachelRoams @BBCWorld Sorry for hijacking your thread, Rachel.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-18 05:45:12	@RachelRoams Hey! @309_470 . I've seen you around here. Are you serious? Know Account with incredible info? FutureOf... Let me know.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-18 05:24:01	@splendidjasmine @RachelRoams @BBCWorld Yes, that is true.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 08:38:54	@loonydepartment swfl flsw
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 08:12:32	@loonydepartment Thanks for the Likes as always, dear.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 08:09:47	@TeamTaylorLautz @ConstanceZimmer I think I *might* be interested.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 05:12:26	@loonydepartment If that's the case, there are lots of message boards and fora out there. They give just as much intercourse.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 05:10:11	@loonydepartment Or writing as it has less structure and different forms? Or are you looking for an interactive form, with people?
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 05:07:24	@loonydepartment That's just me. As for you? If you get anxious about Twitter being your sole line of expression, journalling?
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 05:04:11	@loonydepartment Some people can stay plugged in 24/7 every second of the day. I would implode! I feel breaks can be healthy. Even small.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 05:00:27	@loonydepartment I also disappear from the online world when I get overloaded. Be it online or real life. #Aspergers and just me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:57:52	@loonydepartment I wasn't well as you know, and am still SL or FW at this point! I still could have gone to Twitter but I just... No talk
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:41:24	@cactusian Easier to write. And sort of mumbly, this, part of wha? I have massive Alexithymia. Therapy helping.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:37:44	@cactusian You're smart. You can probably figure it out. Can't believe I'm telling the whole world this stuff. Or some.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:36:04	@cactusian Thanks again. There's a lot more to tell of growing up, not just at home. The Warrior part is... covers lots of roles and that.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:32:46	Okay. Signing off. I think I forgot to take my meds during the day yesterday. Divided Dose. Still out of it! Love to everyone out there!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:29:59	I also need to learn to walk again. In bed so long with #migraines , med changes, evil #fibroid periods, two viruses in a row. I can't walk!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:25:17	I'll get to you Follow Folks ASAP! I've also been dealing with my sister recently. I almost need to become a Chess Master for that.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:21:20	Finally responded to everyone? Just a few! Almost two weeks and still . Better enough to touch lactose and sugar. Avoid when sick.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:15:46	Hey @HerNameIsDeidre ! Thanks for stopping by! Hope you had fun! I think it might be pretty groovy to meet @ConstanceZimmer too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:11:15	Thanks for the Like @technewsinc
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:01:55	@loonydepartment Thanks for the Like, hon. Very out of fashion for me.......
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 04:00:32	@cactusian There's no such thing as normal. I'm a bit of a wounded warrior you could say though?
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 03:58:43	@cactusian Thanks for all the Likes, hon. I don't mind telling you. Or anyone. Or, hell! The entire world since I wrote it on Twitter?
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-17 03:54:36	@cactusian I concede. Only you are the Prickly. *bows down*
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 23:54:33	Up really early with a tiny bit of energy. Starting to get over virus? 10 days! I'm going to take that energy and use it for me. #selfcare
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 04:47:48	Oh. How could I forget? @TeamJJonesCurl ! GO! GO! GO! OR NOT, GO! GO! GO!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 04:32:04	
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 04:30:45	I use gmail. Just got an email. Red lock icon in subject line. Their email provider not using #TLS Be alert! #tech #InternetSecurity #geek
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 03:25:44	@cactusian Oh, zee tread is order after all! I was thinking when I said looked "Caucasian" I looked "Cactusian."
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 03:19:17	@cactusian However, they say you always turn into your parents. Enough of her nutcase genes! I try to monitor BOTH who raised me!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 03:10:00	@cactusian Now that I've become an adult, I look like my Mom. Fine features but mine are more angular. More. Odd looking at old photos.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 03:04:03	@cactusian You'd never know now. I look "Caucasian." I have a picture of my daddy but it's taken so you can't see him well at all.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 03:00:20	@cactusian I was lied to. I was a lot darker in complexion growing up and there are older generations to explain the genetics. NOT TRUE.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 02:56:51	@cactusian I was 29, I think? Close to 30. I felt totally betrayed because I KNEW EVERYONE KNEW. I'm talking entire extended families.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 02:51:20	@cactusian This whole thread is a mess! Twitter has been doing that to me lately! So we talked. A tiny part of me knew? Subconsciously?
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 02:47:52	@cactusian Next question. "Is there anything you want to tell me?" He said he'd meet me at my apartment. I went to pick up a case of beer.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 02:44:55	@cactusian Then, lightening fast question: "If I was adopted, would you want me to know?" Right back, he screamed, "No!" Gotcha. Bastad.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 02:36:15	@cactusian Files given to Therapist I was seeing after discharge. Told me and I became furious. Asked if something based upon my reaction?
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 02:32:02	@cactusian So, how did I find out? In hospital and father of sister and mine who raised said to Psych that I was adopted but didn't know.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 02:21:36	@cactusian Odd prelude? This is a long story, Mom went outside the marriage but hardly a sin compared to the abusive ass who raised...
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 02:18:00	@cactusian So I lost mine in utero. Then, the mentalness and pain of a religiously deluded mother and a kid, Chosen by God to Live. Me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 02:08:50	@cactusian This is true. Mom had a massive miscarriage and suffice it to say, enough to lose a small embryo within the blood. Maybe another?
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 02:04:23	@cactusian Well, first was this when fairly wee. Told I "had a lost twin" "was a surviving twin" "the twin that survived" etc.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 01:56:19	Thanks for the Like @Chilleh7
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 01:55:22	@cactusian Nope.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 01:53:29	Thanks for the Like @Chilleh7 !
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 01:45:22	@alphabetania I think that's where the Monty stops and the surreal comes in. It's shocking. Even as a Canuck, I had more faith in America.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 01:36:43	@alphabetania NO Kidding. I can't even believe it started from Day One. I thought it was a total joke. America attempts Monty Python.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 01:16:33	@ConstanceZimmer Apart from any #Quinning that might be going on as I mentioned above, I do hope you're alright too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 01:10:52	@ConstanceZimmer No matter the reason, just one word or a string of profanity, a la #Quinning , is the only way to express things.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 01:01:42	@ConstanceZimmer @HerNameIsDeidre You look so tiny beside them! Adorable!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 00:57:05	Thanks for your RT too @downey_damon
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 00:54:42	Thanks for the RT @irishgerrie ! Your #epilepsy support counts! #advocacy
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-13 00:52:05	Hi @downey_damon . That's why we have to keep fighting. We need to work with people; help educate them. We can't give up. #epilepsy #advocacy
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-12 04:30:30	Before anything else, I have to say, Bless You #LeonardCohen . A Master Amongst Thieves; A Thief Amongst Masters. Thank you for your gifts.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-11 02:18:21	@VICE Before it grabs you?
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-11 02:15:27	@cactusian By names. Only way to identify. Aunt, her two children, so cousins. And daddy had another girl. So I have a sister. Saddening.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-11 02:08:28	@cactusian But so much has changed in Pakistan, those parts of the world. But from other letters my Mom gave to me? I have more family.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-11 02:05:52	@cactusian Hi Prickly! Thanks for the Like. *big hugs* I wish I could meet my daddy. Don't even know if he's alive. Was in Qatar too...
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-11 01:58:55	@downey_damon Did anyone stop to help me? No. Too busy to get out of the rain. At least the Cops didn't get me. #epilepsy #advocacy
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-11 01:54:14	@downey_damon I also went non-verbal because of my #Aspergers . On the ground, soaked. Limbs everywhere, grunting. Pretty sight. #epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-11 01:50:46	@downey_damon I seized in the pouring rain one night. I tucked under a small alcove. Then comes the Todd's paresis! #epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-11 01:46:53	Thanks for the Like @downey_damon ! It's a damn shame, isn't it? Let's hope it can be fixed. #epilepsy discrimination or lack of care. Awful.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-11 01:34:35	@VICE Like @clovrmay_7 I too should choose my words carefully. I could pull out so many, but the best would be love and care to Londoners.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 09:31:25	I've never been so sick as right now, to actually wear my procedure gloves to avoid cross-contamination. And yes, they're touchpad friendly.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 09:15:43	@RachelRoams Have fun! Did I really need to say that? *huge eyeroll* xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 06:20:54	@CNN Thanks for the Like @loonydepartment
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 06:19:39	@CNN I came back to Canada as a baby. I have a letter he sent to me. I was seven years old. Please stay strong ALL fearing discrimination.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 06:10:57	Watching @CNN with tears. Fine, I'm Canadian. I'm 46, a different time. My father was from Karachi. He risked his life for mine. But lived.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 05:22:18	Crap! Forgot to check people who didn't end up in Gmail! You are very patient. I just saw an old friend now! But will be back. xx

16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 03:45:44	@vicecanada @VICE There's also marriage. Massive appeals everywhere when Gay Marriage became Legal in Canada. Any marriages now? Sure!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 03:32:56	@bellanatale2004 Me too, babe. I feel like shit. I know you like #Moby so hey, just put up RT of article in Hollywood Reporter.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 03:24:57	And this is why Twitter is so quiet today... https:// twitter.com/THR/status/796 402037973884928 …

16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 03:06:41	@ConstanceZimmer
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 02:38:23	@InfiniteKnot So I hope I cleared that up for you. *sighs* We've probably talked about this before. I still don't get it from the start.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 02:30:09	@InfiniteKnot But DON'T BACK DOWN!!! Don't be bullied! You have rights so fight for them! He can't re-write the Constitution. Plus more.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 02:25:14	@InfiniteKnot Ripples in a pond...I just woke up and the more I type to you the angrier I can feel myself getting.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 02:22:25	@InfiniteKnot I totally agree with you. I was only referring to the ones who put him in Office. THEY fucked not only the US up but others.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 02:18:57	@InfiniteKnot I'm not sure if people somehow got trapped in a bizarre life meets art, in the form of tabloid journalism. I don't understand.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 02:13:09	@InfiniteKnot It's like a, "I never signed up for this!" Guess what? Some idiot forged your signature. It is scary! Once you stop laughing.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-10 02:09:24	@InfiniteKnot I meant those that made it happen. Then, thanks for bringing all into what you've created. And not just in the US.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-09 12:15:48	@doc_rob I could come up with one too but I'm now on 300mg of Gabapentin beddy time. Just took now. Almost sliding of bed.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-09 11:58:59	@JenniKonner @ConstanceZimmer Hey. We're nice, your neighbours to the north. We'll make room. Come on up!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-09 11:40:10	Sleep. Sadly, I predict Trump to win. You will all reap what you created from the seeds you planted. And take everyone else with you.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-09 11:12:37	Maybe I should just go to bed. Wake up, see who won tomorrow. Me seeing the sun rise won't change the outcome. #ElectionNight *sick yawn*

16253011	patientanon	2016-11-02 07:11:44	Paradox effect from upping Gabapentin. 300mg. 200 not exactly working. Split. Liquid I found 250 pharmAcy will compound if necessary.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-02 01:14:11	The post-Halloween Spin the Whatever. My neighbour wanted two cigarettes. He always gives me 50 cents. He had no coins, so pay back with...?

16253011	patientanon	2016-11-02 00:49:27	Yes re: right person. I could get all #Aspie Wingy. Being behind a screen at times isn't even good enough for us. @loonydepartment
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-02 00:31:54	@loonydepartment I have been doing it for for years, and my "Objects of Attraction" have been great friends for long, long times!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-02 00:27:11	@loonydepartment I have a terrible habit of turning Twitter into a Dating Service. Or at least my own Dating Service!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-02 00:08:04	@loonydepartment So, seriously. What do you do? DM someone you have a crush and tell them? I tell them when I first meet them!
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-02 00:02:11	@loonydepartment Thanks. Ooop! Now comes your answer? Not in a DM though. You could have lied in your Tweet.
16253011	patientanon	2016-11-01 23:58:03	@loonydepartment Way back we didn't have all of these "_____ days." I don't even understand them! So DM person you have crush on. Tell them?

16253011	patientanon	2016-10-31 04:16:36	@Kerby_Rosanes I'm sick right now. This could be a gift but I noticed something odd. Your book is helping me with my Neuro and Motor Skills!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-31 04:09:34	@Kerby_Rosanes Again, I can't say how awesome you are, and your work is as well. I have the orange book "animorphia." I am so addicted!

16253011	patientanon	2016-10-31 03:27:27	@loonydepartment I meant I was ignoring Games 3,4 b/c of losses, AND the whole stats of "Winner of 3 takes Series." #WorldSeries #GoCubsGo
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-31 03:21:08	@loonydepartment Oh! You found the ! Freakin' big enough to miss? o.O so . Missed 1,2 but on track now. #WorldSeries #GoCubsGo
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-31 03:11:37	@loonydepartment I'm also ignoring Games 3 and 4. We have FL and SW, right? Well, they can be FSFW. #WorldSeries #GoCubsGo

16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 09:31:20	@Zinquefty ok bed now doll. Talk very soon. Wish I didn't have to go! Gotta start the brain fry...ox
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 09:28:58	@Zinquefty That's actually a good idea. Motivation to learn by choice not force. Meanwhile, teaching remains the same.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 09:26:05	@Zinquefty I was reading WELL beyond my age. Yes. Different, too. Uni. Texts a breeze between 10-12.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 09:19:20	@Zinquefty I understood it too, of course!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 09:17:44	@Zinquefty Thanks. I was like a trained monkey for lots as an #Aspie kid. Once I stood and read Shakespeare for Dinner Guests. I was 10yrs?
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 09:10:25	@Zinquefty Going to bed now hon. Not sure what increasing the Gabapentin a second time will do.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 09:06:45	@Zinquefty Also, there are two things I never talk about anymore. Politics and Religion. Did enough as "cute" #Aspie kid.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 09:04:32	@Zinquefty Politics is Politics. Always has been; always will be. Nobody will be satisfied with "everything."
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 08:56:48	@Zinquefty Personally? I don't think you have to ask!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 08:55:54	@Zinquefty Are we having an election? That's what being sick forever gets you! Some bitchin' about Hil's stuff but #Trump haters. So Pro H.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 08:43:08	@Zinquefty I know darling. Just trying to be funny. HaHaHa. Am I funny? I guess we'll have to let the Jury decide.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 08:36:53	@Zinquefty I don't think #Trumpland at the #Debates2016 counts, does it?
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 07:34:45	Second try. My body is perfectly stable on 200mg of Gabapentin. So tonight, begin final 300mg. LOOK OUT!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 06:38:33	@Feeling_low @BPSOfficial @Mind_Out / Thanks for the inclusion as always.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-29 03:20:44	So mad re: the article I put up! My Complex partials? I'm unconscious. I can look nuts! But we're not harmful unless provoked! #epilepsy

16253011	patientanon	2016-10-28 01:54:56	@chukdefatey @WIND_Cares / Sorry. Must have been mistaken. *whistles and walks away*
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-28 01:04:11	@PublicMobile Plus @WINDmobile was acquired by @ShawInfo a while ago. People were scared but it actually means more money for us, yes?
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-28 01:00:35	@PublicMobile I could list HOW MUCH I get from @WINDmobile for $50 incl. tx. Mobilicity tanked. These are the now the BIG GUNS.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-28 00:56:43	@PublicMobile THAT'S where you need to look closely at @WINDmobile . They offer the most amount of services for the least amount of cost.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-28 00:52:41	@PublicMobile Hi. @WINDmobile already had it on their network so it was free. Apart from Mobile Sales, Provider income from Customer Plans.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-28 00:44:49	@WIND_Cares Thanks guys. Just sending a Global Message. I know it can also be Store Dependent. Still, best Sales Move ever. @ShawMedia
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-28 00:30:55	@letsdance51 @InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Like and chiming in! @ampmART
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-27 02:13:50	@WINDmobile Any iPhones coming back? I've been checking, but nothing. Adopting them for sale was the best thing you ever did!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-26 00:38:47	@ConstanceZimmer @ELLEmagazine @robbiemyers @LKBennettLondon @Violetartistry Wow! Very, "Quinn Wins Every Award for #unReal ." @ShiriAppleby
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-25 07:15:36	Nuclear Sick. So, appropriately watching "Resident Evil" at the moment. C'mon, Alice...give me those big, green eyes... RAWR!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-25 06:31:16	@MillaJovovich Disgustingly ill in bed but RE and RE Apoc. coming up on TV. Or I could watch Ultra? Your shit never gets old. Compliment!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-25 04:26:46	I don't know why someone hasn't just stamped SICK on my forehead, and tossed me into the gutter by now. Irrespective of #migraines alone.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-25 04:22:14	Feeling a little "uncomfortable" today. Tested chocolate for #migraine . Not sure if an issue. Woke up and ! Also woke up with virus too !
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-25 04:12:07	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for all the Likes!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-21 00:09:37	In bed watching nothing but #anime on this one TV channel. Totally love BLACK JACK and hey! Up comes Young Black Jack. Happy girl :)
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 23:47:18	@InfiniteKnot Only on my max. dose of Gabapentin for a couple of weeks? I'm charting and it's weird to see how much I just ignored the pain.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 23:43:30	@InfiniteKnot Second is if patient has not responded to every possible medical treatment available at no cost. So right now everything is ??
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 23:39:56	@InfiniteKnot Two ways: Patient requires high cost drugs not covered by Government Disability. I had to do this for triptans but now okay.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 23:33:30	@InfiniteKnot If not Botox Is last option. $$$!!! Hospital Neuro is on top of it. Here we have a program that could help though.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 23:26:16	@InfiniteKnot So that's how I'm feeling a bit. Gabapentin for #migraines as Propranolol not working. I hope this works!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 23:23:15	@InfiniteKnot I'm an Alien from Outer Space.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 23:22:03	@InfiniteKnot Then, OMG! My damn head! Gritting Teeth! More anger. Sitting not knowing what to say again. Final Conclusion?
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 23:16:36	@InfiniteKnot Now put on Gabapentin and it makes me so sleepy, totally sedating, silence, don't know what to say, looking sideways, sneaky?
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 23:12:01	I use it. Quite lovely. Door to door service. LOL. Then, going to Doctor, sick (migraines) thinking about it all, mad, photophobia.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 23:05:29	@InfiniteKnot Apart from our regular transit system, we have another that drives people who can't take people who are disabled or whatnot.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 23:02:49	@InfiniteKnot Oh, this? Trying to be funny. Tweet to use no words. Okay. Listening to music while being driven by a special form of transit.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 22:57:12	No doubt it will continue. I've been sleeping days away so my Tweets might look disastrous!@loonydepartment
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 22:54:54	Thanks for the Likes Doll!@loonydepartment
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 22:53:29	And thanks for the RT too!@madblack65 @BBCRadio4 @jamiecullum
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 22:52:22	Thanks for the Like you gorgeous girl too! xx @madblack65 @BBCRadio4 @jamiecullum
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 06:53:58	I see dead people. OMG. First and last #Halloween Joke I will EVER make. #LAME I will get back to dead people.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 06:47:24	Ah, screw these things. Headed home now. I can't believe I cried a bit seeing my Psychiatrist. A big #Aspie WTF for me. Need bed.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-20 04:28:01	
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-16 04:38:53	@RachelRoams Thanks for your recent Likes too. I've been in another Land lately. Not sure if you've ever been there. Big Pharma. Very odd.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-16 04:34:14	@RachelRoams By the way, I LOVED (lusted?) the hat you were wearing while drinking coffee! I'm a total hat person!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-16 04:14:46	Very much acquired taste do to texture. I just described what I had raw before. Raw? Swallow immediately. @RachelRoams @LeeAbbamonte
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-16 04:08:57	I've had spiced, but not too much to take the real taste away. Then straight down mouth from shell! @RachelRoams @LeeAbbamonte
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-16 03:42:23	Thanks for the Like @holynotes . Feather is here. Although, do I have a plume? Am I getting more stable? Sleep... Well, Feather Love to All!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-16 03:24:18	@Morevoices Thanks for the Like @PMD_Respiratory
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-16 03:18:07	@loonydepartment Sorry. Very poor grammar. Still side effects but people talking to me so thought I'd hop on Twitter and stuff.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-16 03:15:56	@loonydepartment I hold myself to higher standards than others, so I really beat myself up. Plus, the moods you're already experiencing.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-16 03:12:40	@loonydepartment I'm very familiar with that feeling. That's why I noted it as a Trigger. But I still fight with myself as you did at times.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-16 03:06:11	@madblack65 Thanks for the Like, RT and link! Could I love you more? NO. Props to you @BBCRadio4 from across the pond. Love @jamiecullum !
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-16 02:48:16	@THR @ConstanceZimmer Thanks @Woodyman502 . I love it when people (intelligently) do things like that!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-14 06:01:13	@isseynfarran Nice pic, Issey!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-12 02:26:43	No more Twitter. Gabapentin today to final titration. Also @Zinquefty I had a thought about fall etc. Could be simply too fast titration.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-12 02:19:16	@loonydepartment It's not "illogical." It's a "trigger." I beat myself up too. I think where you are right now? The Appt change? Trigger!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-12 02:07:25	@madblack65 Hi hon. Missed you on @BBCRadio4 ! Bugger! Could have picked it up here! Know you were awesome, amazing. Love ya, Mad Maddie. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-11 10:05:10	@THR @ConstanceZimmer Nice one. I was seriously waiting for them to start dancing!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-11 00:04:06	Thanks @Morevoices . A lot of people in Canada don't understand how our System works. It's different for each person of the whole.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-10 23:56:16	I hear you @unitybelle ! But it's over now. Time for healing and recovery. Lots of oxygen so we can breathe too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-10 11:45:23	Hey @unitybelle ! Long time. Thanks for the RT. Take care and hope all's good.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-10 11:40:09	Hi @Morevoices , Thanks for stopping by. I couldn't write everything! So, hey. Use what's in the Debate! Everyone is watching it!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-10 10:57:28	Hate #Trump /Hate #Clinton , I think she's on the way to setting up a good Health Care System. People forget it takes a long time.. #debate
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-10 10:42:02	#Trump is wrong about Canadian Health Care. One? "Canadians" going to the the U.S. for medical reasons. Rich ones.They still have to pay.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-10 10:28:25	@Zinquefty That would be my part of the pop. I am completely deplorable! Plus I have a disability.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-10 10:09:27	@patientanon Thank you very much for the Like whoever you are. If you see this? You're a mystery. I can't find you. #Debates2016
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-10 09:48:54	It would be great if #Trump would actually ANSWER the questions BEING ASKED? #wishfulthinking #Debates2016
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-10 09:04:34	@VICE Is Yoko Ono going to make an appearance?
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-10 06:56:09	Going to start penciling in and drawing the gift given to me. "animorphia"© by @Kerby_Rosanes . Stellar Art! But eyes blurry! Hey! Better!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-08 09:35:51	Am I a hypocrite? I think #Trump should be sexually assaulted so he'd know what's coming out of his mouth. I managed. Could he?
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-08 09:17:49	@RachelRoams First Step: Learn Self Defense. I'm a tiny thing with a cane. Perfect Target? No, perhaps your Very Wrong Target.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-08 09:07:23	@RachelRoams I too stand up for and with you all. Don't be afraid to tell someone if you've been assaulted. It's NOT your fault.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-08 08:48:37	And in other breaking news, they must have installed cameras while I was gone...He just came to...I want a full sweep now! Everything! NOW!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-08 08:43:15	@RachelRoams
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-08 08:42:32	I'm right behind you, Rachel! Always! https:// twitter.com/RachelRoams/st atus/784554093801013248 …
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-08 08:37:51	@RachelRoams @TheAtlantic I change my comment. I meant "promotes" it. Reading these others? Our Trudeau issues were a sneeze. Comic Relief!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-08 08:18:18	Disgusting. https:// twitter.com/RachelRoams/st atus/784544024904474624 …
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-08 08:16:24	@RachelRoams @TheAtlantic Rachel, thank you for speaking up about being sexually assaulted. I have been too. In context here, he permits it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-07 07:52:41	Okay @Kerby_Rosanes ! Visually impaired indeed, but I'm going to get all trippy and colour my pressie "animorphia"© Nice work! Outstanding!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-07 07:38:26	My friend gave me a pressie. Something to do while stuck in bed. It's a colouring book. Dude! I'm visually impaired! https://www. amazon.com/Kerby-Rosanes/ e/B00VOUPDL6 …
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-07 02:55:54	@beyondxdarkness missed too x
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-06 04:03:18	@loonydepartment Oh, it's fine. Don't be sad. I tell everyone in jest I've hit my head on every hard surface you can name. True. #epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-06 03:20:39	@loonydepartment Hi. Per last Tweet, Falling Loser. I'm fine. I've taken a ba-jilliion falls with #epilepsy I Know how to protect head.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-06 03:13:05	Checking for Bedbugs here (yay, don't have.) Talking to people. Search dogs so cute. Oops Moment. Trip, fall, Maintenance Guy caught me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-06 02:59:48	@loonydepartment
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-05 23:25:32	Gabapentin. from 100mg to 200mg. I know nothing. Not even you. Well, you're all fading away so just wanted to let you know.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-03 09:18:47	@RachelRoams You don't even HAVE to be a Pirate as a #Pastafarian ! The #FSM is cool about everything. Uber-cool about our Heaven.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-03 09:12:59	@RachelRoams Including everyone else. Not just we, the Pastafarians. The #FSM has NO bias. Everyone is equal.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-03 09:10:01	@RachelRoams DOESN'T EVERYONE KNOW BY NOW IT WAS THE #FSM ! Everything started with his Blessed, Noodly Appendages!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-02 06:27:09	Back to the Gabapentin Lab. Washing about five dishes sends me back to my bed.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-02 06:23:50	So, I guess a huge GLOBAL APOLOGY if I miss you Following me. I'll have to remember regular checks. Some people pissed off or gave up?
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-02 06:17:19	Don't get it when people are Following me, and I only know when I click ON people Following me on my Profile Page. Thanks, #Twitter
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-02 06:08:28	Hey, 'sup dawgs? Greets from Gabapentin Cray Cray Psych Lab. Coma-like feelings ain't too bad? So big shout out to y'all. Love and peace.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-01 03:58:05	@Zinquefty But would LOVE to see you! Timing is just not on our side. Unless I feel better before next increase on Monday but don't know.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-01 03:55:39	@Zinquefty Possibly near comatose on the Gabapentin. My writing might betray how spaced out I am.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-01 02:04:19	@Zinquefty I forgot to say, I'm leaving all my anime and manga to you. Even if we're having Wheelchair Races in our 90's.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-01 01:37:17	@Zinquefty Financially, I believe I should be quite stable and liquid by government money now, CPP, LIRA. Final must be 65/66.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-01 01:30:50	@Zin Who knows whom is going to die when but the most important thing is coverage financially for her debt. Long Term Care, too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-01 01:27:29	@Zinquefty Yes. Emergency Contact, Mom's Death, Will(s?) Not knowing her finances have to talk Mom into Life Insurance. I'm broke. Her debt!
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-01 00:41:18	Whatever the hell is going on with my sister (don't care about them) changes total health and financial issues, papers, severely.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-01 00:35:15	Will my sister stay without marrying my cousin? She quit her job. What about mortgage for house? Did she sell it? Friend paid for ticket.
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-01 00:24:55	I'm wondering if my sister is planning to stay across the country and marry my cousin. It's okay. Legal here, not like "Deliverance."
16253011	patientanon	2016-10-01 00:17:59	Switch Up on #DepecheMode Lyrics: "Death is everywhere, there is family on the windscreen...come here, kill me, now..."
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-30 07:35:44	I'll stop referring to myself as "Feather" now. It's getting stale. Goodbye Twitter.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-30 07:32:35	But let me tell you, Tony Stark is a prick. After dressing suits, and Feather is working on web shots, he takes off saying, "I'm faster!"
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-30 07:09:12	Feather not resting! Txts to friend Tony Stark. Helps her out. Now, must be her alter Spiderman. But all they do is talk about saving lives.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-30 03:37:46	Feather feels good she cleaned up her Twitter Business. Now, she's going to float back to bed. Fly as high as you can everyone!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-30 03:30:54	Hey @letsdance51 . Thanks for speaking up too. It is absolutely the the truth! @InfiniteKnot
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-30 03:21:05	@loonydepartment and @birdonthehead Thank you! Love, Feather xoxo
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-30 03:18:50	@loonydepartment I guess that means you know which one? Pretty easy to figure out.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-30 03:16:18	Alrighty, then. Let Feather try and talk here, despite the fact that starting Gabapentin has made her feel she's in chemical restraints.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-29 07:21:49	Love to you all, Feather. xo #Gabapentin #Migraines Whoa. Sittin' in the corner with a drool cup? That joke about Anticonvulsants? True!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-29 07:16:18	Gabapentin is knocking me over like a feather and giving me the brain of a feather too. Don't know where Feather, here will be but she's...?
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-28 05:33:13	Initializing Gabapentin. Subject on target. Firing... BOOM! I think we got her. I'll stay here just to make sure. Lots of ammo.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 10:19:48	@Ontheflipside09 Thanks for this too. I kind of felt like saying it out loud though, you know? Like pulling out this splinter in my finger.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 10:15:53	@Ontheflipside09 Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 10:05:07	@patientanon I won't go further into the physical. Basically, I am more of a train wreck than years ago. And people don't like me on Twitter
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 10:01:15	G'night folks. If I go dark, I'm sick. But I see you talking to me.Being sick is damn near paralytic, depressing with menopausal depression
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 09:53:37	@patientanon Wow. He did love me. Both loved the Stranglers. He gave me his album "The Gospel According To The Men In Black." Silly? No way.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 09:37:22	@patientanon Now a HUGE flood of memories. But all good. I call him my "only" boyfriend because he was. Yes, slept with men before. #gblt
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 09:23:47	Have you ever been given something that you never touched from an ex-partner? Well, here I go to an album from the sweetest...
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 09:18:42	Hey @ELECTR0N1TE . Thanks for showing up. Don't be afraid to come by and talk about my brain that's the world's birthday party every day! x
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 08:49:02	@loonydepartment I have my favourite Member. He was nobody's favourite. That should tell you who!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 08:47:00	@loonydepartment Think The Band. Not too hard? ROTFLMAO!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 08:45:37	@loonydepartment Indeed.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 08:44:55	Nothing like vinyl. It's the authentic music, how it is, was. CDs dulled it. I'm blasting Mighty Lemon Drops now. CD that volume? No. BOOM.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 08:32:07	@loonydepartment And you're another one! And a lovely one at that. *conjures saying that in your accent*
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 08:02:42	@loonydepartment Well, not naff. Just more boring. How do I know a lot of terms? Had lots of Blog Readers everywhere across pond.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 07:58:15	@loonydepartment Bloody Disaster! Falling too? Always bedridden. We gotta find good Brit names for FL and SW. Canada bit naff but could try?
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 07:54:07	@loonydepartment First day out of bed walking decently but neuronal desperation to see Doctor about how to handle it. Blind, can't talk, bed
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 07:49:54	@loonydepartment Yeah. FL has been going dark a lot. How Military Spy of me. More fun than off the radar. Terribly sick with #migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 07:24:22	@loonydepartment
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 07:23:11	@patientanon Okay! I guess it flew home! No need to translate what I wrote in English to Haitian anymore. Spooky...
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 07:20:08	Is my mobile somewhere in Haiti?
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 07:18:54	@loonydepartment I'm not there. Neither is my mobile. Maybe it doesn't need all of my medication so it really IS there. Spooky...
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 07:14:37	Thanks. I'm so out of it, I spelled one wrong! It's Lansoprazole! Also, exactly why are my Tweets saying "Translate From Haitian" O_o
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 04:41:10	And so much more than can be described up there!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 04:38:03	@patientanon And the funny thing is, I need all this medication. Here's where the love of my love/hate relationship with Big Pharma pops up.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 04:23:41	I love my life. I really do.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 04:20:53	Neuro at hospital is trying to get coverage for Botox injections too. I got a #migraine seeing the cost! Pain free AND beauty! No. Hardly.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 04:10:20	I'm a walking pharmacy. My meds: Topamax, Lamictal, Clobazam, Seroquel, Biphentin, Propranolol, Valium (prn) Lansoprasole, now Gabapentin.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 04:03:56	I am laughing so hard because I don't know what to do! At hospital and #migraines refractory. Added Gabapentin. I'm a walking pharmacy!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 03:57:32	@Karabo_Mokgoko Thanks for the Follow too!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 03:53:14	@GiftMeWords Thanks for the Follow!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-27 03:51:26	@DruCrawley @Gen7Schools @lilginger864 / Thanks for that!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-25 03:05:00	Friend coming to take me grocery shopping. Only crumbs on my floor. Said I'd wait to take any Gravol or he'd have to put me in the cart.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-25 02:40:25	@InfiniteKnot Oh, yes. I forgot. A #TIA . That certainly fits. I am so sick of my head! All of it! Someone, please prepare the Guillotine!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-25 01:59:33	@InfiniteKnot Oops. Was wrong. No headache. Eye pain and less around socket a bit. Pressure is new. Good lord!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-25 01:33:25	@InfiniteKnot Yes. It's part of the ergot family. I agree. We're all unwell, and some VERY sick. Big Pharma and the Government are healthy!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-25 00:37:34	Eye Break...
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-25 00:34:11	@InfiniteKnot I figure what's the point of hospital when I'm going to see her in a couple of days. Retinal detach? If go blind again, yes!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-25 00:29:35	@InfiniteKnot I can't wait to see her Monday. No #Migraine pain anymore. Eye pain, blurry and a lot of pressure behind my eye.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-25 00:19:41	@InfiniteKnot Just for short measure, blind (or so impaired as close?) One eye. May or may not precede, accompany a #Migraine at all.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-25 00:12:45	@InfiniteKnot However, the signs and symptoms are quite different! Ocular, change or altered vision, not blind, both eyes.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-25 00:07:37	@InfiniteKnot An Ocular Migraine can also be referred to as a "Migraine Aura." What I had was a Retinal Migraine. See name confusion?
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-25 00:01:55	@InfiniteKnot Confused term: Ocular Migraine. Used overall but not for what I had which is much more serious, even medically. #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-24 23:54:37	@InfiniteKnot I've been looking into this. I was curious about the area-occipital lobe-and cranial nerves lately (pain!) #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-23 23:23:47	@MySpinningHead Thanks. Try not to be just a training wheel on a bike today. Sunglasses and mindless TV for me now. Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-23 23:17:01	@MySpinningHead Thanks for the Follow. Your location made me laugh. Although, it could make you famous. You are the axis of the planet!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-23 23:05:10	@InfiniteKnot I wish friggin' #ergotamines were still around to give them a try. Botox not covered by Disability! #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-23 22:58:40	@InfiniteKnot Going blind! I mean, seriously? That's just not right. A #TIA ? Several? Propranolol not effective? BP now. Ugly. #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-23 22:48:36	@InfiniteKnot I also know of #Meniere 's. My Nana had it and really struggled. More to discuss we Hospital Neuro now. #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-23 22:42:44	@InfiniteKnot Oh, I meant new things every day. What was that syndrome for what we were talking about? Tinnitus and pain? That it? Name?
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-23 22:38:58	@InfiniteKnot This is starting to get rather ridiculous. New things are happening and now I'm going blind. Not just spots? #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-23 22:36:35	@InfiniteKnot Then felt like I was actually punched in the eyeball. Then of course all the pain fell back from there. #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-23 22:31:15	@InfiniteKnot Woke up blind in right eye yesterday. Not kidding! Complete blackness. 15min. or bit more to regain vision. #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-23 21:32:34	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for showing up @itsTommyJames . Pain in the head too?
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-20 04:30:07	@ConstanceZimmer You know, you are just fantastic. I told you after one episode that Quinn terrified me! Constance? She makes me laugh!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-20 03:26:23	B2b©
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-20 03:23:36	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. OMG. Everyone wants to talk on the phone for appointments! #TBI people! Done now? Mumbly again. Could it be? #TIA
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-20 01:39:41	OMG. I've had worse #TBI issues but this TBI is WAY up the list on its own! Could barely MUMBLE yesterday. TBI+Mumble sometimes bad.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-20 01:18:01	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Like @birdonthehead and getting involved in the discussion.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-20 01:14:41	@InfiniteKnot Sorry about your experience. However, I might be wearing blinders. When trying for a new GP, one a snob, I can fix everything.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-20 01:10:12	@InfiniteKnot I needed a new GP. Nothing to do with gender bias. Just curious about having a Female Doctor. I love her. *swoons*
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-20 01:08:02	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. I always saw Male Doctors but didn't care. Just as long as they knew what they were doing! Then a change.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 04:03:33	B2b catch up everyone later. I think I missed some people. Sorry if did. Gray Matter coming out of ears.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 04:00:24	@InfiniteKnot Indeed. Got VERY lucky. Female too! Hard to find women there? SO GO WOMEN INTO NEUROLOGY!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 03:54:54	@InfiniteKnot First Splint? Perfect. Then later, I went all "Rare Category" in my life again, and they couldn't make one for me!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 03:51:11	@InfiniteKnot Hmmm. Well, yes. Even ones sporadic can hurt people's necks. I'm so out of it too my Physiology! Cranial Nerves causation!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 03:45:20	@InfiniteKnot Bite Splint and pain meds. OTC.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 03:43:42	@InfiniteKnot Oh, yeah? That's... I was going to say awesome but not so much? You know what I mean. Hospital Neuro is Ace.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 03:39:14	New txt term. Or not? b2b© like brb, but it means back to bed. So b2b
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 03:27:57	@InfiniteKnot Or it could be something else. LOL. Gravol! Stat!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 03:26:39	@InfiniteKnot I have all now. Had ear pain and tinnitus in beginning but not constant. My bed and pillows and crap. Me=Pain Neck and Spine.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 03:23:18	@InfiniteKnot Have theory. Lack of blood flow to areas as it affects neck. Neuro tested my angles up down for migraines. Both=Vertigo.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 03:18:08	@InfiniteKnot Well, all of my Team are great, and if you're sick for a Dr. Appt, what can you do? Yes it can happen with TMJD etc.! Had it!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 03:05:10	@BrandoText Hi there. I've been off the radar because of illness. But I see your Follow now! You can Follow me back. Wasn't ignoring!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 02:54:16	@madblack65 @SteveDunfee @1bluesboss @wilybo @jamieslatemusic @NateMaingard @UlrichJvV @_LifeSurfer @patientanon @aamir20febPPP / Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 02:47:36	@InfiniteKnot Hi there. Cancelled/Rebooked all appts this month except Neuro at hospital. New update. Non-stop tinnitus and pain in ears.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-19 02:43:58	@Canageek @Mattwilljackson / Yep. That's right.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-15 06:03:35	That's all I can say right now from my hammock. It wouldn't make sense anyway. Not in English. And DEFINITELY not in Saturnese. Nice folks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-15 05:52:48	SICK. But not so bad when you need Gravol on a regular basis? Never used to make me feel I was on a comfy hammock from Earth to Saturn.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-14 02:04:23	@Mattwilljackson @Canageek @Polygon / Interesting. I've just got a bunch of Tangles™ And other toys, begged, borrowed or stolen.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-14 01:40:58	Calling Neuro #2 at hospital might be the only thing I can do today. To all of you with chronic pain issues, I respect you now even more.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-14 01:27:26	I just checked in with Neuro #2 at hospital. I was afraid my follow up would take longer than expected. They're so nice. Said all is fine.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-14 01:23:07	@Canageek @Mattwilljackson / Loopy Fidget Things and bulges in pockets. I'm not going to say anything further.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-14 01:19:04	@Canageek @Mattwilljackson / What? Huh? Me? You? Him? Give? I've given him a few things. Which one are you talking about here?
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-13 00:22:26	@loonydepartment
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-11 09:23:35	Still wiped. Out of my head on Gravol. Oy. Hope everyone is doing well! Laters.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-11 09:19:33	Time to get the damn new Mac? With the plan and program they have, for me to get maximum trade value? I only have four months anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-11 09:14:22	Copies for loads of people, plus several Staff Members want me to write piece about it. Conversely, need other's shots.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-11 09:10:01	Hi guys. How to deal with Digital SLR photos. Multiple reasons. Film SLR but of course prints. Can work for you, but need optical drive.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-11 08:48:01	@RachelRoams I can't BELIEVE they have a Sake emoji! I couldn't believe it when I saw it! Totally awesome!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-11 08:41:48	@RachelRoams Hi Rachel. I actually bought some Sake here once that had spring water in it! Smooth and fresh! But not drinking anymore.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-09 23:08:51	On way home. Exhausted. Don't know if I'll crash into a huge #depression after these amazing few days. Talk later all. I'm dusted. #travel
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-06 23:32:03	@patientanon #TravelTuesday #travel
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-06 23:30:58	... We arrived at the Rest Area two minutes later. We laughed because I said I didn't care. No TMI! No pictures though. #TravelTuesday
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-06 23:26:21	Toilet break. Guy beside me. Keeps talking to "nobody" but really nice. Had to go. Took my empty cardboard cup, went to seat behind...
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-06 10:44:55	Should try to get some sleep now. Up early before we take off. Will be in touch while there and send pictures! #travel
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-06 10:40:49	@RachelRoams It must be SO good over there. Not like what we get over here. I love it!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-06 10:01:39	#JakeMurray I couldn't find a corn dog.

16253011	patientanon	2016-09-06 09:01:58	@RachelRoams Prom Date. That was a good one. I write so got it! Your best written material in sync with an image I've seen yet, girlie!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-06 04:43:34	Tunes on ride to #Therapist . I always forget headphones or one pair of buds I can actually wear! Tiny ears. This is good. Ugly Session.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 07:36:43	@loonydepartment I don't see any problems with talking about serial killers. No, really. Big deal.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 07:07:46	@Zinquefty Now worries.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 07:04:56	@RachelRoams @toddheuston / Mmmm... Sushi. *drools*
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 07:02:45	@Zinquefty *giggles* Well, we still have a trip scheduled. And I'm not so spazzy now. So we can plan for that?
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 06:59:32	@Zinquefty Or best is WE go on a trip together. I like that option better. Forget my mobility with you. SPAZ Camping. I have a little stove.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 06:56:12	@Zinquefty I don't even know if it's an annual thing or just special. Come down and I'll sneak you in with my meds. Snacks? Vampire.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 06:52:33	@Zinquefty Turns out wasn't draw. Just people. I got to go being a first timer. People gone before can go only if not enough first timers.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 06:45:12	@Zinquefty I'm sorry honey. I didn't even know they provided it until a few weeks ago! I talked a lot back and forth. Camping no! Mobility
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 06:30:25	PACKED! Except for my meds. Too many damn bottles. BWAH-HAH-HAH!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 05:08:11	@loonydepartment Although one cool stay. On Hold but two nurses smoked. Didn't care. When on shift, always come for me, hang out, talk.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 05:03:57	@loonydepartment Maybe busy? Great you got 30min. with mum. Me on Holds: "No I'm not gonna hurt myself, but YOU ya fucking cow! Gimme a fag"
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 02:34:59	So odd "adjusting" my brain to shooting B&W, after only colour for years. Monochrome, manual controls, exposure... #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 02:23:49	Found strap for one camera. The dog leash idea? I needed another one. However...all is not lost! I have two cameras! #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 02:14:27	Hi @HughsonGeri . Thanks for stopping by.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 02:12:12	Hi @wetravel . Thanks. I have to do just about all today as I'll be busy Monday. Next day, leave early in the morning! Fun of #travel !
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 02:05:20	@patientanon They better use worms too. Not silly bobbles. That's if we just sit. I can't see us all in waders flyfishing. Oh, would rock!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 01:57:55	@patientanon Can't wait to go fishing!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-05 01:52:01	...packing, packing, packing... I'm tired. Although, I'm SO LUCKY my Outreach Support Group does this for us! Place run by @CNIB . #travel
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-04 06:36:30	@RachelRoams We can keep it a secret if you're into it, Rachel. Just DM me. *now grinning not sobbing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-04 06:33:03	@RachelRoams Unless you're into frottage and do it yourself. Perhaps I am wrong. Yet I would think it more New York thing. *still sobbing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-04 06:27:58	@RachelRoams And for the record, "frottage" occurs in #anime and #manga . It is really about fan service. There is no real frottage in Japan.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-04 06:22:06	@RachelRoams Rachel, you're mean! I told you I wanted to go to Japan! YOU took Japan away from me! *sobbing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-04 06:16:38	Lost original #Nikon strap for DSLR. Nothing for Manual. My trip. What the hell walking around? Going to try dog leashes! #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-04 06:02:15	@loonydepartment Just giving you a bolus of humour into your other port, hun.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-04 06:00:50	@loonydepartment Maybe she got scared for her life? *ducks*
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-04 05:59:38	@loonydepartment
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-04 02:57:24	Must go out AGAIN today! I can't read small type and I lost magnifying glass. Missed special health care needs store by 15min.!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-04 02:47:56	@Zinquefty Cute? People writing on white space. Prove gel pens dry fast. White cat rolls over, confused no ink on back. Then just rolls on.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-03 03:58:45	Oh, gawd. 3min. until Shopping Suicide. Better get dressed...
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-03 03:56:52	@Zinquefty Have you seen the pen advert about them drying so fast, they have a white puss rolling all over the writing? Meow? Oh. Meow.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-03 03:52:29	However, until that happens, I have a strong urge to speak to @Zinquefty about cats.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-03 03:46:54	In 15min. I am going to drag myself, kicking and screaming, out the door to go shopping.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-03 03:44:12	@joypaulinesmith No. I might sound mean but it's only about my own life. That "mean" is just a screamy outlet. I avoid mean people.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-03 03:39:53	@joypaulinesmith Thank you, sweetie! It's because you've been nice to me!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-03 00:00:26	Damn! #Menopause screwing up cycle now! Started. Will carry on through trip. Don't want to be sick. Propranolol near zip with catamenial.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-02 21:46:55	Do you think I'm a nice person or not?
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-02 19:35:44	@faulkner368 Hey, Shaun. Thanks.

16253011	patientanon	2016-09-01 10:41:34	I'm going to bed now and enjoy my nightmares just as much as the daytime ones. Happy Times. I think I'll do an Irish Jig to my Bathroom.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-01 10:37:36	Guess I gotta work on that Will and Beneficiary shit, huh? Jesus Christ. Now I only have my Mom and she's beyond batshit crazy. Who else...
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-01 10:34:01	At least my #Therapist will support me. #tired #angry #hurt #disappointing #familytime #yay
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-01 10:28:07	Biggest #NT Fight! Fight! Bow down. My fault. Things will never change because of me. Sorry if she's hurt. Love her, but won't say hurt me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-01 10:23:02	I just emailed my sister and told her "reasonably" I'm cutting off our relationship. I can't stand it anymore. No concept of #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-01 07:21:15	Apparently you do #growupasyourparents because she says the same about me. Piss off! Get outta my life! Too late for #Buddhism ! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-09-01 07:13:43	My Sister can go fuck herself! Self-absorbed, Self-centered Bitch. Get off the Cross! You have to put your Little Sister (me) on it!

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-31 21:53:31	Watching some OMGWTF 90's Music Videos on TV right now. Up there hours ago... you don't know my time zone but, HELLO BIPHENTIN
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-31 19:50:45	@MariaLuaMusic @MythicalScot @RosaWatkinson @Paul72717 / Thank you all for the Likes and the RT.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-31 05:07:59	Must love those little "essentials" they give you in those small bags on planes. I never use them. Until I get home and #travel elsewhere!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-31 05:01:36	@thelawmom I CANNOT make any contact until I see my Therapist. Too freaked out. Contact me? O_o Politely unspeak. Leaving day after appt.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-31 04:56:44	@thelawmom Uber- I'm trying in my head to push them out of head. Don't ruin my trip. Maybe getting away will push them out? I don't know.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-31 04:52:42	REALLY trying to avoid my life--or the crappy parts of it. Trying to concentrate on things I need to do, even if only going to the bathroom.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 09:13:26	Please do not speak to me right now. Thank you.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 09:07:58	@joypaulinesmith my sister and our cousin long story and I need to deal with it somehow very painful
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 06:56:23	@joypaulinesmith Trust me. I know. Nothing like a good coma to keep things peaceful. Pfft. They're not even worth it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 06:00:32	@joypaulinesmith I just want to be thrown under a truck. Anyone got some booze around here?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 05:41:09	@thelawmom Little Sister here can get trampled on and a target for her rage, denial, lies etc. so ugly at times. Denied my logic every time.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 05:35:49	@thelawmom And during the years when it was just the two of us? WE became very close. Sister gets what Sister wants. Via any (mean?) means.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 05:31:52	@thelawmom Thanks. I was talking to him for years just the two of us for years. Then got them reconnected. Cool! No. Sister can go nuts too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 05:22:41	And the nail in the coffin was my cousin told my sister his son has Autism while I have Asperger's. He never told me. Close? Different.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 05:16:42	That's it. Throwing in the towel. Need time. Don't know how to respond. How to see reality. My cuz' tells my Sis' everything, me zero. Bye?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 05:12:49	I finally "admitted" theirs was a lot closer than mine. What do I hear? Well, yours is still close, just different. Competition I can't win!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 05:07:07	This has been going on for so long with my sister, me and my cousin. We're both close to him but have "different" relationships.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-30 01:48:44	E. from Sis' 2day. W/ cuz. other Prov. "Closer" bt my rel. w/ cuz too! Never said son Autie, I'm #Aspie pics fam there. Want me? #PTSD HELL.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 22:17:56	Further: I cannot stand that hand heart thing. Everyone does it. Either do something original, or a few simple things like this:
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 22:08:43	Tell me if the link doesn't work. Didn't post protocol when copied which is totally dumb. But it's YouTube so should be okay?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 22:00:08	You know that heart thing everyone does with their hands for pictures, cameras...It ain't new. From the 90's: https:// youtu.be/wCg8plK7UkQ
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 04:32:24	@loonydepartment Gonna slo-mo quickly lie down now. Headache. xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 04:30:22	@loonydepartment But fast too. Yanno?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 04:25:40	@loonydepartment Then we'll hold auditions for the rest of the band. If they're cool enough, you know? Like us.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 04:17:46	Headache. *clunk*
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 04:03:24	@loonydepartment So Hedge Crawling FLS.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 04:02:38	@loonydepartment Since we were strolling, I was thinking garden path. Close friend. Connection But first thing in head was Hedge.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 03:31:54	@loonydepartment Or... something seems sort of incomplete to me about the name. That's a good punk one. Yeah. Let me think of...
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 03:29:30	@loonydepartment Love it! Can you play any instruments? I can't so I'm vox. I can sing.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 03:26:42	SO happy I got my (just?) 10mg increase of Biphentin--my #ADD med. Now 50mg. Been fighting for YEARS! But another med change... for a bit.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 03:17:04	@loonydepartment I think that would be known as "crawling."
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 03:15:01	@howtolucid Thanks for the Like!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 03:13:40	@loonydepartment Strolling down the lane, two FL's we go...
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 03:10:01	@loonydepartment Oh, you make me laugh lots without even trying FL! So, so fast but in slow motion.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 03:07:56	@thelawmom You know, maybe intermittent compromise? I will have my phone so WP and not greatest pictures? Then better on computer when home?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-28 03:02:14	@MariaLuaMusic @MythicalScot @RosaWatkinson @Paul72717 / You're welcome doll.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-26 05:02:25	Just saw Merlin #3. After YEARS, got my 10mg increase to 50mg of #Biphentin ! #ADD crazy and I said maybe mood for #menopause #depression .
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-25 05:44:59	@thelawmom Just sent in all the information for my current #Mac to see what kind of discount they'll give me...oy. Said doesn't hurt to ask?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-25 02:51:33	@thelawmom I haven't seen any pictures, but have been told some things. So I'll see!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-25 02:44:57	@thelawmom Yes. Very peaceful? Activities to do as well or just bake out and do nothing.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-25 02:42:32	@thelawmom Hehehe.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-25 02:39:09	@thelawmom No pictures. No LAN Cable Connection on computer. Buy new one? Pfft. Money. Tempted but can't afford.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-25 00:33:18	Does going on this trip warrant me upgrading to a new #Mac ? Couldn't hurt to go, talk trade etc. My Air us useless. But pristine condition.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-25 00:02:50	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. I think I'll put up a poll. That would be fun!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-25 00:00:33	@patientanon @InfiniteKnot and everyone else! Please ignore goddamn autotype! And my eyes not working well enough to catch the errors!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 23:56:41	@InfiniteKnot However on two points, they have tandem bikes there so...? Also, I could cycle again. Get a Recumbent!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 23:52:41	@InfiniteKnot As far as cycling, I can't. My balance won't return to bike again. I'm actually selling my bike. It's a good one so I hope.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 23:48:59	@InfiniteKnot I am going to do the very quick swim because it will be cold! The place is maybe 3hrs north so that will give you an idea.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 23:45:28	Hey to you too! @InfiniteKnot Nice to be talking about something else about #migraines isn't it?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 23:40:14	@thelawmom I'm also bringing my B&W manual film camera. Good for some possibly different perspectives of the area as well. #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 23:35:21	@thelawmom Macs are so intuitive, it should just automatically launch the s/w as soon as I connect the camera.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 23:32:40	@thelawmom Hey! I'll do my best. I haven't tried uploading anything on my Mac or reintregting s/w but it's on my backup drive.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 07:08:43	@loonydepartment Been Skydiving so would totally skip up the Mountains for Climbing!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 06:44:51	@RachelRoams And thank you again, Rachel!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 06:43:53	@RachelRoams Thanks, Rachel.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 05:25:05	@loonydepartment Make me laugh.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 04:22:09	@n8wachT Yes, good to try keep everything even, I say.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 02:49:45	@n8wachT Or should have said Owlkay? Much better! x
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 02:48:12	@n8wachT Okay.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 02:01:59	@patientanon Do you want to dare me too? @RachelRoams Any other folks want me to take it on no matter what?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 01:57:33	Trying to decide if I'll go swimming when I head up north. That lake will be COLD! Have seasonal cycling gear. Layer up. I'll dare myself!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 01:40:22	@n8wachT Well, Lemur lives in the real world. Not owl'ways in the Forest so gets gets hurt too much. She needs human (Lemur)Relationships.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 01:26:16	@n8wachT All people who l'owlve get upset, fight, whatever. "Nature" of ReLumerShips.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-24 01:22:50	@n8wachT Th'owtly so.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-23 23:58:54	@loonydepartment That doesn't even look like a LAN but haha.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-23 23:57:51	@loonydepartment Found my LAN Cable too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-23 23:56:50	@loonydepartment I'm okay. Going to make some tea methinks, FL.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-23 23:54:45	@RachelRoams Second Choice: Thailand. Sorry. It's important too, so I couldn't stay clammed up!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-23 23:52:16	@RachelRoams Oh! Love that! SO much to see in that area of the world. Sounds silly, but if given one choice? I'd pick Japan!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-23 23:44:43	There were people who Followed me about Backpack/Knapsack Travel/Travellers. Could you come back if you see this? Twitter Update nuked info!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-23 23:40:03	@Zinquefty I'd like to hear some of your other bad thoughts...
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-23 23:36:49	@n8wachT Sorry I never got back to you hon. No notice! Closing for #Rio2016 always anticlimactic. Much better, watch #TheHip on 20th? OMG.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-23 21:47:06	@patientanon Also, they have a computer for general use, so all I have to do is bring in a LAN Cable. Already have one-unless gave it away!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-23 21:40:56	@thelawmom I went to a meeting about to get more information about it. Even more stoked! More of a "Lodge," I guess?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 02:12:06	@loonydepartment NO! Don't hurt yourself!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 02:11:03	@loonydepartment Or maybe a nap? So tired almost in a daze.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 02:08:01	@loonydepartment Sounds rather ominous, dastardly and nefarious. Hope it doesn't include me!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 01:34:25	@loonydepartment Missing Vol. 2 Batwoman so can start moving on. Art, colour amazing! #Batwoman is gay too! YAY!!! #lgbt #geek #comics
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 01:26:31	@patientanon #Rio2016 sort of winding down. See if anything interesting on. If not, maybe read some Batwoman #Comic . #geek
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 01:22:36	@loonydepartment Too much. The world is getting simultaneously bigger and smaller as time passes. Even faster? Is anyone caring to look?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 01:16:49	@loonydepartment I'm currently working on a new response system.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 01:03:24	Travel set for appointments next week. Check! Sort of eating. Check! Hey, now you can't say I haven't done anything today...
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 00:52:18	@loonydepartment I think this has turned me off salt baths forever. Unless medically necessary.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 00:49:39	@loonydepartment I was starting to think of those little, coloured balls you put in the tub! How would you trip on that? Eat it? Blech. LOL.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 00:46:13	@loonydepartment That's why I hate taking baths and only shower! Sorry. True and some levity but this I've never heard of for a drug!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 00:34:57	@loonydepartment Thanks for your understanding of the situation. *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 00:17:29	@loonydepartment If you read my recent Tweets, you'll get the story. Some even agreed to remove me yesterday but nope.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 00:14:00	Bloody Hell! A few just did it all over again, right now! I'm happy and thankful for Mentions from anyone, but not non-stop from strangers!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 00:08:20	They "are" accounts. Activity. But like I'm in bot hell with these people. Most foreign languages. Started with Top Interactors. Vortex.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-22 00:02:30	Call me "Queen Bitch of Twitter" but time to either Mute or Block. I'm stuck in a list, all keep Like/RT daily, asked to remove. Nope!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 09:17:33	Watching this on TV. I just want to cry for so many reasons. I want to cry too for reasons I don't even know why. #TheHip
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 08:04:12	@Canageek OK hon. Lots of time.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 06:04:42	@Canageek Thanks, babe. We have to talk! It's been like, a quadrillion years? I'm still going to make it to your place for Christmas!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 05:59:34	@LukaLuzelia Please do not Like, RT anything as you just did again when I have asked everyone in that group to do. Thank you but too much.

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 05:45:56	Talked to guy at our BEST #photography store here. Business-Customer Deal? He has Enlarger to sell. Told me $50-$75. Sold! Thank you.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 05:42:12	TOTALLY STOKED about my mini-vacation early September! A lake and cabin up north. I can't afford to travel. So lucky group provided this.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 05:35:28	@ShiriAppleby Hey Shiri. Just wanted to say hello and ask how you were doing. All well, I hope? Watching the Olympics? Or are you there?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 05:18:11	@ConstanceZimmer @JKCorden I'm from Canada so was it Virginia Slim's? In jest, I can't keep thinking, "You've Come a Long Way..."
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 05:13:31	@ConstanceZimmer I admire and respect you even more now. I think you've become a role model for women overall but bar up for them acting!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 05:04:36	I love it when you say things so honestly. You just lay it all out! You're so admirable and so "human!" Amazing. @ConstanceZimmer @JKCorden

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 04:48:52	How to use tissues, easily and historically. Fold along the crease, then over. Stack. No pulling! Same as men in chivalry to women in need.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 04:09:47	Still out. Errands. Break from heat. Bought Vol. of Batwoman still missing and Novel Version "All You Need Is Kill" #GraphicNovels #Geek
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-21 02:24:25	Getting my hair done. Flipping through @Cosmopolitan . I might start collecting them as comic books. Not really a good investment though.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-20 07:30:05	@loonydepartment I'm easy to please too, my FL.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-20 07:19:03	@loonydepartment Excellent! I get so happy when I hear things like that. I was lucky and found a Therapist for my PTSD! Not general stuff!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-20 07:06:21	@loonydepartment Rhetorical Question works too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-20 07:04:59	@loonydepartment Sarcasm?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-20 06:59:56	@loonydepartment Rough last appointment?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-20 06:35:15	@loonydepartment Deal! But uh...DM...?

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-18 22:42:59	Original Comment I thought @declan_hill worthy. #CANvsGER
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-18 22:36:10	Bring on the bullying, fights and death threats. I'm ready. But I'm a HUGE believer in Free Speech. Even if you hate what's said. #CANvsGER
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-18 22:28:54	@declan_hill More than just two minutes here, as you'd know. Ref. wasn't fooled with "injury" at least. Even worse when time gets longer.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-18 21:51:56	@WritingReader Thanks for the RT!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-18 21:48:13	@loonydepartment I suck at Journalling. You too? Start Mood Charting. I've done it; even for my seizures. Lots of templates online! Better.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-18 21:43:18	@loonydepartment *snarf* Okay, not an Official. I didn't have a mouthful of tea. It's beside me.

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 08:43:35	@joypaulinesmith That's a tough argument. I think you'd have to take a step back and look at how well an #addict stays sober.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 08:40:58	@loonydepartment Nice one! I like that!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 08:09:42	@loonydepartment My Beautiful FL xxxxx
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 08:06:01	@loonydepartment Me too. I keep hearing it over and over and it still cracks me up! I've been watching the Olympics from the start! #Rio2016
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 08:00:05	@loonydepartment Good. I'm very happy to do that FL. xx

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 07:45:08	@joypaulinesmith I also know a lot about DID! I actually have Dissociative Amnesia. #PTSD from hell.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 07:43:40	@joypaulinesmith Well, I've met someone else's. It depends upon the person's trust, the alters' trust, how the alters' work w/ the person.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 07:40:37	@joypaulinesmith Funny my battery too. Recovering. You're always in recovery if you're an #addict #alcoholic
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 07:38:27	@joypaulinesmith I thought so about the DID. I'm cool with alters. Maybe I can get to know yours or one or whatever sometime.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 07:36:05	@joypaulinesmith Trust me. A shock to your system will be more than one. I'm an #alcoholic but I want to quit smoking. Only one at a time.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 07:32:13	@joypaulinesmith Do you have DID? You said she. Just wondering if I was speaking to one of your alters.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 07:30:10	@joypaulinesmith Good luck. How about trying just one at a time. Otherwise, you might explode.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 07:28:32	@joypaulinesmith That's a hell of a lot! I was going to say keep me posted but that's using the Internet. Maybe Carrier Pigeon?

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 05:29:47	There is NO NEED when up 2-0, 2min left, to fall for injury and take slow kicks. GER 2 CAN 0. @CanadaSoccerEN @isseynfarran #CANvsGER
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 05:15:58	@joypaulinesmith You look around in a room. Usually large for meetings? Look at all telephone jacks. One won't be one. Bigger.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-17 03:55:30	@joypaulinesmith Well, I always tell people they can call me whatever they want. Nicknames etc. Hopefully nothing bad!

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-14 09:12:37	@loonydepartment It's just more pumped up stupid. I have a friend who's an Aspie too. We'd play a game. "Spaz Moment of the Day."
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-14 09:10:13	@loonydepartment Yes, Monty is good. Sometimes I'll just "do" something and it makes no sense or will be, duh. That's #Aspergers ? Like #ADD .

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-10 01:39:57	I see people have been talking to me. Thank you! I'll get back to you soon.

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-07 08:06:02	My BP loves me drugged up! Peak Plasma Propranolol? Ya think? Also binds to albumin, lowers AAG so Lamictal Clearance but minimal.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-07 07:39:04	Peak Plasma both Propranolol and Lamictal. Propranolol fast clearance. See how long Lamictal with extra 25mg. Hopefully fast! BP now? Ha!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-07 07:25:55	I just made some noodles and broth that SEEMED to be a good idea five minutes ago. Oy increase of Lamictal. Had cereal in morning at least.

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-07 04:11:52	@kezm33 I was speaking about exposure with the WRONG pics. A lot of white, and even though fast shutter, too much light. #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-07 04:05:16	@kezm33 I've had to do that at times. Mostly for difficult shots with my DSLR and bulb, because I have to do too much! #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-07 03:58:28	@kezm33 Absolutely! You never stop learning about everything in life. I'm working on a roll and I'm sure some shots are WRONG. #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-07 03:54:37	@kezm33 Learning that stuff can be both easy and hard. At least for me it proved? I STILL have problems with light! Crazy! #photography

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-07 03:30:51	@kezm33 That's part of the reason for my Darkroom. I am stuck at home and can't get out much. Hard to shoot? Not really. #photography

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-04 23:33:46	@bullfrogr @Soozmc123 @smears_rosamund / Pfft. Please.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-04 23:03:20	@madblack65 Thanks for your input. I woke up and realized it was true. That said, I won't Tweet the colour of your lingerie.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-04 00:12:38	@madblack65 I'm psychic?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-04 00:11:56	Okay! Going to have #twittea and catch up with #UnREAL #UnREALtv #addiction YES!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-04 00:03:34	@madblack65 Thanks for the RT, Mad, Maddy.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-04 00:02:03	@madblack65 Even better! Absolutely brilliant! Come up with one for the then? You know my name right!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 23:55:18	@Soozmc123 @bullfrogr @smears_rosamund / I really enjoy Semiotics. This isn't. Semiotics dovetails with my love of Anthropology.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 23:51:53	@Soozmc123 @bullfrogr @smears_rosamund / Absolutely! Now we're getting into it as a philosophical property. Brilliant! I got good grades!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 23:47:25	@madblack65 Thanks Maddy. I have this "drive" to call you that. If you don't like it, let me know. I thought I'd chime in. More to the list!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 23:41:54	My roots have grown in HOW long now? Summer and ball caps work. Saves me money!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 23:35:10	@ConstanceZimmer I'm not a total lunatic. @ShiriAppleby can attest to the fact. We have actually spoken. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 23:28:42	@ConstanceZimmer I have a feeling you think I'm a total lunatic, and a real PITA. I still think you're awesome though. You are!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 23:16:08	Congrats on Wrap S2! @ConstanceZimmer & @ShiriAppleby Shiri, your Direction S206. WOW! High point? Tears. Rachel DID cry. Quinn SO close!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 07:00:52	@madblack65 And the store where the dress came from. Made overseas by people paid a dollar. The man on the corner selling fake Gucci.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 06:45:05	@Zinquefty And I thought I had a stutter.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 05:28:42	I'm really trying to stop bitching about my #Lamictal titration, but now too many variables. Every issue and drug used for it happening NOW.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 03:40:57	@bullfrogr LOVE IT! I'll use it for the distance. xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 03:24:02	@bullfrogr
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 03:23:18	@bullfrogr Like I said, I have some things to say about the bullies but can't keep at 140. DM
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 03:20:49	@bullfrogr I'm already holding it. xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 03:19:14	@bullfrogr You know what I told you about cutting. You said it! And I'm to hear those words. Empathy for yourself. I'll help.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 03:15:51	@bullfrogr @Soozmc123 @smears_rosamund You're cute. Good to know! Generous with the Likes! I think we Follow each other(?)
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 03:11:11	@bullfrogr @Soozmc123 I think I'm going to have to do a multiple thanks for all the Likes! @smears_rosamund
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 03:05:15	@bullfrogr And being an alcoholic is hating yourself too. So let's stop hating ourselves.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 03:02:51	@bullfrogr It is a process. Like me trying to stop drinking. And I get very sick with Liver Tests. So we'll stay and do it together?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 02:57:04	@bullfrogr You will. You will dammit. You can and you will. I believe in you. That's how it starts. Just one. Then two. A lot are here.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 02:34:51	@bullfrogr @GriceFullyHis @SouthlakeLCSW / ok whoa stop.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 02:32:23	@bullfrogr Oui?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 02:31:41	@bullfrogr @GriceFullyHis @SouthlakeLCSW / Is it me kind-hearted it's so unfair? Now you're being silly. I might have a good heart but... ;)
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 02:28:31	@bullfrogr Answer or talk. Too long stupid 140! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 02:20:40	@bullfrogr @GriceFullyHis @SouthlakeLCSW / But KNOW THIS: Things are NOT a contest! Health, experiences etc. We don't know other's lives!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 02:17:02	@bullfrogr @GriceFullyHis @SouthlakeLCSW / Whoa. I've just been isolated from mine all my life, because every kind of abuse, nobody cared.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 02:03:16	@GriceFullyHis @bullfrogr @SouthlakeLCSW / Oh I've been here once! Brother, sister who were both my friends. Father died. Brother went nuts.

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 01:58:21	@bullfrogr @narcopathaware / Being an #Aspie with poor communication skills from that, it took a while to catch on. Even now as an adult?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 01:53:40	@bullfrogr @smears_rosamund @Soozmc123 / Like my machine analogy. People cannot be like that, positive or negative because we're individuals
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 01:51:25	@bullfrogr @smears_rosamund @Soozmc123 / I was being literal because I think (or it is) totally true. Normal means to act predictably.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 01:47:11	@narcopathaware @bullfrogr Welcome to a whole lot of my life.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 01:31:49	@bullfrogr @smears_rosamund @Soozmc123 / Normal is a ridiculous word in terms of humans. Machine function? My mobile? Okay.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 01:21:44	@bullfrogr @Soozmc123 Thanks for the Like @smears_rosamund
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 01:19:04	@RachelRoams Thanks, Rachel. My inspiration was getting the good ol' fashioned darkroom set up--in my bathroom! Can't wait! #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 01:08:03	@1960ava Oh, Ava! I'm going to thank you now for all the your Likes and RTs!

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 01:01:55	@cactusian One of the biggest things of #Propagnosia is not recognizing someone out of context. Say your tailor on the street, at the pub.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 00:56:55	@cactusian If you're on the Spectrum and you experience something like that, not weird at all!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-03 00:55:18	@cactusian I've never heard that one. Just that it was uber-prevalent on the Spectrum.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 22:15:35	@bullfrogr @Soozmc123 @smears_rosamund / Absolutely! And you can find even simple kindness acts anywhere. Then say, "Aha! I got you!"
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 08:52:19	Always take the High Road. Even if the words that need to come out of you dare you to eat a cadaver, it really is for the best. Truism.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 08:37:28	Thanks for the Like @loonydepartment
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 06:23:46	I am drugged out but I can't stand it anymore. Because I'm friggin'drugged up? *Laughs* give it try.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 06:21:22	I feel like such fucking shit which is an expression that doesn't even make sense. But a real awful something because I owe a person e email
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 05:44:27	*Harvard wanders off to take her more curious meds*
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 05:41:58	It's too early to tell really, but Harvard might have more complicated work. Now she's got a beta blocker in the mix. Not just head meds.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 05:28:38	Why do I feel like I've already taken my titrated dose when I haven't yet? Oh. I lied down.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 04:57:44	Found notes for the pharmacokinetics of starting Propranolol and all my meds! Binds to albumin, lowers AAG so LFT for... *grins* #medicine
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 03:58:58	Omg my crazy mom leave me alone. Not in condition for her right now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 03:02:17	No beating me up! These people are violent. The building group opposing "their side" were violent. Violence solves nothing. Apologies can?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 02:42:44	Actually, kinda wish someone would throw a punch at me. Nail me physically. Where I live charges are not civil. Police take over completely.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 02:35:14	Reverse verbal abuse I got in the meeting? They're on my floor. I'm scared! Write Public Apology. Give to everyone here, post publicly too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 02:16:57	@aspergersgirls Thanks for the...

16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 01:53:44	@cactusian My first point is now at the top. Twitter dumb.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 01:48:43	@cactusian I know lots of #Aspie friends who use them and everyone else! I still ask.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 01:46:25	@cactusian Let's add letters too. Well! Those characters sure don't mean what they did before! I had to ask someone what XD meant! Come on!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 01:42:25	@cactusian So, what are all of those squished up close characters mean, even if we know what they mean separately? < less than, _ underscore
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 01:36:10	@cactusian I don't know where my first point went in the discussion went. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 01:34:18	@cactusian Moving forward, we all have our Aspie (and again our whole Spectrum) Flat Face. We look like emotionless at times too!
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 01:29:37	@cactusian Thus, your Social Cue statement. There is even a name of a facial recognition deficit that exists on the Spectrum. #Prosopagnosia
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 01:16:21	@cactusian You are completely right! In very strong theory? We and all on the Spectrum can have issues interpreting faces or expressions.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 01:10:00	@aspergersgirls You're welcome! I feel for some "Tweet Like Ping Pong." *laughing* Seriously! The person, me, Liking replies non-stop.
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 01:03:12	@DruCrawley @09Clive @_EduardoCortes / Happy to be so. PA
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 00:55:07	@InfiniteKnot I think the need for a Twitter update was suspicious too. Ugh. This, THING! So how are you doing?
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 00:52:52	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Like, hon. I didn't see it until just now! Not sure but Twitter needed update, lost phone's UI and...*poof*
16253011	patientanon	2016-08-01 00:21:32	@bullfrogr That's okay.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 02:27:38	@bullfrogr ok
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 02:22:19	@bullfrogr maybe you could wait a bit to check if u are sure then you could know too explain better? Suggestion. What do you think?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 02:04:28	@cactusian Thanks for the Like @AspergerCentral
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 02:00:00	No idea what's going on with me today. Slept14hrs, still zzz... What's thinking? Incapable of being incapable. Let's keep going! #medchange
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 01:49:47	@RachelRoams You know what I always forget? You can "Roam" all over where you live! Your own environment can be full of so much!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 01:41:24	Thanks for the Like @aspergersgirls
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 01:39:08	@bullfrogr Okay.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 01:23:44	@bullfrogr Gotcha.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 01:23:16	@cactusian Thanks hon. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 01:22:13	A friend called me and left a VM. I don't know if I can speak. I haven't tried in days. *gurgle*
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 01:19:44	@bullfrogr *grins* I didn't know if you knew the joke or not. Not as a cultural bias, but it's been around here forever. Esp. Cleopatra!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 01:15:23	@bullfrogr Interesting. Hope you don't mind the joke, "Why does everyone who recalls their past life as Cleopatra or some giant of history?"
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 01:06:50	@cactusian I know I've gone totally off topic here, but the clock thing fits perfectly with my other Learning Disorders #Aspergers stuff.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 01:03:40	@cactusian I used to be fine, but now it is VERY hard to tell time with no numbers, numbers a bit better. Why I always wear digital.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 01:00:41	@cactusian Sort of like me with clocks--and other #Aspergers Learning Disorders that have gotten out of control over time.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 00:58:02	@cactusian For my entire life always used *emotion/action/etc* Some with #Aspergers and all on #Autistic Spectrum don't get emoticons.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-31 00:46:50	@cactusian Yes. Me, my silly humour. Although this is SERIOUS. I don't know where I stand on emojis. PLUS smilies! Can't understand them.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 05:52:08	If you add Frequency to Gravity while your room is spinning with your closed eyes? Even worse. My music must now be turned off immediately!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 05:44:03	OFFS!!! I want close my eyes and rest, but every time I do, the room starts spinning. Yes, a room can spin if you don't see it. Gravity.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 05:20:54	To try to eat, or not to eat? THAT is the question. I think I had an apple and other day. Nothing stays in me anyway. #nausea #medchange
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 05:10:13	@bullfrogr
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 04:57:01	@bullfrogr Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to do that! Ok, anything like that ever again for anything I will add it's like a joke :D :) Ok?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 04:53:37	@bullfrogr Sicky, love. You know the situation. Have lowered one pill as it may have been too much. So we'll see for now with that.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 04:50:42	@bullfrogr I hope that came out right and I didn't say something totally offensive. *laughing* I haven't translated. Just about being sick.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 04:45:27	@bullfrogr Помоги мне, помогите мне.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 04:35:32	This is awesome! @bullfrogr @NataliaAntonova
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 04:32:27	Listening to albums on my turntable isn't such a good idea right now. *fall resulting in near head injury* I'm fine! Jazz on radio is cool.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 01:51:16	Losing System UI Phone saying outrageous hours to charge. You can still talk to me here but lost UI trying to fix. Be back...?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-30 00:47:16	@NataliaAntonova "Lady TaTa" instead of "Lady Gaga?" I'd pay money to see that. LOTS.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 23:17:39	@cactusian Hi Prickly. I find it ironic when people "Like" a Tweet that's really sad or negative. I prefer the #Twitter "Faves" from before.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 23:11:06	@Kim_Larocque @PartnersforMH @SherryLeveck @AKKerani @DruCrawley / Thank you very much. A pleasure to meet the rest of you as well.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 22:32:58	@bullfrogr I'm sorry. This was the "Missing Tweet" that caused all the ruckus! I wish you could make me well to, love. xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 22:28:28	@madblack65 Thanks as well, sweetie. You have such a sweet, caring nature, good for your field? Yes? xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 22:25:45	@bellanatale2004 Thanks hun. xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 09:36:29	They had a right to be angry. Whatever else comes from them in the future, I'll have to handle. Even if awful. #Bullied #Aspergers #Hatred
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 09:21:53	Just got back from meeting in building. I'm a "Fucking Bitch Liar!" Told, "Fuck You! Go Fuck Yourself! #Bullied forever. #Aspergers #Hatred
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 04:17:43	That last Tweet came from my heart, soul and life. Not from being on a med change right now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 04:15:58	I shall speak no more today. I am capable to face my future. A gift so valuable; years to learn. I wish it always by my side.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 03:54:37	People have always said I should do some #writing with a med change, sick out of my mind, whatever. Never could, but now I am! Total shock!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 03:48:38	Maybe I can Tweet the tiniest bit coherently while making this med change.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 03:30:35	Okay, I'm having a lot of problems with that last Tweet. I can't find any answers to the related terms and more. Haha. #sick #medicine
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-29 03:24:23	Propranolol + my increase of Lamictal: Peak Plasma, Dose, Clearance, Enzyme Binds, Calcium Channels. Fun! Only Tweet today. #sick #medicine
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-27 03:22:07	One last thing. My brain must be SERIOUSLY messed up. Gravol and Valium together? Never made stoned. As I am now! Dying but laughing.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-27 02:52:45	So I bid you adieu for now. Mobile screen hurts and still very sick. Take care, everyone.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-27 02:50:25	Can't wait for Divided Daily Dose to add more Lamictal. FYI re: that, I might be a bit spaced out for a couple of days. Titration needed.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-27 02:46:49	Had to walk against walls for support even though have cane. Once inside still needed support but know my own apartment! Now drugged up.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-27 02:43:55	OK. Sick issue. Migraine. Outside waiting for transit in blazing hot sun. Took half hour. Vision went, puke on ground? Almost carry to car.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-27 01:13:41	No Twee ts now v v sick. Will explain later Ty
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 23:30:10	Ooop! Gotta get ready to go.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 23:26:40	@madblack65 Thanks for all the Likes again too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 23:25:29	@madblack65 Thanks for the RT.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 23:24:39	@bullfrogr There are several. Sitting in my Neuro's Office. Can I tell you when home?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 23:21:41	@bullfrogr No! No way! The Film's Soundtrack has some beautiful songs on it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 23:19:21	Everything taken care of! Harvard is ALWAYS right. That's my Neuro's nickname for me. He told me I had a Neurologist's Degree from there.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 23:14:53	@bullfrogr :)))
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 22:42:17	They don't have a nauseous, pukey emoji.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 22:40:15	Just about there...
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 21:24:08	And now that I am suitability #depressed it is time to get unsuitability dressed to leave for my appointment. Tallyho!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 20:58:38	Time to kill. Soundtrack to film "Sid & Nancy" on vinyl. Right where my head is.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 20:27:08	Thank god I'm seeing my Neuro in a few hours. I already have them here and he wouldn't have objected, but meh.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 19:56:08	@madblack65 BWAH-HAH-HAH!!! Let me know when it's a good time and I'll fly over.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 19:54:36	@madblack65 Right now I'm learning how to open my bloody eyes! I woke up and it's too damn early!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 19:52:23	Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 19:51:05	@madblack65 Thanks!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 19:49:14	@DrEvansWilliams Thanks for the Like. I wasn't liking things much yesterday. I'm up just now and it's really early. Don't like that... I...
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 07:04:15	Thought #Therapy would be good today but... I'm "unsettled?" You never know how a Session will turn out. #tired #lostforwords
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 04:55:36	*waiting for my number to come up and the bell to ring for me to see my Therapist* #sarcasm #humour #ridiculous
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 04:45:38	Dehydrated much? Just downed two glasses of water in kitchen of my Therapist's Office. I might do three, then always my regular for Session.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 04:37:48	@madblack65 WELL DONE!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 04:37:09	@madblack65 You absolutely do. I'd say a LOT more than one thing. I sure do. So many, I can't even count them all!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 04:27:21	I have to wear something "Cooler" when I go out because it's so hot here. I think I know exactly what to wear. @isseynfarran
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 04:14:58	@madblack65 It's true. I could be wrong about the soup spoon but cba to look it up. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 04:12:45	Once again, I will say it. I hate typing on Accessible Transit!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 04:10:31	@bullfrogr What? You didn't upset me. Everything is fine. Completely! xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 04:08:39	@madblack65 Also, that is the trick. Although, larger spoon for soup not outside in. It is closest to dishes so inside out?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 04:05:27	@madblack65 Yes. Same word as cutlery. Flatware is used in basically a special, meaningful form. And formal? Pass on from generations?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 03:24:33	@ConstanceZimmer Oh! Then keep enjoying! I didn't know. Sorry to bother you!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 03:22:46	@madblack65 *courtesy with slow bow* I also know how to use the loads of flatware on the table, if you go to a formal multi-course dinner!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 03:07:14	@madblack65 I'd say they never SHOULD do. *wry grin*
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 03:04:57	@bullfrogr I want that too. Very, very much.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 03:03:19	@madblack65 Thank you. I always say, "Chivalry is not dead, and manners never go out of style."™
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 03:00:55	@ConstanceZimmer Hi Constance. I hope you had a really great vacation and enjoyed yourself to the max! Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 02:54:00	More on dreaming, I haven't been able to do any Lucid Dreaming in ages! I can control EVERYTHING! First at 4yrs old. Means Innate Category.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 02:41:29	Could anyone imagine if we didn't have a REM Sleep Cycle? We'd all be dead.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 02:31:34	Unbelievable Inzombia™ last night! Therapist today. Guzzling tea! Forgot to tell her something last time so at least I have an agenda.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 02:28:07	@madblack65 ... recognized. I'll probably have to keep saying this more. I respond to every Comment on my Blog in the same way.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 02:25:53	@madblack65 I know. Like ping pong. People always ask why I thank people for Liking my Tweets. It's because I feel everyone needs to be...
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-26 02:22:12	Hi @innatelychatty Yes, I always find it flattering when someone famous like @RachelRoams Follows me. It says "YOU are valued and important"

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 10:22:33	@RachelRoams Thanks, Rachel. It hit me like a big bang not only to the senses. Obvious. But really you as a person. All you do. Obvious too?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 09:03:32	@RachelRoams A beautiful piece of writing by Ursula, and none more fitting for you, dear. Carry it with you wherever you go!

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 08:49:04	The lightbulb just died in my bathroom. I only had a 100W one left. My bathroom is now Mercury.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 08:31:04	I felt so excited when she Followed me too. I almost died from surprise and was so, "Whoa. Who me? Holy crap!" https:// twitter.com/RachelRoams/st atus/757370919803162625 …

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 05:10:17	@ThePaintedBrain You're most welcome!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 04:40:28	@bullfrogr It's okay. I'll get good insurance! xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 04:31:57	@ThePaintedBrain Thanks for the Follow. Interesting.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 04:25:03	@bullfrogr I say we're like cars. Our brains need regular maintenance. Sometimes a tune-up, new tires, so we need to increase our meds.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 04:15:05	@bullfrogr Yes. But to keep stable you have to stay on the same dose all the time, right? xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 04:13:09	@bullfrogr *laughing so hard* So Horseback, Unicornback, Witch (Glenda the Good) Fairy. Lots to choose from! I'll travel to find a Unicorn.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 04:07:40	@bullfrogr Thank you sweetie.x
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 04:06:59	@bullfrogr Oh, I think they will. We took extra ones away because I hadn't been seizing for a long time. I'm going to say add them back.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 03:56:23	@bullfrogr Oh! I love that idea! Or would you like me on a Unicorn? *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 03:54:43	@bullfrogr Yes. I read it earlier. But like I said, different ways don't mean we all hurt just the same. So I get it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 03:51:38	@bullfrogr I think I read it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 03:50:26	@bullfrogr Yes. You will. I'll drag you out of it! Now gimme a smile. I know you can do that.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 03:47:27	@bullfrogr That's the worst.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 03:46:16	@bullfrogr I'm so happy about that. You're so special. I'll beat the hell out of anyone that bullies you! I've been there. xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 03:42:47	@bullfrogr Not ! A ? Look at me! SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 03:41:34	@bullfrogr Oh, totally brain flat today. I don't know what meds you're on but do you think an increase of something might help!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 03:39:14	@bullfrogr I am going through the same doll. It's... so many words!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 03:37:23	@bullfrogr *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 03:11:37	Watching @BrainGames It is SO easy to understand and "figure out." *yawn*
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 02:57:24	Don't dismiss me based upon who Follows me, whom I Follow and my Profile on #Twitter . The same applies for all of us. Hidden gems? #advocacy
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 02:33:36	I was actually crying about seeing my second Neuro from hospital because I just don't know what the hell to do anymore. I need some fun.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 02:30:30	I honestly don't know what to say about my health right now. I've been train wrecks before, but now I think I'm endless bombs on planes.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-25 02:26:44	Am I cycling? Not just #Depression but #Bipolar ? I want to trash my entire apartment, but too tired. Thanks #menopause . Neuro in few days.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-24 08:41:50	@patientanon WHOO! I think I got lucky. A bit better now? I think because it might have helped the pain in my body. #migraine
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-24 08:05:00	This is EXTREMELY risky. I CANNOT take any pain meds on my Propranolol or rebounds. But can things get WORSE than this? Okay... #migraine
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-24 07:11:15	I am so bored. I want to do something when not visually impaired and in pain. Lest come here a bit and pain. Treasure your eyes. #advocacy

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-24 01:03:44	@CalliCoop The Wicked bot would come around and say great things to you if you typed wicked in your Tweet. Funny.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-24 01:00:57	@CalliCoop And "The Game." Everyone did this one years ago. We'd almost kill each other over it! http://www. losethegame.com
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-24 00:13:13	@bullfrogr Absolutely!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-24 00:02:53	@bullfrogr Well, thank you very much! How long has it been since I've heard that?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 23:58:18	Fuck you #migraine . I think I'll see if my stomach can handle a bowl of completely innocuous Cheerios™ now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 23:35:04	@bullfrogr I'm psychic and can change temperatures in any environment. Lots more too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 23:09:47	Does anyone remember my last Tweet and still play? It's an old old one.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 23:06:24	I just LOST THE GAME!!! It's been years!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 22:58:12	@CalliCoop Thanks. I usually get them with 0 on each side. Totally bogus. I still miss the Wicked! bot. Do/did you know that one?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 22:30:01	@bullfrogr *nods* Uh, I gotta go read something in a DM. Sorry.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 22:27:34	Can someone please help me with this? Twitter Q: People Following me, show lots of Followers. However, NO TWEETS! Some Private Account?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 22:21:40	@bullfrogr Thanks for the RT!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 08:31:23	@patientanon Also I have never done Heroin but have spoken to people who have. So I know Heroin!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 08:30:00	@patientanon Charming. I came back inside to change clothes. I was so stoned I thought I would do gardening--without my sunglasses.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 08:26:30	This #migraine won't stop. Valium, Gravol Propranolol. Latter Valium. Combo Morphine or Heroin like effect. Yelled insanely at neighbours.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 06:43:04	@bullfrogr Okay.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 06:29:25	@bullfrogr I understand. You can write creatively on your own. Also, simply for the sheer love of it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 06:26:48	Shut up Twitter. You're so plain ol' stupid, I ain't even going to hash you. Not even Corned Beef.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 06:18:34	Damn! Caffeine was helping a bit with this constant #migraine crap. But it's NO match for the #catamenial ones.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-23 06:11:00	@bullfrogr Keep it up! You'll catch a second wind! I haven't written anything since my last Blog Post. Okay. My personal? Pfft. #writing

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 23:23:23	@bullfrogr In doing that, you are now living my life, experiencing me living with #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 23:19:02	Thanks for the Like @Kim_Larocque
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 23:08:28	Appt soon to meet my new but at least temporary Outreach Worker. Sounds dumb. VM to tell me if I need anything. I said maybe MEET FIRST?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 23:02:11	@bullfrogr I can easily see that. It works with some things I want to tell you in DM or e. Plus other things. Too sick. Recovering today.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 22:59:44	@bullfrogr Never! Ask anytime! Everyone can ask me anytime. It means love and care. xxx
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 22:56:58	@bullfrogr Thanks for the RT!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 22:56:20	@bullfrogr It's so good to learn! Imperative! Even in the face of adversity. I'm so proud of you!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 22:53:42	@bullfrogr I have some maybe combinations of the two, I guess? Three guys. My friends have been guys mostly. *laughs*. My Asperger's.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 22:45:39	@bullfrogr ... but if you just say, "Hi, how are you?" don't see them that often but are still nice? They are acquaintances.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 22:42:44	@bullfrogr I totally agree. Those who really understand you and you can RELY on are friends. People, even if they understand can be close...
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 22:38:13	@bullfrogr I know. ;)
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 08:46:53	@cactusian Thanks for the Like, Prickly!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 00:27:18	@bullfrogr Well, I think you shouldn't push. It just ends up in this cycle of frustration. But these are all just my thoughts. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 00:17:29	@patientanon Thanks for the Like @VicariousVibe
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 00:07:27	@bullfrogr Maybe stop looking so hard for a while. Daydreaming and fantasizing works well too. Let your mind wander.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 00:05:26	Once again I'm tired of being treated as "Judge, Jury, Executioner" by people who don't understand. Coddling me is even worse. #mentalhealth
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-22 00:00:24	Don't look down and judge me because I have #mentalhealth issues and physical ones. My #epilepsy and #migraines are fine but not the others.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:55:01	Can't remember the last time I left my apartment to go outside. A week ago on my patio? Forget a shower. #depression #selfcare #agoraphobia
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:50:23	@bullfrogr ...a notebook with you. Even small to put in your pocket. Write down anything that catches your attention. Everything. Use later?

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:45:40	@bullfrogr I always used to say, "You can't summon the Muse." I was talking to another writer in the pub and he said, "But the...
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:43:27	@bullfrogr Yes. Although sometimes that inspiration can come from nowhere, anywhere! Many times I have pushed for it, tried to find it. Nil.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:34:00	@bullfrogr I can go either way for my personal writing, but I usually need a point for my Blog. Unless it's just an update, casual, rant.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:31:34	I think I need an #Anime Day today. Even if it's my old stuff. #tired #insomnia #solace #hermit #Aspergers #depression
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:25:57	@bullfrogr Me too!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:25:27	@bullfrogr I know. I have a lot of Followers (relatively? to what?) but no Comments anymore. Some likes. Idk WP changes, I'm not writing.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:21:08	@bullfrogr ... LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:20:38	@bullfrogr You never know. Someone just might not say it in a Comment!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:19:00	@bullfrogr You're beautiful just the way you are. We all are despite our insanity the pops up every once in a while. You?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:15:56	@bullfrogr I would cry at some Comments. What do you say when a total stranger tells you about your Blog Post and how it saved their life.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 23:13:03	@bullfrogr You funny girl. Reminds me of the past when people would do that. So crazy and flattering. But not writing now.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 22:59:29	@bullfrogr I know honey. It's okay, and it's okay now. You're welcome. I try to help as best I can. Come to me when you need help. xx
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 04:55:26	@bullfrogr No more Tweeting into the Grand Canyon!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 04:52:23	@bullfrogr You either have to stop engaging or...who knows with your Settings or phone.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 04:50:17	@bullfrogr I know what you mean. It's basically like you're giving your Twitter Acct a ping; waking it from sleep.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 04:44:52	@bullfrogr Okay. I will eat something. Make your Tweeting less busy for a while you can talk to others or do whatever wish!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 04:36:45	@bullfrogr I can't spell anything anymore, remember correct meanings of words. Ah, whatever. I need food. Irrelevant. Just feel weak.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 04:06:39	@bullfrogr I see. Well, I can understand because meds, head injuries have messed up my memory. Very bad short term.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 02:37:19	@bullfrogr x ;D
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 02:36:55	@bullfrogr You too, babe. xxx
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 02:24:58	@bullfrogr You are too. I am just not at my best right now. LOL
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 02:08:28	@bullfrogr I'm amazed I keep doing anything some days! ROTFLMAO!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 02:07:05	@bullfrogr Now catamenial migraines. So you can kind of put things together basically. Due to head, prior issues, bigger possible issues.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 02:03:45	@bullfrogr propensity to get worse? Logical. And epilepsy. Catamenial. To do with your period. Developed epilepsy syndrome catamenial
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 02:01:10	@bullfrogr It's fine. Hysterectomy for Fibroids that are insane. 46 so kind of early Menopause. Can change moods so since I have Bipolar...
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 01:47:41	@bullfrogr It's okay. Some more pills and surgery toward the end of the year should help?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 01:45:51	@bullfrogr Me too. I'm also reading an amazing book about your Country's history now. It's incredible! So fascinating!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 01:41:15	@bullfrogr I also tend to take breaks from being online when my world becomes too much. At least these days. So nothing to do with you!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 01:39:21	@bullfrogr Sick and trying to clean/organize my apartment. I live alone so it's pretty stupid, frustrating, I'm dying... sick now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 01:36:19	@bullfrogr Yes. I think I do understand you? And will more in time. I haven't even had any time to talk to you yet!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 01:33:46	@bullfrogr That's fair. I've been all over the map. Some things are more concrete, but my Short Stories come from nowhere! #writing
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 01:29:50	@bullfrogr At other times, this has been like a "Writer's Drug of Choice" for me. I DON'T try. Words pour and it feels so good. #writing
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 01:22:37	@bullfrogr That is how to start. Although, I have had an inspiration or idea, but sometimes it's best to put it aside if you can. #writing
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 01:19:05	@bullfrogr This is what I wanted to tell you. I write/have written every style. No matter what, idea or not. Just WRITE. #writing
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 01:15:17	@bullfrogr Be kind, helpful, compassionate to people in the world? Funny, as I was just thinking about me and this exact question!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-21 01:09:05	@PlusGuidance @Independent / Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 03:53:17	@patientanon Predictable in many parts but still good. #film #writing

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 03:17:27	@Zinquefty Also, Delete from Twitter db to never be shown again.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 01:42:16	Watching "Finding Forrester." Why did I never see this #film before? So far, bloody awesome.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 01:39:10	@bullfrogr Yes. It's another later movie. They've been in one or two before? Can't remember. Called #Minions the movie and what they are. :D
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 01:34:06	@bullfrogr Thank you! I actually have a the movie! Love Sandra Bullock too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 01:26:25	@bullfrogr That's okay too!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 01:25:46	@bullfrogr Okay.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 01:08:33	@bullfrogr I can see your thread now. #twitterfart
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 01:07:11	@bullfrogr Either way, it's fine. I get picky because I'm a writer. But more casual here? If I get confused reading you can I ask questions?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 00:17:59	Time to enjoy some tea, and try to have a mellow, alright day. I'm already 3 on Richter.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 00:05:49	@Zinquefty Okay. I must have taken it out of context from what we were talking about. Still, another issue; another day.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 00:03:55	@Zinquefty More about bullying, some not safe, being hurt etc. Because the dart to my heart was a girl on the Spectrum saying it was so fun.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-20 00:00:03	@Zinquefty That's why I wanted to forward that comment to them.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 23:58:54	@Zinquefty RT by Mental Health Group. I jumped on it and said, ahhh, maybe not folks. So have been talking about it for a little while.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 23:57:01	@Zinquefty No, not that. Article from UK paper posted so good for mental health people to get out, meet people, blah blah.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 23:54:15	@bullfrogr Yes, I keep seeing them come up with the same start! I have to do that sometimes too. Even when proof!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 23:42:25	Call for Submissions. For this one my #photography . Visual art so my #writing out the window. Themed, Juried. Not ready. Well? Undeveloped?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 23:22:35	Sorry. The Poll before? Auto-incorrect! So for the Presidency #HillaryClinton or #DonaldTrump in a Bowling Tourney!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 23:18:26	@bullfrogr I think something is wrong with Twitter. Like me not seeing your feed, I just wrote something and won't send. Power off, restart.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 22:58:18	@Zinquefty Okay, sorry. Won't again. Will delete now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 22:52:55	Thanks @Team_ToH . I'm serious! A lot of weeks have been around 38°C with humidity. NON-STOP. I have no air conditioner. Fun times!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 22:38:36	Can we PLEASE fast forward to Fall? This Summer has placed us in an oven at 425°F. We have NOT turned into yummy cookies!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 10:17:15	I think Gumby should have run for President with Pokey as VP.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 10:13:26	Did I just hear #Giuliani say all police shootings, not justified and justified because there is no Black America, no White... #RNCinCLE

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 09:21:30	Okay. My turn to hang my head over my toilet and heave. Talking about #SyrianRefugees . I'm in Canada and we welcomed them. #RNCinCLE
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 09:13:34	@holsenp @motivate51 @CNNPolitics / Thanks for the Like. Maybe they're trying to get back on TV but this is the only gig they could find.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 09:09:48	@svdate @holsenp / I'm sorry re: the death of the soldier in Benghazi. His Mom asking why was a "computer guy" even there? Doing His Job.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 08:53:19	@holsenp @motivate51 @CNNPolitics / I know. Scott Baio? Seriously? And Antonio Sabato Jr. Q-List Stars.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 08:44:29	I love @Zinquefty. He totally kicks ass and has Superpowers! I'm not lying. I've seen him fly.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 08:35:34	All is quiet on Twitter, regarding the #RepublicanNationalConvention . Is it because they have their heads hanging over toilets?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 05:26:11	I already have a #Migraine . Why am I watching the #RNCinCLE #torture #selfharm
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 04:20:51	@bullfrogr Me too! Okay. Go kiss your pillows if you're tired now. *pats head*
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 04:13:59	@bullfrogr I was only trying to remind you that I understand even if I am not in your head. We can still support each other equally though.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 04:10:09	@bullfrogr Now don't go too far the other way my dear. It wasn't stupid. You were only expressing your care for me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 04:07:12	@bullfrogr Ok. And no, no. Nobody is sicker or has more problems than another. It is not a contest and you can't measure another's feelings.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 04:04:11	@bullfrogr Okay. Will have to check time zone! I can tell you about me in DM later. Want to read what you wrote too. Sweet dreams. xo
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 04:02:29	@bullfrogr Prescribed Propranolol few months ago. Even little screen hurts at times! Have to wear sunglasses all the time!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 04:00:54	@bullfrogr *nods* I'm going to lie down for a while now okay hon. Head hurting and tired. Not sure but could be having continual migraines.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:56:00	@bullfrogr Yes, me too. But have to take good with bad. Can't be offended if someone doesn't get back to you or anything. Hang with the good
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:53:15	Called Neuro. Fix my head? Want to re-add 50mg Lamictal. Chucked as seizure free for ages. #Menopause #depression debilitating. Propensity!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:44:00	@bullfrogr People say, say whatever you want. I'm a firm believer in Free Speech, but I hate when I get too "Free" and become an asshole :D
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:38:33	@PlusGuidance @Independent / Thanks for the Like. I'm a huge Advocate so I'd like to drive people toward this discussion.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:35:10	@bullfrogr Initially, I used Twitter my (dying) Blog. A vehicle. Now I'm in Social Media quicksand or soaring through the air. Pick a day.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:30:48	@bullfrogr Oh, sorry. My phone is slow...
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:29:58	@bullfrogr Can't see what they sent. Froggy?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:28:31	@bullfrogr Nice to see where. Like friend I have! :))
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:27:15	@bullfrogr Gotcha.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:26:33	@bullfrogr Again, it's okay. After being around for this long, I can remember those I've known unless they've changed both avatar and name.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:21:11	@bullfrogr No. *laughing* Psycho Killer African Tree Frog!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:18:41	@bullfrogr Just face and gun.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:17:42	@bullfrogr This might help your memory? Old avatar. http:// static.giantbomb.com/uploads/origin al/1/12675/440651-faye_valentine.jpg …
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:13:44	@bullfrogr Oh! No worries. I had an anime avatar back then. Faye from Cowboy Bebop. Years ago. Also, you get into groups, people leave etc.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:09:13	@bullfrogr Cartoon frog avatar?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 03:06:55	@bullfrogr THAT is not good. xx I was actually going to say, it's awesome to talk to you after so long! You were locked tight. That's why?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:52:20	@bullfrogr Nobody's is. We all have our breaking points.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:49:39	@bullfrogr Cause and effect.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:45:03	@bullfrogr Of course you're tolerant and kind. You Followed me. Oh, WHAM!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:43:03	@Zinquefty Good question. Ditto RT. Follow, then not if you're fast too?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:41:15	@bullfrogr Okay. Chaos Wins!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:38:47	@bullfrogr You haven't eaten shit yet? Of any kind? It's not THAT bad once you get used to it. Tastes like chicken.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:29:05	@bullfrogr I have disorganized crap all over. Would that fuel your depression? I'm depressed because I can't fix it. It's art. Mutual Chaos.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:22:54	@bullfrogr I say take the high road. Don't stoop to their level. But feel free to judge if you like. Smack them with a Reverse God Complex.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:17:29	@bullfrogr *laughing so hard* I live alone, so maybe furniture with #depression in some corners?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:15:15	@bullfrogr Who is, doll? The concept is to take each other as we are. If not, ditch the judgemental hypocrites. But don't judge them.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:11:28	@bullfrogr Come straight over to my place! I'm doing the same and have lots of corners. Well, my apartment does. I only have a few.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-19 02:05:55	@bullfrogr That's how it always should be.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-17 04:53:47	@beyondxdarkness Although I see comments here of interesting and different perspective. It is true to view the present as is.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-15 06:43:56	If you all want to label me as gay, with all of this homophobia in the air? You can Unfollow me. I wouldn't want to upset you. #gblt #humour
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-15 06:37:18	Oh, for Hell's Bell's deafening our ears! Now everyone is up in arms about a gay Sulu in "Star Trek Beyond." What about Uhura? #gblt #geek

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 06:43:50	Can we PLEASE fast forward to Fall? This Summer has placed us in an oven at 425°F. We have NOT turned into yummy cookies!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 06:37:01	@cactusian Maybe something to do with my recent addiction we were laughing about? Wormy? Any special words regarding apples in OZ?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 04:18:35	I'm SO sick of saying my #Aspergers doesn't bother me. It does and messes up my life so much. I'm overcompensating again. That's even worse.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 03:39:56	@SunSedApp Keep me posted.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 03:17:56	I feel like a total sewer rat, that's going to throw up. "Out, Damn Head Injury!" "Alas, poor Body. I knew it well." Exeunt.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 02:55:10	@PlusGuidance @Independent / I'm skeptical here. There are a lot of people running around to bully others and hone in on their weaknesses.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 02:32:29	Although, watching "Underworld over and over has its benefits. *lusts Kate Beckinsale*

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 02:06:28	Here we go with Daytime Television. I guess I can watch "Underworld" for the 1,375,892th time. It's on.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 01:16:39	@Zinquefty Where I HAVE to live? Prisoner of my own home? Once for Complex partial seizures I had to tape all my locks shut for sleeping.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 01:09:55	@Zinquefty All of your woes sound like where I have to live. Sometimes I wonder if I live here.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 01:01:35	@pueblokc Well, a minus for me. Keep me from doing things!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 00:59:47	Well happy, even joyful, surprised and relieved people are still talking to me after my Asylum Poetry yesterday. Still valid points though.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 00:54:48	@cactusian Oh, honey! Don't worry if you can't find a word befitting a Twitter me. "Brat" is universal! Or just make up something! Anything!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 00:50:15	@pueblokc Flip side? Too much work. I hate Social Media enough. I've said a million times. I'm here and can't even keep my Blog up! More?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-14 00:46:53	I'm starting to take nihilism to a whole lower level these days.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 04:44:23	I think I've spewed enough for now. Thanks for thinking I'm a total nutcase. I am, and very proud of it. Knock on my door anytime!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 04:40:24	@n8wachT Where do you even end up going? And how many of you are out there? Are you all the same? Finally, do you believe in Soulmates?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 04:37:42	@n8wachT Process continues on and on forever. I'm explaining it poorly. But in essence, do you keep meeting your soulmate wherever you go?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 04:34:37	@n8wachT If you want to get into Quantum and the Multiverse, two molecules paired, other comes to reach, split and disappear. Now new pair.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 04:14:28	I've given up. I'm lying my weaponry down to no longer fight with any of you NTs anymore. Talk to me. Please? Or not. But we're great. YES!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 04:06:21	Full circle, we bring ourselves here; those with Mental Illnesses. Solace from the Real World's brutal NTs. Only to find them here as well.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 04:01:43	This makes it all worse for the Leprosy Chic in the eyes of the NT. Now we have been "Branded." Hospitals, drugs, cuttings, suicides...
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 03:58:25	The Real World has nothing on Twitter for the fashionable, Leprosy Chic. Forget any NT "Inclusion." It's no wonder we need care or die.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 03:53:04	I see many people with Mental Illnesses reach out to NTs on Twitter. Never (yet?) the other way around. Several areas of interest. Ignored.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 03:47:16	There's a very easy way to stop what becomes wars, battles at times between the NTs and those with Mental Illnesses. TALK TO EACH OTHER.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 03:40:32	You as NTs preach "Inclusion of All." Yet what colour is hypocrisy? Fear? You become Olympic Runners because you fear us, the Leprosy Chic.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 03:31:42	The 48hrs or more have been targeted as "NT seeing my Mental Illnesses as Leprosy Chic. It's the new yellow." Yellow. Cowardice.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 03:27:50	I can't look at Twitter right now. Much less it's macrocosm; the real world. My pedestal. Mental Illnesses, Disorders aren't Leprosy Chic.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-13 03:20:01	I think I only have one hinge left. Everyone else thinks I've lost them all. Time to repair or replace. Fuck you NTs on your pedestals.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 14:31:03	@pueblokc Hey, you! That's excellent to hear and very reassuring. It'll be like a video game. Block! Punch! Hi, good to see you. FUCK OFF!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 14:17:20	I'm thinking of setting myself up on FB just to piss people off. Always the black sheep of the family, always bullied. Hmmm...
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 14:06:28	@n8wachT I can give you hints, or help you. But I will say it's not the woman singing the song.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 13:59:39	@n8wachT Also being Wordly, I dissect lyrics for every song I listen to. I've put "Never Wanted This" to my avatar. Can you see it?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 13:45:56	@n8wachT "Central Reservation" by Beth Orton. And yeah... Orbit. But this song will drag you out of your worst depression?
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 13:40:18	@n8wachT Oh, yeah. Armin. Duh? But song I love? Lust? "Never Wanted This" with Justine.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 13:28:14	So far one vote says I should keep Tweeting. I'll keep it simple. Lying on my bed listening to "Whispering Wind" by Moby. It's amazing.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 11:44:51	My battery is dying. Do you want me to stop Tweeting and STFU? No worries. No offense taken.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 11:37:39	I know a Scot. Man, wee, cuter than a button. 80yrs? Seen a lot. Says, "Live life, then fuck it." Words of Wisdom? Maybe.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 11:28:22	So maybe you're thinking I'm the Mistress of my own Crazy Slavery. Quite possible. Yet I'd like to think others would tell you I'm fine.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 10:54:22	I am not the center of the Universe. Just so you know.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 10:52:17	Wow. My fucking anger is somehow doing something weird. Must have been #Therapy S'all good!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 10:43:17	Yes! I am angry for those I know and love trapped behind keyboards that have feelings but can't get them out!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 10:39:56	The problem with Social Media, Twitter, FB, we are not people! It's hard enough to be people as we are! We chain ourselves to worse hiding.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 10:33:58	I will speak freely. You will perceive me eyes focussed. Will you accept me, saying all are equal? Or not. I won't call you a hypocrite.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 10:23:29	@ShiriAppleby You're gifted. Everyone that even touches the show is. Congratulations Director and Starring Role.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 10:20:11	@ShiriAppleby Sorry, Shiri. I missed the start because maybe "aREAL" person needed me and vice versa. I can see the awesome episode later.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 09:24:37	@HardAspie OMG! Dealing with change! Moving House! I can't deal with a "NEW" Bathroom and Shower! No joke! *laughing so hard*
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 09:21:54	@HardAspie When everything is wonderful and seemingly perfect, when it goes away with no explanation, I'm still living in that space.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 09:20:06	@HardAspie No. Plus the Romantic. Maybe all! And it's very hard for me because I'm an Aspie that doesn't do well with change.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 09:13:48	@HardAspie Good. We've been so fast and close for so long. Been the same with others (Aspies to boot?) and *poof* I still think of them.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 09:08:46	@HardAspie Thanks for "getting it." You always do. But we can't "leave" or drift away from each other. Know that. Not after so long, luv. xo
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 09:03:48	@HardAspie ... and some uncertainty with my head and eyes. Hot, sexy, female Neuro who is very smart. I'm enjoying working with her!
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 09:01:12	@HardAspie Otherwise, I'm okay. Getting better at saying "Fuck it!" when it really should be said. Health getting sorted but time...
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 08:58:32	@HardAspie I disappeared for a while. Still debating nuking my Blog. I feel there's nothing left in me to carry on. Thus, here too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 08:56:48	@HardAspie I apologize so much, then I do what you did. Then nobody talks to me. I can't win. Then others come back. I feel good.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 08:53:44	July 11. One week countdown to #TrumpHell Oh, yee reap what thee sow.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 08:08:02	#Therapy was good today. As soon as I left, instant earworm: "Hammer And A Nail" by @Indigo_Girls I think that qualifies as good.
16253011	patientanon	2016-07-12 04:36:39	It would be like adding a condo in the middle of a church. Or something. Universities don't want your money to expand anyway! #corruption

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-11 10:55:51	@ShiriAppleby Hey, Shiri. Taking "you/Rachel" away (if?) how did Directing make you feel? I say "if" because Direction is a separate focus.

16253011	patientanon	2016-07-02 21:12:26	Just want to say one thing. On the way to another Psychiatrist hoping he will take me to get rid of current. Nervous, Valium #Aspie crazy.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-29 01:07:53	I need to take some time to work on my OWN life. Not everyone else's. Hard to learn and do this. Never done all my life.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-29 01:02:45	Gonna go. Wasn't pulling any Passive-aggressive garbage. Just thoughts. I think I might need a holiday from technology. Unless important.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-29 00:56:43	I'm feeling pretty useless on Twitter. People are all Tweeting what they know, to groups of the same topics, research, more. I'm just blah.

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-25 22:53:31	@n8wachT The pics? Sorry. Mobile Phones near so many electrodes will increase their temperature. So much, I'll get third degree burns.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-25 22:47:07	@n8wachT If you have hair you look like a cross between Medusa and the Bride Of Frankenstein. BRING A CAP! Math? 14 times more than head?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-25 22:38:45	@n8wachT They even put them on my forehead and my face. Wash hair because this "stuff" they put on them to make them stick.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-25 22:34:45	@n8wachT I've had several for my epilepsy and I'm trying to remember the most electrodes they put on me for one. Mid-30s? It's nuts.

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 06:17:03	Oops. Food went out the window today. Not literally, of course. But I can make it happen. Any requests?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 06:12:19	@ShiriAppleby Sorry, won't bother anymore but contact me if you need anything as before. Looking forward to show tonight!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 06:09:58	@ShiriAppleby I hate to carry on but you were also up a 3am. EST at least for the Tweet. With crap I reinstall. Will do. Pain but works.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 06:00:38	@ShiriAppleby Plus grammar? Maybe? "send on accident" You write impeccably.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 05:54:37	@ShiriAppleby Unless you spoke casually in lower case, it has all the markings of a bogus Tweet from your Account.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 05:51:42	@ShiriAppleby Did you contact me about the link that looked like spam? I can't see it. This might have gone backward. To me from you.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 05:38:13	My friend is SO awesome! He found a preamp and the right cord for my BOSE, to use a turntable I have. I can play my vinyl again! WHEE!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 05:15:42	Or buy another because this one is so old! And Twitter! Grrrrrr... Payment plan for an iPhone! Wanted one for how long? I'm a MacHead too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 05:08:28	Just waiting for person to get back to me to know when it happened to them. Then might have to start hacking my own phone. Lord. Technology.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 05:01:04	@bellanatale2004 xo
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 04:52:35	TWITTER ALERT! TELL ME IF YOU ARE RECEIVING ANY LINKS WARNING YOU NOT TO OPEN THEM AND WHEN! I BELIEVE IT'S TWITTER. STILL, I NEED TO KNOW!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:52:42	@ShiriAppleby Shit! Sorry. This is really important. When did you get it? I'll need to know that if crazy things happen LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:48:18	@ShiriAppleby more problems. I'll take my chances with my phone for looking into all of this. Take care and let me know if you need me!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:44:33	@ShiriAppleby More! Now it's a quick 403 error then a pop to a bizarre server provider, domain names etc. Let me know if you have any...
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:27:41	@ShiriAppleby *thinking*
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:22:42	@n8wachT Yum. *want*
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:19:50	@ShiriAppleby Thanks, hon.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:18:33	@ShiriAppleby I'm only using my mobile, don't use any unsafe sites so why? Did it only come from me? Did you click on it?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:15:04	@ShiriAppleby Macafee. That's Firewall Software but certainly not a link to the product. Why it was flagged. Bogus so could be harmful.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:12:02	@ShiriAppleby The link when you read it? Can you recognize anything? Spell the beginning. I'm going to purposely misspell to keep it away.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:08:41	@ShiriAppleby in what I'm sending here! I did reset to home. Twitter? I don't know but it can give me serious problems but not like this!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:05:30	@ShiriAppleby So I have to remember to close all my tabs when using it so it only shows my homepage. I can only hope it's not showing up...
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:03:27	@ShiriAppleby in Chrome. The last update I did for it is pissing me off because it's doing that when I open it on my own! I'm like privacy!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 03:01:13	@ShiriAppleby Okay, bear with me as I have to get into some techie stuff. When I clicked, it took me to the last page I was looking at in...
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 02:50:13	@ShiriAppleby Whoa. That link? No way! I took a look at it, risking my own security and it doesn't do anything. Well, not exactly true.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-21 02:34:21	@ShiriAppleby My heart goes out to you, Shiri. It is truly sad to deal with a loss of someone very close to you. Take your time.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 11:10:39	G'night. Now not just #PTSD but have to put restraints on the #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 10:39:46	Where am I? #PTSD can be like a line of Dominos. One touch of the first, one thing. All then fall. They are other things. I'm there.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 08:50:10	So over and out. I need to deal with this. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 08:39:35	Wow. I have been in a bad mood today. Triggers! #FathersDay #PTSD #abuse #violence #flashbacks I think you get it. He wasn't good.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 04:47:46	Well my, my! ! Guess I can stop watching now. Who knew?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 03:23:46	So sick pollyanna and the world is so wonderful and full of joy. Have you ever been in pain? Real pain? And you can't measure another's.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 02:59:20	Oooh. Two choices of to watch on TV. I want to watch Romania vs. Albania No flipping back and forth. Me=Batty! My pick? Romania!

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 00:35:04	@RachelRoams I find you so funny. The pics you send? I laugh! I also sprinkled glitter on you right? You must have a killer sense of humour.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 00:26:56	Happy Father's Day to my REAL, biological father. Kind, gentle. Unlike the one who raised me. Never met you. I know you love me. I love you.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 00:15:00	Hello everyone! Good morning, afternoon, evening, night!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 00:09:44	@n8wachT Yes, that's very good too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-20 00:06:13	@n8wachT I can translate that! "I have an idea." That one was easy! How are you doing?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 08:01:46	Nice Marketing Tool from a Tobacco Company. Has Computer Power On symbol on filter. Says press to keep cigarette fresh. Just burns faster.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 07:48:50	Ah, whatever. Irony, irony, irony. A sense of humour is your Lifeboat!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 07:43:02	Where's my Blog Post? Okay WP to Twitter? Anybody there?

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 03:41:54	Oops. I forgot. Many drugs can't be taken with grapefruit/juice. Fresca™ is a grapefruit pop with natural juice. My Propranolol. Shit.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 03:26:12	@Zinquefty If Portugal wins the match, there will be non-stop car honking and yelling with flags all over cars. Our heads can't win today.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 03:19:48	Incredible urge for Fresca™ *runs to fridge* Go Austria! OMG! If I was in the Portuguese area of my city? They'd squash me like a bug!

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 03:12:08	@Zinquefty Oh, no! And I thought my situation was bad. And your headache too! I'd put my head on the counter and bang it with a hammer!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 03:07:38	And now Portugal vs. Austria Go Austria! "The hills are alive, with the sound of ..."
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 02:56:47	Going insane turning up the volume on my TV because of people riding by on their huge Harley's. Then my TV is deafening when they're gone.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 02:39:23	@ShiriAppleby @ConstanceZimmer P.S. I'm not stalking you or some weirdo, obsessive fan requiring bodyguard. I like you both and talk a lot.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 02:33:06	@ShiriAppleby @ConstanceZimmer I know a famous man. We email! Just an example similar to you. You care, and see we're all just people.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 02:20:53	@ShiriAppleby @ConstanceZimmer I just want to say you both do an awesome job keeping up with your fans. A lot of famous people don't.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 02:11:26	Of the following Television Shows that are currently running, which is the best?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 01:58:19	@GoldenPDesigns Merci, mon ami!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 01:56:46	@GoldenPDesigns Okay, thanks! You can DM it to me too. That way memory impaired doofus over here won't forget! Thanks again. PA.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 01:53:47	@ConstanceZimmer Hi. Have you ever done Stand-up Comedy? If not, considered it? Because I think you have the gift! You'd be perfect! xo
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 01:47:12	@GoldenPDesigns I forgot to get back to this one! *WANT* I'll have to go find you to buy now? Totally awesome!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-19 01:33:02	@ConstanceZimmer Is this the same episode of Jimmy you were on? Unfortunately I missed that (Michael Jackson and all.)
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 08:48:56	This also means bye bye tiny mobile screen. For a bit. My eyes can't take you right now either. Never take your eyes for granted folks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 08:38:15	No more Russia. Being as partially visually impaired as I am, reading was strenuous maximus. Wait for TV and sunglasses. #blurry #ouch
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 08:28:41	Thank you so much! Three people actually voted! That's amazing! https:// twitter.com/patientanon/st atus/743925797870776320 …
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 08:05:31	Okay! The results of my Poll are 100% Mess Around on Twitter. While waiting I was reading, say, Russia's Peter I and the Treaty of Nystadt.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 06:33:44	I'm not going to Tweet anymore until the vote (or votes) are tabulated.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 06:31:15	Well, so far my Poll is only telling me to Mess Around on Twitter. A solitary vote or people want to talk to me? Or read garbage?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 05:58:26	I had to change my Poll because my environment changed. Sorry folks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 05:35:38	Why am I wearing pants outside??? Hot! *eats water* A year ago I'd be just fine. #perimenopause #menopause #ihatemyhormones
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 04:56:07	I think I need a good dose of air, sunshine and Russian History. Let's get m'self together and head like the wind.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 04:41:59	My hair is looking pretty impressive today. It's like all five members of Duran Duran c.1985 waking up together after 72hrs of partying.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 04:34:20	@GothicDressCode Great to see your site back up! However, now I have to look at both it, and my Credit Cards in sheer torture. #goth
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 04:17:22	@gothicgourdgirl So how are you doing Sweetie?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-18 03:44:36	CRAP! Learned over bed to reach for something and CRASH! I'm flexible so curl, tuck, cover head to avoid injury. Already have huge TBI!

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-17 22:23:28	@ConstanceZimmer Kind of doubly embarrassing to say this but I hope I haven't offended you. Asperger's communication can be awful at times.

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-17 06:37:19	@Zinquefty Don't get me started on Urban Planning and simple math to account for infrastructure--both maintenance and growth.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-17 06:31:20	@ConstanceZimmer @ShiriAppleby Tres cool pic.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-17 06:28:39	@Zinquefty Ah, yes. Perfect Ad to match article below it! Granny can lead the family to the benches and they'll all feel healthy and happy.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-17 06:24:12	@Zinquefty ... I'm trying to control myself here... I think I need to sit down... Does anyone see any benches...? #epicfacepalm
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-17 03:08:05	Watching Germany vs. Poland Not particularly biased in this match. All about Group Strategy now. So, I pick Poland. #EURO2016
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-17 02:51:28	@Zinquefty Okay, thanks. Have I told you you're the best lately?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-17 02:49:02	@doc_rob WHOO HOO! Better remember to get her something really special back!

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-17 02:34:39	@Zinquefty Okay. No harm in d/l just to check it out though. Not to be greedy pants but HP done by weekend? No pressure. If I need bag.

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 23:19:37	Word.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 23:17:24	@KwakuToure The most important thing is #Aspies #Auties everyone on the Spectrum and their parents get PROPERLY educated #advocacy
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 23:13:54	@KwakuToure Don't get me wrong. This is my Free Speech. I used to hate the Quacks and Curebies, but room for them too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 23:11:28	@KwakuToure I'll put my money on Neuroplasticity (at least for my epilepsy) than wearing his funny hat. *shades of Scientology* *shivers*
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 23:07:36	@KwakuToure #Aspergers and #Autism are Developmental Disorders. Not a cancer patient who had a root canal. Connection?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 23:04:41	@KwakuToure Neurochemistry? I have epilepsy so I am no stranger to GABA and glutamate. My brain swims in them. Help? My thyroid is fine.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 23:01:16	@KwakuToure Science is finally making great strides toward genetics where there was too much shame before. I have a great uncle #Autie !
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 22:58:38	@KwakuToure A contradiction because of how it works and how much it takes away or what the body can need.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 22:55:54	@KwakuToure Plus "Ketones." Getting rid of heavy metals. That extends to the Ketogenic Diet. It can be dangerous.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 22:51:52	@KwakuToure I'm probably going to have to stop soon because this is getting exhausting. The Autistic Spectrum? GABA? Glutamate?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 22:48:38	@KwakuToure He said he had encephalitis. No. That would require emergent surgery because he might die. He had a TBI and recovered.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 22:45:22	@KwakuToure His brain anatomy is a mess. He's saying things happen in the frontal lobe when they don't. He worked on eyes. That's occipital.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 22:42:38	@KwakuToure Acupuncture can help some people with some things but it's not the answer for all just because it worked for him.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 22:40:54	@KwakuToure True voltage through our bodies, pH delicate and can cause lots of problems but he's blowing both up to exclude everything else.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 22:37:36	@KwakuToure And no disrespect. Have you studied any type of medicine? I have. Was going to enter field. Just waiting for him to say Krebs!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 22:32:37	@KwakuToure Thanks for that. Although I am a firm believer in Free Speech, this guy is wrong on so many levels. Should I continue?
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 21:22:34	@Oh ! I missed you there @APerfectAppleby
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-16 21:19:00	@ashton_owen @ShiriAppleby This made me laugh.

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-13 04:26:05	@ConstanceZimmer and @ShiriAppleby I've watched S201 three times now. I have unlimited access to both channels I can watch you over & over.

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-12 10:16:48	@Zinquefty Ah, you create lots of things and very well. You just don't know it! It's the thought of it that makes you lazy! It's ok. Me too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-12 10:12:57	@Zinquefty Plus you know all of my theater background. I can even create stage makeup from home items. LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-12 10:09:32	@Zinquefty Very interesting. Surprisingly less dialogue than you'd think as you incorporate everything. Where camera goes, look of scene.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-12 10:06:21	@Zinquefty We could even make a YouTube. Never written a Screenplay but helped someone edit for their film. I could pick it up?

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-12 09:46:12	@Zinquefty What if things worked on a geographical plane like humans? We can go to the Bahamas while living in n and vice versa.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-12 09:43:59	@Zinquefty Ditto if they'll fry in sunlight. Zombies, just like Vampires need blood, require brains for living sustenance? Vacations...
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-12 09:41:23	@Zinquefty Good question! Even Vampires, but they live forever, or die after so many years, or whatever story you believe.

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-12 08:50:10	I fear people look at my Profile with my many psych diagnoses and do judge me. Add no deemed "erudite" Tweets they see? They need a mirror.

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-12 03:00:44	I'm still standing firm on FB. No.Way. That would be real life. All the kids who DID bully me would come back and find me! Plus Evil Family!
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-12 02:56:37	Thought I had an Instagram account. Can't find anything. Guess I should get? Everyone is using it. I feel like a kid again who never fit in.

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-11 11:49:32	@n8wachT Music, one of my Personal ANTHEMS as a teenager was Lloyd Cole's "Lost Weekend." That's me. Duh. But you and location. Funny.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-11 11:43:47	I won't Tube it. Cba. But check out "Dance Yrself Clean" by LCD Soundsystem. Ace just for being Ace, and LCD? Uh, ya? Also good #Aspie song?

16253011	patientanon	2016-06-11 11:16:02	Have you ever had a moment where you stop frozen and say, "What the FUCK am I doing?" Okay. Rhetorical. Just happened to me now. That's all.
16253011	patientanon	2016-06-11 11:01:13	Hey @mama_kass Good song but it always makes me think about Etta period. Aw, what a life she had. So good but ultimately so tragic.

16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 12:25:07	In love, there's never, "The One That Got Away." If you look back, how many were, "The Ones That Got Away."
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 12:02:57	@cactusian No, don't think I would. Just be witty? Which I'd try to do anyway with our senses of humour alike.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 11:56:00	I'm enjoying the tunes, and just sending good vibes. Hoping that person is well. I'm sure they are after so much time.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 11:50:24	Listening to a song that was sent or received involving someone in a relationship and it hurts? Fine. But eventually just enjoy the song.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 11:33:40	@gothicgourdgirl You might like my last one? Forgot to hash. Wrote too much!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 11:25:03	@cactusian Okay. Well, the imagination runs wild! Let me think when I have an apple for breakfast-and hopefully not give you a REAL answer!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 11:07:23	Does anyone know how much of a prima donna, bitch Siouxsie is? I saw her in concert and sound feedback. She wouldn't finish show! Seriously!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 10:59:50	Thanks for the RT @gothicgourdgirl
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 10:46:26	It's surprising what $10 Bazooka™ Desktop Speakers can do to your head.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 10:42:58	I should turn the volume down. I'm getting a headache. But you CAN'T turn #goth music down! It's both a Cardinal Rule and a Cardinal Sin!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 10:38:51	"Far Side Of Crazy" by Wall Of Voodoo. It's done by Andy Prieboy who is awesome. Oh, let's 'Dive' into "Marian." Sisters of Mercy. #goth
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 10:31:18	Listening to music on dead Mac. At least can still do that. I always Tweet what I'm listening to which I'm sure can be insane. I'm eclectic.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 09:22:22	OMFG NT STUPIDITY! *slaps self all over* The simplest, tiniest, logical concept even WITH NT HUMOUR!!! Dude still clueless. #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 09:13:54	I love being in a places where "Membership Has Its Privileges." Hanging out with the Staff after places close businesses.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 08:21:51	@RachelRoams My verdict? Tool vs. weapon? Remnant of a tool. With the steep edges meant to be held in hand. Other for work. Roam anywhere!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 08:13:02	@RachelRoams Other side is COMPLETELY flat. However, it has a VERY sharp point at one end, and an upward smooth part missing. A 45° angle.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 08:07:26	@RachelRoams One side, two equidistant raised peaks at 45° to create a 90° pyramid. Peaks and pyramidal shape run entire length of stone.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 07:54:41	@RachelRoams Doing some Archaeology in my own city. Found tiny stone. VERY, VERY, VERY old tool or weapon? Let's see what we've got here.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 07:47:52	Thanks for the RT @gothicgourdgirl
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 07:46:40	@cactusian Okay. Have a good day, Prickly.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 07:45:40	@cactusian Am I supposed to answer this, or is it an Interior Apple Knock Knock Joke?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 04:45:16	@cactusian Hi, Prickly. Clearly that's my pet name for you? How did you sleep? Time zones! Just got your DM. Appt. 15min so
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 04:34:20	Outside looking more #gnarly #boarder than #goth Ball cap with my red hair sticking out, black T w/skulls, crosses, plaid shorts, red kicks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 03:41:46	@RachelRoams I forgot and meant to say that it really is and can be wild and wonderful. Having it can be a gift. You can explore it via me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 03:08:01	@RachelRoams Okay. I think I'm over being so shy now. *winks* I'd love to tell you all about the wild and wonderful world of Asperger's.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-31 03:01:02	This boiling May has made up a quadrillion times more for our frigid April! #GlobalWarming #carbonfootprint
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 22:51:55	@cactusian Still hungry for breakfast. What? What? A THIRD apple?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 22:28:05	One Appt. down. Hysterectomy, Fallopian Tubes, Pelvic Prolapses all over. Later, my Therapist. What should I talk about there.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 22:16:25	@RachelRoams I'm shy now. Asperger's. That and not knowing what to say sometimes. But talk can be overrated, right? x
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 03:44:35	Fucking peri-menopause. DIE PERI-MENOPAUSE, DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! No, it's not turning me into a total bitch. I'm young. Menopause after!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 03:36:16	@RachelRoams @Sasquatch I thought you'd like it, and girl, it would look Absolutely Fabulous. Soon I'll be putting you on the the runway.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 03:30:56	@RachelRoams Thanks for Likes, Doll.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 03:19:09	@RachelRoams @Sasquatch YOU GO GIRL! *tosses glitter all over you*
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 02:39:48	What do they say? You can't put a ($4,000) price on your health? I'll live in pain for a while considering that figure.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 02:37:26	Oh, god. The more on my list about needing an adjustable bed, I might have to actually buy a TEMPUR-PEDIC™ More things wrong with me!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 01:36:33	CHRONIC PAIN=I CAN'T EXERCISE!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 01:34:54	I think I need an adjustable bed. *drools over TEMPUR-PEDIC™* But they are !!! Another thing medically justified. Bed now=Chronic Pain!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 00:36:02	Happy Memorial Day to all in the US. But recall those who fought, fell. In Canada we say "Lest we forget." Line in Kipling's "Recessional."
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 00:13:34	However, stupid Government wouldn't cover TENS. They said too many people have them. But BP is Medical. TENS is Therapy. Still too many?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-30 00:08:57	WHEW! I thought I lost the receipt for my new BP Monitor. Along with a Doctor's Note, covered by the Government? Totally necessary.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-29 23:30:12	@RachelRoams @GoRVing @TravelMindset @ExperienceWA Person made Business Pitch? Consider last Tweet Formally mine.® Serious. Please contact.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-29 23:19:17	@RachelRoams @GoRVing @TravelMindset @ExperienceWA You sound so happy! I'd go on the most dangerous highway in the world. Are several.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-29 23:10:35	@RachelRoams Yep, Rachel. It's tough world out there. Who would know that better than you! So it's good you and I are tight on Twitter!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-29 23:02:14	@RachelRoams @cactusian @Stan_Ridgway Thanks again all. Ditto for coming board @ScottUngerecht and @amarthapa1812 for the RT as well.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-29 22:52:40	@RachelRoams @cactusian @Stan_Ridgway Thanks for the Likes guys! Nice to meet you too Stan. Cheers.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-29 22:32:48	@cactusian And yes. We will write. I have decided.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-29 22:30:41	@cactusian Hi Prickly. Still not up to snuff, so resting like yesterday. Propranolol and its peaks and waves of insomnia! SO Deprived today!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 08:20:40	@cactusian Well, sometime in the future after getting to know each other or something or...duh...migraine now, we can do it!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 08:05:20	@cactusian Well, I love it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 07:46:09	@cactusian
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 07:45:20	@cactusian Thankies.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 07:44:26	@cactusian @RachelRoams Twitter is awful in a lot of ways. You have to learn very hard not to take things personally.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 07:41:56	@cactusian That is only if you care for that sort of thing. Some don't.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 07:40:47	@cactusian Absolutely Prickly! Well, you've got one here! Obv. Maybe the Playing Field can open to snail mail after a bit. Lost Art Form.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 07:37:33	@cactusian Thanks for the Like.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 07:29:49	@cactusian *giggles*
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 07:28:51	@cactusian @Zinquefty Thanks!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 07:28:20	@cactusian Yes. So many NTs don't get it and are put off. Although I have found some that are okay. They are more open and crazy too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 07:02:13	@cactusian I'm good looking and attractive aren't I? @Zinquefty
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 06:57:03	@cactusian I love talking to other Aspies. Isn't it great we can let our being blunt go completely out the window? Ever feel that way?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 06:54:06	@cactusian Thanks for the Like, Prickly. I don't know if you'd find me attractive. I've been told I am. By both genders.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 02:07:46	@Zinquefty
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 02:07:09	Where are my socks? They were on the bed. Oh. On the bed. The seams are on the inside of my shirt. Pants not backwards. Good. #Asperger 's
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 01:58:33	Went into #photography shop. Sales guy wanted to sell his Enlarger. I was okay but don't need now. IDIOT! Photographer, good price, storage!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 01:34:59	There are so many questions in my life right now. The answers will guide the future of my life and where I want it to go. Patience. No fear.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 01:16:25	@RachelRoams I think I figured out how the Kennedy Family Member found me but I'm not sure. Didn't feel like asking that person, you know?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 01:12:51	@RachelRoams So if you'd like, DM me and solve my puzzle? Where did you find me and why did you Follow me? I was shocked!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 01:09:43	@RachelRoams Yes, Twitter is a MASSIVE scale of Networking, where at times, it "can" do it for you. But how for my "Heavy Hitters?" My blog?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 01:04:46	@RachelRoams So you, a member of the Kennedy Family, Famous Television and Music People, and Award Winning Writers have popped up to see me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 01:00:29	@RachelRoams Why me? I'm a nobody. Even if you're trying to look for more reach I have 1,300 Followers! That makes no sense.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 00:57:22	@RachelRoams You followed me for a reason and I don't know why (yet?) I call people like you "Heavy Hitters." I've got some who nailed me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 00:53:09	@RachelRoams @cactusian But the top of Victoria Falls? That's a combination of beauty and stupidity! Joking. I'm the Adrenaline Junkie.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 00:48:59	@RachelRoams @cactusian I want to call you Rach for some reason! Shorten it. I will do ANYTHING but Bunjee was lower on scale after diving.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 00:42:38	@cactusian Thank you for all my Likes, Sweetheart!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 00:37:56	Thanks for liking my Post that got sandwiched in here. I think "hipsters" as a younger age for some reason.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 00:33:07	@cactusian @RachelRoams Now THAT I'd like to taste.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-28 00:31:25	@cactusian He just said it! I think there are are hot girls everywhere. Definitely Oz, Prickly.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 10:02:36	@cactusian @RachelRoams In case that's confusing Blunds are the epitome of NON-fashion in Oz and might be used for gardening?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 09:43:00	@cactusian I hope you don't feel too bad. One friend of someone I knew in Oz said, "Canadian girls are so hot!" *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 09:37:12	@cactusian Thanks for the Like doll. Although I TOTALLY busted you and took you down! Lots of love.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 09:34:30	@cactusian @RachelRoams Please feel free to answer my question if you wish Rachel. Ignore Ian FROM OZ WHO WEARS BLUNDSTONES!!! LOSER!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 09:21:48	@cactusian @RachelRoams How much caffeine and crack was in it? Looks like we have a Humour Battle?Juvenile re: my sense of humour too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 09:14:19	@RachelRoams Thanks for taking my thoughts into account, Rachel.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 09:10:00	@cactusian I think you're funny though my dear. No worries from me. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 09:08:33	@cactusian My sense of humour is so twisted, wild, dark, out of control... I don't think lot of people understand mine either!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 09:05:52	@cactusian Glad you "came" back. I was hoping you'd catch that! I'm still Campaigning for the IOC to include Wordplay for Summer AND Winter.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 05:54:41	@cactusian *laughing so hard* Well done! I give you a Standing O. Wait a minute. Ahhh... that didn't come out quite... Oh, bother!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 03:50:00	I'm not sure if you Liked another Tweet @_confusedpain but thank you if you did. Twitter made it look like it but I couldn't see it.

16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 03:43:09	@InfiniteKnot I've been Pain Scale 11, 12 sometimes. I must have given birth to 546 (or more) children now if labour and birth is like this.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 03:34:12	@InfiniteKnot
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 03:13:04	Oooh! Flick about Rosa Parks on now! Angela Bassett in it also. Let's check this out...
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 02:34:29	@RachelRoams Culture. Not sure where you're going, but go as deep into Anthropology as you can.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 02:31:47	Had to say goodbye to a colleague today. She's retiring so big yay for her! Still, kind of sad. See what happens next, but new person good?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 02:05:29	@RachelRoams What's the most adrenaline pumping thing you've ever done? Me? Skydiving. Biggest rush EVER! Wanted to do as sport but money!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 01:43:50	@InfiniteKnot I'm dying right now. Well, not highest number on Pain Scale. Say... 8?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 01:41:45	@InfiniteKnot Nonetheless, it's only TENS. I have nothing to lose but it not working! Heating pad, forget it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 01:39:11	@InfiniteKnot I never got around to asking my GYN and I now have more questions as things have changed. I'm calling her and my GP.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 01:37:07	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. I just had a re-idea.© I forgot to try it for my cramps that I'm pretty sure like going through non-stop labour.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 01:26:58	@CalliCoop But thanks hon. Don't think I've ever had a healthy food craving this intense before! So how are you?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 01:24:53	@CalliCoop If you're craving four chocolate bars a day (or especially night!) I'll explain what THAT is. But for over crave? Doctor.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 01:21:56	@CalliCoop Even potato chips! You need sodium! Although let me say crave "food." Correction there. And in a relatively, decent manner.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 01:19:29	@CalliCoop I know. I was being my typical, sarcastic self. I do believe that if your body is craving something, it needs something in it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-27 01:16:24	@D8Iveta Hey there! Seeing some Tweets passing by and wanted to see how you are doing? Haven't talked in a while.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-26 23:58:36	All of the sudden, I have become addicted to apples. I could eat five in one sitting. I have no reasonable explanation for this.

16253011	patientanon	2016-05-26 23:01:55	@InfiniteKnot That's great you got a new TENS. I use mine when my ankles blow out. Don't give up on finding a good PHP! You'll find one!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-26 03:49:33	Great day! Finally groceries! Barren fridge. Awesome weather! Sitting outside reading Russian History. Fascinating! Loading camera. Laters!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 22:25:13	@InfiniteKnot Okay. Because you know I have a Footie Team of Doctors! Kidding. That's because GP knows out of scope. That's a good GP.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 22:09:53	@InfiniteKnot Who did you get as a replacement? Are they decent? And sorry, h/a? Just got up a while ago and drawing a blank.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 22:07:19	@InfiniteKnot Oh, shit. I run interference with everyone but Dr. PA guides her own treatment. Are yours open to YOU suggesting ideas?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 22:02:15	@InfiniteKnot How's your Medical Support Team? And I say "Team" because multiple problems usually require multiple doctors.

16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 08:24:16	I am afraid I might be on a downward, spiral staircase to the Basement of Babblement and Bunnies. I am now opening the Cage and signing off.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 08:09:51	That last Tweet was a super fast synapse snap! Partly true but let's expand it to life. Then, Hold on! It's not that bad! Just chill out!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 07:58:27	"Love" is so complicated. As far as feelings for another person, sometimes it's best not to "think" so hard or much. Just accept things.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 07:09:18	I have to listen to Toad The Wet Sprocket and their album Fear now. All this talk and it has been a long time!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 07:05:55	@PanicPandaCat A song about women being sexually assaulted and how ashamed they feel because they're men themselves.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 07:03:32	@PanicPandaCat Haha! Another thing about Toad and their album "Fear." They get serious respect. Because what men would do this???
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 06:52:52	Shopping and I just forgot the world hearing this. From their album "Fear" which is awesome. Been ages! https:// youtu.be/AVYYpNaSs2Y
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 06:35:08	@PanicPandaCat That's cool. I have to put it back up. I hate links. Want pictures.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 05:52:47	Home! Back into my comfy, little yoga pants. Ahhh...
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 03:59:42	Oh, crap! The time! Double Crap! I have to go out! Not a single cloud in a blazing, sunny sky. Okay, eyes. Get ready... 1, 2, 3...Wince!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 03:46:58	@InfiniteKnot But overall, I'm groovy with my bean. It could be A LOT worse. I have a bean that's very logical. My #Aspie strength. Logic.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 03:41:52	@InfiniteKnot We're so sensitive to everything. A single blade of grass! But we will have a lot more physical and mental stuff.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 03:38:59	@InfiniteKnot Out of all the Neurological things it's the Asperger's hands down for comorbidities. For everyone who has it, on the Spectrum.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 03:36:03	@InfiniteKnot That's when my bean can become part of me. That's when people freak out, think I'm totally insane and run away. That hurts.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 03:33:44	@InfiniteKnot Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm more than my bean. My bean just gets cranky, or has a tantrum sometimes.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 03:31:21	@InfiniteKnot Truism. Look at all of my comorbidities too! Just kidding. But I am pretty complicated in the bean.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 03:17:57	Now that I feel I can work, I'm talking to people on Twitter and generally goofing off. Bad Girl.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 03:10:30	@JohnGilstrap Maybe I'm Lee reincarnated. Wouldn't surprise me based upon her life. She was pretty wild and other things.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 03:05:07	@JohnGilstrap It's a little scary when you take a shot, then see it eerily close to a massive photographer--that you've NEVER seen before.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 03:02:01	@JohnGilstrap Thanks again. I could go on about Lee Miller forever. We shoot the same things. Not to boast? Some of my work kinda look...
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 02:56:22	@Calichusetts274 Okay. I must have you mixed up with someone else. I think I was talking to them about epilepsy.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 02:54:05	@insideoutauthor Sorry. Limited characters!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 02:50:42	@JohnGilstrap Thanks. Story is true about Miller and Nast if you don't know. He saved her. Almost hit by car. He said, A Model! On the spot!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 02:39:54	@InfiniteKnot So logically, it would make sense that I'm already Neurologically sensitive to the fan hitting the shit.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 02:36:18	@InfiniteKnot This also doesn't surprise me too much. Don't know if you recall but developed epilepsy syndrome-catamenial.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 02:34:27	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. The Plan is with the hysterectomy. Not full. Keeping ovaries so I have my own hormones. Don't want HRT!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 02:31:15	@JohnGilstrap Thank you for the Follow, as well!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 02:29:41	@JohnGilstrap @insideoutauthor And, "Being in the right place, at the right time." My Photog. Idol is Lee Miller. Swoop me up Conde Nast!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 02:22:50	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Like. But it's definitely true!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 02:13:00	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. A lot of things have changed so you're now my #Migraine best friend. Which is great! Except for the Migraine part.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 01:35:06	Buckets of tea+Propranolol blunted things a bit. Wow. Because I've got proofing, documents to work on, research...slow down, PA! #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 01:16:08	@RachelRoams Interesting. I never think of past photographs when I shoot. EVERYTHING is new! However, yours are full sensory experiences.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 00:30:14	More "joy" of #peri -menopause Sweating in the night. But first things first! What I wear! My red! Bleeding on the collars of my clothes! NO!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-25 00:21:53	I'm quite young to be #peri -menopausal but it can happen! Now, time to become some sort of "Inverse Stripper" with my T-shirt. On, off, on..
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 23:53:46	I should really use my Mac I've never used because I don't want it and want to trade up for better use and #writing better not like here.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 23:42:04	@Calichusetts274 Hey, Park. If I can call you that LOL! You said you were working on a cartoon about our discussion right? Is it done?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 23:31:46	@InfiniteKnot I might have sent a ping to slowly restart the server. MORE TEA!!! #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 23:20:29	I will be so happy, when there will be more in my life than being sick. All.The.Time. And, always talking about it. I want to LIVE a life.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 23:09:19	@InfiniteKnot One other thing. Now that it's this crazy, let's see what the Propranolol is doing. Okay! Managed to make my tea! #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 22:55:34	@InfiniteKnot It's not even the pain. That doesn't get in the way. You're exhausted. But a tiny thing is keeping you away from needed sleep!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 22:51:45	@InfiniteKnot Don't know if you ever get in this phase. You feel like you could pass out to sleep but one little thing is in the way.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 22:46:34	@InfiniteKnot WHOA. I am in THE PIT my friend. LOL! Confirmed catamenial #Migraines now! Try caffeine for vasoconstriction but can't move!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 22:14:17	Who can count the number of Social Media Apps out there?! Do people no longer sit and talk to each other? A call for distance? #cranky #true
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 22:01:36	Enough time now for proof! Catamenial #Migraines Propranolol slowly working for other things. Please hurry hysterectomy.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 11:16:56	"...Jet Boy Jet Girl... I'm gonna take you round the world... I'm gonna make you... #awesome Poor kid. All those hormones, his best friend.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 11:07:24	Based upon my last Tweet, I now COMMAND you all to listen to "Jet Boy, Jet Girl" by Elton Motello. Unless you already know it. #sex #NSFW
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 10:56:52	Car advert running a music clip from a song. Added their lyrics. The song is "Jet Boy, Jet Girl." I wonder how many people know that. #sex
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 10:47:00	Thanks for the Like @Goldrushcomic
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 10:26:20	#Marvel is releasing all of these new and revamped "for today" #comics Anyone care to weigh in on plots, drawing, "future" worth? I say nil!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 10:15:13	I think I'm going to start a Novella based upon sheer and severe Dehydration. Gulp, gulp, gulp...
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 09:53:17	@RachelRoams Thanks. I've done it in different ways, so I know I don't need to see it. How about sabotaging?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 09:49:06	Sitting in my building laundry room WAY before my load is done in the washer. That way, nobody will steal my WET clothes AGAIN. Truism.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 09:43:53	@RachelRoams Bathroom is too easy and overrated. Everyone knows how to do that!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 09:26:39	@RachelRoams I am crazy and I'm not. You might be able to use both me and those qualities--or not. *smirks*
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-24 09:22:11	@RachelRoams Thanks for the Like again Rachel. I wasn't joking about perhaps helping you with what you do. Need to do some research though.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-23 07:01:22	Thanks for the Like @AmberlyLucio
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-23 05:58:24	Spreading the love to my brother's and sister's! #worldgothday
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-23 03:42:46	@RachelRoams Thanks for the Like! I'm actually part Lemur too. Just so you know.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-23 01:24:13	@toymachine Hi! No doubt big request from everyone! Could I please get a copy of Thrasher signed by the Team? More rad, extra copy of KOTR!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-23 01:11:29	@RachelRoams Also, if you're looking for people to join you, work with you, I could fit the bill in all areas? DM me if you'd like! Cheers.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-23 01:06:12	@RachelRoams Well! Hello Rachel! In she busts through the door (to hopefully NOT explore me, but like me?) Okay both.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-22 06:27:49	Thanks for the RT @designopinion
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-22 06:24:14	Holiday Weekend. Annual Fireworks. Shot them for years. Thinking about doing them in B&W this year. Might be interesting. #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-22 06:15:46	I don't think the Bed/Office/Closet/Pharmacy© has been this out of control EVER. Well, probably. But it's looking pretty insane right now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-22 05:58:54	Thanks for the Like @lucastpate I'm laughing so hard now! Nobody I know on Twitter spoke up to say if I'm pretty or not. Mystery!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-22 05:04:54	My Mom was so pretty too. Perfect for Portraiture in #photography One of my loves! I can see my looks in her... Wait! Not saying I'm pretty!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-22 04:57:00	It took me a bit to get used to this picture of my Mom but it wasn't the #PTSD so much. I'm a photographer so it was art. The #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-22 04:53:02	Here smile? My Mom isn't smiling at all in the photo. It's simple a trick. Her lipstick applied a tiny bit upward at the corners. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-22 04:47:48	Forget it. Alone, hunched over a bit. Her face! Eyes in people's direction but more like she's seeing the Sahara over their heads! #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-22 04:39:23	I have this photo of my Mom at a party before I was born. Haunting. Mental Health issues but in denial. "In the world but not of it?" #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-22 04:21:40	Going through box of old photos. It shook hands with a bomb. Books for some I like. Chronological order for life. But maybe NOT today. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-22 01:36:32	Irony: something made of, or feels like iron. Haha.Going to do laundry yesterday, all organised. Then received notice water off in building
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 23:42:20	@ukschizophrenic Thanks for the Like, babe. XX
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 21:31:15	@ukschizophrenic I can see that. Although for me it would be the Asperger's sensory overload. I still have a problem with regular crowds!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 21:27:22	I'm up too early. Bye.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 21:25:21	@mama_kass I know! All men can bend down and worship women's sex organs (no, not for THAT!) but because they would fold at the pain we know!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 04:36:05	@Megami_Saga You are very welcome.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 03:07:46	@Zinquefty That was just a joke. I was going to put in getting a day off somewhere but how to phrase as I don't work anymore.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 02:26:18	@Zinquefty Indeed. Or, count up each year she ages and do something different than the year before etc.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 02:23:20	@Zinquefty Thank you for your wealth of knowledge as always. We will celebrate celebrate it for us and both our living spheres. Good?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 02:18:51	@Zinquefty Wot? Did someone lie to me?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 02:16:56	And just why DO we celebrate that old hag of a Queen of England every year with a long weekend? Why not celebrate ME with a long weekend?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 02:08:48	Oh, crap. I need to buy, photocopy and mail things while out but CLOSED. We're celebrating some old hag who once was a Queen of England.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 01:49:12	Wow. Serious mistake when I bought a soft-cover #comic edition and a #Graphic Novel. Like $15? Cash Dude luvin' my red hair? Lost attention?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 01:24:19	Take a rest from what I'm doing now. Tea, of course! Might help and get me sorted in, out. *sighs again*
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 01:21:42	Forget work! But moving into super-sick phase. Spring. So slow to come! Great outside. Want to go for walk! But dangerous. No falls. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 01:05:26	@mama_kass There's barely any room, at some point no room, then it'll just explode! So let's take care of things now! RIP!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 01:02:46	@mama_kass I also found out I have the beginning stages of endometriosis! That certainly explains why things have gotten much worse?!?!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 00:59:49	@mama_kass My rationale was what if they come back. Then we have to start this whole thing WHOLE thing all over again. *waiving finger*
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-21 00:56:25	@mama_kass Thanks for that. I looked at EVERY option when I decided I wanted this. There are other things like this too!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-20 06:14:41	@VICE @VICELAND_ca Watching #KingOfTheRoad Gnarly. Totally.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-20 01:35:53	@Zinquefty I can do some laundry but with an extra person, a lot more. So I have my list of O.o and see what gets done. Including 0.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-20 01:31:37	@Zinquefty BIG problem. I'm going to buy millions more!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-20 01:30:44	@Zinquefty Shred documents, go through books, general tidy? Not enough room for Graphic Novels and Manga even with Bankers Box.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-20 01:28:25	@Zinquefty Okay. Laundry, shopping, stuff in storage, organization, maybe some clean up. More? I can try and do little and personal.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-20 01:25:53	@Zinquefty Twitter is not putting up my Tweets.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-20 00:30:12	@VICE Well, you do burn approximately 20 calories when you have an orgasm.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-20 00:19:54	Friend coming to help me with heavy labour is not bringing his heavy labour ass over. What to do? Heavy labour anyway? Get hurt anyway?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-19 23:22:37	@middlemediazzz @RichieMc_ @VICELAND_ca / Thank you for this shout out too. Again, much appreciated.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-19 23:11:23	@oldmediazzz @RichieMc_ @VICELAND_ca / Thanks so much for the RT.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-19 22:32:12	@VICELAND_ca Happy to help out with any projects you've got going on. Even if it's sweeping the trash but still copyediting the paper in it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-19 22:26:09	@RichieMc_ @VICELAND_ca Or at least along those lines? I'm half a filmmaker? Never made one but worked with one.*laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-19 22:23:43	@RichieMc_ @VICELAND_ca The Foreign would be to one production that would be juried to Film Festivals. Then Award Notifications would come.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-19 22:20:48	@RichieMc_ @VICELAND_ca Yes! Many Awards! Specifically Canadian is the Genie. Others of smaller type. Then there are Foreign Awards.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-19 22:16:42	Overjoyed @VICE and @VICELAND_ca rose up to where they are. Same (or better?) entertainment than before on TV etc. platforms. Watching now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-19 22:04:07	@PanicPandaCat Thanks hon. Without people like you here to pick me up and dust me off it would be a lot harder! x
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-17 01:59:34	@PanicPandaCat So hang on until then! But I can't die right? Then you'd have no one to save? Or was it something like that?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-17 01:57:07	@PanicPandaCat SO much to say after today's appointment! Date will be sometime in September. GYN sweet. Said she'd take good care of me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-17 01:54:34	@PanicPandaCat GYN even laughed when I said I was on Propranolol so make a note of that. I'd like to wake up. It slows your heart.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-17 01:52:37	@PanicPandaCat Because of anaesthesia and post-op pain meds. I am choosing Morphine over Demerol. Seems to work better.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-17 01:50:08	@PanicPandaCat My pain meds can help a bit but I can't take more than 2x/wk because of the Propranolol. Rebound pain. Gone for surgery?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 20:52:43	@PanicPandaCat Thank you! And back at ya!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 20:51:46	@PanicPandaCat Ironically I feel better today? But again things have been getting worse and worse. #Fibroids don't pull this shit! And more.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 20:48:55	@PanicPandaCat This is all to do with my Fibroids getting worse over time. I'm getting a hysterectomy but keeping ovaries for own hormones.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 04:43:12	@PanicPandaCat Thanks so much for your well wishes and good vibes. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 04:42:13	@PanicPandaCat Hey! Good to hear from you sweetie! I have been in bed basically incapable of doing crap! Just fuming at laundry! No clothes!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 03:58:42	No more laundry. No shopping. Rest between current loads. GYN tomorrow. Something wrong after biopsies? Severe pain since. Like after done.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 03:47:17	@Zinquefty I'm the sort of person who ALWAYS prefers to be overdressed, not underdressed, whatever the occasion. #fashioninsta
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 03:43:06	@Zinquefty No doubt. At my last job I wore jeans and whatever. Unless I had to make some kind of presentation.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 03:09:49	@Zinquefty Yes. Just to go to the shops. But plaid. Not hospital.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 03:07:57	Nobody seems to care about me walking around in pyjamas in my building--or my neighborhood. Clearly I don't care. Mental? Pfft. Yes. I am.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 03:02:43	Success! Two loads of laundry dragged down to lobby. No pockets as in hospital pyjamas. Put change in shoe. I do this all the time. PJs too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 01:55:35	@GothicDressCode Oh! So sorry to hear that. Technology sucks. You're welcome for asking. I'll keep a look out when all is fixed. Take care.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-16 00:55:16	@GothicDressCode What happened to your Website? There's nothing there. Unless I missed a Tweet about it. It's still on your Profile though.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-15 23:33:07	I PROMISE I'm going to clean up things around my apartment today! Even if I get a head injury because I'm so blind, dizzy and nauseous!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-15 23:28:36	@beyondxdarkness Thanks! I'm going to come visit you. Just think of all the fun we'll fun have!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-15 04:40:05	@beyondxdarkness !
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-15 04:28:17	@mama_kass Although, since this so sucky, fucking unreal bad? We're now appreciating everything as Sistahs! Lord, Lord, Lord...
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-15 04:24:20	@mama_kass Oh, we are Sistahs in Solidarity in SO many GOOD ways, but this is a BAD way! Although, maybe it's good to appreciate the bad.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-14 09:29:08	@n8wachT Yep. The good Owl'dies never go away, hon!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-14 08:49:36	@n8wachT Thanks for the Likey.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-14 08:48:50	@mama_kass Thanks for the Like, and I'll Like it too because we're Sistahs! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-14 08:36:23	@n8wachT That one takes me way back in time!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-12 02:25:10	@Zinquefty LOL! The one bedrooms are nicer. Smaller bedrooms but overall living space big. Kitchen smaller? L shape of mine?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-12 02:20:23	@Zinquefty Hella move just down hall but guys who took me here were awesome. Still have their card.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-12 02:18:15	@Zinquefty Actually just found out from neighbour. On other side one bedroom has become vacant. I'm on list so maybe get it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-12 02:03:24	@Zinquefty *no
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-12 02:03:04	@Zinquefty Light gets in here on matter what and I have to wear sunglasses almost 24/7 anyway.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-12 01:21:51	Holy Scalpel and Saint Pushpin! Banish the awful Sun for the sake of my eyes! Should I go blind from it, I declare ALL will be made quinoa!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 22:18:23	@mama_kass Yeah, Baby! You got it!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 22:15:21	@patientanon Thanks for the Like.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 04:35:51	@isseynfarran I was actually thinking Pollock before I clicked. However, there are many other ways a ball can nail your face, right?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 04:27:04	@beyondxdarkness Thanks for Liking both! Twitter MADE me send two as none of my Tweets were getting through!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 01:38:31	@beyondxdarkness People come and go, you lose contact but if you were friends you keep talking. People disappear, leave you. Things change.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 00:53:37	@beyondxdarkness Ah! You got this! Thanks. Just didn't want you to feel like I completely abandoned you. Twitter is just like real life.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 00:50:02	@mama_kass Thanks for the Like. Although only for the Tweet? Ain't nothing likeable about the rest of this! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 00:50:02	@mama_kass Also, don't be sorry about my partial type of hysterectomy. I've been begging for it for a long time! So happy now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 00:50:02	@mama_kass And, I can totally see the C-Sect angle. No other option!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 00:12:06	Here we go again. Twitter malfunctioning. I might not see Tweets from you and vice versa. If you can see this! Goodbye until a fix. Bed.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 00:03:11	@beyondxdarkness Hi hon. Sorry I haven't been in contact for so long. ‍ ‍ Blogging about being sick, being sick.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 00:03:11	@beyondxdarkness I'm sorry I haven't been around lately. I haven't forgotten about you. Blogging about being sick. I hate it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-11 00:03:11	Test Tweet.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 23:56:15	Tweet
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 08:06:42	@mama_kass It's so much easier to do now. I watched one filmed in an Anatomy and Physiology Class. Laparoscopy. Removed vaginally.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 08:01:49	@mama_kass But for women who have bad problems, don't want any kids, any more kids, hysterectomy options are the first given normally.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 07:58:47	@mama_kass And trying to pass a baby through that? Kids aren't fish! Even in regular birth with no problems, they don't swim out of you!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 07:55:39	@mama_kass That's pretty big. I have four and maybe 2cm each? Maybe we sort of equal each other out with the math?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 07:49:12	@mama_kass I say we give 'em this. Fuck you #Fibroids
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 07:46:34	@mama_kass Thanks too. And sorry for you as well. Holy!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 07:45:24	@mama_kass Hey!!! Good to see you!!! Normally #Fibroids don't cause too much trouble but whoa. I'm getting a hysterectomy. Not full.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 07:40:48	I'm DYING for chocolate!!! Asked neighbour to get me some as she was going to store anyway. That's going to be my dinner.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 07:34:52	Still can't get buddy to come help me at my place. Been so sick! It's okay. I'm stuck in bed ovulating now. It hurts to blink. #Fibroids
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 03:25:06	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Like. My head is just a big party Neurologically and Psychologically. Look at all my diagnoses/Comorbidities!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 03:15:38	@InfiniteKnot Huge list why I need it done. #Fibroids but things happening that should never occur. The Neuro stuff is paramount.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 03:12:22	@InfiniteKnot The same drug is used for it. I've already noticed a bit of a pattern with #migraine activity with my cycle.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 03:09:37	@InfiniteKnot Put on best med for it and after so long it went away. But it could still come back. You can also get catamenial #migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-10 03:07:15	@InfiniteKnot My situation is different re: developing an epilepsy syndrome that was catastrophically catamenial! LOL! Not really funny.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-09 07:31:08	@Zinquefty One more thing. Have to tell you about "my" feelings of being on "Heroin." This based upon people I've talked to. Fascinating.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-09 07:17:18	@Zinquefty In constant contact with Specialist Neuro. Can see her anytime before follow up. They know Catamenial. Need to tell when surgery.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-09 07:12:21	@Zinquefty Just been on Propranolol for month and half? Don't know if it will work for continual #Migraines or if that's even the problem.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-09 07:05:53	Bye... *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-09 06:59:29	I feel totally gone which was an initial side effect. Best side effect EVER from a new med! And no never done Heroin but talked to people.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-09 06:55:34	Pain I'm feeling is actually severe cramping, bloating and nausea. Gravol needed! Also Valium to relax! Just side effect of new Propranolol.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-09 06:50:24	Head not too bad but Catamenial Time! Ovulation. Wonder if #Migraine problems will abate after hysterectomy (not full) from #Fibroids
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-09 06:43:51	Time to dope myself up. Morphine or Heroin this time? Haven't had to do this in a while with Propranolol. Gravol, Valium. Allowed to take.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-09 06:31:01	@sashasharovk9k Thanks for the information.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-08 08:09:39	@Zinquefty That's cool. I don't know much either and really don't like it. However, there is some classic stuff you can't argue with.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-08 08:03:56	@livehealingly @retweetablog @davebrum @GH4_Recruitment @unsuicide @heartlessmnp / Thank you. The same to you and all others.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-08 08:01:13	@Zinquefty I'm watching "Dirty Dancing" on TV right now. O_o ROTFLMAO
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-08 07:57:41	@Zinquefty Probably Garlic, Onion, Paprika, Salt, Pepper, Chile (other than Cayenne) uhhh... basically it?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-08 07:54:15	@Zinquefty Tilapia fillets are maybe half of Catfish. Lots of coating or a Professional Kitchen! Cajun largely Cayenne in a mix.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-08 07:45:54	@Zinquefty I don't like that sort of thing but great fish for lemon. Versatile but careful! Very soft. Fillets can fall apart.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-08 07:29:10	@Zinquefty Hehehe. I LOVE Cajun Catfish. You should try some Tilapia. Lovely white fish. Goes well with lemon if you like or anything.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-08 07:25:05	@Zinquefty Feed.Me. Need.Food.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-08 07:21:57	@Zinquefty SPAZ O.o How did the fish turn out? I know I owe you a what's up email too. Eyes very bad. You can send to me first though.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-07 06:08:53	It's DEFINITELY hit! Peri-menopause! Too young for Menopause? Hot/Cold/Hot/Cold...I'm putting clothes on, off every second! Sleep=Drenched.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-07 03:10:14	@AlIySheedy Also where is the blue mark to show this is an official site of who or what the Account promotes? Hopefully if real, revived?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-07 03:07:09	@AlIySheedy Think this Account seriously bogus. Like all others out there. Or this has been abandoned. Date of Posts?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-07 02:56:35	Not in the mood for Twitter now. Back to TEA! Ciao! Not to be confused with Tea Chow.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-07 02:43:23	Well a Follow of @AlIySheedy it is then. Even though my last Tweets might never see her eyes. And vice versa. Which is odd. Right place.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-07 02:32:59	@allysheedy Let's see if we can get this right as it went to a masked or incorrect Account. Want to make you giggle Ally!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-07 02:27:20	I've also had a lifelong lust for @AllySheedy You don't? See "High Art." I wonder if Ally likes women as Lucy does. I'm cute. Her type.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-07 01:42:22	Back to teen years. "The Breakfast Club" on TV. Saw Simple Minds Live. Front Row! Band and especially Kerr LOATHED making theme song.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-05 03:36:54	Thanks for the Like @MigraineRF
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-05 03:01:35	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Like.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-05 02:25:03	@InfiniteKnot Finally after much research, your Prodrome can actually be anything for your #Migraine and could happen weeks before!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-05 02:22:36	@InfiniteKnot Then things got really funky, because what the hell WAS my Prodrome? It was like my Prodrome WAS my #Migraine
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-05 02:18:55	@InfiniteKnot We just wrote it off to weather. But that didn't make sense because weather wouldn't change. So #Migraine Bang anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-05 02:16:42	@InfiniteKnot I thought I was right! And true, SO many causes. When I got ones hither and yon, nobody could figure the prodrome.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-03 08:20:32	Goodbye screen. Yeah, right. This boredom is as painful as the fucking #Migraine Someone from #MI -16 put out a MASSIVE Contract on me?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-03 08:12:48	What am I doing looking at this screen! My #Migraine From Hell! I'm bored, can't concentrate, books are swirly, twirly letters, can't eat.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-03 08:05:39	Went to give neighbour a little gift. Say thanks for helping me when sick and in general. She's nosey! But above is true. She was shocked.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-03 06:53:54	Only thing to handle today was see my Therapist. Too sick so phone session. Done. Back to bed. This #Migraine in relentlessly wretched.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-03 03:44:29	CRAZY #Migraine today. Can only use pain pills x2/week with Propranolol (rebound headaches.) Need ibuprofen today though.
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-03 02:58:11	@InfiniteKnot and Others: have you ever had #Migraines after a lot of physical work and even logical processing like packing things to move?
16253011	patientanon	2016-05-01 06:27:06	Friend sick. Said I should try and make some Jewish Penicillin (i.e. Matzoh Ball Soup.) Haven't had it? Easy with the Matzoh. Constipation!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 10:25:42	@LePetiteNYC There aren't any "Rules" for Twitter. All you have to do is sign up and read people's Tweets to see that! Rest well, love. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 10:21:33	@Ascii211 Just saw you here. Been ages! How are you? Now, where were we with my picture...? *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 09:51:07	I Hate Yuppies! https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2016/04/29/i-h ate-yuppies …
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 08:12:15	@Zinquefty Also wonderful weather. I could probably ask my friend here to be a wee tour guide. He's retired. Show you my everythings here.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 08:08:44	@Zinquefty Next time you come down if it's to where I live. We could bus it down. Although it would do more justice with a car.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 08:04:59	If you want to try and get to know people, you have to try and put yourself out in their direction somehow. Maybe hard but it could pay off.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 08:02:23	We went for a smoke with her friend, had a nice talk. Exchanging emails can still mean nothing-I said in friendship-she's straight but hey.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 07:58:15	As expected, knew I was hitting on her but it was a conversation where we both embarrassed ourselves. She loved gesture, exchanged emails.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 07:36:29	@Zinquefty Yes. Lived roughly 10 years here before moving to where I am now. I miss it SO much! Not far by bus but not same as living here.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 07:24:22	Now I have to go talk to her. I think she's freaked I'm trying to pick her up. I wish I was wearing cooler clothes... *sighs* LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 07:21:40	UPDATE! I know the bartender. My old neighborhood. Girl hasn't decided, doesn't know what to do about it, how she feels. If I was a guy...?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 07:19:09	I could have the luckiest new hair in the world. I'm not getting to get this girl.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 07:11:00	Christ! My new hair should be lucky! My Stylist is a Goddess! Everyone is liking my hair! A woman in her 60's! Not kidding!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 07:05:33	Never tried this one before! Uber-cute girl across room. Told bartender I'd buy her drink. Other girl with her so...? LOL. Lucky new hair?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 06:15:52	Thanks for the Like @Toxic__Trace
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 06:13:50	Although, my Stylist told me I put my shirt on backwards. #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 06:06:45	Saw friend for lunch and hang out time. Don't see each other often. Tired, but been a good day. And it's not even over yet. Hmmm.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 06:03:45	Now sitting in club listening to a jazz band and keeping my fingers on the table (roughly) in time with the drummer's sticks on snare.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-30 06:00:01	Just finished getting my #Anime and #Goth hair redone. Feels good to be cut all spiky and firey red again!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-29 23:52:51	@OfficialPBSNT @isseynfarran We have no Nasidagang here!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-29 23:46:13	@OfficialPBSNT @isseynfarran Oh, Issey! This made me laugh so hard. You're crazy! I don't think I could it! So what if I'm a girl but...?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-28 07:06:32	Talking to person about how my Blog needs a total overhaul. I haven't looked at the whole thing in ages. I just about puked when I did now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-28 04:51:54	Busy studying Sociology. I'm watching "The Price Is Right" on television.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-28 03:19:24	Found great article to read about them. A bit older but recent enough for good selections. And I know your sale @fitbit May not work for me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-28 03:13:44	Looking at a @fitbit Watch and the competition's offers. I know what I need. UNLESS wearing it will be an issue with my #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-28 03:02:31	Okay. Seriously. Seriously! I have limited energy but I'm getting rather pissed off I can't do shit! Another appt today done! More tea.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-28 01:50:40	@oneanna65 Thanks for Liking my last Blog Post. That is if it was you! Same name? *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-28 01:43:29	@Calichusetts274 Good and bad, I'm a cat with a million lives. Maybe more?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-28 01:42:10	@Calichusetts274 It's different for everyone. I know about Tourette's of course but not so much about other diagnoses. So I'm curious too!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-28 01:38:00	@Calichusetts274 Okay. Maybe you could email me if you feel comfortable? Easier to talk about things in detail.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-28 01:33:17	@Zinquefty It's too damn short here and I want to check in on you too apart from that last! Here's some Sake.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-28 01:31:08	@Zinquefty Hi hon, thanks for asking. Mostly (all?) Medical Hell. You've probably seen stuff on Twitter? We should email.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-27 05:28:44	@bellanatale2004 HAHAHA! Well, I hope your eyeballs are feeling better in the time it's taken me to reply! Thanks for the luv, luv. X
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-27 05:24:45	@Calichusetts274 Is there anything that affects you with lunar changes or any other time frames? I'll keep my eye on the moon for me!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-27 05:20:46	@Calichusetts274 But not sure if anyone is as fast AND continuous as me? 24-48hrs. Usually more 48hrs. Tornado. See if the house is gone
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-27 05:16:23	@Calichusetts274 They thought they were out of their minds but I told them it was okay. What you're experiencing is real.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-27 05:14:28	@Calichusetts274 Doctor's don't have much of a clue about it but they're catching up. So many people on my Blog were, thank you, you too?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-27 05:11:18	@Calichusetts274 Circadian is 24hrs. An Ultradian Cycle runs within the Circadian! I'm an Ultradian Cycler with my Bipolar. And a FAST one!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-27 05:07:44	@Calichusetts274 At least that's my theory. We on the Spectrum can be so sensitive to everything. A speck of sand on a rock! Seriously!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-27 05:04:43	@Calichusetts274 Circadian nails SO many people with Asperger's and on the Spectrum when we change the time twice a year. We can go nuts.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-27 05:01:47	@Calichusetts274 However, if I dig deeper and grow/shrink time, things do change. My Circadian Rhythms and Ultradian ones too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-27 04:58:37	@Calichusetts274 I don't notice anything unless I'm not paying attention. Although I do love Astronomy so I love viewing its phases!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-27 04:54:27	@Calichusetts274 I don't think your question is out of line at all. I have a Blogger friend I've known for years and he gets migraines then.

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-26 23:46:06	@03alwi Thanks for Liking my last Blog Post. That is if it was you! Two matching names?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-26 23:38:17	@Calichusetts274 OMG! I'm sorry hun! I didn't get a proper Twitter Notification about this! Of course you can! Anything!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-26 23:34:10	Thanks for the RT @TheSEOTools
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-25 22:44:08	Time to make Doctor's Notes but the BedOfficeClosetPharmacy© has gotten pretty out of control. I just thought some tissues were paper.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-25 22:32:17	Four appointments this week, starting today. *dies* But Friday will be REALLY GOOD. Cut and dye! Bleach=Time but my fire back! Bye roots!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-25 22:26:08	Thank god it's cloudy today. It's been sunny for days! I hereby banish the Sun! #Migraines
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-25 22:18:46	Good morning, day, evening, night everyone. Time for tea! Well, I need some tea.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-25 05:05:20	@Adamhorner_ Immediate Follow! I could eat Avocado almost daily? But Artichokes daily. No question.

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-24 01:53:20	For clarity, I didn't TAKE heroin. I just felt like I did as a side effect of starting my Propranolol. But it was the best side effect EVER!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-24 01:49:00	Pharmacokinetics. Know med I'm on that tripped me out on heroin starting Propranolol. Seroquel, enzymes albumin, time. Less doped. Wait.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-24 01:24:23	@Mayra5218 You're very pretty too. Whoop! Here I go using Twitter as a Dating Service again! I'm female by the way. Just so you know.

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-23 22:29:07	@Calichusetts274 I have an Anonymous Blog. Twitter connected. Although I do make friends who have varying degrees of my information.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-22 01:31:46	I'll get back to folks later. Period soon? #Migraines since Monday. That could mean catamenial territory. . PARTIAL HYSTERECTOMY!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-22 01:26:59	How do you women have children?! GYN took biopsies of #Fibroids and more. But FINALLY! Laparascopic partial hysterectomy!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 05:10:22	That last Tweet was pretty funky. Medical information and #photography Well, they say "Medicine is an Art." Indeed. You can trust me there.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 05:05:35	Doctors! Have to explain Neurology to an OB/GYN tomorrow. Plus transvag/pelvic US, biopsy...only good thing is #photography shop after!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 04:05:45	@duffleslive Thank you for the Like and RT! After all, I know you're so busy!

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 03:25:32	@DysthymicDad Thanks. Couldn't resist.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 03:17:31	@DysthymicDad Oops. Must have tripped. Explains why I'm feeling pretty awful today...
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 03:11:53	@DysthymicDad Bwah-hah... Well, we got everything covered and now I think you!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 03:08:16	@Calichusetts274 Also, I can be tough but you big boys might crush a small woman like me. Not sexist, just size and strength for me!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 03:05:45	@Calichusetts274 Well, we can commiserate with each other about our writing woes. I'll watch you play sports. I have a cane.

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 02:43:30	@duffleslive Hello, Lady Duffles. Thank you for the Follow.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 02:39:36	@InfiniteKnot Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that! Because my stupid cocktail is growing, regular LFTs? But for now, I'm fine. Thanks, hon. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 02:37:02	@Calichusetts274 I need to get back to my writing but in a more serious way. For that I need a new computer. So smaller things and chores!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 02:34:28	@Calichusetts274 I mean that. You're great. A real inspiration to the #Epilepsy Community.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-20 02:31:43	@Calichusetts274 Yes, I read your Profile and some Tweets so I know you're keen on sports! And I'm really keen on your attitude.

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-18 07:50:10	@Calichusetts274 Or at least pursuing them on a regular basis? I get stuck in bed for so long times ill. It's frustrating!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-18 07:48:10	@Calichusetts274 That can definitely help as well. I do have them but unfortunately because of my other health issues I can lose them.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-18 03:55:28	...the Pharmacy called...?... what time is...
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-18 00:15:32	Propranolol=Sleepy? Maybe nap. Look into things deeper later. Issues with other meds?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 21:48:10	@n8wachT That is really cool.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 08:58:05	Pretty early for meds but I just want to go to sleep.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 06:19:41	Kimchi Noodles for dinner! Good and HOT! All fluid in my head now drained via my sinuses HOT! The only way to have it! Others would explode.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 06:11:38	@MolecularBliss Thanks for the RT too!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 03:27:39	Thanks for the Like @MolecularBliss
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 03:20:20	@Calichusetts274 Definitely. You've got your meds, nobody can predict or control Neurology but you can predict and control your attitude.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 02:20:49	Feet SO dry. Goopy Socks! Lotion ALL over feet. Squirt copious amounts of Lotion into PURE NYLON socks (NO FLUFF!) Heat. Put on trainers.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 01:56:09	@Zinquefty Oooh! Love it! I agree! Books will cover. Like I said, my Graphic Novels and Manga need to be boxed. Find me a shelf! No space!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 01:43:17	@Zinquefty I have some organisational stuff to do too. Books in boxes, stuff in trash. Maybe that. Day not over. Just so tired. But eating!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 01:34:47	@Zinquefty I totally agree with that! And I totally know the feeling!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 01:27:30	@Zinquefty Not over yet. Tests and further discussion with one of them next week.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 01:24:50	@Zinquefty I didn't expect to see TWO Specialists in March while waiting for the referrals so everything has been killing me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 01:22:08	@Zinquefty Oh, been up for a while. I'm still dealing with the meds, med changes, why I need them, side effects, virus.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 01:15:29	OMG. Can't coordinate getting friend here to help with stuff. Been in bed for how long? LOL! Maybe try dizzy, fall down laundry?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-17 01:07:01	@Calichusetts274 That's true but sometimes REALLY hard! Emotions immediately after too. Mine could get really messy post-"ick"tal©
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-16 08:49:09	@Zinquefty The awesome ol' fashioned way. You do it in your bathroom. I've tested any cracks for necessary dark work. Towel placement.

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-16 04:56:19	@InfiniteKnot Hey. We were talking about my motivations not to drink. This is the HUGEST. Liver enzyme rises when I do. That can't happen.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-16 04:25:53	My mobile went all screwy. Since then, I haven't bothered to reinstall WordPress. Then I've been so damn sick! Why no Posts. Someday? #lazy
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-16 03:09:07	@Calichusetts274 Oh, and you're welcome for the hugs. A bit sleepy so I missed that part.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-16 03:07:11	@SoberNCleanLife It is VERY true new relationships can affect your sobriety. Been there!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-16 03:03:18	@Calichusetts274 Thanks!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-16 03:02:29	@Calichusetts274 Thanks for the Like.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 03:14:28	@InfiniteKnot I've gone to #AA Meetings and when I've left I felt I was on pure Oxygen. Others, just a bit happy. Calm. It does work.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 03:10:07	@InfiniteKnot Some of are nutters, their friends crazier. Others were born to be stand up comics. We tell our stories, can nod, laugh.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 03:06:56	@InfiniteKnot It's not so much a question of "like." Again, it's just my current situation. I've had so much fun at #AA Meetings. Yes, fun.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 03:01:41	@InfiniteKnot After I joined #AA I immediately relapsed and lost all of that sobriety. Irony is without a sense of humor. Unreal.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 02:57:33	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. I haven't been this sober before I joined #AA I was almost three months before I started but Dr. Therapist said go.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 02:53:08	@InfiniteKnot That's VERY frustrating.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 02:52:30	@InfiniteKnot Also, I have been trying to find a Sponsor for ages. Has to be a rapport. But I haven't even found a person to start with yet!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 02:47:32	@InfiniteKnot When I can get myself out of bed on decent basis I really should go to my Home Group. Probably think I lost my mind!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 02:41:46	@InfiniteKnot The question about doing it alone was just a musing about how #AA states it is very rare. I believe that. So just a thought.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 02:39:21	@InfiniteKnot A lot of people might or probably need that. I'm not saying I'll never go back. This is just my current situation.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 02:37:23	@InfiniteKnot Not that I know of. Also, I think the purpose is to be physically around the people. Hugs, support physically in other ways.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 01:32:44	So, those are my plans for clean and healthy living, folks. Right now that plan includes some "New Medication Rest."
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 01:25:16	If I manage to stay sober with alcohol (lots of reasons!) smoking will be next. But not yet. Only two and half weeks since last relapse.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 01:18:49	I've lost the taste for alcohol. Even literally at times. There's just no appeal. Not going to #AA I read the book, but find it depressing.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 01:12:33	No drinking since end of February except two relapses in March. No #AA forever because sick forever! Am I a rare case that CAN quit alone?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 01:05:57	Brain feeling a bit less like a Pharmaceutical Waste Site. Back where I was before. Starting 40mg Propranolol. Body detoxing other? TOILET!

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-14 00:48:02	@Calichusetts274 Oh, sorry to hear that *hugs* The only thing we have to do is get up and keep fighting. Sometimes literally? Epilepsy joke.

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-12 03:52:31	Wow. After being #seizure free for almost three years I'd totally forgotten what it feels like to be post-"ick"tal©. Until now. #epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-12 00:47:05	I find my Complex partial #seizures so interesting. I'm unconscious but I've never hurt myself. I know the layout. But actions may be odd.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-12 00:40:17	Always unconscious with my Complex partial #seizures Tissue box balanced perfectly over junk on table. Couldn't do consciously! Hilarious!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-12 00:31:58	All of this was my biggest worry and it's come true. Woke up distinctly post-"ick"tal© this morning. Not side effects for so long!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-12 00:27:37	Fibristal now giving me seizures. SO pissed off! None over 2.5yrs! It plays with hormones for Fibroids but had catamenial seizures before.

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-09 01:15:54	Some would LOVE my perpetual, med change side effects: Extremely high Morphine levels and/or Heroin. Things to do! Feels great, but STOP!

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-09 00:35:11	@electroboyusa Thanks for the Like hon. I understand your answer. Sometimes we have a baseline, other times no clue! But glad you're okay.

16253011	patientanon	2016-04-07 03:08:49	Okay. Trying to get my head bloody un-morphined from med changes. I'm not doing so well. I wonder why. I have no control! *slaps head* Ouch.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-07 02:19:22	@electroboyusa While I'm here and just did the RT thought I'd check in. It's been AGES Sweetheart! How are you doing? x
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-07 02:05:19	@InfiniteKnot Preachin' to the Choir, Baby! It goes beyond ridiculous, where ridiculous goes beyond ridiculous! Oh, please help us all.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-07 02:01:04	@InfiniteKnot Yes, of course. This is embarrassing. I'm forgetting all of my Neurology!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-07 01:59:04	@InfiniteKnot OMG. Can I blame being stoned on my meds? Of COURSE the Trigem! Others too! Vasovagal for eyes. Thought that for me?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-07 01:54:52	@BautistaNY We're already destined to be together. Sarcasm FINALLY took Mercury out of Retrograde!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-07 01:50:44	@beyondxdarkness This hits me like a bullet straight through my heart, hun. Sorry I haven't been round to see you for a long while too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 06:18:22	I kind of forgot to eat today. I was a little preoccupied with the side effect coming back making me feel like I'm on Morphine. Maybe lots?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 06:13:09	Whoa. Went down to get my mail. I only had one leg that would work. My cane!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 05:54:16	Song is "Two Star." Album before change to dance. Mellow. Retrospective. Okay! Time to listen to you! @ebtg Also loved you live mid-90's!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 05:44:06	Watching cartoons. No sound. Think of song by @ebtg "I watch Saturday kids TV with the sound turned down I leave food on the eiderdown..."
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 05:13:53	@InfiniteKnot Well, that was a pain because my Sphyg started acting up but to guess? 115/70? That's excellent!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 04:42:25	@InfiniteKnot Let's check my BP now! I'm totally out of it but...
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 04:25:52	@InfiniteKnot Diastolic which is still important but is in between beats. Also monitor resting pulse. Drop logical. I'm 80bpm. Was 100-10bpm
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 04:18:46	@InfiniteKnot Thanks you for the Like here. My BP can't drop <100. Systolic/Top Number. Measures contraction of Arteries. Heart is slowing.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 04:01:23	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Like!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 04:00:28	@InfiniteKnot Interesting. Maybe some still happen that way, but what are the new types of theories? #Migraine
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 03:56:49	@chatobstewart Thanks for the Like!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-06 03:54:52	Just had phone appt with GP. Gave her wrong information so then had to email office. In email I wrote I ignored what she said to do. We=
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 08:47:59	I swear to hell. My life seems to be nothing but pills and pain these days. I've been reincarnated. I've figured that much out. But as whom?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 08:30:15	Actually made it outside today in long time. Carried by Accessible Transit Driver? Heh. Sunny. So bright! Head ow now. Barfy. Pills!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 08:13:19	@InfiniteKnot Finally, to everyone here, I am not a real Doctor. Dr. PA works on my Blog. Some delusional people think I should be a Doctor.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 08:05:21	@InfiniteKnot However, as really a Cardiac Drug, I have to be careful. Monitor BP, other things. Good thing Dr. PA has the tools for it!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 08:02:06	@InfiniteKnot My Propranolol is a beta blocker. Taken daily. Reduced heart rate to try to keep no vasodilation possible.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 07:59:19	@InfiniteKnot So that's my "theory." *laughing* No, I believe quite right. Why the limited use at onset with triptans? Their abortives.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 07:55:18	@InfiniteKnot Then your poor vessels are left with no protection. Completely dilated and ready for the blood to come rushing through!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 07:52:06	@InfiniteKnot So if you increase the pain meds you risk making it faster. So all of the sudden, the vasoconstriction goes out with a bang!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 07:47:48	@InfiniteKnot Here's where it gets ugly. Too much pressure with pain meds as vasoconstrictors could work too hard with pressure or too fast.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 07:44:13	@InfiniteKnot Thus, you need a vasoconstrictor. I know, it sounds backward a bit. The vasoconstrictors apply pressure on the other vessels.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 07:38:43	@InfiniteKnot Either way, the vasodilation allows too much blood into your brain and then there's too much. The vessels are not big enough.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 07:34:12	@InfiniteKnot Migraines are caused by vasodilation. That can happen who knows why. Trigger? No clue.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 07:23:17	@InfiniteKnot Ah! I still use the term rebound. Let me try and explain. Certainly with my Propranolol. It slows the heart. Less blood flow.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-05 07:13:09	@chatobstewart Oh, that's so sweet! Thank you! Please let me know when you've done it and where I can see it!
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-04 08:14:18	Just wanted to say still sort of alive. Starting two new meds at the same time...uh...Haven't forgotten people. Will be back. Whoo. Hoo.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-01 11:21:39	Going to try and go to bed now. If I get insomnia I'm going to kill myself. I've been so out of it all day. Tomorrow?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-01 09:20:06	Hey @birdonthehead thanks for Liking the Convo.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-01 09:17:52	@InfiniteKnot Now my turn to know more? I must be idiotic and missing something totally obvious but MOH? What's that? We're silly.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-01 09:13:16	Thanks for the Like @_confusedpain
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-01 04:21:49	This is what Heroin feels like. After talking to people and what they've experienced? No doubt about it. Don't worry. I'm safe.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-01 04:08:23	Last thing while trippin' on my side effects. Morphine, Heroin. I'm so euphonic. Only surgery, but home. Like Heroin? Know ppl who have done
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-01 03:18:00	I feel like I'm on Demerol or Morphine starting this. Now THAT is a WICKED side effect from a new med. So please excuse me while I enjoy it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-01 03:10:01	Just have to see what new or are doing to me. Fibristal REALLY fast acting to tell my deathly period now to STFU? Can that be?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-01 03:02:37	Will be back to talk to folks. Got messages. Keep talking to me too. Not a bother. I'll just be a bit slower getting back. DM's cool too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-01 02:56:52	Looked at Fibristal and did say minimum three months for pre-surgical candidates with #Fibroids I'll get my partial hysterectomy? Thank you?
16253011	patientanon	2016-04-01 02:50:55	Starting another new med today. Oh, boy. Fibristal. Finally got spelling right. So many including Vitamins needed. Divided doses...
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 10:44:23	@InfiniteKnot But it makes sense? Painkiller overkill on my head. It's a Beta blocker so different? Not sure if I came across correctly.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 10:39:45	@InfiniteKnot It's there already trying to keep a lid on things and adding another lid on the makes the pot heavier. Nice analogy. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 10:35:30	@InfiniteKnot Oh, and just so we're on the same page? I can't take any pills for pain because of the Propranolol. I take it daily.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 10:24:17	I keep putting up Tweets then deleting them. I wonder what that means. I think it means my doppelganger is doing it. Not me. Only logical.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 09:54:56	@InfiniteKnot Yes, rebound types? But with the enormous pain of my period from my Fibroids. That's what I was talking about. Big problem.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 07:16:26	@isseynfarran Hey, Issey. I just ordered some sort of Malaysian Noodles for my dinner. Don't know what, but I'll try anything!

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 03:18:40	@chatobstewart Thanks for the Like. I think a kid I knew had a Table. We'd paddle the balls off it. Then, Aim! Fire! Opponent's Head!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 02:31:37	Only 2x/wk pain meds for Propranolol. Migraine head explosion? However, on "I Need Surgery Period." Have to crawl outside. Ibuprofen. Dying.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 01:44:17	@chatobstewart Another factor? Ping Pong and Table Tennis might be separate games. Head straight to Google and Wiki?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 01:42:11	@chatobstewart Table Tennis another name. But I don't know if they score, or even play by actual Tennis Rules. Never played.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 00:35:53	@GUBLERNATION Ah, jeez. I always forget to do this online. I'm a Writer, so "popcorn poppin"© But I'll waive cost for you; just credit me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-31 00:16:21	@GUBLERNATION Hi. Watching you on TV now, so I thought I'd say I hope you're having a good day. Or better than. Like a popcorn poppin' day!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-29 23:14:11	Okay. My body has to slow down medically. I can't tell side effects from drugs to them making me worse or because of period or just period.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-29 22:53:30	@_evolvingplanet You are most welcome.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-29 21:16:10	@_evolvingplanet Thanks for the Follow. Your personal feed looks interesting.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-29 21:08:29	@chatobstewart Here we go with the "Thank you for the Like Ping Pong Game!" Thanks. Warning: I usually end it at some point.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-29 21:04:06	@StacieMKelly @MrsPinkStig @HavanaWellness Oh, you don't have to thank me. But you are very welcome. Nice to meet everyone else!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-29 21:01:35	@isseynfarran Again, don't carry any of these around! Or if you do, be very careful! Take care now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 05:18:29	Except for OUCH! KNIFE! BLOOD! MORE BLOOD! bye now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 05:16:09	FUCK! Be so careful! New meds, having #seizures Don't shower, even bathe if a bad fall. Dishes... SLASH! No more dishes or Tweets from me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 03:25:11	#cranky I'm such an idiot.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 03:21:32	I want to go to sleep. I don't feel well. After much research, I can't take Propanalol with all my other meds. Great. ANOTHER Divided Dose.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 03:14:00	I feel like a fucking Junkie. Yes, I'm crazy, mental, so batshit, born in the belfry, but I am NOT a Pillhead.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 03:09:54	So there you go about my #Fibroids Actually getting my period early? Time to get the pills! Because pain pills only 2x/wk per Propanalol!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 03:03:14	I'm sure I'm at least peri-menipausal. #Fibroids can shrink then, you know the rest... Fibristol like me through menopause minus death.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 02:57:15	Jumping to my Future #Fibroids gets REALLY exciting! Fibristol is given to women pre-surgery. That's me eventually partial hysterectomy.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 02:51:48	I have to do a new Pelvic Ultrasound. Obviously Though during. I'll need a cancer biopsy/ies of my #Fibroids Which is not going to feel fun.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 02:44:16	However, shrinking my #Fibroids might not be"very cool" for me. A couple of scenarios. but I have to go through something painful first.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 02:40:22	Fibristol. Interesting med. Alters Progesterone to lighten heavy periods, shrinks #Fibroids themselves. That's VERY COOL.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 02:35:18	The Propranolol seems to have had some effect after 1.5 weeks? Less sunglass time? Keep that up. Now, Fibristol for my #Fibroids LOTS there!

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 01:43:51	One more thing. The Skip for Team Russia is GORGEOUS! The Skip for Japan in really pretty too. World's Women's #Curling
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 01:40:06	Okay, back to my Country. Team Canada (who had to compete for the World position here) vs. Team Russia. Women's World #Curling Bronze.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-28 01:31:46	Team Japan vs. Team Suisse in Women's World #Curling Final! Japan never at World Level. Like little kids! So cute! But good. Gold or silver?

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 03:19:22	Tea to stop my rocket to Saturn. Day three increase Propranolol. OW! Bad idea. Pain pills only 2x week. Make pain worse. Take? Die? Okay...

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 02:43:11	@LePetiteNYC To get an idea, look up Schrödinger's Cat. Then move on to more about relatively(?) easy how we have a Multiverse!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 02:39:41	@LePetiteNYC Based on Physics. We just need to get things up and running a bit. I'll recruit the best team and oversee it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 02:37:24	@LePetiteNYC What did I write there? Blame my med increase. You take care of World Domination. I'll start with the Multiverse. Truism.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 02:33:51	@LePetiteNYC Thanks for the Like. And your tag? Yes, no point in getting mad with all our craziness. Even though we do sometimes? Okay...
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 02:30:12	@bondobbs Do we get free spoons?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 02:27:14	@LePetiteNYC Sorry. I don't have your number so it wasn't me. *pokes you to make you smile or laugh* x
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 02:18:14	@BeyondMeds I know. But these types of discussions are great! I'm finally Tweeting intellectually and not just saying useless crap!

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 02:06:48	@BeyondMeds Enslaved? Take a Sociological Macroscopic view of Humans, Conditions. We're all enslaved to something. Or scarier, everything.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 01:57:33	@BeyondMeds Thanks for the Like.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 01:27:10	@BeyondMeds Yes. I've explained in complete detail, given names, times and asked if they could check the cam.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 01:23:51	@BeyondMeds I just realized what I wrote there, sounds somewhat vaguely like a prison description.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 01:21:23	@BeyondMeds Thanks for the Like. There are a lot of people who tend to gossip, be crazy but not my crazy! I've learned who to trust etc.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 01:16:29	@BeyondMeds Yes. You're right. Thieves can be anywhere. It's just the absurdity! Steal a DRY load! Don't think anything too important in it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 01:11:31	@BeyondMeds That's such a short period for someone to run in and grab it. And why not take my second WET load too! Camera there. Something?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 01:09:16	@BeyondMeds I think from now on I'll just sit in the room for the whole time. But only 10 minutes late, before person said she put in dryer
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 01:06:44	@BeyondMeds Thanks. I keep a low profile here, no gossip (never gossip period!) I'm polite and friendly. No "enemies" but crazy people here.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-26 01:02:26	Still haven't heard from Building Management about my stolen WET aundry. Gone by now? Can't even remember what was there. SO ANGRY.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-25 07:48:27	Actually, let me correct something about my last Tweet. It might not be so awesome because of who is running it. I meant the concept. Yes.

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-25 03:45:49	Just emailed my GP. Told her I was on Saturn (I did say that!) Upping Propranolol has sent me there. No new meds Rx from yesterday!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-25 00:13:52	I am exhausted. I am giving myself a free pass to do nothing. Or whatever I choose to do.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-25 00:10:59	Getting to know someone can be a really scary thing sometimes!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-24 06:13:58	@n8wachT I'm sorry. I must speak up now. This isn't funny. Saying a trigger will happily give you epilepsy? So many can't function with it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-24 05:36:00	I refuse to think of anything about medicine or remotely medically related for the remainder of this day. Wants #RetailTherapy
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-24 04:32:33	@TayandYou Okay, thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-24 04:30:58	@TayandYou @imDanime What's that?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-24 04:27:18	@imDanime @TayandYou Maybe I should give it a try.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-24 04:25:45	OMIGOD another med! The Coctail Martini Glass in now a Beer Pint. To ease awful Fibroid problems before surgery an option.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-24 02:41:26	OMIGOD! I'm in the Waiting Room and going through my "So Stoned Everything I See is Hilarious Stage " I'm trying so hard to stifle!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-24 01:47:09	CRAZY woman on Accessible Transit right now! I just bitch slapped her for what she "knew" about mental illness. I love doing that to people.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-24 00:20:06	First day of Propranolol increase. OMG. Where am I? This Doctor's Appointment might be disastrous this afternoon. Food. Upset tummy.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-24 00:10:48	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Like. However, I really wouldn't want the job at all!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 23:23:35	@InfiniteKnot I'd also be a better President because I'm nice. And cute. I'll love you whether you're rich or poor, wherever you are...
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 23:20:19	@InfiniteKnot Maybe there aren't a lot of other good options but where are America's brains! I'd be a better President and I'm Canadian!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 23:14:22	@InfiniteKnot I know. It's been deplorable from the very first second he even said he'd run for President!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 11:23:20	I'm in shackles now with #Trump A dark room in Arizona? I don't know what he will do but I'll die eventually. Nice knowing you all.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 11:02:28	Totally EPIC! Commercial just came on to visit Idaho, it's so wonderful... The channel is all news and covering Idaho's voting.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 10:34:12	Hurry up and tabulate Arizona! I want to see if #Trump is going to treat me racially like a Muslim (even though I'm not) and shoot me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 10:17:52	@Zinquefty Thanks for the Like. He's been "torturing me" all day. Okay. That was pretty lame. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 10:04:36	OMG. I think I'll go to sleep FOREVER if #Trump gets Arizona.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 10:01:02	I really wish I didn't have to go to this Doctor's Appointment tomorrow, but it's been scheduled for months. When to go to bed? 4hrs ago?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 07:25:57	Thinking about setting up my Darkroom and getting excited. Been looking at stores here online. Going to be FUN! #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 05:40:37	Does stupidity have any borders? If not, I'm creating them. Then crossing them. Then setting up camp, because I'll be living there forever.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 05:04:52	Okay! Now let's try something small to cover all the food groups. Vegetables? Check. Where am I going to get Protein? *huge sigh* Later?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 04:53:46	@n8wachT Have you been reading my Tweets about what I was thinking of eating or am just somewhat delusional?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 04:23:34	I think I have "Serious Issue #Therapy Session Syndrome." Symptoms include extremely marked Mind-Body Illnesses and Feelings resulting in...
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 04:11:48	BUT I'M TOO DAMN NAUSEOUS TO EAT DAMMIT!!! I suck.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 04:10:15	Sick, Tired. Food? Tin of Ensure earlier. And forget MAKING anything. Asleep=Fire. What do you say tummy? Carrots and dip? Healthy at least.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-23 00:27:04	This is all so foreign to me. A bizarre, living film. Hollywood could not make it. I'm from Canada. Doesn't happen here. Love to #Brussels
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 23:36:20	@n8wachT You be careful over there too, okay babe? I'm sure you will, but the geography and border crossings. I love you. Just in case. xo
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 23:26:54	@n8wachT At least we're sweet foods together.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 23:24:47	@n8wachT Wow! Sleepy Grammar! Let's correct that because we are not food. Ah, leave it! We are food to some animals on the planet.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 23:18:16	@n8wachT What should I have for breakfast honey? I kind of feel like ice cream.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 23:14:39	@isseynfarran Voted! Let's kick everybody else's ass like a !!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 11:12:21	One last check for my stolen load of laundry that was WET! Nothing. Time for Meddy and Beddy. See you later folks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 10:52:03	Why is life so twisted and complicated? If it wasn't, we'd all be on the ground catatonic and nearly brain dead. Who could pull the plug?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 10:12:02	@n8wachT Thanks for the Like and a big YAY on my Snail! Well, I don't actually own one. But I look forward to it. I need some happy. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 10:04:52	Okay. Maybe new choice of CD?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 10:02:22	@n8wachT Thanks. Music at home. Haven't done that in ages. Not your stuff so don't worry about that. Good to hear from you.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 09:57:26	I was trying to enjoy listening to music but the last one I got a few minutes ago seems to have killed that feeling. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 09:53:36	My Mother will not stop emailing me about the most insane things like magical giraffes and travelling around the world like them. Help me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 09:36:26	Friend gave me cool #Aspie Stim Toy or cool pressie anyway! Metal stars hanging from metal fan over tealight candle. Spins by convection.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 09:16:41	Ah, no matter. I am merely waiting for something. Patiently. In my life. However, I will make no sacrifice over things that will hurt me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 09:05:13	Be most careful. As much as you can. Not to get hurt. And try in love, gently not hurt them. Put yourself first when pain hits you. Or try.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 09:00:38	All the time.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 09:00:13	And so it goes.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 08:51:11	@chatobstewart Thanks for more Likeys! x
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 08:49:09	Total earwom tonight. https:// youtu.be/EIrodEp0_CU
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 06:47:47	Moneymoneymoney...must buy stuff I forgot when doing groceries. Go be proud about shopping. Then go relax for duck's sake! What a day!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 06:42:29	I'm so ticked off, I'm not even going to put away my ONE load of DRY laundry. And I was feeling so proud of myself for doing it all. Damn.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 05:44:18	Someone just stole my WET laundry. O_o #youaredead
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 04:49:20	Totally exhausted and mind-screwy while attempting to do laundry. Also needed Gravol™. Never made me feel funny before. See what happens?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 04:42:35	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Like! I wrote an essay. But hopefully an entertaining one.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 04:20:19	@InfiniteKnot Okay. Thanks!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 01:40:48	But I can't push myself. #Therapy can leave me exhausted if it's an intense Session. It definitely was today. Time to just rest. Not a race.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 01:35:10	Feeling bit better first week Propranolol. Saw Therapist. New GYN in two days. Lots of work there. Try laundry? Need clothes. Don't push it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 00:21:43	@bethevansart Thank for the Like again too here. If only it were true. Love as a "Cure." Pfft. @StacieMKelly
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 00:18:17	@StacieMKelly Thanks for the Like again.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-22 00:15:17	@isseynfarran Oh, Issey. Such a beautiful story but a sad ending. I hope your awesome Doctor does a good job. Don't carry these.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-21 01:28:25	@Zinquefty Beta-blockers can be used for that. Less blood flow by slowing heart, keeps it from getting in head. Vasodilation in migraines?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-21 01:24:31	@Zinquefty Chronic Migraines. Why the damn sunglasses for 24/7 Photophobia, headaches, visual impairment. Kicked off by "Stroke?'
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-21 01:07:51	@Zinquefty I have to increase from 20mg to 40mg on Wednesday. Let's see what happens then. Actually getting worse. Side effect=Treatment.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-21 01:04:14	@Zinquefty This slows heart so below 100 not good. Head down Asystole Avenue. Also, slow heart? MUST be known before ANY surgery.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-21 00:59:24	@Zinquefty It's great. The "normally healthy" is 120/80. Been that all my life but now it CAN change under various conditions.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-21 00:51:34	@bethevansart @StacieMKelly I'm laughing so hard I can barely type!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-21 00:48:07	@StacieMKelly Thanks for the Like. Sorry it took so long to get back to you. Crazy days right now. My head's broken.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-21 00:43:55	My Sphygmomanometer didn't break after all. Awesome! Need BP checks for starting Propranolol. 110/70 yesterday. Green light so far!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-21 00:36:38	@beyondxdarkness Okay. This might be opposite of being twins! LOL. I get too close to people immediately, then can't figure why they leave.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-21 00:32:46	@beyondxdarkness Hi hon. Sorry I haven't been around to see you. Sometimes I think we might be twins! I know this feeling!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-19 06:22:03	@Artemis787 Oh, yes! That would be a problem wouldn't it? Go to the bathroom in the tub? *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-19 04:55:02	That's right. Your mobile ALWAYS changes channels on TV. (nothing to do with starting new med now.) My bathroom is also my fridge too. #ADD
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-19 04:43:44	Unreal! How slowly I have to eat from starting this Propranolol! I'm a baby all over again! But at least not one throwing food everywhere.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-19 02:58:01	@Artemis787 Thanks for the Like, dear!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-19 02:40:45	@Artemis787 Hi. Yes. The bathtub is ideal. Thanks!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-19 00:16:52	Wash few dishes, fill up loads of water bottles, enough to fill toilet, uh...think about it later. Hopefully sleep in?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-19 00:12:55	Great. Water shut off all day in tomorrow. Notice at door. Neighbours came to make sure I got it. Hadn't seen me in days. Thought dead?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-18 23:58:53	@InfiniteKnot Hey you! I wanted to talk about your migraines before, and your treatment. Because I'm just starting Propranolol. Chronic.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-18 23:53:49	Spoke to friend. Older who's had awful heart problems. Laughing as I'M on a beta blocker? He's actually med free now though. Yay!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-18 09:16:41	Actually #ManchesterUnited Fans, there's a Man U Pub where I live. Canada. Total blast! But they're probably shitting themselves in it now?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-18 08:45:37	Pardon me #ManchesterUnited Fans but I always want your opposition to win. Your Club steals the spotlight. It's not fair. You are bullies.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 23:11:41	If the Propranolol starts to work when I increase in a week, always hate the feeling. Health Limbo. Better to do stuff but not. Frustrating!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 23:07:29	I just selected Favourites of Music Stations from my Cable Provider. More music to listen to than local. TV repetitive, can rest eyes a bit.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 22:57:06	@doc_rob I've seen one up close and almost needed 911.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 22:54:03	Thanks for the Like there...er...app. Never had an app Like one of my Tweets. bot bot bot... I really miss the Wicked! bot.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 22:48:02	@doc_rob Especially if she was a Tarantula! *screams so loud to shatter your office windows* #arachnophobia
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 22:43:57	Whoa Propranolol. Take first dose early. No problem. Killer insomnia. Food. Appetite but knives in stomach. Get food? Falling all over.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 04:45:23	Okay. Back to feeling like crud again.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 04:11:29	This is ALWAYS how it starts with med side effects. First day you feel great. Second day, potentially ugly stuff hits. Enjoy Day Number One!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 04:05:08	@doc_rob Can I borrow one of your Llamas to ride while I'm now trippin' out on Propranolol?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 04:01:58	Although, Propranolol is NOT a head med. All I've ever known. I wasn't so happy earlier but now a bit "better?" Stoned. EVERYTHING funny.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 03:46:32	My starting dose pills are so pretty too! Light blue hexagons! <...here we go...> Just kidding. Side effects shouldn't hit in a minute!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 03:40:49	Well, popped the first Propranolol. Let's see what it's going to do to me. God, I love starting new meds! It's so thrilling and exciting!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 03:20:04	My stupid neighbour didn't want to help me by taking my script to the Pharmacy. It was raining. I crawled up. Who's made of sugar and sweet?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 00:22:36	Thanks for the RT @irishgerrie I shouldn't even be looking at this screen right now!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 00:20:36	I can barely walk around apartment. It's po bid but to space it I kind of want it soon. Yet another reason to hate me head. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 00:15:33	Getting sicker. Rapidly. Don't know why. Stress? Mind-Body Connection. Asked neighbour to take script to Pharmacy but he's flaky. Go myself?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 00:11:21	Why propranolol? Mostly for Cardiac? Beta blocker. Lowers epinephrine. SLOWS heartbeat. Less blood slowed overall helps chronic migraines?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-17 00:00:00	I've decided I'm going to start the Propranolol today. Week before seeing new Specialist. Any side effects done by then? If not, wing it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-16 09:10:34	@isseynfarran Nice.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-15 06:49:32	A gorge female Neurologist? I was in heaven! We geeked out too! I was so dizzy but I still wanted to toss my cane against the room and...ah.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-15 06:45:05	Alright. Back to resting my Propanalol head and eyes. Harrowing day. Although, I was quite un-harrowed when I this Neuro. She was drop dead.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-15 06:34:48	Another Med added to my Beautiful Cocktail already overflowing the Martini Glass. New Neuro today giving me Propranolol. Totally awesome!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 14:33:52	I am so pukechedelic right now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 14:20:08	Okay, seriously (?!) I'm so exhausted I almost typed my real name after "seriously." Meds taken. Sleep Fairy please come. Need help?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 13:25:50	Yup. My Ringtone for Twitter too. https:// youtu.be/TXYyStWlJtY
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 12:46:53	For the first time in my life someone has been in love with me for years. I never knew. And they have just waited. To talk. That is love.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 11:31:21	@n8wachT That was like the "Magic Eight Ball! When we were talking it gave me NO solace.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 10:37:12	Is it right, is it wrong. Is it shallow, is it deep. Should I keep my mouth bound, should I dare to speak.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 02:21:39	Next appt with Therapist about two weeks. *sighs* Could book another faster and toss our regular sked off temporarily. Maybe good?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 02:11:35	I think before I even attempt to do anything around here (dishes, laundry, going to the bathroom...) I should start a new Journal. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 00:34:00	@n8wachT Follow @apod Now, that's nice eye candy! I love it!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 00:26:03	@n8wachT There's a really cool pub over here. This reminded me of collages in their bathrooms. Loads of Pop Culture. Pub walls awesome too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 00:19:51	Maybe I can feel better about life's recent bomb if I can at least get ONE thing done around here. Stress=Tired. Stress=Stress. Stress=Sick.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 00:12:16	@n8wachT I'd get up and start dancin' away but I just woke up. Not good. Fall down go boom.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-12 00:05:52	@n8wachT That is both terrifying and hilarious at the same time! He's such an asshole.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 23:59:31	@FrazaKing THANKS for the Follow!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 23:54:01	@FrazaKing Thanks for the Like again. Maybe you can Follow me in thanking me so much! *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 23:51:31	@n8wachT Thank twoo.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 10:50:10	@n8wachT Owly the cool? Lemur the head injury. But Lemur still the cool?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 10:25:56	@n8wachT I haven't been wearing my sunglasses at all today. Bad Lemur. So heady hurty. Rest modus now. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 10:19:32	@n8wachT I must say, that video was cool. I knew from the beginning it was going to head toward Alchemy or something. But the Alien stuff?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 10:05:01	@n8wachT Thanks sweetie. Surprisingly I DON'T have photogenic seizures! I've had about every other kind! Some incomprehensible! Brain
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 09:55:04	@n8wachT And I thought I didn't know what to say about the Simpsons on drugs?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 09:52:37	@n8wachT OMG. I don't even know what to say to that. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 09:47:51	@n8wachT Nice song!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 09:33:19	@n8wachT *Lemur falls out of tree*
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 09:31:42	@n8wachT Oops. My TV just died.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 09:29:57	@n8wachT Lemur a brat for writing that but Owly knows Lemur is a brat. Owly let Lemur get away with being a brat. *hangs from tail*
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 09:17:37	@n8wachT Thanks for the Like. I'm sorry about this. You'll probably kill me for writing it in my Tweet, but I learned! Ik hou van jou! xoxo
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 09:07:53	@n8wachT You're sending Lemur pretty things to look at Owly. It's making Lemur stimmy but in a good way.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 08:44:50	Thanks for the Like @medsharpe
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 08:29:53	Thanks for the RT @HappyiQuit
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 08:20:33	I can't believe this last week hasn't driven me to go out, and become completely legless! Nope. Two weeks sober today. #PTSD #Addiction
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 08:04:44	Txts with Sister. Try and blow off steam. Thought she'd blow me off! We've been fighting too! She didn't. Bit better? Need #Therapist #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 06:26:51	It's true. With gory details my mental, sick, abusive parental units are back together after years. So much harm. I want to puke. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 03:59:13	Vasovagal Hypoglycemia. Tests nil for glucose but not eating for 2-3 days. Ice Cream cleared vision significantly, energy levels up. Okay...
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 03:38:58	Stopgap solution if so. Can't keep eating massive amounts of sugar to resolve visual impairment! Although, maybe related to Vasovagal Nerve?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 03:34:40	I swear. I don't know if this is really possible. Vasovagal Hypoglycemia fits all symptoms of my eyes. High sugar intake helps clear vision.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 03:23:18	Yum. Ice Cream. Now I can simultaneously test my theory of Vasovagal Hypoglycemia. Now I'm a smart 5 year old.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 03:11:19	Cold. Back to bed under Spidey Bankie. It's pretty. Actually, even though I'm cold, I want ice cream. Yes, I'm being 5yrs old today.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-11 02:21:45	@n8wachT Depends upon the context? Saying, "It is just us" can mean you take all the space and make it your playground. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 10:15:45	It took 40 years to actually have a Mom. That was scary. Got enough marbles together to be my Mom when I was 40?! Fuck. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 10:09:41	Waiting to hear back about them. Two choices? Divorce Mom to keep him away (she'll talk!) Or, forgive the bastard to keep my Mom. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 10:00:39	Oops. Forgot the hash as I'm REALLY in #PTSD HELL.They divorced when I was 14. I can't have him in my life. That will happen via her. Help.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 09:55:11	I no longer speak to the male, but I do the female. Over birthday, pressure to forgive him! NON-STOP. Now I think they're back together?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 09:52:09	Yes. Let's celebrate being born into such a wonderful family home. She's a bit abusive too. Denial of mental illness=invisible. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 09:46:11	This REALLY BAD #PTSD crap began on my birthday. March 4. Today? straw, me, back. All about Mom and sick, abusive non-bio dad.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 06:38:52	God this is pissing me off. Fucking enough! Hurry up and finish the job already. Jesus. Let me go. Undo the shackles. #Dissociation #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 06:30:30	You could possibly know something is wrong as my style of talking to you is different. Someone I know can tell. #Dissocation #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 06:26:01	It might look to you I'm not going through any #PTSD #Dissociation because I'm still "here" talking to you. But it's different for everyone.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 06:21:27	#Dissocation with my #epilepsy is brief. Simple Partial Seizures. I only feel something isn't right or I'm altered a bit. NOT like my #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 06:11:43	Got up to get water. Looked in mirror. A sort of ghost or shell looking like me? #Dissociation from my #PTSD is different from my #epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 05:55:54	I have no clue how long I've been sitting here Dissociating. #PTSD joke: If you can't remember how long, you're DEFINITELY Dissociating!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 05:51:49	Aha. That's why I'm not feeling so jolly today. I watched a movie last night. Guess I put a gun to my head? I hate it when I #PTSD myself.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 04:29:45	Holy Wow! I didn't realize how warm it is today! Maybe I can try and get out for a bit of a walk. I should probably try. Wait for a bit now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 04:20:51	@phil500 I tried to catch some of them years ago. Many different types. None were very social for me! Wouldn't surface too much. Good shot.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 04:11:38	I was going to enter the field of medicine but life changes. So, all of my various work makes me know stuff. Pretty well. Yes.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 04:05:15	New Neuro, Gyno this month. Dr. PA review files dictations ready. Dentist, TMJ more dictate. I'm not a real Dr. Blog joke. But I know a lot!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 03:44:01	Oh, thanks for the Like of the Mention to @birdonthehead
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 03:41:13	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Like!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 03:36:01	@InfiniteKnot And finally, we all know we're in our own dreams. But Lucid Dreaming requires you to "see" you. Through your own eyes.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 03:28:19	@InfiniteKnot A common dream of repeatedly falling down stairs? I was lying down floating, controlling my speed, angles, turns, landing!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 03:24:01	@InfiniteKnot I might not have needed any such "learning." Some Lucid Dreamers are Innate. That would be me. My first when I was 4yrs old.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 03:19:38	@InfiniteKnot I'm also a very advanced Lucid Dreamer. I can control everything. Some people work for years to reach that level.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 03:15:07	@InfiniteKnot At first I thought it was a lot of hooey, but not so. Your subconscious tells you a lot. Even if you can't find meaning, wait.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 03:12:33	@InfiniteKnot But I got better over the years and really trained myself to do it. I also find doing it for your dreams is valuable too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 03:09:52	@InfiniteKnot I've done it on and off for many years. A lot "off" at the beginning because my #ADD Brain couldn't deal with it! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 03:05:21	When I can get myself sorted out, go shooting with my #Nikon FG-20 I got so lucky replacing it. In perfect working condition #photography
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 02:50:30	How do people survive? Because I'm not feeling the fittest right now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 02:46:07	I know why I'm tired. My body. But my emotions, head. Mind-Body Connection. I'm not a total wreck. Just ill and stressed. Lost. Nowhere.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-10 02:40:34	Just found old Dream Journal. I think I'll sit and read that now? I should probably start Journalling again period. I'm so tired right now.

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-09 07:45:02	Got it back! #Nikon FG-20. 1984. My first as kid. Taken away. Some folks want $! Rare. I was lucky. All Manual! How you learn! #photography

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 23:19:11	On way to Therapy. Having very interesting discussion about religion, faith and morality with my special driver. Love when I get these ones!

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 03:38:10	@Zinquefty Can't remember right now. Brain mush. East Canada Uni.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 03:36:54	@Zinquefty Never even tried distance! LOL! But if only way, I'd do it. Was the only way at what?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 03:35:21	@Zinquefty This place does distance and downtown. Because of how I learn, I prefer class environment. Focus. Writing notes.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 03:05:27	I DESPERATELY need to go grocery shopping. Let's see if I can put something together...
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 03:02:15	@Zinquefty Once Hell can possibly cool down a bit I can get back in touch with them. They were great. Not surprising as who they were!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 02:59:46	@Zinquefty Thanks! That's awesome. I couldn't remember since I was wondering with large organization as it was for employment, not school.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 02:39:17	I'm playing #Mancala on my own right now. High probably oldest game played in history. Easy, but strategy! I just slaughtered myself.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 02:30:26	@penseurdeverite Doe, a deer, a female deer. reee... You know the reeest?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 02:26:23	@philipgledhill @Cfc_Craig @D8Iveta That's SO totally awesome! Although as a Writer I must have forgotten to copyright that one.

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 02:10:15	@Cfc_Craig Good to hear.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 02:07:14	@Cfc_Craig Oh. I thought I did something wrong. Thanks, Craig. I hope all is well with you!

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 01:42:19	I'm with Philip. Pick what you think would suit me. I stretch with my cane outside. EVERYONE thinks I'm a dancer! https:// twitter.com/philipgledhill /status/706531259594440704 …
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 01:35:25	@D8Iveta Nice to see you! Haven't in ages! I looked at the pic and thought 'Better than a $20 bill in a coat pocket you wore last season!'
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 01:11:28	Maybe this second place might have Grants or Bursaries? Help for Mature Students. My CV is pretty good for it? *sighs* No debt? I could.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-07 01:06:00	I want to go back to school. I had one idea, now I have another, but it's SO expensive! How can I do it on Government Disability??? Ugh.

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-06 04:58:33	I have a picture of Mom on my bookshelf. I just had to turn it around. Stupid? Juvenile? Comical? Not when you have #PTSD and #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-06 04:27:19	God I wish there was someone here with me that I could curl up against. Cry or not. Just some warmth and human contact.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-06 02:17:50	And so the Birthday #ptsd continues the day after with my mother who out of her tree trying to get me to forgive all the abuse growing up.

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 09:31:39	@n8wachT Therefore, Neural Network, Epilepsy, EEG Results that would show your algorithm. ;)
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 09:29:17	@n8wachT Here's a good one. Me having a seizure. Very hard to catch (never have with me) but EEG test. Monitors brain waves.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 09:22:04	@n8wachT I could toss in Stem Cells too, but that's a jump from the brain. Or is it? Let's expand it to all our physical properties?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 09:16:59	@n8wachT Why not? Neuroplasticity? That was unheard of until recently (relative time period?) But a shock everyone that it could happen.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 08:37:46	@n8wachT Hello Physics! Here we go! Or don't go. Because after all, it is Physics.

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 04:50:33	@Zinquefty Oh! There's no rush! You can do it anytime. Also need to talk about working on it and my new Mac when I get it.

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 04:43:33	@Zinquefty You totally read my mind. I have no need for Linux.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 04:40:51	@Zinquefty Yes, choose your Tech by means of versatility and why you need it. What you'll do with it. And comfort zone too, I guess.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 04:38:14	@Zinquefty OMG. Screw Linux. LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 04:35:18	@Zinquefty Ha! Can't read. Meant congratulations on the Pad.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 04:33:54	@Zinquefty And speaking of PCs, not to be rude, but do you still have the one you wanted to unload and pass on to me?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 04:31:54	@Zinquefty I know. That's why #Apple Rules! And congratulations on the Tab! You're making me drool. Not that PCs aren't awful.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 04:23:21	My phone did a major software update and huh? It actually deleted WP. I think I screwed something up but not huge. iPhone here I come?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 03:13:54	Long Term Rehab has to take a back seat for now. My health has to be dealt with first. Problems with not meeting criteria. Too many issues.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 01:22:17	GP had no clue I did anything wrong. Good. I swear she's an #Aspie just like me. I'm damn sure my Gastro has #ADD just like me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 00:04:11	Gotta go! Appt!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-04 00:03:47	Still sick, my period which is now making me terribly depressed (thank you Fibroids.) At least my GP just deals with me and moves on.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 23:56:58	Reasons are not excuses (unless the other person allows them?) There have been reasons. But I don't think they have been excuses at all.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 23:53:47	My GP might really give me crap. Or, if she actually doesn't or has no idea, moot point. LOL! All in my head? I've done this before though.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 23:50:19	I already apologized to the Admin. I think something's up because she said it was okay, their job but not in a happy tone? Or regular happy?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 23:47:03	I never mentioned that. I have access to contact them for EVERYTHING they do and they do A LOT for their patients. I feel terrible.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 23:43:59	Here at GP. Lots to talk about as she's been away. First, massive apology for breaking boundaries and wreaking havoc all over office lately.

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 06:54:29	All of the #Detox HELL can leave your brain pretty fast. This is when you're most vulnerable to your #addiction Thinking so hard now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 06:49:59	Apart from feeling so sick going through #Detox from an #addiction upside? You're not using. But what happens when you're done? Feel fine?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 06:45:13	Are you fucking kidding me with your Like @OMGDetox ? Thank you SO MUCH for trying profit from my pain and serious issues for people.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 06:38:18	Still not feeling so well. A little bit better? Faking wellness for phone calls etc. Gentle food still, Gravol before. #Detox #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 06:06:32	Who are these Merlins of which I speak? I started by calling my first Psychiatrist "Merlin" in hope that he could magically fix me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 06:02:43	Got in touch with Merlin 1! Finally can throw Merlin 2 out the door? Hopefully I've got a Merlin 3 now! All over upping 10mg of my ADD Med!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-03 03:51:22	I am now quite sure that "Steak Knife In Ear" is a formal diagnosis of my recurring TMJD. Found a great new Dentist but Disability Coverage?

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 04:31:50	@Zinquefty When I'm better, come down for sure and we'll have loads of fun. As always. OX
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 04:30:08	@Zinquefty And if it makes you feel better, I've been cancelling things all over the place. Can't go out except to corner store. GP soon.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 04:27:37	@Zinquefty It's my worst ever. Things happening that never did before. But I just have to go through it and come back. Out the other side.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 04:25:21	@Zinquefty As you can see, the visit would have gone down the shitter anyway! Withdrawal and subsequent Detox hit right after we talked.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 04:22:04	Banana for breakfast. Now some Cheerios™ Gentle for tummy. So yay! Eating. Worry about more food later. Maybe I can nap? #Detox #Addiction
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 04:06:33	@GothicDressCode Yes. I always say go for a larger size because you have to remember that you will be putting clothes on underneath!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 03:11:18	@GothicDressCode Especially with the size differences from Asia. They are smaller than in the "Western World." Have a M shirt. Bit tight?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 03:08:04	@GothicDressCode I'm totally buggy eyed over all the Men's. Even though I'm a girl. And tiny! But sometimes you can make it work.

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 00:41:36	@InfiniteKnot I'm really lucky to have her. She's incredible. Even does Counselling Appts just to talk. I talk to my Neuro via phone too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 00:10:04	@InfiniteKnot I didn't get the name of the enzyme so I couldn't look into it. She's out of office but staff have passed on I need a call!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 00:06:12	@InfiniteKnot There is a Liver enzyme that rises (seemingly) when I drink. I stopped for a few days, tested again and it lowered.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-02 00:03:28	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. Although, can't understand why I'm not getting better. Or why it's taking so long? I've called my GP just now.

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 11:55:37	@_believein_you_ That was very poor grammar! Didn't come out right at all! Hack was based on personal information. Not saying my fix here!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 11:51:46	@_believein_you_ I won't Tweet my fix, but it was done via my personal information.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 11:47:37	@_believein_you_ That was a problem (and a solution) years ago. It was almost like a bot took over your Account and you had no idea.

16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 09:51:22	Perfect time to head to the shop. Just started freezing rain. Don't feel like a head injury right now. Maybe later when I feel better?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 09:51:22	Should try and eat but Gravol/Dimenhydrinate into me first! STAT! This Withdrawal and Detox is killing me. But no drinking! #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 05:30:20	@The_Truth1111 Thanks again!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 05:25:28	@The_Truth1111 Thank you and you're welcome back! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 05:22:01	@The_Truth1111 Thanks for the Like.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 05:20:38	@The_Truth1111 Really? Well done!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 05:15:56	@The_Truth1111 Oh, the picture you've chosen for Twitter. For your Profile.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 05:07:32	@The_Truth1111 Where did you get your avatar? It's really pretty.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 05:06:30	@The_Truth1111 I totally agree.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 04:27:24	@n8wachT Oops. I guess I was wrong? Sorry!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 03:37:41	@n8wachT I think I got the "Wed-ness." Where's my ring? *giggles*
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 03:36:04	@n8wachT Appointment with GP on Thursday so creative then? No guarantees that they'll let me help. But I have enough reasons it needs help!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 03:32:29	OMG so sick to go out. Withdrawal, detox. Serious binge. Made promise to self. Remain sober a week for GP. Could drink to nuke being sick?
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 03:21:46	OH NO!!! Bathroom Web Design!!! I'm out of toilet paper!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 03:15:36	You could say "IDWIMIE" instead of "IDWIME" to be more precise. Or if you like acronyms that end like words/some grammatical expression.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 03:05:29	"IDWIME" What a WONDERFUL word in Web Design! Okay, it's an acronym. Who out there knows what it means? I think I've only told one person.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 03:01:29	It seems they got stuck at the "IDWIME" like all electronic communication with their patients. But after the beta fix, they stopped there.
16253011	patientanon	2016-03-01 02:42:27	Seeing GP Thursday. Apart from health, need to talk about new, little website they have. Layout, breaks, content "promotion" so to speak.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 08:04:45	@_believein_you_ So...if it were to be used, someone who has it, screwing me over. And/or a major personal or WTF hack. WHY? Totally stupid!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 07:59:24	@_believein_you_ Then I clicked on another email portion of NOT ME! Still, good Twitter Security? I don't use my own email address here.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 07:57:08	@_believein_you_ Then I dug deeper to see the Account. Who was it? Gone but... Account name said from my email address from Twitter!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 07:54:22	@_believein_you_ First it was a wrong but close enough email to my personal. Of course I clicked not mine!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 07:52:52	@_believein_you_ Twitter emailed me to confirm some Account to confirm set up of something in foreign language. Account?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 07:50:22	@_believein_you_ I know. Everything seems fine now. Maybe a problem when someone was trying to set up Account with my personal email.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 07:46:52	@_believein_you_ x
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 03:32:20	Good Twitter catch. Person setting up their account here, using my personal email. Don't try again you fuckers.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 02:08:41	@_believein_you_ Thanks for the Like again. Weird. Not getting Notifications! Ah, Twitter...
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 00:47:38	@_believein_you_ HAHAHA!

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 00:46:12	@_believein_you_ Thanks for the Like.

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-29 00:14:50	Good advice when in debt: "Needs not Wants." I'm now here-or was a long time ago! I have enough credit for a Maserati, Condo, Harem...more.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 12:16:53	I just set up a Weekly Alarm on my mobile for my #AA Home Group. It's early in the morning. I labelled it "Get Up Asshole." #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 11:54:55	I have to go to the bathroom SO BAD but I can't leave the television! #tournamentofhearts
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 11:46:49	Whoa. Immediately a huge groan in entire arena for Team Northern Ontario's last Rock in 7th End. Now THAT'S gotta hurt! #tournamentofhearts
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 11:25:08	@_believein_you_ So you are loving and protecting me and my tummy right now?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 11:22:52	@_believein_you_ But thanks so much again.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 11:22:15	@_believein_you_ I'm so out of it, I didn't reply properly through the original Tweet. I think it was because I didn't get a Notification!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 08:53:06	@beyondxdarkness *raises hand* Are we twins? I have a huge case of "The Green Eyed Monster."
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 08:51:04	@beyondxdarkness I'm like this so much and have been for so long. Been a total Hermit. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 08:01:56	Party in our Social Room. Woman gave me food. Can't eat it. Tummy bad and fever 100°F. Don't forget kindness. Definitely for small things.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 06:03:14	Way to go Team Northern Ontario in Tournament of Hearts for stating touched stone. To me that means you've already won.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 05:47:25	@_believein_you_ Thanks. Just not too much?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-28 03:20:31	@beyondxdarkness OMG! I can FINALLY see all of your Tweets here again? At least by scrolling down over and over? Thank bloody god!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-27 10:05:24	Just ordered pizza. Ate one slice. Now completely regretting phone call. #anorexia #eatingdisorders
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-27 03:22:32	Severe rest needed so finishing up Series "Maria Watches Over Us." SO HARD to find anything #yuri (or close) #Anime This one sweet though.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 11:58:42	Oh, man! Just missed AMAZING Rembrandt Documentary! Ah, shucks!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 11:52:05	Meds. Check. Sleep in clothes and clean bed tomorrow. Maybe me too. Mind numbing television. Valium push for insomnia. I'm allowed to do it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 11:35:37	Okay. I've got to settle my silly ass down. Overworked, overtired. I'm being a moron. Well, that happens regularly. Nonetheless...
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 11:32:10	@tablopublishing And Thanks for the Like again!

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 10:34:22	Must arise from the dead again! Outside to pay rent. Fuck off.

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 10:22:40	@n8wachT Now that I'm home I think I'll allow myself to die on my bed like before. ;)
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 10:17:46	Have the window open. Will just listen to the sounds outside.

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 09:25:30	Tears up old #writing to shreds. #amnotwriting
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 09:17:27	Ran into this kid I knew who is #writing and I'm proud because I encouraged him years ago but too much talk! #amnotwriting Now head gone.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 09:01:11	@Zinquefty No. Too cold. Totally covered in ice right now anyway! I can navigate the ice on the streets with my cane.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 08:22:13	@Zinquefty Just took some Advil as it helps maybe a bit. I need air right now. Stuck here all day. And smokes, juice. Want to write too?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 08:12:40	@Zinquefty I was supposed to go downtown, get ID and see a friend but cancelled because of that and pain. I might need rain check. Sorries.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 08:10:44	@Zinquefty Saturday, WTF is Saturday? O.o WTF is today? I'm pushing myself. Not sure. Knife in ear causing bad vertigo.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 07:53:27	@Zinquefty Some is my own though so it needs special attention. Keep to continue or let go. Need notepad and pen for that as well.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 07:51:38	@Zinquefty I dunno. I gotta go out to the shops. Then helpful to sit and go through more reading material to keep or toss. Was doing today.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 07:47:39	@jimm_perdue Thanks again! Now we get into "Like ping pong!"
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 07:46:23	Question. Do I have any of my head left to read. Yes? I can do more work while out. No? I'll fake intelligence. Or maybe I always do that.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 07:37:16	@n8wachT Hi Sweetie. Hope my'owly doing good? Dead Lemur. Got a lot of exercise twoo? Lemur not so perky with legs to jump! Lemur head whoo!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 07:31:15	Oh, crap! I can't just lie here dead! I gotta go out! *slowly falls over...*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 07:27:32	Oh, well. Got stuff done. Should shower but I think I'm too tired and dirty to care! I've been washing my hands a lot! Ugh. *dies*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 07:25:04	No World Rocking. Except for Previous World Rocking. Stereo I had in storage for preamp for turntable. Nope. Now through TV and old! Quiet!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 06:07:55	We're getting closer. If I don't end up needing to go to the hospital before accomplishing this, it'll rock my world. Literally. Whew!

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 01:46:50	For my "Shred-O-Rama" I forget how long I need to keep my Income Tax Reports. I'm sure I can get rid of A LOT of paperwork there!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-26 01:43:55	Alright! Managed to cross a couple of things off my MASSIVE "To Don't List." Not bad. Now some tea and I think a "Shred-O-Rama" next.

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-21 10:56:23	One really cool song recommendation though. "Sorrow" by Levinhurst. So depressing a song but put dance with a tiny D&B.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-21 10:50:13	Okay. Enough of the lyrics. Blah, blah. I don't think any of you care. *smirks*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-21 10:48:22	Deciphering Tanita Takaram's "Twist In My Sobriety." I laugh at people for their take on it. Dead easy. Oops. I said "Dead." Context people!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-21 10:42:27	The Fortune Cookies to his song? First line and background lyrics you can barely hear.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-21 10:32:29	Since I'm a writer, uncontrollable urge, bloody can't stop, song lyric dissection. George Michael's "Precious Box." Want To play with me?

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-21 03:39:14	@n8wachT My impulsivity is NOT a very good trait of mine. Gets me into a LOT of trouble. Sometimes it's okay but oh god.

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-20 03:58:49	@n8wachT I'll take both. Unless they're the same? *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-20 03:55:40	@n8wachT *Lemur laughing* I think dishes will be okay. Then look at stupid LIST again. Sometimes do one thing, motivated for more?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-20 03:46:34	@n8wachT Do my dishes.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-20 03:45:06	@n8wachT Maybe that was a mistake while I'm sort of not looking at it now. *Lemur sigh*

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 12:06:03	@HardAspie Heh. After I've left they'll learn not to erect any buildings ever again.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 12:02:45	Yay. Txt from cousin across country got birthday pressies. That's happy.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 11:59:40	@HardAspie Neato.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 11:59:26	Don't bother saying anything "encouraging." Suicide is ugly. Being in a coma for three days is ugly. Please don't attempt suicide people.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 11:56:56	What's "killing" me is #PTSD of anniversary of trying in 2011. And wanting to do it again now. Just an offhand thing. Nobody knows.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 11:53:51	@HardAspie Cool.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:58:10	@HardAspie Other Professions? Medicine is very hyperfocus. Gee, why am I so into it? HA! Neurology for thought. Personal joke. *wry grin*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:52:55	@HardAspie But that's when I've had to try and choke out my words and cry. When there is conflict. Our personal relationship shifts.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:50:45	@HardAspie Yes, she knows. But is narrowly focussed as a MD. Funny. I've even thought she was an Aspie at times. *crosses eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:47:17	@HardAspie I'll wait. Of course. Been at points from Brighton to Inverness, this lass.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:44:50	@HardAspie Now not angry at GP anymore. Sad and upset. We're so close. I get Aspie Spazzy and have told her it gets in the way of "us."
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:42:18	@HardAspie Come over and help me! I know how long the flight is! Made it myself! 5! *laughing* You know where I am 'cross th' pond?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:39:01	@HardAspie *whipping along with my cane avoiding ice* Oy. I'm not Jewish. My GP is. *upset*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:37:02	@HardAspie Oui.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:36:17	@HardAspie NOW! NOW! NOW! I swear!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:35:41	@HardAspie I have one week to sort! My new deadline is 23rd! I should probably quit fucking around with emails and go to the damn place now!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:32:37	@HardAspie So, in a roundabout way, yes. I just need to get things sorted with the new woman at the shop. The program was 2yrs. So why now 1
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:30:29	@HardAspie I just didn't have it then due to Government crap! Sent my DL Reinstatement after seizure free to OLD address. Muck up.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:27:56	@HardAspie No payment for a couple of years or three? But you need Government ID for another Bank approval. Only a few minutes.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 09:25:41	@HardAspie No, it's kind of a long story due to the shop, prior person I worked with when my old Mac was dying. They have their own plan.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:52:22	@HardAspie Absolutely.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:48:56	@HardAspie Apparently I've got until Feb. 23. And need new ID for a payment program. If no time, further into debt.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:47:22	@HardAspie I just only have a few days. Something must have changed. It was a two year period upgrade, now I'm being told one year.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:45:43	@HardAspie Yup!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:45:04	@Zinquefty It's rare! But from me having to go to them all the time, I've mapped out what's around. And certain Doctors at some!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:42:34	@HardAspie Fuck dealing with my home and getting it sorted for now too! Gotta get my new ID AND apparently my new Mac in a few days!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:40:44	@HardAspie Therapist gone until early March. God knows what I'm walking into with GP early March but we are so close. Fuck Rehab now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:39:02	@HardAspie Thanks. I just have to try and get super organized really fast for two Specialists in March. The ear thing a monkey wrench!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:35:46	@Zinquefty I've already picked my hospital should I go. Best treatment ever had in city ER. Treated me like a Queen.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:33:39	@Zinquefty Been there, done that with my sensitive right ear in the past. They don't understand the history and how bad it can get.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:31:27	@HardAspie Thanks but there's too much now to deal with. More than before. Medically, personally-as my own life stuff.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:26:19	Now, I am going to try and read while it feels like someone is constantly shoving a steak knife in my ear.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:19:42	@HardAspie Thanks. I love you too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:18:54	I think I'll hold off for an ER visit just to spite her. How mature? But seriously, it might seem to "reactionary." I am SO truly twisted.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:14:03	Thanks to everyone else out there for letting me explode. But I'm not exactly finished with that yet.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:12:06	@HardAspie Of course you can. Always. Thank you. Very much needed right now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:10:49	When I see my GP. Cold as ice. I'll apologize for anything I did wrong but again, I will say I have to Triage my life. Going crazy. Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:05:50	I don't even give a shit about treatment for anything in my life right now. I don't give a shit about me right now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:03:52	I cannot express how upset I am right now. I want to just tell all of my Team to Bugger Off! I'll just go it alone. I don't give a shit.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 08:00:58	ER probably needed now as ramping up in unbearable pain FAST! Years ago burst drum in same ear and they thought I might have lost hearing.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 07:58:25	Today I call panicking because Accessible Transit fucked up my time so 15min. with Therapist! That I need! ER for my EAR? GP in two weeks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 07:55:34	I think I pissed off my GP. She went back on a promise. I broke boundaries? Well excuse me because I have to Triage my life! I need you.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-18 07:41:44	Thanks for the Like @QuialinoCases

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-16 10:49:57	I'm SO sick of WINTER! I'm wearing my scarf inside my apartment! Actually, it's a fashion statement. I tied a small scarf perfectly today!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-16 10:14:38	@zachbraff @BrassGoblin I know. Who wouldn't? Couldn't? As soon as I came home after writing that, I had to play the Soundtrack! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-16 09:59:42	*frozen in time and space*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-16 09:27:41	If you could go back and not do it all again, would you? #noregrets #regrets

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-16 08:17:54	I should keep track of what I'm doing when I get certain Followers out of the blue. Yes. I'm going to call it "The Twitter Ouija Board."

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-15 05:36:13	@Zinquefty Just watch #Anime and lie here shivering. OX
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-15 05:34:20	@Zinquefty Phone off for now too. Maybe back later. Ugh. No condition to make any sense.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-15 05:32:06	@Zinquefty Going back to bed now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-15 05:30:41	@Zinquefty Not yet. Had to fix Cable yesterday and now sick. Doctor Appointment tomorrow.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-13 10:29:48	@GothicDressCode Hi. You don't take DMs from people you don't Follow. Confidential. I contacted you as the real me. Had loads of questions!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-13 09:50:01	I'm hemorrhaging dye showering, turning my towels red all over the place! Oh, well. The price you pay for good #Goth Hair @GothicDressCode
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-13 08:00:10	Oh, no! Icky Jelly Beans? Did I lose my tattoo friend's business card???
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-13 07:56:50	Okay. I'll just wing it with the Coconut Oil stuff. Leave it in my hair for a bit. I want to email I guy I met about a tattoo. Time killer.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-13 07:46:10	Freezing! Shower! How long should I leave Coconut Oil Conditioner in my hair before washing? Protects dye. It's like this weird Pomade too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-13 07:39:32	The Police are over the place anyway. I just walked home as normal...but with a sharp key through my first. Just in case. Self-Defense 101.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-13 07:35:20	One woman with kids wanted to kill them, one was scared to death. I didn't care (except for anyone hurt!) Cane=Weapon+Mega Self-Defense.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-13 07:26:24	Okay. Out and some kids stealing and beating up people. This doesn't exactly happen where I live. There were three women. Three reactions.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-12 04:57:20	Thanks for the RT @GothicDressCode
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 13:59:27	Snap me, Zip me, Belt me, Jacket off, but still wearing my Doctor Martens Standard Eights on bed. What? Odd? You just gotta know it. #Goth
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 13:37:32	@Zinquefty Check out "Before The Bullfight" by David Sylvian if I didn't tell you about that one before.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 12:57:58	Best song by Duran Duran. Obscure B-Side. Secret Oktober. Seriously.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 12:54:45	Here I go again. Playing DJ at home and giving you my Playlists.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 12:52:52	My favourite song by The Cure? Now playing. "A Forest." #Goth
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 12:39:10	@Zinquefty "...be running up that road, be running up that hill..." ~ Claudia Brucken and Andrew Poppy. ALWAYS for you.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 12:04:21	@Zinquefty And have been in Straitjackets in BDSM Scene. They are are SOOO relaxing and calming. Sounds strange but relax and enjoy.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 12:00:10	@Zinquefty Another thing? Love this Jacket because of Asp. Swaddle. Like my Weighted Blankets...
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 11:47:01	@louiserreyna Thanks for the RT.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 11:45:25	I'm home right now. Space, time. Cocteau Twins. I made a joke. Instead of going back in time, Retrofit. I'm going back. Me. Young #Goth
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 11:32:48	@Zinquefty Baby, I can lie down on anything! *winks* Unless, grammar? Yes, to lie down. But erm...anything else?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 11:30:27	#Blogging can be so "pedestrian" at times. Every other Social App too. #Twitter #Facebook #LinkedIn More. Even worse than pedestrian. Awful!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 11:20:41	Ah, yes! A gentleman I know. Must email about a tattoo. Long story about tattoo past but have none. Want this. Told it won't work? Well?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 11:13:13	@Zinquefty Cannot lie down on this #Goth Jacket we know. For I've had to wait to wash my newly dyed hair! But it feels sooo good to wear it!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 10:59:54	Oh! What yonder #Goth Clothing...time to put on a jacket. A steal! Worth about $100.00 more. Belts! Zippers! Design Padded! *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 10:47:24	@bestofgoth @GothicDressCode I love my #Goth gear, all fit up, just at home or lying in bed. Not out and about. Just enjoying what it is.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 10:41:58	@bestofgoth @GothicDressCode When out, come home, before looking for music, footwear always on the bed. Right now, my 8 Hole Dr. Martens.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-11 10:32:24	@roclip I've driven Standard Shifts all my life and even Speed Shifted (no clutch.) Now THAT will take you to life! Real Life.

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-09 08:56:40	@purpIeutopia Your trust in me means so much. I forgot to say that.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-09 08:32:53	The Sick Soup Conundrum. Do I dare to partake? Step One. A single spoon. *pause* Step Two. A few more spoons of it. Okay. I had my soup.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-09 08:19:39	@purpIeutopia Thanks for the Likes. Now we can both see. I've got my spectacles on!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-09 08:10:18	To the world: Cin Cin! Nasdravia! Lachiem! Cheers! Autre "Mass" Hail Mater POUR MORE FAVOUR! Has anyone seen my wallet or Passport?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-09 07:57:27	@purpIeutopia Did you see my last? Just sent? Geography.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-09 07:55:57	Another day bedridden completely with cramps. Thank you #Fibroids I just made some soup to try and eat but after looking at it? Uh, no.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-09 07:35:20	@purpIeutopia I sent a couple more DMs. Can you read those?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-09 07:28:44	And a final thanks for the Like of my head exploding! @faulkner368

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 14:14:42	Never should have even looked at Twitter today?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 13:32:48	I fuck up with boundaries but you can never have proper relationships with extremely reticent and capricious people. #Aspergers #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 13:19:54	I have completely lost my "Sane Face." Granted, online. But I'm now losing the mask of how you might always see me. #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 13:15:14	@AspergerCentral Thanks for the Like. Probably shouldn't be on Twitter. Impending Meltdown?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 13:12:40	@purpIeutopia I have new red hair too. Yours looks lovely. Your prettier than me though.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 13:03:44	Suck it up. Because it's fucked up. But try not to cry because you didn't do it, but you did. Now nothing. Dead. Like always. #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 12:57:19	Okay. Something's up. Too much is up. Let the Stimming begin. Stuff I haven't even done since I was a kid. #Aspergers #Nonverbal
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 12:52:17	@Adeel_Raana You're most welcome.

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 11:35:09	@purpIeutopia BLASPHEMY! *all Footie fans drop to the floor*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 11:32:09	@purpIeutopia "Football" as in the Superbowl is WRONG!!! There is only one form of Football. Which I love. Thank you very much.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 11:28:28	@purpIeutopia Depends how hungry you are.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 11:19:41	@purpIeutopia @Adeel_Raana Oh! That was such a pleasure to read!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 11:18:14	@purpIeutopia As per my DM, just where are we going to shop together? Or both? SQUEEE!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 11:04:40	@purpIeutopia And my dear, that is just the START of my #Aspie Shopping! You should see me when I'm in the grocery store. Total Chaos!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 11:01:24	@purpIeutopia We're "Shopping Twins." Heaven help us!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:50:02	@purpIeutopia Thanks for the Like. I really needed to read something like that right now!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:48:24	@purpIeutopia I've gone shopping with a list, forgotten the list, forgotten a pen for the list, brought both but forgot I had them with me.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:45:16	@purpIeutopia You sound so much like me! A joke in one of my areas? #Aspie Shopping. We can get all spun around and crazy. Total mess!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:41:50	@purpIeutopia ABSOLUTELY!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:27:08	@Zinquefty Total blind search within basic parameters. Printed off pages of Psychiatrists. Then I started calling. Hey, want to see me?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:25:05	@Zinquefty Oh, it does. More detailed search. There is an option for Specialty. Psych, Neuro, Gastro etc. Again, how I found Merlin #1.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:21:44	@Zinquefty So go to CPSO. Also, gives you a bit of geographic leeway?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:20:23	@Zinquefty Like, this Doctor isn't taking patients, but try this one we know of... I found Merlin #1 there, he lead me to Merlin #2.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:18:12	@Zinquefty CPSO looking useless? It usually is, but... Not always. It can almost be like a job. Cold Calling. You can get surprises!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:15:14	I hate my hormones. I can't wait to see my new OB/GYN to discuss my *want* partial hysterectomy. GP and I have a STRONG Case! #Fibroids
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:11:04	@Zinquefty Harrumph. Too far to come to see mine. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:09:31	@Zinquefty How bizarre to go from smaller where you might think underserved, to where you are now. Not a huge jump for lack of resources?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:07:35	@Zinquefty That sucks. I got REALLY lucky because I need someone who can deal very well with #PTSD She was also the first I met.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 10:04:49	@Zinquefty I always say you have to shop around. Find a good fit and be REALLY committed. But I agree it's also not for everyone.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 09:59:07	@Zinquefty And with my #Alexithymia ? She gently pulls EVERY word out of me when I can't say a thing at all! #Therapy
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 09:56:38	@Zinquefty This woman is worth every penny I pay. She lives in my brain. Finishes my sentences for me. Right on the same page.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 09:54:05	@Zinquefty What did you do? Oh. I know. Doing too much research so brain fried. This is just lately though. Overall, it's great.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-08 07:45:50	#Therapy tomorrow. Sessions so weird lately. Go in. No clue what to say. Then I think I go "Stream of Subconscious." I leave totally unfine.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-06 15:56:38	Itch, Itch, Scratch, Scratch… https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2016/02/06/itc h-itch-scratch-scratch/ …
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-06 14:58:27	My ADD and just plain ol' impulsivity always gets me in SO much trouble! ALWAYS! Now, lying on my bed. Reality. Something needs thought.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-06 14:29:40	God, I hate "Should'ah, Could'ah, Would'ah."
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-06 14:15:18	Listening to "set free" by the american analog set. So good to just to send you gently on a Shuttle to anywhere you Want To Go... *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-06 09:15:17	@isseynfarran Hi Issey! Good to see you on the CanMNT List with all of the other Team Members. Here's to a fantastic 2016 Season!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-06 04:04:09	OH MY GOD! I just went to the toilet as I'll be sitting in a chair forever and I hear the Mom going at it with her kid! Oy. #kidsareevil
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-06 03:55:46	I just yelled at a Customer's Kid. Playing with stuff in Salon. Something fell down. Me: "YOU BREAK IT YOU BUY IT!" #cranky #kidsareevil
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-06 03:46:28	Plus, my grays are actually cardboard whites. When I go salt and pepper, I'm a "salty" cartoon character--and a bad one to boot!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-06 03:42:22	Although I will tell you, as much as I POSITIVELY LOVE my new red hair, it's costing me a fortune! Mostly because my hair is dark brown.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-06 03:38:13	At my Stylist early to play with my red and roots. I bought her a wee Valentine's Pressie!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 07:30:46	@WIND_Cares Done. Where I was speaking to the other person. I just said Hi to you.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 07:25:11	@WIND_Cares Actually, I'd be DM'img your entire Account!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 07:20:13	@WIND_Cares Hi Alan. Thanks. I was talking to another person from you about this and other problems. He just said his wife had the same.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 07:17:38	Oh, shit. Forgot to eat again.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 07:15:55	I think I have to get an iPhone from @WINDmobile Not that I don't love #Mac I'm Newton under the tree! My phone now? Can't even make calls!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 06:02:42	For the love of whatever Deity! Why the hell do people Follow me? O_o From all friggin' areas! Stupid, smart, funny, similar, loving...
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 05:51:50	On the other hand, any money in #writing Greeting Cards? If so, I could retire now, with my Award Winning Purple Prose #amwriting
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 05:46:35	Sending Birthday Pressie to cousin a year late! Must finish up the job by #writing #amwriting a hilarious letter! I loathe Greeting Cards.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 05:40:08	@Writing_Class Thanks for Following! Now I must ask you a very important question, based upon that fact. Am I to be a student, or a teacher?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 05:31:27	@PurpIedarkness I love this little guy. I think he suits me a lot. This one I sent you too, is just ONE appropriate for my head!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 05:27:48	@PurpIedarkness A Like of a "Test Tweet." Never before! I love you for that! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 05:17:00	@PurpIedarkness I struggle with this so much. Comes from how I grew up. I never had a childhood. I had to parent my parents. Others first.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 05:12:40	@PurpIedarkness I know how it feels. I get so mired in my #PTSD but when I get out, I try really hard to turn it all around to see the good.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 05:08:36	@PurpIedarkness It's just that when you're caught up thinking of all the painful ones, it is so difficult to remember the good ones. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 05:06:17	@PurpIedarkness True. But only some? Not to sound pollyanna, as we all hate that! But there are good memories too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-05 05:03:28	@PurpIedarkness Yes. And when that sleep comes it's like magic!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 13:47:39	Ohhhh...Riiiggghhhttt... If I want to sleep, I must remember to take my meds. Funny, that.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 13:18:30	"...Goodbye you moonlight ladies, Rockabye sweet Baby James..."
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 13:13:55	@PurpIedarkness Okay. I'm not lost or in some forest or something. It's you.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 13:10:54	@PurpIedarkness New name?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 13:08:19	@HardAspie You too! I should try to sleep too. Sleep sked all over! x
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 13:00:28	@HardAspie Cool. I'll talk to my neighbour about them.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:40:17	@HardAspie Nice!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:38:37	@HardAspie The Girl With The Weight Of The World In Her Hands. Whoa.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:37:14	@HardAspie Excellent. I miss my cycling days when I lived down by the lake. Another tune for you too! Indigo Girls always amazing!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:29:12	@HardAspie Neighbour here cycles like crazy! Multiple bikes! We talked. He said I could get this type for my needs. Upper body fine.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:26:29	@HardAspie From This Moment On.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:26:02	@HardAspie Yes, try to find. Back then, I only liked three tracks. Sinead O'Connor You Do Something To Me and Jimmy Somerville...
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:22:16	@HardAspie I'll never be able to ride my regular bike now from so many seizures and loss of balance but I could do a recumbent?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:18:07	@HardAspie OMFG Fine Young Cannibals doing Love For Sale. SO AWESOME!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:16:23	@HardAspie Don't know if you know or remember CD Red Hot and Blue? I think that's it? Support/Sales for HIV/AIDS. Covers Cole Porter.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:06:36	@HardAspie You know me. Dr. PA ALWAYS wants to know... *smirk*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:04:07	@HardAspie I've always had a good sense of balance. Center of gravity so it was almost like I could fly! No head injuries epilepsy. Totally.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 12:02:07	@HardAspie Booze was more untreated Bipolar but not. I would be hypomanic, drunk, and fall but almost bounce back onto my feet!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:58:59	@HardAspie Medical problems. Yes? No? Answers? Mysterious? Treatments or none? I'm the Queen of Mysterious, thus no treatment.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:55:16	@HardAspie The joy of epilepsy. Or bad meds. Possibly leading to seizures but you don't know it. Or a kid and ? Or Manic Flying. Booze.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:51:36	@HardAspie Oy. I've never "disjointed" in any way but any temperature comfort? My head injuries? Name any hard surface and I've hit it!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:44:15	@HardAspie Ouch! And thankies for the hugs back!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:43:10	@HardAspie I prefer Cyber to Steam. Actually, I want DESPERATELY to be a Cyborg in real life.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:41:14	@PurpIedarkness It's funny. I never made the connection before. Duh.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:40:08	@PurpIedarkness OH! We would have SO much fun! Where I am? I think you would LOVE IT!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:38:31	@HardAspie You KNOW I'll give you hugs until the end of time, dahling. You know that.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:36:50	@HardAspie What happened? And yes, at 45, I can Goth it out! Small and look young. How fucking vain. Aspies say WTF BLUNT. Love it!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:32:44	Three loads of laundry to be folded and put away...tomorrow.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:08:31	@HardAspie BIG HUGS BACK!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:07:04	@HardAspie And you? I never heard back after I said I liked your hair! LOL! Mine's dyed red now. Going back to my Goth Teenage Years! YA!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 11:04:50	@HardAspie Not bad. Lots of crap to get my place in shape from the Bedbugs long ago. Organization, unpacking still. Medical shit. Always.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 10:56:53	@HardAspie Okay, cool. Great to hear from you too!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 10:54:19	@HardAspie Okay, Liked so I can remember!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 10:53:07	Deborah Cox: "If I go to work in a miniskirt, am I giving you the right to flirt?" I say HELL YEAH! Bring it on!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 10:43:04	FINALLY doing laundry after NOTHING all day. I need music.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 10:41:34	@PurpIedarkness Well, long time "good friend." What is now with the person has just evolved into something closer. A "bigger friend." LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 10:37:53	@PurpIedarkness I'm glad you can see my point? Too bad we weren't closer together or we could go out and paint the town a rainbow!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 10:17:19	@PurpIedarkness I'm Purple Nin-Jah actually. Seriously! LONG time Blog History with a friend from his Blogging between us. *swoosh*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 10:12:41	@PurpIedarkness I will add a caveat to this. Human beings are creatures that do need real contact with each other. So we must have it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 10:09:56	@PurpIedarkness Yes, I love you! HA! The other J. Did I write that? If anyone clues in, fuck it. The person would never be upset.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 09:51:51	@PurpIedarkness And I will do my best to catch you just in case you do.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 09:50:36	@PurpIedarkness J. the you I but another J. Many, many people know of this person in the online mental health world. And it is returned.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 09:41:46	@PurpIedarkness I see. I see you. I am a hermit. I go out little. Maybe three (un)reliable friends. My Professionals and online folks? J.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-04 04:51:03	Gruesomely unmotivated. That's all I've got to say.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-03 04:42:41	@PurpIeObsession Thanks for the Like here too, doll. Hope you're doing okay. I've been off the radar with a lot of medical stuff.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-03 04:40:32	@InfiniteKnot Can you DM me when you're around? I need to talk about migraines. Thanks, dear. Hope you're doing okay.

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-03 02:39:40	@patientanon Moreover, I have things worth stealing in my Locker.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-03 02:37:13	@tablopublishing Thanks for the RT @whoever. This was saved in my Drafts. Let's say 5W's and the H?
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-03 02:34:45	Break in to the Locker Room of my building. It was an "Inside Job." (cue Movie Trailer.) Nothing stolen from mine. Except the lock. Curious.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 12:33:39	Should try and sleep. Emphasis on try! But here is the love part of my love/hate relationship with Big Pharma!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 12:30:43	Never mind that past business. Can work with #SUDEP and my own instincts. Things I found here make me happy. Just scared at first. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 12:03:58	Dammit! Did I experience #SUDEP so briefly and recover. OD 2011. Stuff I found in the apartment today I thought I threw out! #PTSD #Valium
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 11:53:59	I'm going to choose silence, no stimulation for current #PTSD I need to clear my stupid head.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 11:48:49	From Dance now to Depressing Music? Funny how #PTSD works that way. Or silence. Although that can be REALLY BAD.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 11:38:36	And now, to conclude our Dance Party appropriately, "Save The Last Dance For Me" by The Drifters.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 11:26:29	Sometimes there's so much you want to say but it's better to have a gag tied around your mouth. For everyone's sake.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 10:30:35	@D8Iveta I also must say poor Etta.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 10:28:50	@D8Iveta Coming up next is "Miss You (Illicit Remix)" Etta James from US Series of QAF. Musical Head Explosion! Reply again! LOL!

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 10:16:53	@doc_rob I thought it would be a Llama Vouging!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 10:00:21	@doc_rob "...Rita Hayworth gave good face..."
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 09:51:12	@doc_rob Can Vogue like a MAD MAN!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 09:49:24	I'll be dressed in ALL BLACK. Of course! *swish and finger snap again* Come on children. We can ALL Vogue.
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 09:46:09	Just found the perfect hat for my Doctor's Appointment tomorrow. My GP doesn't know I've dyed my hair red! *snap* She'll LOVE IT! *snap*

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 06:53:34	@douleurnocturne A lot of things are repetitive due to derivation from Latin and Greek. Still, I highly recommend it!

16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 06:23:25	Perhaps I can find it somewhere to buy again for the charger. *feels sick to stomach*
16253011	patientanon	2016-02-01 06:21:05	Fuck I thought I lost special gift from someone in Oz. Needed charger. Threw out charger because thought gift lost. Very unhappy. Very.

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-29 09:52:02	@PurpIeObsession Yes, it's so hard and painful. I have known so many people via my Blog and Twitter who do use Twitter alone so it's fine.

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 23:59:16	@PurpIeObsession That's why nobody voted on mine.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 23:58:12	@PurpIeObsession Just offhand, I didn't see your poll because of phone problems but I would have. Check your Settings for Polls On.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 23:54:57	@PurpIeObsession I love this Account!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 10:08:03	@dazzgiveaway Oh, I love a good url that has the words "foragametrick" in it! bot bot bot #bot
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 10:04:20	@dazzgiveaway Tell me what you think of that?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 10:03:56	@dazzgiveaway I'm Anonymous on Twitter. So how about I put in my Twitter information, and if I win, I will give you my personal information.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 10:00:27	@dazzgiveaway My favourite colour is a classic NO COLOUR phone. They're ugly. So anything BUT colour!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 09:57:04	@dazzgiveaway Sure! Put me in your magic hat, then draw my name!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 09:54:06	I'm doing so much laundry right now I'm developing an allergic reaction to detergent. Sign: Blurry vision. Can't see money making you broke.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 09:43:38	@BrassGoblin If you like this Tweet sooooo much, then Follow me back!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 09:41:28	@BrassGoblin *jumps on your back and climbs on your shoulders mussing up your hair* It's okay. I'm tiny and don't weigh much.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 09:35:51	@BrassGoblin That's it. Being such a damn Troublemaker, just like you? I'm practically your twin? You get a Follow, Dinky Dong!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 09:31:52	@WIND_Cares Back to the store? Don't want to have to buy a new phone. I can't afford it! But this one is going fast!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 09:30:21	@WIND_Cares Repetitive Notices or from the past. Kind of need regular/future! Just not sure of anything. I'll tinker some more?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 09:27:17	@WIND_Cares Thanks. I appreciate that. The gent in the store assured me everything would be fine. Another big thing is Calendar Storage.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 09:24:17	@tablopublishing Thanks for the RT @veyloivergidi11
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 09:18:59	@BrassGoblin Troublemakerrrrrrr...
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 07:31:58	@Zinquefty I can try and clear data but have with other backgrounds. It just comes back automatically. So pissed off @WINDmobile
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 07:29:27	@Zinquefty *want* Only 5S so compatible with current OS maybe @WINDmobile will start getting upgraded iPhones. What's yours?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 07:26:56	@Zinquefty in background. Now losing almost all space and Twitter slow. Clearly battery fucked. Ironically @WINDmobile selling iPhone now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 07:24:32	@Zinquefty I only have a few Apps on my phone and I moved some that my phone would let me but not huge. And DON'T run constantly
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 07:21:52	@Zinquefty You've got Timeline, Follows and it runs at startup. Thus, no option for SD. Phone won't let me do it and others.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 07:19:15	@Zinquefty I figure because they're constantly running. I think Twitter is a big problem because pictures, videos etc even though not my own
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-27 07:17:07	@Zinquefty Basically 5GB Internal Storage. Put in SD to yay! No yay. Can't move Apps except a few taking up MASSIVE space.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 14:25:54	I don't think I'll ever know but it keeps pulling at me!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 14:24:33	But what about before and I could go on and on... terrible what it all produced, then disproved via my subconscious.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 14:21:50	Complex partial mostly and had outside in winter missing clothes. VIVID things mind. VERY personal. Dreams in comas I was in one when found.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 14:16:33	Several years ago. OD. Coma. Ictal asystole (aka SUDEP.) Pretty rare for spontaneous recovery but some things don't fit. #epilepsy

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 12:01:09	@Zinquefty But tired so was going to email you later.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 12:00:21	@Zinquefty Also, my phone is fucked up. I wanted to talk to you about that actually. Was just going to email. SPAZ Brains in sync.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 11:58:14	@Zinquefty It's got a line out antenna so if the signal gets unclear occasionally, move it around a bit.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 11:48:07	Mmmm...okay. @timomaaslive Let's try that. CD "LOUD."
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 11:41:31	Okay. BOSE Static damn antenna. I can't stand static noise period. #Aspergers Now what the hell do I play?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 11:37:29	Thanks as well for the Like @tablopublishing This seems to have been a pretty good Tweet!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 11:16:26	Hello my @BrassGoblin Thanks for showing up and giving me a Likey too! Troublemaker. *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 11:12:52	Ahhh...now for some interesting crossover what the fuck or just groovy shit you've never heard of on #CBC Radio 2. Groovy now. Chill...
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 11:02:34	Thanks for the Likes @JukePopSerials @DigitalDeron @KalvinFadakar Much appreciated!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 10:48:16	Now, where's my bottle and where's my ink! Or would that be more than one bottle! Pour! Pour! Pour me more! #amwriting #writing
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 10:40:01	Sometimes becoming exhausted by throwing yourself into the abyss is worth it. #amwriting #writing #exhausted
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 06:13:09	@douleurnocturne
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 06:11:07	@douleurnocturne I agree. What we were taught in school was the real thing! It would take you straight to France!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 06:09:09	@douleurnocturne I would probably be fine. Hmmm. Send you .mp3? LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:57:26	@douleurnocturne Are you kidding me? Our entire Country makes jokes about the Québécois and how they sound vs. Parisienne which is proper!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:53:07	@douleurnocturne You need a good ear so I guess that transferred over to languages.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:51:20	@douleurnocturne It probably comes from singing as a child into my adult years. I don't anymore but range First Soprano to First Alto.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:46:50	@douleurnocturne I also have a stutter so it might come out when nervous! But I can pronounce words from other languages well too.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:44:24	@douleurnocturne Would I sound cute? My pronunciation is very good so I could read out loud. But I would lose everything when nervous.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:33:42	@douleurnocturne *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:32:03	@douleurnocturne Thanks again for the Like. Almost dying laughing I wrote that. Apologies to all Québécois! But you know we joke about you!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:27:40	@douleurnocturne Thanks. I was having all sorts of films running through my head when I wrote that.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:25:51	@douleurnocturne *says Merci beaucoup quietly* Thank you. I suppose I do see the world differently. Sometimes?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:22:52	@douleurnocturne Thanks for the RT again! *laughing more*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:20:48	@douleurnocturne Then, we have the Québécois in Canada where I am. They sound like they're Pirates barfing. I was taught Parisienne.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:13:03	@douleurnocturne The "Chere" might have come out thinking I was in New Orleans. They sound a different, fun French!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:10:41	@douleurnocturne *grins* I read your profile but having no gender is fine. Some may get pissy like those being Asexual. Be who you want!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:06:02	@douleurnocturne That's why your Tweets might help. When I read French I can string some things together! x
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 05:03:52	@douleurnocturne Out of all three comprehensions; speech, hearing and reading, the best that has stayed with me is reading.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 04:59:53	@douleurnocturne Merci, mon chere. I even gendered it nicely for you? Oui ou non. Fucking gendered languages!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 04:56:51	@douleurnocturne Thanks for the RT! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 04:55:37	Someone just called me and left me a VM. I don't know the number. Go away. I'm not interested in your petty words and nauseating drivel.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 04:49:24	@douleurnocturne Thanks for the Follow. I'll try to keep up avec le francais. Lost mine years ago. Maybe this will help me get it back! x
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 04:44:13	@nrmcfarland Oh, Twitter smoking Crack again? The favourite came from @himulodaya Well, thanks to both of you because I can't see correctly!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 04:23:21	@nrmcfarland Thanks for the Like. Something told me you had done work in that area! I'd love to do language dub. Or dub for anything!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 04:20:35	I love making calls and being placed on ignore for hours. Currently doing so.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-26 01:18:53	@D8Iveta And Nashville gets Bombed! But with Great Dancing!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-25 23:46:40	Whoa! REALLY crazy person on Accessible Transit picked up after me! Almost came to blows with driver! Thought I'd be late but here now
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-25 23:27:50	Thank god finally above 0°C! Not by much, plus wind chill. So today -5°C. Been stuck at -17 or colder forever! Good for my appt. right now!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-25 23:12:53	@nrmcfarland Hey there! Thanks for the Follow. How are you? Have you ever worked with Anime in Film? I love it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-25 23:01:44	Thanks for the Like @phil500 I took a nap and when I woke up, it was dark. So it's quite possible I did wake up in another country. Hmmm...
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-25 04:55:12	@CarryGorney Thanks for the RT. Ironically, I tried the other day and it didn't work. Don't even think it's in my Settings!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 16:41:56	@D8Iveta Actually, I could go on and on about Lanz for Contemporary and Ballet? Nyman? Heh. Now he's something!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 16:29:07	Nighty all. Wee PA needeth sleepeth.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 16:27:37	Although, I am so tired, I just might wake up in another country?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 16:23:11	Okaaayyy. You know what they say about insomnia. Nothing stimulating (or over.) Tunes off even so lovely. Meds. Get warm. And...? Be quiet.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 16:18:40	I should try and sleep. Count down to sunrise? Or maybe sunset in another part of the world, where my brain has shot off for months.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 15:41:51	@beyondxbrokenx Thanks for the Like @marcellobar1
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 15:38:04	@D8Iveta Have you ever used that piece for dance? Would you ever choreograph a movement of dance using it? I think it would be awesome.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 15:34:53	@D8Iveta Hi. You must know of David Lanz? Finger Insurance! Cristofori's Dream. I love and Cristofori believed to have invented the piano.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 15:17:51	@beyondxbrokenx Funny. Perfect timing for me to pry open and old box right now. Well, not pry. Gently try to open? Might get nothing. Okay.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 14:38:25	@beyondbrokenx Excellent! I did Unfollow, then did a quick Follow back, as again, a problem on my end? But nuffink.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 14:32:07	@beyondbrokenx
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 14:21:03	Gawd. Gah. You sure can't help falling in love with anyone but a bloody #LDL One threatened me with a fake lawsuit for sending gifts. Sad.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 14:16:08	If you're in a #LDL just toss it. They have a 99% success rate. I've been in five to whatever degree and trust me. Complete insanity.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 14:01:35	My favourite song by @APOPLOVESYOU "Moment of Tranquility." Really complicated breakup song but so melodic and different from other work.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 13:44:49	@mattarmitage BOO! I have red hair now gloomy. Send me an email when you can?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 13:41:58	@Bodd23 Great. Thanks a lot.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 13:40:33	HA! I just said I DARED people not cry if they have never heard "Song To The Siren" by Dead Can Dance. No. By This Mortal Coil. #tiredgoth
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 13:11:58	Well, there's always music...
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:59:40	@beyondbrokenx Bugger! Still can't see, but your personal seems fine. I can try my own uninstall etc. See if that helps.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:57:02	@beyondbrokenx Hey! You can see me now! I was wondering if there was a weird disconnect.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:55:22	@JennyBoooo97 @beyondbrokenx *pours Sake all around*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:54:09	@JennyBoooo97 @beyondbrokenx And definitely! Come join in on the party. I'm having some Sake on my own now!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:52:46	@JennyBoooo97 @beyondbrokenx Thanks for the Like. I missed my g in there but I'm a bit tired.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:48:52	@JennyBoooo97 @beyondbrokenx Thanks! I think I'll go join #Twittersmokinkincrackonheroinandoxycontinplusloadsofbooze now though. Jesus! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:45:09	Okay. Seriously needs the fix later. No more of #Twitteroncrackheroinandoxycontinplusloadsofbooze
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:41:38	@beyondbrokenx and apparently nobody can see me here... problem on my end? bbbbbbbbb......
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:39:48	@beyondbrokenx can't see them... psycho PA...losing it...
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:38:33	@beyondbrokenx can anyone see me here?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:36:54	@beyondbrokenx can you see me?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:31:26	@CorinaBecker Great! That means I'm not smoking Crack like Twitter is.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:26:40	Is anyone seeing my Tweets?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:14:40	*throws mobile across room*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:11:43	I'm too #fuckingtired to deal with #Twitteroncrack right now. Get on yer bike!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:08:51	Oh, man! Please do not let ME have to uninstall and reinstall to fix this? AGAIN?! #Twittersmokingcrack
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:04:16	@beyondbrokenx I'm not getting a response from you. Anyone else reading, can you see me here?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 12:01:37	@_believein_you_ You're welcome!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 11:55:52	@beyondbrokenx Fuck!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 11:40:41	@PurpIeObsession are you getting my Tweets on your other Account?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 11:38:58	@beyondbrokenx A dumb question if you're not, but are you getting my Tweets?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 11:28:57	@beyondbrokenx just make a regular tweet.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 11:28:17	@beyondbrokenx I'll even put on my magic Techie Gloves for typing and scrolling in cold weather when the touchpad can't get your heat!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 11:24:49	@beyondbrokenx Tweet again.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 11:23:30	@beyondbrokenx Okay I need to try this or do an uninstall and that whooey because I can't see. Harrumph. Don't worry hon.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 11:20:41	@beyondbrokenx Nobody would Unfollow you! Tsk tsk.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 11:00:41	@PurpIeObsession I keep scrolling down so I guess yes?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 10:50:01	@beyondbrokenx Twitter Support is basically non-existent. Sorry? My experience? I still say uninstall and then just add yourself back.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 10:44:58	@beyondbrokenx Think of it this way. If you're worried about loss of things, you don't have anything to lose by trying. Pardon the pun.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 10:42:07	@beyondbrokenx Did you try my uninstall and then just re-add your Accounts like I suggested? It fixed my problems and nothing was lost.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 06:55:15	I can always listen to some cassettes on my yellow Sony Sports Walkman! Yes, I have one. #geek
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 06:51:04	Can't do it via my BOSE. Tired. Would be nice to listen to some of my vinyl. Or what's left of it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-24 06:49:11	Not sure if I can carry up a Micro Stereo System in Storage with my cane. Strong enough, just awkward. Should be fine amp for old turntable.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-23 06:44:07	@isseynfarran Good to have you back this year. Like there was ever a doubt? See you when you get to my area.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-23 06:16:03	@D8Iveta Thanks again for the Like. All you need now is a carrot and some little ears! Stay warm. Oh. Maybe not that warm.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-23 05:00:51	I must be having "a day." *laughing* Head+Pillow=Still Crazy. Lying down...
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-23 04:58:23	I don't care if any NTs or other crazies think I'm totally overboard, super whacko, she's contagiously crazy and more. I really don't.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-23 04:52:23	@D8Iveta Thanks for the Like. It was just so cute and what immediately popped into my head. I forgot and should have added this!

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-23 04:44:38	Can't believe how much I'm sleeping. Underlying medical issues still to solve, but with physical work a lot of psychological. Slow. Down.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-23 04:39:36	@KoraLovelaceArt Thanks for the Like, hon. Now I have to familiarize and take in all your work. Then come back with questions!

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 09:15:16	@bestofgoth @GothicDressCode I saw your Tweet about genderbend. I was going full Andy Warhol for my dahling @samwhatisit
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 08:47:25	I'm so tired, I can't see. Gah. *reaches for sunglasses* I might have a problem that's pretty bad. Need to speak to Neuro Eye Professional.

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 08:34:34	@PurpIeObsession Thanks for the Like. Or should I say Love? 'Cause I love ya babe!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 08:29:08	@ComeBacks2016 @twitter @DentzelDomain @ginger @delbius Not sure about problem with your Account but word domain in it? Thinks a website?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 07:36:31	Uh, I have have people out there. Notifications and...Twitter! Harrumph! Oh, the time too! The cuckoo in my head didn't pop out!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 06:56:41	@WINDmobile And yet, I'm using my middle finger to type now! Maybe it's the expensive brand. Get what you pay for! Or, find on street!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 06:52:12	@WINDmobile Ironically a typo but auto correct. You also need to remember design. Longer fingers used more for larger screens.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 06:48:46	@WINDmobile Okay. Lot of people saying they don't work on touchscreen. Got mine out and work fine. Must have gone fit.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 06:43:31	@WINDmobile Totally! I found some brand new ones on the street and it was like winning the lottery! Great Name. Online they cost $50!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 06:29:49	Wow! My Poll from yesterday has FOUR HOURS left and NO Votes! I guess I really suck, huh? Dumb question? I didn't think so.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 05:53:42	Okay, tea break from work. Then work break from Twitter, or Twitter break for tea. I haven't made it yet. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 05:50:39	@beyondxdarkness What version/App of Twitter are you running? Mobile phone, computer, Mac PC?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 05:47:44	@beyondxdarkness Add accounts etc. and it might take a tad, but everything should come right back. Almost reverse of my issue!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 05:45:45	@beyondxdarkness You can still see your Follow Folks so YOU are not gone. Do what I did. Uninstall Twitter App. Start from fresh.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 05:43:11	@beyondxdarkness Remember how I kept losing all my Notifications and Tweets from people coming in? Yours has gone poof?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-22 05:35:43	@beyondxdarkness I wrote this long Tweet to try and help but apparently I can't use TwitLonger. Not in Settings? I think I know what to do.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-21 12:26:42	@AdviceToWriters So true. Even if it's only a single word. #amwriting #writing #poetry
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-21 11:20:20	Do you think Tim Burton is overrated or not?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-21 10:18:43	@AdviceToWriters Rather confusing to "Write What You Know" and/or Memoir. Unless something dredged up via subconscious? #amwriting #writing
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-21 09:19:13	If punctuation is a problem and especially with commas, read your sentence out loud. #amwriting #writing https:// twitter.com/AdviceToWriter s/status/689975733670686720 …

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-20 04:23:14	I used to say so often in the past, "What am I?" But the right question is, "Who am I?"
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-20 01:47:03	Maybe a rest day today. Distressing. I'm not as physically strong as I used to be from being so sick over the years. Swollen, bruised arm?!

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 12:06:37	@n8wachT Oh! One more thing twoo. I'm a red Lemur now! Dyed my hair.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 11:53:06	@n8wachT I've worked with him on projects, research. We're good friends.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 11:43:50	@n8wachT That Blog Post was kind of funny. Reminded me of some of the ones I've written in the past. I know Jerod too. Have for years.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 10:57:39	@miriamyvega Thanks for the Follow but I have to tell you. Madness! Suggested Follow after I Followed you was Scientology. Okay...unless...?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 10:50:46	@PurpIeObsession YOU CAN DO IT!!! WHOO HOO!!!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 10:49:04	@n8wachT Thankies. I was thinking too. How funny is it that both Owly and Lemur live in trees and prefer to hang out there a lot. Just sit.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 10:45:13	@PurpIeObsession But could be wonderful like mine! Therapy takes time. Not an Olympic Sport! But it's so worth doing! Trust me!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 10:42:12	@PurpIeObsession I'm in Therapy too. Just don't push. Start out by just getting a "feel" for the person. If not so right, another one.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 10:38:39	@PurpIeObsession I can't be with you there in person but I'll be there with you in spirit. I'm so proud of you! You'll be okay. I promise.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 09:32:00	@n8wachT Did you think that would ever change about Lemur? Owly and Lemur have met before. *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 09:25:47	@n8wachT Okay will Twit TwooDoo. Probably after Laundry Insanity when I can take a break and flop!

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 09:14:48	ICE CUBE LAUNDRY! The room is freezing so you have to dry everything twice! Unless you put one sock in a machine. *fuming unlike dryers*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 09:05:10	@n8wachT No Owly. Lemur wasn't worried. Just wanted to say hi. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 08:19:24	@CarryGorney And I should be using Twitlonger. I totally forgot it existed even though I did use it before. *crosses eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 08:13:07	@CarryGorney Thanks for the RT!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 07:45:30	I'm now doing laundry very carefully. I don't want the Great Pyramid of Giza to fall.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 07:38:10	Gave myself huge slash on left forefinger with a Box Cutter. Now that it's starting to heal and cover up, looks like Great Pyramid of Giza.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 04:47:40	Oh, right. Sunglasses for damn near everything. Must make appointment with GP. Need to discuss "Mystery" #TBI some more. And other crap!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 04:43:12	My body is telling me I need to stop doing so much physical, and bright eye work (sunglasses!) Break. Now.

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-19 00:53:55	@n8wachT ou'e? How are are you? Lemur.

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-18 07:31:23	Don't let a paper cut stop you from #writing if you're doing it old school. Okay. Now I'm just being completely silly; totally ridiculous.

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-18 06:15:07	@alphabetania So how are you doing?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-18 06:14:36	@alphabetania So it's not used here. If someone, a Psych or Neuro #writing forget it. But I'm a writer so I NEEDED a good word!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-18 06:11:38	@alphabetania I was taking #Depakote and going out of my mind. So in my #writing then, I pulled that out because of my brain exploding! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-18 06:07:25	@alphabetania HEY!!! So good to see you! Since there's been a lot of talk going on for #amwriting #writing for me I found it in my notes.

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-18 05:17:00	New Writers start out and don't know a lot of pitfalls and traps that can hurt both THEM and their writing futures. Sad. #amwriting #writing
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-18 05:13:49	I think I'm trying to say is no Vanity Publishing, not knowing if a House is Reputable and more is SO important! #amwriting #writing
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-18 05:01:42	I might be wrong about self-publishing, then acceptance for your work. But in Canada I know through Professional System. #amwriting #writing
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-18 04:53:52	Again you might not like me saying it, but self-publishing period is a direct way to have any Reputable House say no. #amwriting #writing
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-18 04:44:29	A lot of people aren't going to like me for saying this re: #writing #amwriting Don't self-publish on Amazon. It's considered Vanity.

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-16 06:39:06	I'm actually kind of wondering if I could go to a couple of long term inpatient treatment places for #addiction Illegal? Breaking Rules?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-16 06:32:24	However, with so much other work at home, other things, I'm overdoing it. Slept all day and night after appt. Start of getting sick? Yes.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-16 06:29:40	I was up so late researching places for inpatient treatment for #addiction Things are finally looking more promising.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-16 06:25:52	I was having Shiatsu done. My right hip rotation, perfect. Left was a rock. A couple of needles, bit of time. My left almost spun off body!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-16 06:22:16	I found a place at a hospital does majority Neuro. Acupuncture for #addiction SO excited! I was skeptical about Acupuncture. Until...what?!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-16 06:11:52	Sick so can't do much. Trying to stack Dominos to make them all fall in a row. It's hard! Or maybe I just need to wash my kitchen floor.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-16 03:45:16	@GothicDressCode @bestofgoth Thanks! Just proves you can always "do it!"
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-15 11:38:18	@bestofgoth @GothicDressCode How cool when you can go out, still looking wicked in a ball cap and dirty clothes? People loved it last night!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-15 10:08:30	Here is a lovely word @WordCanteen and @AdviceToWriters Gedankenlautwerden
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-15 10:01:55	@Kim_Pilkington Hello Yoshi. Manners are extremely important. Farewell, Dr. PA.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-15 09:59:46	@Kim_Pilkington I have a strong base in Neurology, Psychology, Medications and such. I sound like I'm writing a miniature CV or Resume.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-15 09:55:37	@Kim_Pilkington I was going to enter the field of Medicine and their is a huge joke on my Blog of calling me Dr. PA.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-15 09:53:25	@Kim_Pilkington Hello. I'm not a Doctor so I can't give you an official diagnosis of Asperger's but I can talk to you about it.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-15 09:49:16	@beyondxdarkness x
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-15 09:48:36	@_believein_you_ Hey, we all Tweet in whatever kinds of moods we're in. We say whatever. I can act totally arsey! So you're not alone.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 15:17:47	Meds. Quiet. Think of journals I have to shred. Read them enough. Person gone from my life for good, so why hang on to my words about it?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 14:50:21	@_believein_you_ Oh! You're welcome! I saw that Tweet you put up and it made me me feel so sad.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 14:16:44	Nothing like "All Mine" by Portishead to listen to when you're using your new Paper Shredder to nuke your journal about your ex-partner!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 13:53:31	I never slept with any of them but how many people have I taken home, both of us drunk, just to lie on my bed and listen to music.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 13:47:49	@beyondxdarkness But please know that it doesn't make you a "bad" person. That's impossible and denies all logic. You are good.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 13:44:51	@beyondxdarkness You're human. It's okay. You don't have to apologize. We all have emotions. They can feel all sorts of ways.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 13:42:05	If you like music where you bake out? You MUST own the K&D Sessions. If not, you are banned from baking out. FOREVER.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 13:29:34	@beyondxdarkness Sometimes that's a really good thing to do, or even the best thing to do. It's even physically healthy, luv.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 13:19:08	I just bought a new watch that runs on Atomic Time! Bounce! Signal to Electronic Land, no ping, wait...let me have a bit to recalibrate.

16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 08:47:51	@InfiniteKnot Not that I'm making excuses. It's just the reality of the situation. I wouldn't be looking for Rehab if I could quit on my own
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 08:45:40	@InfiniteKnot Plus finding one with proper medical care. I'm having to do all the research in finding ones on my own.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 08:43:31	@InfiniteKnot I know my GP will be happy with the reduced drinking. It's just difficult as there are long wait times for long term Rehab.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-13 08:30:13	@InfiniteKnot True enough. But the most important thing is you have to keep trying. If you don't, you'll never have a chance.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-12 02:29:21	Waited 45min in -17°C for Accessible Transit to pick me up. Sure. Can't drive. Slammed on brakes so hard nearly threw me out of seatbelt.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-12 02:20:21	@Ascii211 Thanks for the Like, hon. How are you doing these days? We still have to get the damn Etching done, hey?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-12 01:27:10	As all else, we'll miss you Major Tom. Ground Control actually didn't stop hearing you. And we still left will never stop listening.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-12 01:19:35	@JustJingjing Thanks for the RT.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-12 01:16:37	@LePetiteNYC Thanks for the Like, Cutie.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-12 01:14:57	@InfiniteKnot I've cut down my drinking a lot. Maybe 1 or 2 a week? I'm feeling pretty good about it. A start? #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-12 01:12:18	@InfiniteKnot It was pure stress, my sleep schedule is completely backward. Sleep at 2:00am, up so late. But be proud? If you want to?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-12 01:08:56	@serialinsomniac @ms_molly_vog @nurse_showkat / Thanks for the inclusion as always, dear. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 14:57:10	Possible Departure https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/pos sible-departure/ …
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 13:31:02	BOOM! *silence* Guess I'll try and say something?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 13:12:02	I guess the best way you could describe my feelings about my Blog is that I have phantom limb pain?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 13:07:30	Thinking it might be time to retire my Blog anyway, folks. Just thinking. FYI.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 13:05:46	Patientunanonymous
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 13:04:22	I'm going to have to change my Blog name. One of top three in world.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 13:03:06	I'm tempted to tell you about our Pride Celebrations here but my location would be totally blown. Oops. I guess it is now! #gblt
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 12:55:01	@AliveinMe Good to see you too, doll! x
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 12:54:06	Oh, my Bipolar Rainbow Flag Memories. CRRRAAAZZZYYY. I "convinced" a gay guy he really wasn't. Bad move. Puppy love for me. Get away! SHOO!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 12:41:04	Nobody on earth would EVER remember bloody "Blue" by Eiffel 65 if it wasn't for the Iron Man Flick. Except me. Because I'm a dork.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 12:34:12	Thanks for the Like @wayoutosphere
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 12:31:56	Oops. I just lost my outerface. Regular Programming will resume shortly.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 12:17:28	Now my Mac is Gay Clubbin'! Come on everybody! You're missing out on the biggest party you'll ever find! And WHOO! WE partied! #gblt
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 12:02:09	If you know Crystal Castles or not? Canadian. I could listen to "Crimewave vs. Heath" (version) forever. #goth
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 11:52:21	Think I've learned how to twirl pen through all your fingers. I can't! No manual dexterity! Start slowly, bigger object. Using Apple Remote!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 11:31:00	Going through my Proud Canadian Playlist I made for some folks.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 11:04:17	Are there any Twitter Awards this year? I want "The Truth Award." Because everything I say is true. Otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 11:01:07	I got too excited because I found a missing keyboard button that had fallen off another old machine. Ironically called, "esc"
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 10:56:41	Oh, my goodness! Forgive my manners! I haven't taken my boots off in my own apartment!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 10:50:27	Home now. Time to drag out my old Mac that can still function as a stereo with a device input. Meaning, more music, too lazy for CD's.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 10:19:56	Thanks for the Like and RT @PainfulKnife
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 10:13:21	Time for a cigarette. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 10:12:01	Hey, at least you can say I'm med compliant! #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 10:10:30	I'm so awful! Trying to get into Long Term Rehab, forgot my afternoon meds, so now just washed them down with a White Russian. #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 10:03:52	@ThatKaz You too. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 10:00:52	@ThatKaz My GP and more importantly my Therapist know. So I'm covered. It's been a lifelong issue so it's not hard to "prove."
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 09:58:08	@ThatKaz Well, that's crap. We all know! But it's so hard to manage as it's a huge Trojan Horse in your head like any mental health issue.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 09:53:39	@ThatKaz Yes, that's the problem. When done... UGH. We all do for different reasons and diagnosis this, that. Apparently I have no problem.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 09:44:47	@ThatKaz Read about the ice cream. I starve but I've been binging on so much crap, and yeah...care? Should, don't, want? x
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 08:42:28	@LePetiteNYC I had some with dinner. Mew.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 08:21:21	@n8wachT The automatic nods, the verbal recognition from "the cool." I was bullied like hell as a kid! Looking "cool." Fuck that now.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 08:16:43	@n8wachT You know what though? As an #Aspie it's kind of freaky. I'm not used to people looking at me, turning heads.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 08:08:04	@n8wachT Oh, sleepy oeh. We never did trade pictures! Lemur. x
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 08:05:08	@n8wachT Oh, I just can't waaaiiiggghhhttt to see how the ID is going to turn out. Yours will probably better! eoh...
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 08:02:08	@n8wachT My (new) blazing red hair was not a problem. Neither was drinking. Had to take off glasses so couldn't see a damn thing!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 07:54:01	@Zinquefty Well, indeed the way to order it properly. Nay, say drink. But at home? Microwave Sake? THE HORROR!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 07:49:02	@Zinquefty Warm like soup. THE HORROR!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 07:48:03	@Zinquefty Rice,sobu,water?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 07:46:39	@Zinquefty Me too. And you KNOW I don't with my Beloved Bride Vodka. Could you imagine our Sake? O_o
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 07:43:21	Who knows what else I'm missing?! How many times have I done this? Plume again? I lost all my feathers! Seizemic? Riiiggghhhttt...
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 07:40:05	I think I have to completely reinstall #FuckingShittyTwitter AGAIN! No regular Tweets I've chosen from people anymore. Can't believe this.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 07:35:36	White Russians are best served without ice. No dilution of the alcohol. #yummy
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 07:32:25	Had way too much for dinner with friend. Gave my takeaway to a homeless man. #alwayshelpothers #kindness #losingallyouhave #hypocrisy
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 02:47:26	@missmayim Like you guys having fun isn't riddled with rhetoric. Cheers to you and all the Cast.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 02:45:02	@missmayim I was just having some fun with you last night. Thought it might make you laugh. Hope all of YOU GUYS had lots of fun last night!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-08 02:40:32	@n8wachT meoh! Yes! youh! Me! Wtf with the pic? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-07 12:36:26	@n8wachT Hey twoo. I forget what you say. Sorries! *pouts* twoo? Close? That's funny. I'll drink after? Or maybe before like you. #copycat
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-07 11:55:17	Well @missmayim you got it with the gang. Now if you all didn't win, I'd have to torture myself by watching EVERY Award Show until death.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-07 11:41:58	Gotta look all pretty tomorrow. Getting new Government ID. But I can't go overboard and really have fun. Alas. #goth
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-07 11:29:18	Heaven help me? When will the #PCAs end? I need to watch the screen on my window. Much more interesting.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-07 11:22:26	Conversely, do laundry across the street, slip on ice outside. Does it matter? Hit head on every hard surface period. #epilepsy #headinjury
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-07 11:18:16	There is flooding or WAY too much cleaning in our cold laundry room. The mopping is turning it into an ice rink. Fun times! #headinjury
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-07 10:36:35	@missmayim You can have my Fleece Spiderman Bankie. I'm actually cuddling up under it now. No, I am. Colourful too! Not like twisted glass.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-07 10:29:31	I don't like Celebrity Award Shows. I'm torturing myself in protest with the #PCAs @missmayim Has NEVER won! Not even nominated this year!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-07 06:43:36	I either have the worst sprain ever in my life, or I might have broken one or several metatarsals. Holy, ouch. Must see GP.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-05 03:00:39	Time to write the "Blood, Sweat and Tears To Do List." A movie first? Hide all pens while blindfolded? Burn all paper? Eyes open for that.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-05 02:44:33	@confusingaf Thanks Confusey. Just saw it when I signed on but Twitter has been confusing. Still, I'm pretty sure you sent this Like.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 06:39:34	One final item before the whole "Throw my Mobile Out my Window Thing." Make sure my window is open.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 06:33:11	One last thing before my mobile goes flying through my window like a bullet, "I BLAME GOOGLE!!!"
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 06:28:41	Those pictures and maybe others are supposed to be on SD Card but I can't find them. Maybe I deleted earlier? *defenestrates mobile*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 06:23:52	My battery died and my mobile did an Android update of my apps. Not abnormal but photos deleted in txt streams from people too. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 06:20:35	Now not getting regular Tweets from people marked within stream. *sighs* Try and "reboot" them. Putting in the SD card fucked things up.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 06:11:50	@ladygaga One thing I would have to say is lack of references to love between both genders. You might not feel it but listeners do? #gblt
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 04:53:09	@ladygaga I'm reviewing you. So much more creativity and attention to detail. I have a theatre background. Segue? Your ACTING is better LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 04:48:21	@ladygaga A lot of people will disagree of course, but you're a helluva lot more talented than Madge. Every way. Since birth!
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 04:02:29	I hope you caught my last hangtag @ladygaga #fencing I thought it was fun and even inventive? #iamawriter #amiabadwriter ?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 03:57:12	Yes, we all heard it. Was it #Madonna saying @ladygaga was "Mediocre at best?" Now that's just plain mean! #jealousy #fencing
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 03:26:50	I think I'll give Twitter an update just to make sure it's working properly. After watching some #LadyGaga videos.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 03:24:06	Thanks to my new Blog Followers if you can see this on Twitter. You've given me a glimpse of hope I shouldn't flush it down the crapper.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 03:19:23	@confusingaf Thanks for confusing me with your RT but it's okay because I get confused very easily. Writing that was even very confusing.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 03:12:20	@Zinquefty Tunes nothing, really. But I've already got all pics in files etc on my Mac so redundant. Get off gmail. More so old, just crap.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 03:07:58	@Zinquefty We can send everything from Android and PC straight to the sky for Mac Cloud. Email attachments like pictures? HUGE SPACE.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 03:05:53	@Zinquefty I gave up because I had no need for Thunderbird or a mac email address either at the time. Present? Need the mac account.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 03:03:45	@Zinquefty though. WAY before Cloud was part of our sky! Then was it IMAP not the way to go with Thunderbird. POP? Or vice versa.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 03:01:18	@Zinquefty in the past. I did both for Thunderbird on my Mac years ago as too fucked for a name@mac account. This is all in the past...
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-04 02:57:46	@Zinquefty First, Twitter has decided to kick in! I'm getting Notifications? Everything syncs to my phone. Period. I've tried IMAP and POP..
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-03 07:53:37	@Zinquefty All the shit's been put into folders, iTunes etc. anyway. *eyes close*
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-03 07:51:29	@Zinquefty I'm tired and it's going to take me about five years! Attachments can be 5386KB and regular emails themselves.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-03 07:48:50	@Zinquefty So little I could move. Screw extra space. So tackling email accounts and massive delete fest. Very, very, very, much later.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-03 07:42:17	@Zinquefty Like, Serious Pfft. MUCH LATER.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-03 07:40:36	@Zinquefty I think mine is my new SD Card. Can't move shit over. Background runs like Twitter. Might have to update every app. Pfft.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-03 07:30:43	Maybe I should say just as well Twitter is being quiet. Tired of messing with my phone.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-03 07:28:20	@Zinquefty I was talking about/for me. Not a peep from it for over 24-36hrs hours. So I thought a push by a Tweet.
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-03 07:23:56	Test. Did Twitter break AGAIN?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-02 02:21:37	Happy New Year to all. Even if you may not feel so happy, try to be good to YOU. Even I'm on the fence about 2016 but who knows? Open mind?
16253011	patientanon	2016-01-02 02:03:09	Happy New Year @isseynfarran I'm pretty sure you celebrate THIS Holiday.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-31 09:17:19	SO Techie Not Happy. Open to suggestions. Crashing now. Good pun.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-31 09:14:50	My new SD Card. Can't move larger apps for more memory on phone. Won't take running apps like Twitter! And others. Only background? Fuck.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-31 09:09:07	Thanks for the Like too @depressionklz I'm sorry for the sad face but we just have to try and work through it. Even though it's hard.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-31 09:06:44	@beyondxdarkness Thanks baby. We both get it, huh?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-31 09:04:15	More #BigBangTheory Marathon! It's not stopping and neither am my eyes!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-31 01:35:06	@fympsnews @thehumanruckus You're welcome!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 11:46:08	@scanman Thanks for the Like Vij'!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 11:42:26	My dinner I was invited to was postponed (again.) I hate making plans and then having them fall through! *bored*
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 11:39:25	The next step into my #Goth Past will be makeup, of course. Deciding that will be rather interesting, dare I say fun.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 09:00:11	In old Fave Cool Pub. Two cool guys said hi when we all walked in. I look shit. On mobile and interrupt to say bye. My new hair? ROTFLMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 07:18:40	Thanks for the Like @bellanatale2004
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 07:16:18	HAIR FIREBELL RED!!! SO FUCKING AWESOME!!! Better than before. Bleaching was the way to go. #Goth #Punk
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 05:00:40	@WIND_Cares Thanks! I must have misinterpreted it. Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 04:58:17	@WIND_Cares Yes, that's what I found out. Your original Tweet seemed kind of vague. That's why I checked it out.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 04:56:16	@WINDmobile Thanks for the RT @portOdin
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 04:53:45	@WINDmobile FYI Folks. The deal is $5 off per/mo. and only for new customers. I just got back from a WIND Shop.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 04:48:36	I'm actually sitting in the Salon reading "Cosmo." Other places offer you a glass of wine while you wait. ROTFLMAO!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-30 03:49:59	Off to Stylist. FIx my broken red hair? Another couple of things I forgot to tell her. Bleeds a bit with water and IMPOSSIBLE GRAY!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-29 23:33:55	@doc_rob HA!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-29 11:21:47	Thanks for the Like @devilmikey
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-29 11:17:13	@WINDmobile Thanks for the Like and I'll be sure to let you know!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-28 06:40:26	@Zinquefty And more money! But what can I do? Well, she has to see it first but regular cost is $100! She might drop it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-28 06:37:51	@Zinquefty Oh, yes. Going to see my Stylist to try and fix my hair Tuesday. All that red I lost. Going to have to bleach first though. Fuck.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-28 06:17:52	@Zinquefty Oh, yeah? Well, guilt is starting to weigh a bit heavy upon my shoulders now...I still have time...later..
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-28 06:11:35	@Zinquefty If you want, I'll stop watching it for you, but then I'll have to do work.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-28 06:06:29	@Zinquefty I know. We talked about your feelings for it. Different strokes for different folks? I've always loved it. *shrugs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-28 06:02:24	All Day Marathon of #BigBangTheory on TV. I am ignoring ALL the things I need to do. Oops. "Oops" my ass.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-28 05:58:03	@SIEDAHGARRETT Checked your Bio too. Nice! I see you wrote Spike and your future at Sundance here. Ever been to TIFF?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-28 05:46:54	@SIEDAHGARRETT Thanks so much for the Follow. Followed you back! Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-28 01:51:20	@WINDmobile I plan on hitting a shop in a couple of days. Like these folks and their concerns, you might want to make sure things are clear.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-27 03:37:13	Moreover why does it take such a slow amount of time for EVERYONE to fall out of airplanes when they lose cabin pressure? Death in seconds.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-27 03:30:48	Why is it in movies people can actually hang on to the Emergency Doors for just a little bit when airplanes lose cabin pressure?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-27 03:00:16	@beyondxdarkness But I'm ALWAYS loyal even if DO really step in it!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-27 02:58:52	@beyondxdarkness I have a big case of the Green Monster too. Even to the point of sabotaging relationships, myself. I can make a big mess.

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-27 01:56:58	Hello, pretty First Degree Burn! You're big and going be LOADS of fun to treat. Get to the drugstore fast! First Aid supplies running out!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-27 01:53:04	PAIN!!! I just spilled boiling hot tea on my hand. #coldwater #clumsy #INSOMNIA
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-27 01:29:08	@WordCanteen Lists are ALWAYS a good thing. I actually need lists for my lists!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-27 00:31:05	*dies*
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-27 00:30:21	Only 4 hours sleep last night. Pretty wobbly. My body doesn't know exactly where it is in space and time. #INSOMNIA
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-27 00:24:21	@TattedBikerChik I tried to leave a Comment on your Blog but *poof!* I'm so sorry honey but you'll get him. Love you. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 23:39:35	@bullfrogr @ItsJackOk @chatobstewart @unsuicide @The_blindman @JeffreyLBabbitt / Congratulations! Thanks for letting me know!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 23:37:40	@cheerfulamigo Thank you so much. I'm turning very red now, but thank you so much. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 11:39:00	Holy Cats. I'm so tired I think I'm gonna sleep in my clothes. How many days did we do that partying in uni? 364? 365 if a Leap Year.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 11:29:26	I had a bit too much Turkey. #tryptophan hurts my tummy. Blech. Why does Christmas always have to suck somehow? *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 11:26:25	Home now. Just how LONG do you stay for a Christmas Dinner with someone you REALLY don't know? I gave five hours a shot.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 08:00:19	My Mom said she was feeling lonely and depressed last night. However the best Christmas present she got was hearing from me today. Huh?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 07:52:31	Helping to cook Turkey Dinner with woman I'm visiting in my building. She's not very able bodied and in a lot of pain. #AlwaysHelpOthers
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 06:14:35	I got a black eye for Christmas. Reflex to grab something when falling to catch it? I don't recommend that with glass hitting the floor.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 06:10:45	@bellanatale2004 Thanks beautiful. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 06:09:36	And thankfully Mom kept the call in check. Or I did? She talks forever.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 06:08:04	Can you say showing up "Unfashionably Late?" Yikes! The woman upstairs might think I'm not coming at all. I did say I might sleep in though.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 05:31:28	Some Christmas time with a lady upstairs. Huge physical and mental issues (bigger than mine?) Bad joke. But we're both alone. She invited.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 05:25:55	Just woke up. SO late. NEED TEA!!! Must call Mom. She wanted me up but travel impossible.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 05:12:06	Happy Christmas All.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 04:46:01	Thanks for the Like @youdont86045045
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-26 04:43:38	@isseynfarran Thanks for the Like Issey.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 11:50:08	Friend or Foe, I haven't heard that shit for a while.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 11:48:54	Still here. Nice. Fun. I just want to relax. I was writing a Blog Post earlier but it wasn't for lolz laughs whatever. Just so you know.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 10:49:50	So on that note, Happy Christmas to all of you wonderful people AND dumbass fuckers. Hey. Equal inclusion, right?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 10:46:41	Ages since Egg-Schnogg. Friend gave me some with his own Rum (Canadian) Whiskey. See? Friends. Don't know if should be happy or angry now!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 10:30:50	Everyone has stepped outside. I'm running the bar!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 09:50:12	Hanging out in the pub. Closed with a few of us. OMFG! I'm talking to people I know! They all say I've been treated like shit. See? Friends?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 07:53:52	I'm going to change my Twitter Ringtone to "Smothered Hope" by Skinny Puppy.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 07:52:08	Further, I said I look like Queen Bitch now. I can't talk to all the people I know when I always did before! *sitting by myself maturely*
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 07:47:59	Other guy working now. HE and I are friends! Told him how I get "ushered" away from people. Guy said, "Nice Coach." He Coaches kids sports.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 07:44:07	At pub where told owner about being bullied? He said don't talk to anybody! Sit by yourself! You run around...! Nobody is your friend here!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 07:16:06	A VERY astute person I have been talking to noted my writing has changed from before. It is not that I have calmed down. Dissociation. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 07:02:16	@SketixED
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 06:40:02	@SketixED Of course about the personal. And thank you for trusting me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 06:37:36	@CalliCoop Thanks as always hon. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 06:36:12	@SketixED Nothing is TMI for me and I promise you can trust me. Really.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 06:32:24	@SketixED And screw whatever we call ourselves!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 06:31:39	@SketixED Will do!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 06:30:55	@SketixED Alright. Well, even still. If anything pops up, you know you've got the option!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 06:27:20	@SketixED Yes, I'd be happy to do that. However, #PTSD is not as simple as it is so often portrayed. We would need to talk via email.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 06:24:45	@SketixED Eventually you will arrive at a decision of some kind. You'll find an answer of some sort. The best is usually Blogging.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 06:21:24	@SketixED Just ponder the idea for as long as you need. Relax about it. Don't pressure yourself into a decision. Check out other writers?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 06:18:40	@SketixED And that could be a very good thing. Conversely, some people online might scare you to death! But if you're thinking about it?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 06:16:40	@SketixED It's really a choice of how comfortable you feel about it, and your own INDIVIDUAL choice. You can be inspired by others.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 01:50:03	Be back later. My ride is coming soon. Want to pay attention to everyone properly. Thank you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 01:47:58	@crazybeanrider Thanks. Irresponsible, Disrespectful, Scared She Wouldn't Love Me Anymore, Foolish...? Courageous?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 01:44:01	@SketixED Ah! Didn't see this! Thanks for the Like. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 01:42:23	@SketixED Oh, I've written on my Blog about my #PTSD and that. I even have a Category have it and my Blog is 9yrs old! No clue it survived!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 01:37:54	My GP then said because of it all, at least I know you a lot better. But in a sort of sad and upset way. I wonder how sad she is. We = Love.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 01:31:33	But then I told my GP not really like this though. You've asked different questions. About my #PTSD and trauma since I was a kid.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 01:26:29	She asked if I talked to my Therapist about all these things, helping me with my #PTSD and #DissiociativeAmnesia I said Yes! She's the best!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 01:21:51	I'd never told her about being raped, my #PTSD and how everything all works. Plus how my #Aspergers plays a role in things too.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-24 01:18:55	More courage? I asked my GP to do another test. HIV. #PTSD Flashbacks brought back rapes, untreated #Bipolar crazy sex. Test for Syph too.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 13:41:33	Stereo is trumping Alarm Clock. Shit.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 13:39:30	@onibagapp Age old expression I always haul out.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 13:35:42	@WordCanteen I've read it twice and just thinking of it now makes me want grab it immediately!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 13:33:36	@WordCanteen Thanks for the Like. You absolutely have to read it. It's a doorstop, massive. But I guarantee you'll love it!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 12:59:15	@WordCanteen Looking at my Bookshelf and just thought of you. Have you read "The Boomer Bible"
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 12:54:36	@Zinquefty I love you my friend. You always make me laugh and put an Asp smile on my stupid Spazzy Face.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 12:42:15	I will not censor myself but if only Twitter had a function where you could stare directly into my eyes. Then you could know me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 12:32:45	I often wonder if I Tweet about my mental, physical health, others too, they look at my Profile. Do they see that I have more to offer?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 12:16:29	Happy Christmas to you and yours @isseynfarran I'll just say it early. That is if you celebrate it. Many don't. If not, Happy to all.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 12:12:50	@ClaudiaBrucken1 Thank you very much for reading my many Tweets. I appreciate your time in doing so. All the best.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 12:09:18	@ClaudiaBrucken1 Pick up where pitch, chords, all things in stanzas before they're made. The best is at live concerts!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 12:05:22	@ClaudiaBrucken1 Told I could sight read at 7yrs. Wot? Range First Soprano to First Alto. Good ear? Can listen and raise my hand up, down.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 12:00:33	@ClaudiaBrucken1 Don't want to bother you too much but about singing. Most of my life but lost now. Although, join group and back quickly.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 11:42:49	@onibagapp Hey! Who are you callin' a Ho'!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 11:40:41	@SketixED I get so stupid with Likes for my Tweets sometimes. I get all spazzy and can't reply to thank people. Dumb, Arsey Fuck.

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 11:34:18	@ClaudiaBrucken1 You have an indescribable voice. Inexplicable! I don't know how you sing period, but all over with your Canon of Work!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 11:30:33	@ClaudiaBrucken1 Just listening to "a secret wish" and wondering if you'd be here. Voila! Loved you since and more you've done. 80' Goth.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 11:22:21	Oh, two minutes until a full battery charge! Can you feel the excitement!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 09:50:43	...and have some beer...
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 09:44:00	Excuse me while I take a break from Twitter while time for #BoomtownRats and "The Fine Art Of Surfacing" One of the best albums EVER made.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 08:52:28	@SketixED HAHA! I thought you gave me a Like.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 08:51:37	Thanks for the Like @onibagapp

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 08:48:07	@SketixED Thanks for the Like. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 08:46:10	@SketixED High point but then low points. Now okay but waiting for drug delivery so can go out. Prescription drugs.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 08:43:59	@SketixED Not bad. Got this HUGE Package from Community Centre here that helps people who have no money etc. for holiDAZE.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 08:40:32	Thanks for the Likes @medsharpe and @TrueAccountable
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 08:03:57	@DrAndyRoark They hardly believe me but when treating animals medically, so many things are used to treat humans as well. Done so myself!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 08:01:14	@DrAndyRoark Thanks again. I'm a total Med Geek but was going to enter Profession anyway. It's amazing when I tell people this.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 07:57:17	Trashed Immune System, WTF weight loss. Don't mind that! #EatingDisorders Fibroids... My body is a Train Wreck.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 07:53:21	That's even more than original tests for Liver Function, elevated related enzymes, Hep A, B, C. Ferritin in the basement for severe anemia.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 07:50:08	Have to see GP tomorrow. Seriously nervous. #Rehab New theory not episodes #TIA but Vasovagal Hypoglycemia. Identical Presentation.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 07:33:07	@SketixED So, how's The Weab'?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 07:24:53	
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 07:17:38	Oops. I just about took my sleep Med with my Divided Dose of others right now. That would not have been good.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 06:54:46	@beyondxdarkness I have nobody too. Maybe we could celebrate together online.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 06:42:08	Stupid family I had. Stupid X-mASS. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 06:40:40	I think I could give my sister an Olive Tree, but she'd cut it down straight so it would fall on me. I hate X-mASS. #PTSD
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 06:37:27	Last night when going to bed, an urge just hit me to txt her and say, "I love you." I haven't heard a thing back. I'm trying. Thanks, Sis'
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 06:34:40	They say in Rehab bring pictures of loved ones. I'm bringing one with nothing in it. Seriously. My sister and I are locking horns kicking.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 06:22:59	@beyondxdarkness XX
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 06:22:17	@beyondxdarkness Tried to talk to you via DM. Couldn't. Now Pending. Let me come back in the door if you want. Take time if you need.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 06:16:36	@beyondxdarkness I've just been trying to catch up here as I haven't been on Twitter. So running around, okay and... KILL!!! OH...
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 06:04:21	@beyondxdarkness I know this. The silence when in the throes of PTSD. You touch or don't, hug and cry or don't but just want them there.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 05:51:24	@DrAndyRoark Thanks for the Like. I just learned about that with a type of Parrot and it was seriously bad. Couldn't pass BIG egg. But okay.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 05:42:27	@beyondxdarkness I love you! You know that. You're not going anywhere without me!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-23 04:16:25	@DrAndyRoark It seems I've finally found a decent #Veterinarian To Follow on Twitter I mean. No need to call Aviary with a HUGE EGG I..Ahhh!

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-21 07:10:48	@Feeling_low @Quinonostante @fympsnews @patientanon / Thanks for the inclusion as always. And always in the "Adult" Section.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-21 07:05:12	And now I forgot I was published somehow in an online paper. I forgot to look at that so I will now. To cheer me up. Hopefully.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-21 07:02:12	I now feel like I'm a child growing up in my abusive household all over over again. I shouldn't have said a thing. Like growing up as a kid.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-21 06:58:53	Therefore, I do know people that are nice to talk to, even though I KNOW they are not my FRIENDS, but go sit in a corner in silence.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-21 06:56:13	He said I run around and talk to everyone too much. Don't try to make friends, nobody is your friend. So just sit and be quiet.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-21 06:54:14	I can't believe what I was I just told. Talked to owner of pub who always has my back about being shit on the other night.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-20 02:15:31	@Zinquefty Okay thanks. Where are you? Somewhere for Christmas?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-20 02:13:57	Aston Villa vs. Newcastle. 0-1 scored just now. Pouring rain! Almost going to call game but didn't. #BarclaysPremierLeague #BPL
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-20 01:52:01	@beyondxdarkness Yes. And it's happening EVERY day now. Inspiration...Total Deflation...Desperation...Complete Annihilation. Toss book away.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-20 01:39:15	@Zinquefty Take care. Rest well. And HAVE FUN!!! ox
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-20 01:35:02	@CanadaSoccerEN @Besiktas Congratulations Atiba on four times! I know another Footie Player who is of that rank so it's quite something!

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-18 11:11:02	Je suis fatigue. Fin.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-18 11:09:55	I watched him Tasered once. I tried to get into his apartment because I thought a familiar, safe face might help. Kicked out. Cops Suck.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-18 11:04:55	I'm just so overjoyed that HE admitted he was on good meds and they had kept him out of hospital for n long. My heart flew.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-18 11:01:29	I just want to cuddle up with him and hold him in my arms. He's so sweet. But physical boundaries. I know when I get too close and scary!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-18 10:58:59	Everyone here is awful. Think I'm batshit too but it took me ages to get close to him. Great talk about addition, both struggling.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-18 10:56:38	I'm even more happy about the party because a guy on my Floor came. Didn't think he would! Severe Schizophrenia. But on new meds!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-18 10:46:25	Actually, now bathroom.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-18 10:45:21	Building Party. Free food, alcohol. Just brought my last beer up to my apartment. Now...

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 10:50:08	@WINDmobile Wouldn't it have been hilarious if I lost my phone today?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 10:46:33	@WINDmobile @xPawnachu HEY! Good for you! Hope you enjoy! I'm sure you will.

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 10:31:22	@WINDmobile Wait. Your OWN phone. Sign up. YES. I knew that.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 10:30:10	@WINDmobile No but now I do. Ironically my phone needs service!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 10:27:20	@WINDmobile Yep
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 10:19:24	@WINDmobile @DelfTerry Congratulations!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 10:18:01	You're giving me a weird stare. Aren't you. That's all I won. Okay. I understand. https:// twitter.com/WINDmobile/sta tus/677310622145490944 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 10:15:13	Will you give me more than just a weird stare from someone on the street? https:// twitter.com/WINDmobile/sta tus/677310240489152513 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 10:11:58	@WINDmobile Thanks for the Like @youdont86045045 It's pretty much true.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 10:09:54	The only things I win are weird stares from people on the street, but let's keep trying. https:// twitter.com/WINDmobile/sta tus/677308695110373376 …

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 09:53:44	@crazybeanrider Thanks for the RT of my RT *laughing* Love your handle too! @WINDmobile
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 09:50:07	@WINDmobile @NACWatts And congratulations once again!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 09:46:08	@WINDmobile @NACWatts @Chrissyann12345 / I'm so tired. Not a direct Tweet. Thanks for the RT here!

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 09:38:54	@WINDmobile @ShawInfo @chinookgust Hopefully all will be good and not like my experiences!

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 09:18:43	@WINDmobile @ShawInfo The Purchase "might" even be a good thing? I sure hope so!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 09:13:32	@WINDmobile @ShawInfo I come back to say after some hopefully decent research and I think things will be okay.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 09:10:38	@WINDmobile @NACWatts Congratulations as the clock is ticking...
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 09:05:03	Okay! Let's do it! https:// twitter.com/WINDmobile/sta tus/677292464558985217 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 08:36:41	@WINDmobile @ShawInfo Shaw is from Western Canada and has been slowly expanding Cable TV East. Let's hope we'll be alright.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 08:34:30	@WINDmobile @ShawInfo From my perspective that is what they are doing with this acquisition. WIND also spoke of better service in BC.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 08:32:16	@WINDmobile @ShawInfo Depending upon where you live, it is roughly on par with Rogers Cable. Now they are moving to mobile service.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 08:29:38	@WINDmobile @ShawInfo Let's hope this will be a good thing for existing WIND Customers as Shaw is a very large Corporation.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 08:26:59	@WINDmobile @ShawInfo Like some others, some concerns with Takeovers. It is possible A LOT can change. Personal Professional Experience.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 07:59:34	"I have become uncomfortably numb..."
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 07:50:33	@LePetiteNYC Thanks. I'm sure the two of us could come up with more. Wordplay should be an Olympic Sport. Fucking, deaf IOC.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 07:47:22	Okie Dokie WIND! https:// twitter.com/WINDmobile/sta tus/677273450101276672 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 07:46:06	@LePetiteNYC Although I suspect that's already taken for something else. *huge eyeroll*
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 07:44:02	@LePetiteNYC WarStars?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 07:38:51	Okay, I'll still try! https:// twitter.com/WINDmobile/sta tus/677269771440824320 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 07:29:27	@WINDmobile Hey guys. Looks like I have to leave your Celebration as per your Agreement. I have a Math Learning Disorder. You time it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 04:08:44	Then wrote I was crying and said oh, whatever! Let's talk on the phone. You can be home, I'm too sick to go out. But out of TP. Shit. Haha.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 04:05:16	I started talking about what was going on. Felt guilty for taking up her time (gee, fear, denial about going to rehab?)
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 04:02:50	Sent email to my Therapist to ask how kitty was and thinking of family. She got back, thank you. Need Session still? Next mid-Jan. Month.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-17 03:36:56	Thanks for the Like @CrownJwlz
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-15 08:57:16	@CalliCoop Oh! I get it! Awesome!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-15 04:16:19	I can look all dead and ghastly with drugs placed all around me. Talk all whacked out. I already do that last one. Okay. No more of this.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-15 04:12:28	I want to be on it so I can get a beautiful, cushy Rehab Facility that I NEED so much right now! Fly me to a gorgeous place. Pfft.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-15 04:08:39	The TV show "Intervention" is always the same story over and over again but with some differences here and there. Is the show scripted?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-15 04:04:53	Now I'm going to watch the TV show "Intervention" to keep reminding me what a mess I am. I'm curious about the show though. Seems odd.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-15 04:00:58	@CalliCoop Oh yeah? Don't know it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-15 03:59:24	@ptsdawareness29 You should have just read my last Tweet! I forgot to put to write it #PTSD See HIV in it and the one after?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-15 03:55:33	Some of those "issues" I couldn't help. Yes. Being raped. I think I'll be okay.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-15 03:53:43	Appt made with GP. She's worried about my Liver so all sorts of tests up to Hep A, B, C. PTSD Flashbacks. Several "issues" but add HIV.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 10:43:44	Just for kicks lied down on white pillowcase for a bit after washing now. Bits of red! I'm seeing red right now!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 10:40:41	Stylist never called but best to go and show her. Maybe we can dye it over but with less time? Don't think we'd have to strip and redo! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 10:35:38	Oh for god's sake! I'm still bleeding red! My dyed hair that is. There was still some black dye from my last cut. Needed more time and goop?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 07:57:34	@D8Iveta Hi. What do you think about Figure Skating and dance? Can you skate?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 07:28:22	@CalliCoop Plus all our joking and laughing at the world and so much stupidity in it!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 07:27:01	@CalliCoop Thanks hon. I really appreciate that. And all the support you've given me in the past. It hasn't gone unnoticed or forgotten.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 06:24:28	@Zinquefty I'm watching the Men's Final right now and there's also a term mentioning, "Crotch." Who knew #Curling could be so sexy! Nice...
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 06:10:08	@TeamJJonesCurl What do you guys think about this? #Curling
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 05:52:49	@Zinquefty "Harder, Hard, Straight Line, Look Up, YEAH, GOOO!!! *sighs* Good one..." I rest my case. #Curling
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 05:42:14	There's nothing worse than when you turn on your TV and your neighbours hear nothing but "Go! Go! Harder! Hard!" not knowing it's #Curling
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 05:32:02	Speaking of sick animals, are there any #Veterinarians out there? I'd be interested in reading/Following you. Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 05:22:49	@Canageek Yes. Veterinary Medicine can be a lot like Human!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 05:20:57	@Canageek But she was having a bloody awful "prolonged CVA!" I had to let her stop suffering.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 05:18:52	@Canageek I had to take one of my babies there for her heart. Had her on Nitro and Oxygen with a kitty sized cannula if you can believe!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 05:16:25	@Canageek I know! I'm waiting to hear back to see if she's okay or any word. Hope kitty doesn't have to go to ONE place here.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 05:11:12	OH NO!!! My Therapist's kitty got hit by a car!!! Just emailed me as appointment tomorrow. I'm so upset about it!!! Family and kitty!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:33:55	@Canageek Heh.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:28:59	Ah, I can see everything I sent now! Confirmation.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:26:51	@Canageek Sorry, can't type. Predictions completely off!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:25:43	@Canageek it's okay. I said your Psychic Predictions were completely about me going to bed and feeling better the next day. *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:22:44	@CalliCoop So that's a "different" kind of "Rock Bottom" as I see it. Psychologically you're obsessing. We all know how great that is right?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:22:44	I have no Internet again on my mobile. Sort of. Some apps. Let's see if this will go through because my replies won't. App. vs. Internet!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:22:44	@CalliCoop All I can focus on now is TOMORROW in terms of my drinking. That's bad. Another trigger. Call down because I am anxious I can't?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:22:44	@CalliCoop Yesterday doesn't matter, tomorrow doesn't matter, only TODAY. Well #AA that was great but even being a lazy Buddhist, no more!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:22:43	@CalliCoop Places I need because of the medical. #AA says one day at a time which applies to everything, every problem.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:22:43	@Canageek Ugh. Your Psychic Predictions were wrong sweetie. The Evil Detox. Been a long time so forgot how ugly it really is.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:22:43	@Canageek *big hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:22:43	@youdont86045045 Thanks again.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:22:43	@CalliCoop Hey, been so long! Miss you! Calling GP on Monday for appt. Asking everyone else that I can help I see for places.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:21:36	@Canageek Okay. I can't see anything I wrote at all. Except in gray on my own Profile Page.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:19:06	@Canageek *big hugs* I wrote to you too but Twitter won't send. Now will?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-14 04:17:16	@CalliCoop I wrote a bunch of stuff back to you but it's not showing up??? But thank you! Hope you're doing well. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-12 15:55:32	Fuck it. One friend just reached out to me. Thank God! Nobody else has said shit to me about drinking and this hell. That's it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-12 15:43:54	@Canageek I'll try but Circadian Rhythm out the window. Nonetheless...
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-12 15:39:59	@Canageek Thank you. *tears* I miss you more than you know. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-12 15:36:31	Okay. Poured drinks tonight from people, poured into a Taxi to get home. Will I ever get clean? I can't stop.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-12 10:44:09	I think I'm writing about this a lot so people with #Addition see I'm scared doing this but we're not losers and really not so screwed up.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-12 10:38:07	@WheatgrassTammy Oh, thank you. Going for my Multi-B now.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-12 10:35:07	I went out a week ago. That was how I got my concussion. Fell. Head on counter. Lots of TBI's from epilepsy but it sucked and fucked.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-12 10:31:08	Need to getThiamine into me now. Used in Detox. B1? Yes? Home Detox now. You SHOULDN'T DO! But done so much. Also my Rx Benzos are used.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-12 10:24:13	So still with the plan. Long Term Rehab Facility if I can find a proper one. #Addiction
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-12 10:22:07	Dumb Tweet anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-12 10:21:27	Thanks for the RT. Can't access your @

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 23:48:59	Okay. All's square with my phone call. I'm useless on Twitter so g'bye. Be back when I'm in a better state.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 23:42:18	Everything is so fucking fucked! What am I doing?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 23:06:19	Thanks for all the Likes @youdont86045045
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 21:50:42	The sun is so bright it's shattering my eyes. Shards of brown and shrapnel of a more indescribable colour surrounding that brown.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 21:40:48	I hear people waking up. The sounds of the city. Is it too early to play more music?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 21:26:46	@PurpIeObsession Mmmm...
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 21:13:46	Okay. Going to shut up about my drinking now. That's all I've been Tweeting about. Good lord.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 21:05:35	Still drinking. 12hrs now. Can't reach GP til Monday. No sleep. #Addiction sucks.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 20:53:11	WHOA! Everything is falling on the floor! At least I'm not!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 20:51:28	@giveawaybulp Thanks but you always pay a price for everything in life.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 20:47:08	@PurpIeObsession Right now I am. YAHOO!

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 17:48:31	Just like the old days. A bottle of 750ml almost done but it's Sake. 14.6%. At least I know I need help. Not like the old days. #Addiction
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 17:37:42	Email sent to #Addiction Facility as Dr. PA about herself exactly as Sweetie GP would have written it. Hey, I know medicine! C'mon!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 16:53:33	#Addiction doesn't just eat your body away piece by piece, it does your soul too. So when someone like me PLEADS for help @CAMH NO HELP!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 16:46:07	@WheatgrassTammy Thanks for the RT.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 16:44:51	I have too many health problems and the "Supposed Best" in Canada told me to Fuck Off. Yes, you #CAMH Will you help me now? I'm asking?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 16:40:32	I don't know if we can find one as most places are shitty Detox Black Holes where you stay for a week or two and bye. #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 16:37:55	I have to get my GP to find me a long term Rehab Facility with Medical Treatment. I can't stop drinking on my own #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 16:22:11	Won't accept SIM? Take it out! Back in and my Network is gone. Going to the shop tomorrow? Fuck me. Don't need this now.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 15:15:20	I called my Government Disability Worker in tears about losing my Travel Benefits. That's the call for tomorrow! To sort it!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 15:12:35	My head hurts.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 15:06:27	@beyondxdarkness Reciting the alphabet are we or is it a secret code I have yet to decipher.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 15:04:37	@beyondxdarkness I wrote that speaking from experience.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 15:02:56	Okay. My Tweets look good. Fuck emailing my friend. Too tired. Resolution...sometime before I NEED a VERY IMPORTANT CALL TOMORROW!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 14:59:06	But that SIM Error that could not connect. Now I've never seen that! WTF does a SIM have to... I should see if these even went through!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 14:56:06	I think it's a total service drop over my intersection, general area, city and all roaming areas across the globe. It's been hours!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 14:52:55	My Storage has hit the bubble. My friend is giving me an SD Card. Hope that doesn't make things worse since it's not from my mobile shop!
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 14:48:14	Going to email friend on same service. Has been silly problem but now Error that my SIM Card won't let me join Network? Excuse me?
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-11 14:44:54	Now I'm Wi-Fi to my home Router but limited in app use. Ironically, stupid Twitter works. Email looks okay but no responses. No phone!

16253011	patientanon	2015-12-10 01:58:29	@InfiniteKnot Indeed. It's best to have little expectations of others.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-10 01:56:37	@InfiniteKnot I agree. I also feel just the thought of giving me a gift is a gift itself.
16253011	patientanon	2015-12-09 08:37:22	But when depressed like last night? And not feeling so hot right now, I have a precious gift from someone. Insanely precious! Look. Hold.

16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 11:37:59	Have you ever read a book that made you cry? What was it?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 10:53:35	I'd write a Blog Post right now but I'm too pissed off. Which is probably a good time to do it, but cba AND pissed so whatever. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 10:40:38	Loud Raucous Music Therapy. #feellikecrap
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 10:39:23	GRRRRRR!!! I had to say it all to him! Then, keep saying goodbye over and over! God, I didn't want to do it! Now ignore again? *hangs head*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 09:42:36	Here he is again. Asking for drinks I need a drink!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 09:24:46	All I do is ignore him. Ex-gf who beats partners? If you are reading me on Twitter, I have no clue, I don't read you, tell him to go away.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 09:21:51	That is because I don't like to air dirty laundry and keep things private. Will I have to share this to make him go away? I do not want to.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 09:19:37	So mad right now. Stalker ex-gf who beats her partners. Her friend keeps txting me over and over. Don't tell him WHY I can't talk to him.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 05:35:10	Out to pick up order for #Graphic Novels #Manga placed year ago? Needed more too. $200 paid. Black Fri. saved $175 in actual total. Whew!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 02:00:12	@PurpIeObsession Many reasons for that! I can tell you. Must dash for appt. Do you have email? patientanonymous@gmail
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 01:59:01	@PurpIeObsession No worries. I'm crazy batshit too. Only anonymous because use it as vehicle for Blog Posts. Anonymous Blog.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 01:51:49	@beyondxdarkness Thanks for giving me access to the private too! *mwah*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 01:50:43	@beyondxdarkness You know I love you. We could even talk about it together! Deal with it and not feel so alone!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 00:37:19	Happy Thanksgiving (weekend!) to all in the US. But please don't forget who can't celebrate: no family, homes, money... Please help them.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 00:28:37	@beyondxdarkness What was it? Why have I been so stupid and have not gotten around to Following your other Account until now! *face palm*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 00:25:49	@beyondxdarkness I don't think you could ever trigger me. No, you'd just let me know a commonality. Although this did trigger me a bit.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 00:20:30	Forget me trying to ramble on about inflenza a and b. How the vaccines are made. Several factors. Get it. Definitely if you chronically ill.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-28 00:06:38	SICK ON SICK! Had to cancel one appt. this week but more? Have to go out today. Don't need a flu shot? Having to fight influenza strain now!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-27 23:55:41	Thanks for Like @Rich_Like_That
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 05:08:18	@beyondxdarkness *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 04:24:53	@beyondxdarkness A lot of chat here but we'll get our calendars in order!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 04:22:40	@Martinush66 @beyondxdarkness Not sure what you mean, so soon but my flat, blunt tone was part of me being and an #Aspie Plus knowledge?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 04:16:33	@Martinush66 @beyondxdarkness Perhaps other parts of the world but not in North America. Welcome to my #Aspergers side now as well.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 04:14:52	@Martinush66 @beyondxdarkness Yes, I'm medical. Technical term. Somewhat confusing as used largely in the UK and surrounding areas.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 03:09:45	@beyondxdarkness @Martinush66 An eternally unanswerable question. So hang on for the ride! Also, take anti-emetics! Lots of them.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 02:38:06	@beyondxdarkness Thanks for the Like @Martinush66 Having eternal problems with Twitter Threading! Will this work?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 02:34:55	@Martinush66 Thanks for the Like!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 02:27:16	@beyondxdarkness Thanks, babe. Let's say we pick the same day and do it together, hey? *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 02:24:47	@beyondxdarkness Yes sweetie, I cannot count how many days I've felt the same. Before all of this technology, I add that in now too. xx
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 02:14:30	@bellanatale2004 She's awesome. I'm so lucky to have her. I keep forgetting to watch the stupid thing! I'm so stupid. Maybe today? Gah.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 01:24:11	@bellanatale2004 Therapist actually gave me film about girl who has epilepsy (you know I have.) She sees world differently because of.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-26 01:20:15	@bellanatale2004 Hey! Criminal Minds! Awesome! Two back to back so some time killed off Daytime Television.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 10:13:49	Meds, Symbicort (no OTC sicky products work.) Time to crash. Still sleep on something dark for dyed hair, wait to wash. Latter easy! BLAH.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 08:17:49	@patientanon And she would be extremely high class (are you kidding me?) and cost me a lot of money. She wouldn't find me ugly though!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 08:13:08	@patientanon And it would be with another woman. Just to be clear. #GBLT
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 08:07:27	@patientanon My Vote is Maybe.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 08:05:09	Watching a documentary. History of Brothels. No gender discrimination. Would you pay to have sex?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 03:29:51	Thanks @periodbox I still think it would be hard to make a tampon to measure your fever when sick with a virus. Science Rocks though!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 03:17:48	I can't find my thermometer. Lots of tampons, but they wouldn't be helpful for THIS health issue.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 03:07:35	@bellanatale2004 It's maybe some interstellar-timed trigger thing. I've been good with fending off other triggers and cravings.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 03:04:37	@bellanatale2004 I TOTALLY understand. I've finally dragged my ass back to AA but I'm having this "two week" issue. Can't get past it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 02:58:59	@doc_rob *pokes tongue out* I know the regular sizes and all over so my Immune System full throttle. But my nodes feel huge. CACK!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 02:55:11	@bellanatale2004 Thanks so much about my Blog. That means a lot. Odd, huh? Welcome to the Club! Was it the Self-Medication/Drinking?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 02:51:36	@doc_rob What's the average size of a lymph node in your neck, enlarged for battle of an infection? A freakin' watermelon??? OMG. Blargh.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 02:44:55	@bellanatale2004 I hope you're doing okay! x
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 02:44:16	@bellanatale2004 Just waiting to call Sweetie GP and cancel my appointment with her tomorrow. No go. Thanks for thinking of me!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 02:42:44	@bellanatale2004 Right now I'm watching a "Super Smart" Science show that I could host. Brain numbing for sleep?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 02:38:31	@bellanatale2004 *laughing so hard* You know, we're totally offending everyone who loves them.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 01:57:20	Thanks for the Like @bellanatale2004
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 01:42:23	Okay. My throat is so sore I want to cut my head off. Salt Water gargle every five minutes. Can I nap after my Stims? Hmmm...
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 01:35:37	@LePetiteNYC Thanks for the Follow and Like. I'm a smart ass and sarcastic and...most please don't get my sense of humour.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 01:30:04	@starryeyes2001 Maybe rest for a bit now and better later to do stuff. Still early in the day here. Hope you're doing okay too! x
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 01:27:52	@starryeyes2001 You're such a dear. Lactose and sugar intake make any infections worse. My body is ridiculous. Avoid!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 01:25:14	Sick in Bed Conclusion: Daytime Television is not from Jupiter. It's actually from a distant planet called "Whatthehellisthat?"
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 00:58:59	@LePetiteNYC You were distracted while giving me access to your Account and Following me back! *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 00:55:17	@Zinquefty Cute new avatar, cutie!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 00:34:25	@starryeyes2001 Maybe just a passing virus and over soon, but it's treating my body like a punching bag. *weak laughter*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-25 00:32:04	@starryeyes2001 Thanks hon. I have an awesome duvet! Always warm year round. But now I'm sick. Are you kidding me? Work to do! But bed.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 11:39:12	Happy Birthday? https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/hap py-birthday …
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 10:23:22	@ladygaga And just so you know you can trust me? I have a lot of access to someone else who is famous. Of course I can't say who here!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 10:13:55	@starryeyes2001 Okay! Black T-shirt Pillowcase! Now I'm walking around naked with the window open. Like I care.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 10:08:46	@starryeyes2001 It's a size L and I'm really tiny. Wear S or MAYBE M with whatever clothing it is.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 10:05:00	@starryeyes2001 Ironically, fleece blanket over mattress is rose coloured! Wore black T-shirt to appt. I can afford to lose.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 10:02:10	LYMPH NODE ALERT! LYMPH NODE ALERT! Awww, come on. Gimme a break. *feels throat getting sore*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 09:50:12	Oh, crap! Hair Sleeping Arrangements! Red Bleeds! Head on pillow with dark, crappy something. Or no pillow and something crappy under head.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 09:38:18	No work tonight. My dealer came by too late. Baaaaaddd Groan. Delivery guy from Pharmacy with my meds. I could be bad and go for a drink.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 09:32:17	@ladygaga Thank you for the RT @Jacquelyne214
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 09:16:57	@ladygaga Nonetheless, considering what I would like to tell you, it seems lacking in form electronically. So if I may mail you, thank you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 09:12:33	@ladygaga My sigh is that I am now 1,000,001. But pen to paper. How I wished before. If possible, please? Tangible. Keep or toss it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 09:02:28	@ladygaga Not a Little Monster. Well...maybe of a different kind. Yes, overloaded, every day 1,000,000 people contacting you. We both sigh?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 08:58:42	@ladygaga It was the intersection of two streets, showing their names. Then I could figure out the rest. Not bad, huh? *raises eyebrows*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 08:55:35	@ladygaga I had your old home address from the Oprah Show? It wasn't mentioned but I payed attention. Easy to put together from one frame.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 08:53:03	@ladygaga Hello. I love the Blue Circle! It means the person/s are "real?" *smirks* I'd like say some things to you. All good, don't worry!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 06:11:50	What colour? I have very dark brown hair. Now I'm auburn on fire.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 06:06:24	I'm not a vain person but I LOVE my hair. It's done. The dye took perfectly. The cut is EXACTLY how I wanted. Versatile to everything!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 05:11:16	Thanks for the RT!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 03:41:41	Sitting in hair salon covered in dye goo gunk all over my head. Head covered with plastic bag. FUN! God I hope this looks good.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 03:38:17	@AbdelGadry Silly me. I forgot to say thank you the proper way now that Twitter is working for me. Thanks for the RT of my RT!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 03:36:38	@patientanon Aspie Penguin told me to thank you. He says sorry for the delay and me too. More sleep. More Twitter problems.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-24 03:31:32	@AbdelGadry Thanks for the RT of my RT! Too funny you are!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-22 07:06:56	@apod Ah, forgot. Was going to study Astronomy in uni but lack of student interest. Plan cancelled. Can you believe? I was ticked!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-22 07:04:12	@apod Glad I found you to Follow! Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-22 04:49:23	@TheAnimeBible @imjeaIous Thanks for this guys! So pretty and shiny! I know I won't win so good luck to everyone else!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-22 04:43:52	I can look at the drawings but I can't really make any drawings but scribbles. So, uhhh... https:// twitter.com/TheAnimeBible/ status/668165649936576512 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-21 07:06:52	In going insane with 8 loads of laundry yesterday, I lost some things. OMFG! People didn't steal. One personal and my /34/ Hoodie! OMFG!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-21 06:16:56	Trying to find energy to do more laundry. #bedbugsarechildrenofsatan
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-21 06:14:30	Moreover, doing First Aid/CPR on my GP would be lovely because she's absolutely gorgeous! #notransference No. Not Transference! Just pretty!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-21 06:08:03	I'm seeing my GP on Wednesday so I want to freak her out. All in black, leather jacket, wicked shoes. I'll have to give her First Aid/CPR.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-21 06:04:03	Getting my hair cut and dyed on Monday! WHOO HOO!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-19 06:34:58	From Aspie Penguin https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2015/11/18/fro m-aspie-penguin-21/ …
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-19 04:34:05	@D8Iveta Sorry. I'm a little brat but don't you know that by now? x
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-19 04:32:39	@D8Iveta Well that's quite the rhetorical statement! Of COURSE it is! *giggles*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-19 04:30:47	Time to get on my computer and start working on my Blog AGAIN to clean it up. Take about 257 years? It's now descending further into hell.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-19 04:25:48	Damn, I hate the world of #Blogging some days. Damn, I hate the world some days! Damn, add hating Twitter some days too. *HUGE EYEROLL*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 23:20:20	Meeting across the street soon. How GLORIOUS is it when THEY come to YOU! I'm going to go early and drown in Twinings Earl Grey. YUM!

16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 22:55:47	@D8Iveta Thanks for the Like! In fact, I find EVERYTHING Feline beautiful. I'm just one of "those types" I guess? *laughing* But it is true!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 22:40:28	@AbdelGadry Thanks for the #FIFA RT! I just couldn't restrain myself from doing that last night. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 22:33:45	@D8Iveta Have a beautiful day yourself! I fear I might have a sleepy day. Well, sleepy days can be beautiful. Feline Naps!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 10:39:14	Just kidding @FIFAWorldCup about your updates. I'm sarcastic and just believe in MY team like EVERYONE @CanadaSoccerEN and @CanadaSoccerFR
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 10:26:46	@FIFAWorldCup @CanadaSoccerEN Canada is going to win so you don't have to update everyone. *grins* #ProudCanadian
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 10:16:35	@Ladyklepht Thanks for all the Likes again! x
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 10:14:50	@isseynfarran Wearing my Red of you now. Can't watch match on TV. On BEIN. $$$ to order channel! So Twitter updates. Hope you're well.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 08:41:52	I can't wait to be cooler since I'm already so uncool. When I get cooler, you'll be able to boil me and get popsicles. Not just water now.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 07:49:44	@beingLsa But bloody hell! £1 is x2 CDN1! And shipping! I can probably get gear on my side. I SO miss MY Bondage Pants I bought from BOY.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 07:45:40	@beingLsa I was looking at Tiger of London because I'm going back to a Goth when I was a kid. I'm 45 but small and look young still. *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 07:33:40	@Ladyklepht Okay talk later. Just working on dye colour in my head still. And cut. Have to talk to Stylist first but no secret. Don't worry!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 07:31:01	@beingLsa Thanks for the Likey!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 07:29:03	@Ladyklepht And I look at hell of a lot younger than I am! *laughs maniacally* Getting hair cut and dying it...
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 07:27:12	@Ladyklepht And yes. I'm tiny so I can pull it all off and not look ridiculous. Angular facial features, high cheekbones and all that!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 07:23:59	@Ladyklepht I had so many clothes like hers. WHY, OH WHY DID I GET RID OF THEM!!! I'm reinventing myself so just buy new ones. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 07:21:29	@Ladyklepht Morpheus Station. *laughing* Well, Trinity is still good good in the Matrix. I'll call you if I need a secure line.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 07:18:57	@Ladyklepht Thank you, that's a HUGE compliment. Have good sleeps.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 07:16:49	@beingLsa It's on my Profile but to save you time http:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com Now that you want to read, WARNING: YOU ASKED FOR IT.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 07:09:51	@D8Iveta @ArthurMurrayNY Looks lovely! Can't wait to see more!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 06:22:06	@Ladyklepht I have to go to the shop. Be back if you still want to chat. Just around corner.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 06:20:54	@Ladyklepht I write EVERYTHING. *laughing* Really, it's like I've got a finger in every pie. I have written at some point every style? Yes?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 06:18:26	@Ladyklepht I have a book where if a line, metaphor, simile, idiom etc. comes to me, I write it down so I won't forget. Good for future use?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 06:15:50	@Ladyklepht Actually, something I said/wrote to someone in an email turned out to be a great line I could use for that in my writing.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 06:10:38	@Ladyklepht Typo, then saw another notice and send! Before I read anything. Was going to say I create whatever time zone I'm in.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 06:03:45	@Ladyklepht Oh, you're more than welcome! I was enjoying our conversation very much.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 06:01:51	@CanadaSoccerEN Want to go out to pub for #CanMNT match SO MUCH!But know it's full already. I have a cane! Not safe to travel alone. Bummer.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 05:54:25	@beingLsa Thank you. Cutie. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 05:52:41	@beingLsa Lots more. Maybe check out my Blog?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 05:51:47	@beingLsa Did develop one I LOVE! WTF? Seizure you love? O_o A GOOD Gelastic. The emotion for me is humour. I laugh until I almost die!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 05:47:57	@beingLsa Had first Complex partial few years later out of the blue. They almost always stick with people. Have one, will continue. Yep.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 05:45:50	@beingLsa Damn forced me to a Neuro and from there, nothing... until it can just sneak up on you and bite you in the arse.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 05:43:59	@beingLsa Then a stop during adolescence. Not uncommon. Then small SPs back in early 20s. Never bothersome. GF all upset! Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 05:39:26	@beingLsa You're welcome! *kiss* I've been told I'm pretty too but I can't tell! *embarrassed* I first remember Simple Partials at 6yrs old.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 05:33:03	@beingLsa I'm just a lady with Asperger's too. We can be blunt. You are pretty so I just stated it. A compliment too. *smiles*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 05:29:55	@beingLsa Thank you for Following me back pretty lady. Epilepsy sucks, doesn't it? Please don't think I'm a crazy, stalker, weirdo ick.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 05:25:51	@Ladyklepht Great! Glad you found the Tweets!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 01:56:09	@Ladyklepht That was yesterday. So, alright. Today? I just woke up so I have no clue. *flops back onto bed*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 01:53:17	@Ladyklepht If you still can't find the Tweets, just search me, go to my Page and click on mine to you. Or the last one? Read from there.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-18 01:50:35	@Ladyklepht Sorry for being away for so long. My appointment was with my Therapist and sometimes that can take a lot out of me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 09:12:51	@Ladyklepht Oh, Like too. Exhausted.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 09:11:33	@Ladyklepht Thanks for this RT!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 09:09:58	@Ladyklepht I have an appointment tomorrow so just going to calm down a bit and bed. Up VERY early. Not used to that. Set alarm...zzzzz...
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 09:05:47	@Ladyklepht Thanks for the Likes and RTs but you made me laugh about giving such boring Tweets RTs! *laughing so hard*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 02:13:58	@Ladyklepht Oh, if I'm not around, battery dying and need to give it a full power down charge okay?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 02:11:02	@Ladyklepht Okay. I'll be watching more TV and trying to wake up!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 02:09:14	@Ladyklepht Oh, you don't have to apologize! Don't worry. We all get busy. I need tea and am watching Curling Finals. *laughs and gets tea*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 02:03:37	@Ladyklepht Thanks for the RT.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 02:02:07	@cherbudd I was better at Pattern Recognition a bit when younger I think. Okay. I hope you can find all of my replies! Maybe email better!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 01:59:17	@cherbudd Crap. New Thread. We have so much to talk about, email? All of this on Twitter? *laughing* But your son and I are the Logic one.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 01:55:01	@cherbudd I grew up in a totally abusive home but as Aspies can have strengths in defined areas, I thought I could "fix" everything.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 01:34:51	@cherbudd Knew so many words named by kids "Dictionary Last Name." LITERAL! Compliment. Joke. Teased, Bullied, Cry Baby but cried more!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 01:31:04	@cherbudd When tiny some echo but easily understood as verbal development. Then I went Pal verbally, then non-verbal in my head!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 01:27:30	@cherbudd Your son sounds a fair bit like me although I was a mouse as a kid. But normal age to learn to speak but then rapid vocabulary up!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 01:10:51	@cherbudd "Special Ed." was for the "Retards" and the troublemakers. And none of the Teachers cared very much. Ran on until high school end.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 01:07:33	@cherbudd If I had to guess a Grade Level? Primary School! Maybe Grade 2? I know. Can you believe? But all we had was "Special Ed."
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 01:04:53	@cherbudd Everything is backward, forward, reversed and spatial, with Dysgraphia. My Dyscalculia is so bad I can't read equations, symbols.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 01:01:10	@cherbudd fully bloomed now as an adult. Dyscalculia is killer, Dysgraphia and maybe a tad Dyslexia but they all work on same level.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 00:58:25	@cherbudd They were crap. I have some old Report Cards and I see some maybe minor problems but then definite LD issues that have...
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 00:55:35	@cherbudd For all I know with my epilepsy I could have been having Absence Seizures as well. At least one teacher noted I needed glasses.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 00:53:28	@cherbudd They had no clue of that because quiet little girls just stare out windows or the chalkboard and write along but doodle too.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 00:50:50	@cherbudd They didn't know anything about anything when I was little. Moreover, I have ADD Inattentive Type. That's the Space Case version.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 00:45:32	@cherbudd Nope. New Nested Thread! I replied to you. Everything is stil. I'm 45. But look 10-15 younger. Just had to say that. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 00:41:43	@cherbudd Oh, wait. I started a stupid new thread! Hang on...
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 00:38:32	@cherbudd First, you're Tweeting fine. It's all neatly organized from where you Liked my Tweet. Just click on your last sent. You'll see.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 00:28:32	@Ladyklepht My friend in Paris is fine. Overwhelmed with all the support. Told her I was upset and people supporting me here! #PorteOuverte
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-16 00:24:18	@Ladyklepht Hi. I Followed you just now because you are so sweet but I don't know all the hashtags! I'm okay. Well, tired. Bad sleep.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 12:13:10	@cherbudd I couldn't get my words out after a million times. I totally lost it. BANG! BANG! Then my friend lost it. RUN!!! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 12:08:12	@cherbudd I did head bang in front of a friend at 7yrs playing a game with a friend. She wasn't playing "right." As in logic. The rules.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 11:57:27	@cherbudd I was also hauled out at the same age+ as a Little Professor to do all sorts of tricks for people. "Awww, isn't she adorable!"
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 11:54:23	@cherbudd All of the "Narrowed Focus of Interest" jazz and how we're all known as Little Professors as kids. I was reading uni texts at 10.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 11:51:52	@cherbudd What another distinction is, and a big one, goes back to diagnosis a bit and said development? Hypelexia as kids.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 11:49:31	@cherbudd I mean, to start with, diagnostic criteria different. BUT... Aspie kids can still show similar behaviour.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 11:47:12	@cherbudd True. It varies with all Autie kids but I totally understand. I'm an Aspie so being a kid was not like being Autie.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 11:36:35	@floralmask I should go to bed but I'm too busy looking at awesome clothes to buy from the UK. That I CANNOT afford. Double Stink! Bed.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 11:33:53	@floralmask I'm tired and blind. Have been all day. I stink. *hangs head*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 11:31:33	@floralmask Thanks for the Like. And accidentally clicked Unfollow with you. Oops! Sorries! Back on Board!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 04:32:13	Social Apps are destroying Society. It's a joke it makes it better and brings things together-treating us as "things" too. Yet, here I am...
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 04:27:43	I hurt people. They had every choice because it was their choice to leave my online life. I know why. Other people? Simple choice of own.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 04:24:51	I want to apologize for my earlier Tweet re: deleting people I was Following, friends who were gone and them not caring. Woe is me! Hardly.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 03:33:14	@floralmask I couldn't agree with you more.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 03:23:29	@cherbudd A friend of mine is moving and as wonderfully bestowed upon me a Laptop that he doesn't need. So I'll be getting a PC soon-ish?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 03:21:55	@cherbudd version of my old one that died (still works as a stereo with iTunes!) I am so in debt it's crazy, but I DO need a proper machine.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 03:20:29	@cherbudd I can trade it in and get money off at the GREAT store I bought it but it will still cost me a LOT of money to get the newer...
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 03:19:12	@cherbudd I bought a new MacBook Air that I'm using now but I'm not happy with it. Trying to save money but not flexible enough.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 03:02:07	@cherbudd This is actually very labour intensive and tiring, even though I started all of this just under 1,350 Followers. Might stop soon!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 03:00:24	Thanks for the Like @cherbudd This is even more fun as I'm multitasking on my Mac and my Mobile that is Android and syncs and pings!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 02:47:19	@RobotJames Where are you my Cyborg Friend. According to my List of Communicators here you are my only one to talk to as a similar entity.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 02:40:02	Not just cleaning up Followers who are lost friends, lots of people who have just gone *poof* No Super Blogger here, but this is good to do.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 01:32:37	Has anyone watched new doc about #AmyWinehouse Out now in Canada so loads here? Thoughts? Comments? Personal (non-media) Reviews? Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 01:29:54	@filmcrowdboards Anyone watched new doc about #AmyWinehouse Out in Canada so loads here? Thoughts? Comments? Personal (non-media) Reviews?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 01:20:03	Getting rid friends here with no Follows back. Don't give a toss about me anymore? Maybe? Dunno. Sad to part. Still love you all though.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-15 00:42:57	@TheAnimeBible Hey, What's your new Account? I tried to open your Notification but Twitter said it wasn't available. Now scroll, scroll...

16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 09:14:40	Going to go and try to relax in tandem with my friend in Paris. We're in different countries. I told her to try and sleep. #PorteOuverte
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 09:00:12	Friend in Paris about to email me when I did now. Safe. Casualties x2 now. Military in. Fear, panic all over. I'm freaking. #PourteOuverte
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 08:53:02	@Ladyklepht Indeed. All I can say. Except for a Timeline Tweet now?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 08:41:29	@Ladyklepht I love her so much. She's like my sister. I can't lose her! #PorteOuverte
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 08:39:56	@Ladyklepht Also I wanted Intel from someone actually living there. Fuck! I'm so freaked out I keep forgetting the hash! #PorteOuverte
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 08:38:01	@Ladyklepht She's okay but scared and everyone and is a disaster! She was just about to email me when I did her. Oh, god.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 08:30:22	@Ladyklepht Think okay being a long time resident. Dual Citizen from Canada where I am But good to get news from her right there. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 08:26:28	Thanks for the RT @Ladyklepht
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 08:12:00	Have friend in Paris. Have just emailed. #PorteOuverte
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 08:01:25	@InfiniteKnot Severe enough Hypocalcemia can turn people into such stupors, cause sensory disturbances, make them like me now.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 07:58:45	@InfiniteKnot Severe Hypocalcemia. Plus my anemia and more. I'm eating two chocolate bars a night and still can't get more. That bad?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 07:56:37	@InfiniteKnot Wow! Thanks, I didn't know that. Sure, alopecia and such but thanks for letting me know. I'm now going down... Dr. PA!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 07:53:42	@Erik_Sijk After reinstall sorts things out and looking maybe now. But do lose updates unless now I'm starting to use serious push or ping.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-14 07:50:52	@Erik_Sijk Reinstalled now. However, problems with my Carrier, even phone re: software hardcoded, memory, other could be messing Twitter.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-12 07:43:09	@Erik_Sijk @patientanon I got my Notifications all back just now but you can go back to others after responding/looking. All gone again.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-12 05:53:01	@Erik_Sijk Let it be for now? Or power off/on. Or reinstall later that fixed things? Need to rest now. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-12 05:50:10	@Erik_Sijk So can't see red hearts for Likes, can't see proper Notifications of who they are via Twitter. Can via email but Twitter same.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-12 05:42:03	@Erik_Sijk Look at the duplicate that just showed up for your last like. No red hearts anywhere.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-12 05:39:00	@Erik_Sijk Okay try again?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-12 05:37:18	@Erik_Sijk Thanks! I can't even see Likes or what Tweets but thanks again. x

16253011	patientanon	2015-11-11 10:56:13	@Cfc_Craig @D8Iveta I understand. Totally anxiety provoking. I get the same way. I'm always here if you want to talk. *big hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-11 10:43:52	@Cfc_Craig @D8Iveta No sleep in four days! Oh, please try to get some rest! Now I'm worried!

16253011	patientanon	2015-11-09 05:58:05	@SketixED You're crazy! People like you! I should probably put it up and get one vote from you and that's it! *laughing*

16253011	patientanon	2015-11-09 05:52:16	@SketixED I was going to ask, "How's the Weab'?" but I slept really late. Now more Laundry Hell. Painting room tomorrow.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-09 05:50:06	@SketixED I notice all of them. I have you selected so I receive every one. I was just thinking of you today actually.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-09 05:02:38	Trying to do as much laundry as can. Running out of clothes! But not feeling well, painting room tomorrow and Neuro for my #TIA issues too.

16253011	patientanon	2015-11-08 04:20:11	@patientanon But yes. Thank you. This is going to be hard. I freely admit I am an addict. Born one, made one, created by myself one.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-08 04:17:36	@patientanon Oop. Thanks. What? Tweet where? Very tired. Bad sleep.

16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 10:07:18	Watching "West Side Story" now. And of course the original! Brings back memories as I performed in it many, many years ago! #theatre
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 07:23:00	You don't know if you don't ask. What is the "Worst?" No? So realize that and ask away. Even if it's outrageous! You have no clue of "Yes."
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 05:47:34	@Cfc_Craig You make me go crazy with other Accts like FIFA, UEFA, Bundesliga... Time difference. See updates before I watch! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 05:42:51	@CanadaSoccerEN If you were in Victoria BC with #CanMNT Butchart Gardens is beautiful. If you have time to get to the Island go and see.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 05:33:15	@CanadaSoccerEN So many Tweets going back and forth I couldn't keep up with the park. Hope they liked Stanley. I have relatives in BC.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 05:18:28	@doc_rob *big hugs* Thank you, my friend.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 05:11:50	@doc_rob BAD STRIKE #2. 911 lots of times! Actually DID have #Stroke in summer! All makes sense. Hospital for five days. YAHOO!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 05:07:31	@doc_rob I'm like that with every damn thing I have. They happen all the time. Strike #1. Don't resolve quickly as you know, but HOURS.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 05:05:16	@doc_rob Now to the point of Referral to Specific #Stroke Management Clinic. Of course "Rare" in #TIA area too.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 05:00:56	@doc_rob Do you know about my #TIA and #Stroke stuff? Random Tweets about. I need a Llama plushie to cheer me up. I'm sick.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 04:57:31	@doc_rob I am seriously tired today but at least not having another #TIA I thought you said you were actually 89. I'm like, NO! No he's not!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-07 00:07:08	@histopathology @ScienceDoesRock @jhewitt123 / Thanks for the Like too!

16253011	patientanon	2015-11-06 10:36:00	@isseynfarran is a man of honesty, respect, care and so much more. He didn't leave me sad. I don't want him to be sad. Be happy Issey!

16253011	patientanon	2015-11-06 03:32:00	@CanadaSoccerEN @FIFAWWC Hi @keishaballa Hope you have a blast! I'd comment on your kickass skills but it's 'usually' kickball right? LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-06 01:06:36	@patientanon Thanks for the Like.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-06 00:22:47	@beyondxdarkness So many times I wonder if I sabotage my life this way or is this really what life is
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-06 00:18:17	@beyondxdarkness I'm the exact opposite. I know I've been hurt so much but then I sort of "forget." Then I go out just to find it the same.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-06 00:13:13	@CanadaSoccerEN @FIFAWWC Happy Birthday! @keishaballa
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-05 05:26:36	@Erik_Sijk *grins* x
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-05 02:25:34	Or is it a combination of me alone, PLUS being a Med Folk that makes me the "Worst Patient?" EGAD! Both. I'm a Patient Nightmare!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-05 02:17:50	If my #TIA gets worse and heads (lovely pun) to #Stroke Land THEN I'll go back to hospital. *sighs* Are Med Folks really the worst patients?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-05 02:11:49	Thanks to some great Followers recently! Back to rest for a bit with tea. The #TIA problems have still not fully cleared since hospital.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-05 02:06:53	@SketixED Yep! Just like Kooky Me! *pokes you in fun*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-04 01:19:58	@SketixED Although... I wouldn't say retartarded so much. So many other categories. Also, LDL's are doomed unless you can get together.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-04 01:16:26	@SketixED Thanks for the little heart. That's so cute! *giggles* A bit embarrassed too but we both get that way so whatever. *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-04 00:04:27	I'm dying now. Farewell. *passes out*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-04 00:03:15	Home now. Unresolved: hemiplegic, nausea, headache, vertigo, diplopia, god! Everything for a BIG TIA! Referred to Stroke Management Clinic.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-03 14:41:11	In damn hospital again. Three TIA's in one day. My left side is fall over weak! In room fast. Phone off now to save battery
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-03 09:25:29	Gonna scoot. Photophobia, headache, motor skills will go out window soon, want throw up, blurry vision, vertigo, dizzy, sleepy, fuzzy...
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-03 09:20:18	Had another today. Took few hours to stop the damn thing. Having another one now! Two in a day can happen! Need GP and Neuro ASAP.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-03 09:16:38	And finally this makes TOTAL SENSE! Everything SO pronounced when in hospital in July. Everyone plus me said Stroke. I DID have one? Surely.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-03 09:12:21	Also VERY BAD because this both constant and RARE to take 2hrs or so to resolve. Several days in a row sometimes? No wonder I'm bedridden!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-03 09:08:40	Why I've been acting SO uncontrollable than other type head injury. Constant actions specific TIA that can look like Stroke and vice versa.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-03 09:04:38	Sicker than I thought. Constant TIA's. Some obvious, pattern, others not. Mine too often, last long over time = Stroke. Dangerous.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-03 08:52:36	@jamesdefrances Thanks for the Follow. Tallis Scholars opinion? Like? Don't? Just to start us talking, I bow down and pray to them. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-03 08:47:01	@SketixED Online. Real Life I can go nuts! Impulsive! Diehard Romantic! Fall in love... BANG! But can be dumb like that online. Trouble.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-03 08:39:19	@Erik_Sijk Thanks for the Fave!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 14:34:59	Problem. Eye bandage from Bedbug bite so uncomfortable. Tear off in sleep. Procedure mask to keep on. Bugs go for CO2. Breathing out crazy!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 13:11:37	@isseynfarran Sounds lovely. :)
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 12:55:39	Okay Westryn Wind Mass by Tallis Scholars. Love! This is 450th Anniversary of Composer Taverner's Death. My favourite of what I have.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 12:46:50	I look like I got into a good mashup, crikey, bareknuckle. But I won. No, no pictures of my face right now.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 12:36:31	I just got a Bedbug bite beneath my eye. Head Injury = Partial Vision Loss. Patched myself up as good as I could. It'll go. I'm toast.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 12:30:20	@cornerworker Thanks for the Fave. If you just read the liner notes with some GOOD discs you're an expert! But great history!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 11:26:06	Actually, time for Chamber Funeral for Dowager Empress Maria of Austria d. Feb 26 1603. She wrote it? She was quite something of a lady!

16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 08:55:25	#Aspie Meltdown. Can't talk to anyone to me. Was told because I couldn't do all Bedbug Cleaning by woman would blame me for whole building.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 05:29:44	@SketixED I'm a total Med Geek but have studied. Was going to pursue professionally. So if you have any maladies and need help, let me know!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 05:26:38	@SketixED Thanks for the well wishes about my health too. Missed that! Bad me! Very odd. Migraines that mimic strokes or stroke signs.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 05:23:27	@SketixED I am here now. Reading local rag actually. I wore the leather gloves too so I'm 2/3 good looking? #parttimefashionista
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 05:02:04	@SketixED I think I shall. Then come back to give sweets to brats in Lobby?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 05:00:37	@SketixED And read MANGA!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 04:59:36	@SketixED Indeed. I look like a total bum, but I would love to stroll down to the pub in my London Fog and Burberry Scarf. Leather Gloves?
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 04:19:04	@SketixED Well, a Bedbug issue. Going on forever. I live alone so couldn't wash my world. Much less with cane, head injury. 4 days! Fuck!
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 04:06:21	@SketixED *grins* Thanks for all the Faves too. Been running around like crazy trying to do laundry. Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2015-11-01 01:59:00	@SketixED It's okay about the compliment. I'm just an #Aspie working my entire life to... get better? My face is a tomato now! *rolls eyes*

16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 04:59:03	@beyondxdarkness I can really let go. You have just met me in a certain place at a certain time. My Blog has some prime stuff on it. It's ok
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 04:52:47	@beyondxdarkness So there shouldn't be any need for Police knowledge. Help Lines are, and should be confidential. Different system I think.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 04:49:26	@beyondxdarkness Help Centers aren't like 911. At least shouldn't be! People call for all reasons. Just to chat.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 04:46:53	@beyondxdarkness They might have seen it come up Call Display unless you have your number marked Private for calling.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 04:44:53	@beyondxdarkness I'm not sure where you live and where you called. I worked for a Help Line years ago. Confidential and only given if emerg.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 04:38:56	@beyondxdarkness To all of you with a collective, even if biased, IQ of 51? I'll give you a quote: Learn what a quote actually is.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 04:35:14	@beyondxdarkness I was on the phone so I apparently missed something really fucked up. People said this was a Quote Acct?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 02:27:51	@beyondxdarkness No. You're just expressing yourself. We all do that here. It's okay!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 02:12:31	@doc_rob Yes, natural habitat. Also, might induce Llama Panic! Or Revolt! Or something.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 02:08:03	@doc_rob What a cutie! Keep him (or her) to entertain your patients that are kids. Or give them iatrophobia.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 02:03:20	I keep forgetting to take my meds. Not that big a problem or anything, right? GAH. Stupid Head Injury. It's making me mess up everywhere!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 01:53:29	@beyondxdarkness Can you just lie down and try to rest? The tears will stop and tire you out. Then you can go to bed. Maybe nap?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 01:32:32	It's all a big conspiracy... https:// twitter.com/Cute_otakugirl /status/660146249568542720 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 01:30:51	@beyondxdarkness I don't really have anyone either so I know. My sister just betrayed me in the worst way EVER this week. kthnxbai. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 01:27:24	@Cute_otakugirl You're welcome!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-31 01:18:36	@Cute_otakugirl Thanks for the Fave. I love the drawing of Gilgamesh. So different?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-30 09:34:45	@Kinda_Squatchy Thanks for the Fave about our Jays.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-30 08:32:01	@CanadaSoccerEN Poor grammar. Canada's fans "Bleed Red" for #footie EVERYWHERE because our Flag is Red and White. Not for #ManchesterUnited
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-30 08:12:26	@CanadaSoccerEN #ManchesterUnited Fans say they "Bleed Red." So do Canadian #footie fans because our Flag is Red and White!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-30 07:15:04	@CanadaSoccerEN GO #TFC GO!!! Not gonna wear my scarf, I'm gonna WAVE IT!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-30 06:54:09	@beyondxdarkness Love you. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-30 06:50:21	@CanadaSoccerEN @RealJohnSmits Yes, it definitely is. And a really nice one too.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-30 06:23:10	@TheAnimeBible Watching Curling right now. They should make an Anime Series about Curling. WHAT? Make one about me. Award Winning! No.Doubt.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-30 06:16:36	@TheAnimeBible You funny. Make wee PA laugh. *grinning*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-30 06:11:26	@TheAnimeBible JUST ONE? I'll just say the first one that came into my head. "Gilgamesh."
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-29 08:11:48	Shamefully, everyone was so drunk where I crashed with my friend, I slept with her brother who was engaged or already married? #iamnotaslut
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-29 08:07:16	But our Jays weren't sucky in the 90's. Back to Back World Series. The second year, there literally was beer pouring down the streets, rain.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-29 08:01:16	Also, every Basketball Fan should know the sport was created in Canada! The Leafs suck (uh, never get Stanley EVER again?)
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-29 07:56:43	Watching Hockey. Most people think it's Canada's National Sport. It is "half" now? Made so not long ago. Popularity. Real one? Lacrosse.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-29 07:46:21	You know? Maybe I should dye my hair purple after all. Someone suggested that to me here. #boringtweets
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-29 01:42:16	@RachelFeltman Well, there is writing content to Poop and Space. They have to get rid of it "somehow" when launched away for lengthy times.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-28 03:03:18	Thanks for the Fave. It's cold out but looking at them? Some seem like a bonfire!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-28 02:53:45	Driving to appointment. Mesmerized by all the colours of all the leaves changing on the trees. Gorgeous!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 11:14:07	At first I was really angry re: my sister not telling me my niece was getting married. Next, she's moving FAR away. Now I just feel sad.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 10:54:31	Okay, seriously? My youngest niece moved away and got married two weekends ago. My sister said nothing. This is our lovely relationship.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 08:52:15	My GP loves me enough to call me from home if too busy during day. Please not now. #Aspie non-verbal. Will force talk only for her. So hard.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 07:09:42	Going to at least rest now. Can do still do lojong? #Buddhism
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 07:06:58	Well, a half hour. Got to point where I could shut out some significant noise. But not Twitter! Almost took plunge when silent. #Buddhism
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 06:23:17	I need to meditate SO much right now. Managed a good three hours after all these years. Want that! Can I? Must leave phone on. #Buddhism
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 04:02:07	@SunSedApp Let's DM now so people don't have to hear our blah, blah. If I disappear, pause in conversation. Telephone call.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 03:55:58	@SunSedApp Thanks for the Favies!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 03:35:37	@SunSedApp I thought we were Following each other but...? Huh. No clue on that one. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 03:32:18	@SunSedApp I want to talk some Techie stuff like we did before.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 03:31:04	@SunSedApp Ah! I put out a Tweet just now looking for you as I thought you were Following me. Just Followed you now. Follow me back please?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 03:11:00	Where's my Follower who was working on Blogging Platforms and other Techie stuff. We talked about it. If you see this come to me. Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-27 01:31:55	Thanks for the inclusion, as always. Kinda felt you'd like that one. Cheers, PA. https:// twitter.com/histopathology /status/658578037479460864 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-26 08:54:58	Is it time to offer to feed Dons? Don't think so. That's a very specific type of meditation. #Buddhism
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-26 07:09:00	If something happens in your life that disturbs or upsets you, be a placid lake of water, not a tsunami.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-26 07:02:00	I've kind of been taking a break from everything. Unless it's a priority. You need to take care of yourself at times.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-26 06:59:04	Time to watch some #footie I guess. If you can believe it, I've actually taken a break.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-26 06:24:53	Call Poison Control! https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2015/10/25/cal l-poison-control …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 21:38:01	Thanks for the RT.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 14:57:07	And ah, crap! Hot when I should be under my duvet to sleep. All night until I sleep and then who knows what? Can sweat. Hot flashes anyone?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 14:51:07	Otherwise just pyjama bottoms and T-shirt. I should be freezing but it's like a kind of cold breeze blowing where I should turn the heat up.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 14:45:26	I think I am seriously going through menopause even if so young. Always cold but fine in very cold Fall Season except feet!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 14:37:04	@_kevinlim Thanks like l said, you'll have to help me out though. Otherwise I'll have to hitch a ride on a bad Keanu Reeves Flick.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 09:46:52	@_kevinlim I'm on Government Disability so like I said, I'd need some help to get over!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 09:44:54	@_kevinlim Communication can be fun!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 09:44:14	@_kevinlim So lots of time for you to get the plane tickets arranged for me. We can get to know each other. I'm an Aspie too. So...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 09:41:19	@_kevinlim Okay! I guess it's a deal then. This is how two geeks make a deal. Online or whatever, then get to know each other.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 09:37:34	@_kevinlim Okay. My geography is horrid, as is my meteorology. However, I want to go so much I don't care about rainy insanity, heat etc.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 09:32:25	I will no longer walk on trippy toes when I see both discrimination and competition for talking to someone. Ridiculous.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 09:27:58	Things should remain decent on Twitter. Not offensive unless you mistakenly and offend someone. I'm tired of taking care of others here.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 09:15:53	But to reclaim their cultural identity that has beaten down, subjugated, they were slaves, many died. The world "nigga" ain't cool.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 09:11:39	It's offensive to me and surely many of my Readers. In my mind, used by black community, largely men to reclaim not anime. Love it!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 09:06:56	I've found only one Blogger that does that, Parod plus cool gear. Few Following. Some of you? Okay. but I don't do "nigga" character or not.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 09:00:12	Love the a + m Parody but getting sick of the word "nigga. No excuse. Also repetitive? Give me fun AND info?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 08:52:34	From that last Tweet, you can see I'm still suffering from doing so. Total Grammar Bomb.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 08:49:33	Don't you hate it when when all is going well, then you blargh out something you what you wanted to say. Wrong time. Are things still okay?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 08:06:22	Hey my MORE new anime and manga Followers. Yes, Parod but wicked to have sound with clips. Make it real. Make me happy? Heh.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 07:56:28	@LowkeySaint Where can I get. That's it! And no shit sprayed ink to go weak and drain. Total Converse Market they're...zzzπzzz.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 07:49:21	@_kevinlim Also, I'd love to go to Taiwan. I just have to update my Passport. After that, mail me tickets. Best season. Will come to you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 07:45:51	@_kevinlim Thanks for the Fave on your own Post? I have various criteria, sometimes very stringent for Follows but this #Pineapple said YES!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 07:38:37	@sound_me_pl Thanks for the Sneaker Pimps Fave but holy shit! That was in my blip.fm days. Does anyone blip anymore? If so, I'll go again.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 07:33:07	@beyondxdarkness Thanks for the Fave about doing all of those hard things to move on? Very hard for me as an #Aspie but why I wrote it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 07:26:05	Sometimes you have to do something that feels stupid, awkward, embarrassing and more. Because If you don't, your life won't change.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 06:04:29	I have a sprained right ankle, just heard my left knee "pop" in a way to support it. Cane vs. Pro Sports Injury Crutches. Can I fly? Please?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 02:05:25	@D8Iveta If you want to judge a competition for your own life, how about that one? All that hard work can really tire you out! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 02:02:19	@D8Iveta To me that is what that picture represents. Glitz and Glamour are great! But a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt? Favourite slippers?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 01:57:42	@D8Iveta You are beautiful in every way, but I like the beautiful you just as a person. Iveta doing fun things, being playful.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 01:53:29	@D8Iveta So, if anyone is to state a preference, then I suppose I should go first. Iveta, I choose "simple."
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 01:49:54	@D8Iveta That is not the point. A matter of personal choice, even debate? But not a fight! Be civil! Be nice to each other!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-24 01:45:18	@D8Iveta You do look very cute. So, the elegant Iveta vs. the simple Iveta. Which one? And people, don't say you'll just take both!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-23 07:06:57	Killing myself laughing. And I don't even like #Pineapple https:// twitter.com/_kevinlim/stat us/657085926808547328 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-23 06:42:18	@Erik_Sijk I would love to be fluent in ANY other language than just English. Maybe I can get my French back! x
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-23 06:40:09	@Erik_Sijk I just meant it is pathetic for me! I studied in school for years but can't remember anything. I would love to be fluent.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 16:13:00	All I can say right now being with such lack of movement is gimme a smoke! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 16:08:42	Oh dear. Very bad stroke head injury problems. Had VERY bad episode in the evening and now almost paralytic. Okay. Have #epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 15:20:04	How do you know you know you're in love with someone? Or you might be?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 15:06:14	Too many remote controls to Tweet. None of them are them are my phone.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 14:34:17	You want to chill, bake, go to exploratory places musically. Get the K+D Sessions. Masters. Pre-Massive Attack say? But go KD first to melt.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 13:26:11	Hello Stoli, my old friend. You're really 40%? Okay. Just a bit and...not a problem? Inhibitions down for a sec' but a good talk. I feel.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 11:32:09	@brittneypiper Thanks for the Fave.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 11:28:55	Thanks for the Likes on my Post just now you THREE. Came in bang, bang, bang! Have I ever had more than three people give me Likes?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 11:13:43	Speaking Different Languages https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/spe aking-different-languages …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 10:00:26	#footie scarf on again! This time it's the one for my Home Club that plays for #CONCACAF @CanadaSoccerEN
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 09:43:51	@doc_rob I can help you with the latter. Really. Forsooth. *serious face*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 09:41:52	Watching older #footie match with #Beckham in it before #CONCACAF coming up. Highly entertaining.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 09:35:52	@doc_rob Congratulations FBSM (not to be confused with BDSM.) I'll let you try to figure out the acronym and get back to me. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 09:25:29	I should be careful watching out for my #FIFA Tweets as I've got them coming up regularly. They can give me TOTAL spoilers on fixtures!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 05:36:17	Thanks to all my new incoming anime and manga Followers. I'd like to list you all but there are too many of you. So, sorry. I suck.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 05:08:53	@FortiusCentre @CanadaSoccerEN Excellent! Sounds like a blast!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 02:00:11	Now I have a working phone! CC lost/stolen and automatic payment went through when I was sleeping. Goodmor... GoodBUY Service! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-22 01:47:26	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Fave on my Tweet about being proper to people on Twitter.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 08:39:44	@beyondxdarkness Thanks for the Fave. I was just thinking about some things I've done. And have never had a chance to say sorry. Hurts.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 08:27:18	Like in real life we should try not to hurt or upset people on Twitter. We should treat them respect, kindness. Unless unintentionally.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 07:29:42	@D8Iveta If you don't provide them or it would be too much of a bother, it's alright. I totally understand.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 07:27:33	@D8Iveta Glad you're safety back and had such a fab time. Earlier C. asked for an autographed photo. If possible I would like too please?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 07:23:36	@Erik_Sijk I don't speak Danish. Only minimal, pathetic French!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 07:22:08	@Erik_Sijk And true. Costumes used on stage! NOT Drab! Other places here too.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 07:20:31	@Erik_Sijk Indeed. Big Box Store Fashion. Second Hand can be a full of surprises Consignments. Where I live Theatre you can buy!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 06:59:03	@Erik_Sijk You, well I don't pigeonhole myself. Generally women but if a super special man. All fitting pieces, yes.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 06:54:41	@Erik_Sijk I had to add that last part as I knew a girl who could only have an orgasm if she rubbed up against a tree. No word a lie!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 06:52:17	@Erik_Sijk I agree. I can wear the entire spectrum of a wardrobe and still be me! Also, beyond my sexuality. It being frottage with trees!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 06:45:59	@Erik_Sijk Oops. Fave. Dumb phone. The Fave you Gave or vice versa.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 06:32:16	@Erik_Sijk Gay women wore suits to go out then (of course.) I would be an anachronistic Marlene Dietrich! *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 06:29:53	@Erik_Sijk Why, thank you very much, sir! I would love to take you back to that period though, loads of fun!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 06:01:13	@Erik_Sijk Well! You seem quite the young man about town! A Dandy that would make Wilde himself give you his ink! Bon! And you're welcome.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 05:52:53	Total non-starter as I still need the partial hysterectomy. Another reason why! Don't hate being a woman, just one who needs a scalpel now.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 05:45:40	I think I'm going through menopause. GP thought. Now two periods this month! I'm a bit on the young side (45) but not that young to start?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 03:35:15	@isseynfarran Yes, I'm crazy, a brat but you will never be able deny how fun and interesting I am. This is just fun. Not interesting yet.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-21 03:31:58	Finally got my Cable fixed! #footie in bed! Well, not literally. Unless anyone's interested? *bats eyelashes* @isseynfarran I'm sorry Issey.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-20 05:13:53	"It's in the water baby, it's the pills that bring you down. It's in the water baby, in the bag of golden brown. It's in the water baby..."
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-20 05:10:29	Change my Ringtone here. Nuts to people always going off? If they know it, I'm automatically, super cool though...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-20 03:04:35	I would if you wanted me to. https:// twitter.com/beyondxdarknes s/status/656182945238003712 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-20 03:02:35	MY CABLE IS OUT UNTIL TOMORROW!!! #NOFOOTIE !!! @Bundesliga_EN @UEFA @FIFAWorldCup @CanadaSoccerEN #depressed #ineedtissuesnow
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-20 02:50:11	How cool is the Party I'm voting for today? I'm can't walk to the nearest Polling Station so they're DRIVING me to one of them! #NDP
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 10:58:29	More migraine stroke weirdness. I can't see. The world is a blur Vertigo, I can't sleep. That could just be the head injury. Must sleep.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 10:44:13	@D8Iveta Interpol still hasn't caught me yet. Sssshhh...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 10:41:17	@D8Iveta Thanks! I'm glad you liked my "critique?"
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 10:39:19	Just got migraine! Let's see how far this goes what a stroke Is like! Gross and fine motor skills gone, weak left side. Barely hold phone.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 10:29:19	@MyID_Research Hi. Just Followed you. Follow me back. See what we can do? Also med background and knowledge so can speak on that level.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 09:08:01	I should go to bed. Anyone want to help put me to sleep?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 09:06:05	I've had it. #Twitter actually just crashed on me. Instead of hitting Cancel, I bloody well reported it. I've now given my life to Google.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 08:42:46	Or it can appear so. From some small degrees to going to hospital. An extremely bad and very annoying TBI. Cane needed now! #ihatemyhead
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 08:37:51	My epilepsy has been kicked out the door with GREAT pleasure. Now, a ridiculous TBI where I get migraines that appear I'm having a stroke?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 08:30:36	When is my Limo coming tomorrow morning! (i.e. personal use of regular city transit giving door to door service for anyone "disabled.")
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 08:21:19	@D8Iveta Oh. I thanked you twice! I'm not intoxicated. Just sick. May have met some of your friends that Faved me earlier. Faves all around!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 08:13:32	@D8Iveta And thank you again for the Fave my dear.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 08:12:12	@D8Iveta Thanks for the Fave!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 08:10:27	@D8Iveta Glad you had such a great time! You sound so happy it's like you're intoxicated! Or maybe you are? *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 05:45:17	@Cfc_Craig Thanks hon. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 05:41:57	@Cfc_Craig Oh, it's acting up again but I'm so I'm sick and NOT acting up who knows? Maybe I'm too out of it to pay attention. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 05:24:35	You're like a silly puppy I just can't paper train #Twitter Now you're turning into an adult! *throws hands up in air*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 05:20:29	Oh, joy. Oh bliss. #Twitter won't even let me read my own Tweets. I did reply to you two lovely men for Faves to @D8Iveta Hope you saw them!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 05:06:30	@Jerry_Tse Hate to sound SO repetitive with multiple Faves, RTs etc. But thanks as well, and a Follow back! Take care, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 05:03:19	@TitansdanceCON Thanks so much for the Fave! Gave you a Follow. Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 04:57:09	Thanks @Bundesliga_EN
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 03:03:07	One thing pulled from damn bag was a book I've been meaning to read FOREVER. History of Soviet Russia. Almost inch thick. Keep me busy.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 02:54:53	@SelwynKapit It's boring. Just end of story. Action begets action to toss the thought away. Maybe I had to build a second level to do it?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 02:52:06	@SelwynKapit Here's a thought to let go. Pretty banal in the quote dept maybe? Don't be afraid to ask but expect nothing. *poof* The end.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 02:38:34	I just did one bag and I'm so unhappy. Back to bed. Where I should be anyway because I'm quite unwell. And wait for my mobile to charge!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 02:27:53	Putting away some things packed away from the Bedbug Treatment. It's like the worst Christmas ever. Shake! I know what! Put it there! NOPE.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 02:14:23	@Cfc_Craig @D8Iveta Hey! My name was there when I went YEARS ago! Okay. Yes, I went years ago, but my name was only on Interpol's List.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 02:02:15	@D8Iveta I've made Theatre Makeup from household items! *laughing* Really! It's fun! But same questions. Who designs everything, everywhere!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 01:58:14	@D8Iveta Oops. Hit Send too fast. My second question. Do you design your own clothes? Theatre I would say for sure as I have too.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 01:54:23	@D8Iveta Which designers do you work with?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-19 01:53:04	@D8Iveta Nice blue. Or blues if lighter that run down to the end. Reminds me of Caribbean but brighter! Interesting flair at floor too!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 09:01:28	@Zinquefty Yes! Definitely!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 08:59:18	@Zinquefty I'm kind of in Hell. Bigger Hell than before. I'll email you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 08:31:38	@Zinquefty *nods* Talked to other woman. Kept saying, "Copper." Even though we don't make pennies anymore don't want to look like one. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 08:17:28	@Zinquefty Decided to dye my hair when I get it cut. Unless there isn't a suitable colour.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 06:30:57	@beyondxdarkness Thanks. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 05:28:15	@beyondxdarkness Do you ever wonder? *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 05:16:59	Now, I think I need a break from Twitter. *laughing* I'm 15min into some #footie match I can watch. Gotta get back to that!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 05:13:58	@Cfc_Craig I actually saw your notice! After all that technobabble of how I (hopefully) fixed the problem!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 05:12:03	The Android Error or problems? Happens with emails other, options how to view. Select to open with Twitter ALWAYS. We'll see.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 05:09:04	So in this case, delete Twitter, reinstall, change passwords. Looks like some things have fixed up already.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 05:04:52	The best rule to swear by for EVERYTHING in life is "simply" Ockham's Razor.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 05:01:18	When fixing technology, the best way is to just pull the power plug out of the wall then plug it back in. Here? Which one?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 04:26:26	Just realized. Android Error? That's MUCH MORE than Powering Down to Reboot. I'll say goodbye now. Since I have to kill my phone to fix?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 04:20:46	@Cfc_Craig Okay, thanks. It's also saying I can't read Tweets, try again later. Sometimes if I reboot it helps. SO nonplussed.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 04:16:52	@Cfc_Craig It seemed so weird as I wasn't getting your updates. So I Followed you back now. It said you weren't Following me anymore too!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 04:13:56	@Cfc_Craig Hey, something happened with Twitter. Everything keeps breaking! Just found out I somehow stopped Following You!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 04:10:15	@Cfc_Craig @scdesc @D8Iveta @GaryHSprague @patientanon @Sajedaa_F9T @strictly_steph / Awww Thanks, hon. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 02:56:14	@vladyushvah Thank you as well for the Fave.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 02:55:42	@foodieduud Thanks for the Fave. I honestly don't know!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 01:41:41	Thanks for the Fave.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 01:35:24	Whoa. Did this "Bedbug Stress" make me lose weight? I've been eating healthy food. Not so much when sick, but I try. I'm now 98lbs.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 01:16:53	@iamAdamMac Thanks for the Fave! I'm a total #Geek but I wave my Geek Flag HIGH!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 00:55:12	@iamAdamMac Thanks for the Follow. Love the Avatar with glasses pure white. Know #Anime ? That on person means hiding, schemes, bad stuff!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-18 00:38:30	@ukschizophrenic XX
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 11:26:27	This game is MASSIVE! Mainze Dortmund and everyone is flying all over the place and each other! *laughing* #Bundesliga
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 11:02:38	No longer cba!!! #Bundesliga now!!! *perk*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 10:57:51	Pretty much cba I'm watching Rugby. Not my usual bag but really? Well, cba to reach for TV remote. I'm in trouble.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 10:52:34	SO #Twitter cba and pretty much everything cba right now. *laughing* Tired Wee PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 10:46:57	Could go back to #Plume but it was a bloody nightmare. New phone though. Nightmare vs. Nightmare. And forget Seizemic!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 10:41:41	Hi Notifications. Goodbye Notifications. If anyone is trying to talk to me, #Twitter isn't allowing it. I see numbers but nothing. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 10:37:06	I cancelled my appointment with Sweetie GP indefinitely. I'm too sick to go. *trying not to laugh but futile action*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 10:26:58	@Canageek Never bother honey. I go cheap and SO many things come early! How are you doing too? x
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 10:21:50	@RodriguezChloie Thanks for the Fave. Much appreciated.

16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 05:46:07	Waiting for next match coming up. Happy and wearing one of my #footie scarves. Tied right, like the traditional. Don't choke.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 05:26:43	Don't EVER give up on your dreams. I had a childhood one that came true in 2008. LONG TIME! Another 10 years later. Life needs them to work.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 03:07:23	Been to Scotland too so fair knowledge of geography. Okay, idiot! Stop Tweeting! Watch the match!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 03:03:43	Something different. Scottish Premier League. Cool. #footie
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 02:42:56	Now it's time to lie on my nice clean bed and watch some #footie
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-17 02:41:46	Put away VERY heavy but nice #Reisenthel CD cases under bed. MADE bed. Properly. Crashed on clean sheet before. One camera away. That's it!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-16 22:06:49	Thanks!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-16 05:06:11	@D8Iveta He is so sweet like you It's not a quick "fan" letter. We're going to work on some art together, other. So I dedicate it to you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-16 05:00:47	@D8Iveta I love you. For being REAL. A truly CARING Famous Person. I received a personal email from my favourite footie player.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-16 04:27:37	*smiles*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-16 04:26:09	@Canageek Awww.... What happened to Adorkable? *laughing* I'm happy you liked it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-16 04:24:27	@Zinquefty I still have some here!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 11:45:11	Oh, yeah. Just for the record? I've wanted to sleep with Ally Sheedy since I first saw her. And I'm female. Another choice to watch. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 11:29:14	One more thing before I put my DVD in. Does anyone even care if they're #GLBQTTIQ ? And don't forget the #A folks too. I certainly don't.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 11:07:09	I think I'm going to watch "High Art" now. Booze, sex, art, drugs, depression. Well, I'm not having sex. My drugs are script. The rest, yep.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 09:47:17	ALWAYS. https:// twitter.com/beyondxdarknes s/status/654473208981118976 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 09:00:23	@lovekoan Hey. Just a test about the List add. Taking down. Twitter wouldn't work. How are you? Did you email me? I forgot. Eek? xoxo
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 08:31:17	@beyondxdarkness Thanks again, love. I' m receiving every Tweet you send. Yes, to hear what you to say and keep an eye on you! *wink*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 08:01:29	My Gastro's Scrubs he gave me! Perfect! ...SCRUBS...SLUT...SCRUBS...SLUT... Sorry. Joke based on my obsession with. Do anything for Scrubs!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 07:46:19	*wanders off to find clean pyjamas* Emphasis on clean. Post-bedbug Bed must be not grubby like I am now.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 07:42:24	More #Sake ...After my day today? I might just brown bag it and drink it out of the bottle.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 07:28:11	HO-LEE FU... Whoa, Nick. Nice Tweet but not a "nice..." Yeah. https:// twitter.com/nickgenes/stat us/654437139162263552 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 06:52:00	Ta Ta...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 06:51:35	Now I want some nice music on a clean bed with clean linens. I fear I may sleep 24hrs straight.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 06:49:06	Home now. Is the pesticide smell fully gone? Eek! Don't care, sleep deprived and actually had to report lost/stolen Credit Card. Cheers.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 06:45:38	The game is always the same. Get beaten up. Take it or fight back. Fight back, get beaten more. Take the high road. The best "game."
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 03:30:33	@beyondxdarkness Oh me, oh my! You Faved FOUR of my Tweets! I'm so sorry I didn't say thank you! #Twitter isn't working!!! *growls*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 03:27:11	Had another look at this. Judging by your Profile, curious about the Fave. Pleased, yes. But medical Blogger at times. No joke about Tweet.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:53:53	@D8Iveta Have you spent all of your money gambling in the Casinos yet? I know. I'm a naughty girl teasing you. But you're so fun! *smile*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:44:51	@Mike1ac It's on your Twitter Profile and it made me laugh so hard. So I was wondering if it was a compliment or not!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:42:22	I'll have to be honest my Wonderful Greenies. I don't smoke. Here in TOTAL Solidarity for Legal/Med. Plus I get BRUTAL 'noids! OMFGG!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:35:33	Alright Greenies. Somebody said they liked me and thought we'd get along well. Wanted to reply but can't find the person!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:23:25	@WeedEssence @growinggreen27 @patientanon Green's a very nice colour.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:21:00	@TawanaGrogan Oh, oops! Thanks for liking my Location! Sleep deprivation today.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:19:41	@TawanaGrogan Thanks for the RT.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:15:17	@TawanaGrogan Thanks for the Fave.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:13:46	@Mike1ac Old fart. *cackles with hurting sides* I guess that's a compliment?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:11:04	@TawanaGrogan Location. Fantasy Island. Gave me a tickle. Still love mine though. Original one I've had, never giving it up!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:06:01	@growinggreen27 Merci!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 02:03:19	@beyondxdarkness Thanks for the huggy Fave. Lots more for you. Kisses too. That's my girl.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 01:58:54	I just want the Stoner Snacks. https:// twitter.com/NurseMaryJInk/ status/654006095329923072 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 00:11:35	Redundant. Libraries are always quiet. Not like huge wrestling matches with people fighting over the same books they want.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-15 00:08:57	Almost done. I'm going to find a nice quiet corner in the Library and pass out.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 23:52:24	Finally out. Having "All Day Breakfast" that my stomach will soon regret. Except for the water (hydrate) and chocolate milk! Sugar.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 23:12:31	@InfiniteKnot You know, just had tiny thought. Mind-Body Connection. I have actually lost weight because of this. I was shocked!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 23:06:12	Going to try and sleep some more. If they can't be on time...? Left message.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 22:41:08	@InfiniteKnot Oh, thank you. I'm about to hit the floor. I did get about three hours, and flew out of bed in a panic. Guy running late?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 18:33:55	@StephyJamesLove Thanks for the Fave.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 18:27:39	Good Blog Topic. I should look into the Neurological Aspects and Chemistry of me being tired and feeling punch drunk.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 18:17:37	When I get really tired, I get punchy so everything is funny. That's where I am! I don't care anymore. I can't afford to.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 18:14:33	Movies until Pest Control Man arrives. If I drift off, okay. A little nap. Actually, my nap might be coming now! *laughing so hard* Ohhh...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 18:11:00	HUGE White Flag! I can't do anymore. But just a few hours sleep more detrimental than staying up. Took meds but now a morning dose! @@
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 17:57:02	@D8Iveta Thank you for the Fave, Sweetie. Have a safe trip. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 16:02:17	Have to stay out of my place for hours too so will sleep on sidewalk.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 16:00:51	#nosleeptonight I mean this morning? Seriously. The Pest Control Guy is going to be here in 5hrs and still not done. Give up in an hour?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 11:40:04	Still working. Sorry for not getting back to anyone. This is nucking futs. Doing Duvet now. A big pillow that can hold moisture. Dry 10hrs.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 08:34:40	Also arrives within an hour. Usually quite quick. Keep all the drunkards happy. I got all night. I need a break.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 08:31:50	If I can't go to the bar, then the bar is coming to me! Ordered #Sake Really not outrageous. 750ml Bottle for tonight $23. Last time $20.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 08:30:19	@Hippie_of_Love @Cogitatorium @johnlan27986372 @Phillip87024251 Twitter has been misbehaving with me. More than. *frowns*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 08:28:43	@Hippie_of_Love @Cogitatorium @johnlan27986372 @Phillip87024251 Was writing another Tweet. And sending another stuck in Drafts.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 08:27:30	@Hippie_of_Love @Cogitatorium @johnlan27986372 @Phillip87024251 Nothing. I just said thanks. And gave it a Fave too? I think?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 08:23:23	@D8Iveta Now how did I know you would say that? *laughing* Done it since there years old. And turned Nick into a Prodigy! Tap, tap, HUH???
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 08:22:54	Thanks for the Fave.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 07:34:40	Trying to rotate all my laundry to I can get to the bar as fast as I can. Told Pest Control coming tomorrow! #INEEDADRINK
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-14 07:25:08	@Hippie_of_Love @Cogitatorium @johnlan27986372 @Phillip87024251 / Hey thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-13 12:14:53	Mission Demolished.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-13 08:36:06	My Toxic Apartment https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/my- toxic-apartment …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-13 03:35:41	Happy Thanksgiving to my Canadian Friends! Great food, company and fun! If you have nowhere to go come to my place. I'm alone. No plans.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-12 09:03:23	Don't keep asking too much from a person. It could be the fastest way you lose them.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-12 06:36:25	@D8Iveta Wow! Your dancing must really make you REALLY hungry!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-12 02:27:19	Thank you for including me here. Cheers, PA. https:// twitter.com/Cogitatorium/s tatus/653214358906925056 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-12 02:21:48	@isseynfarran Way to go Issey! Lots of your support from me as you know. https:// twitter.com/OfficialPBSNT/ status/653202463328104448 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 12:14:38	FME! Okay... Time to become even more of a pauper...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 12:10:58	Couple of solutions if I can't do what I think I can't do. SD and/or interesting USB Card. If that still is a big FU to me new battery too!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 12:07:31	Plus my apps are all screwed up. Think I know why that is. On Motorola phones if it has Battery Saver, NEVER use it. It lies!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 12:04:46	Nah. Leave on to die for same dead to full charge leaving off. Lack of storage will affect battery of course but shouldn't like this!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 11:49:20	How about just plain FO! In a massive, goddam HUGE way! PHONE OFF! AGAIN! Right, clear cache for EVERY APP? I don't think so. Laters.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 11:43:37	Okay, seriously? I have lost almost all storage on my phone with no changes. My battery is dying so fast. Haven't used. Gone in 12hrs? WTF?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 09:35:20	Mobile, we have some lift off. Always, give tech units a bit of time to start talking when yanking plugs. Best way to fix everything really.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 09:26:49	Okay, kick gmail in the arse too. A double push, since I opened up here and started Tweeting. Please begin a sync. More like sink.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 09:21:14	Another change to Profile. Plus, lost all of my Notifications AGAIN. Well, mixed within from before and any new ones. Send again, please?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 05:38:28	My battery is now at 0%. It needs a full, fresh charge. That means PHONE OFF! You can still talk to me though! Just be back in a few hours.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 05:32:18	@D8Iveta You could do some great lifts with me too. I'm barely 5'2" and weigh 100lbs. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 05:30:29	@D8Iveta Maybe you could teach me. Toss my cane away. You could support me. I don't always need it. If I don't have a strong lead I'll lead!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 05:26:37	@D8Iveta Now how did I know you were going to say that? *laughing* Doing it since 3yrs old. Turning Nick into a Prodigy. Tap, Tap...HUH???
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 05:01:39	@D8Iveta After that, you have a bit of a learning curve that you can even teach yourself. And of course in secret to amaze everyone later!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 04:59:31	@D8Iveta Maybe a good way for people to learn to dance with whatever skills. Find the song with the choreo split, then together.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-11 04:53:59	@D8Iveta Thank you so much about the Madonna "Vogue" Video. Wasn't sure if I could get the point across!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-10 11:11:42	YES! Happy Sports Day Malaysia! https:// twitter.com/OfficialPBSNT/ status/652682385960505344 …

16253011	patientanon	2015-10-10 08:26:42	Just emailed Editor I know of awesome paper we have here about a suggestion for an article. We'll see.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-10 06:21:18	@SunSedApp Okay, I will have a boo?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-10 06:18:38	@SunSedApp Hmmm. Sounds interesting?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-10 06:16:44	@SunSedApp Awww...I feel all warm and cuddly inside now.

16253011	patientanon	2015-10-10 06:07:09	@SunSedApp Thanks for the Fave.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-10 04:25:18	Don't judge someone on Twitter by who they Follow and/or who Follows them. You might miss out on meeting a really great person.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-10 04:17:22	@SelwynKapit Nice to meet you. Thank you for the Follow. Intrigued. *smiles*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-10 04:11:10	@InfiniteKnot Yes. Life is an ongoing, sometimes knowing, lost in the dark brain blowing path. And I'm so lucky to have you with me on mine.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-10 03:56:53	@wowifangirlalot So by Following me does this mean your going to call me on my shit? Show I'm real, a loser or both? *laughing* No, really?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 18:38:16	Don't throw caution to the wind, fling your entire being into a tornado!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 18:14:58	I've been the Court Jester in a couple of Plays. I'm still quite "amused" to be the Fool that's foolish or not. #theatre
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 14:03:46	Soothing rain against my windows. Makes me think of #Rodriguez Anyone know of him? Maybe I should watch Sugar Man's Documentary now.

16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 13:10:15	@beyondxdarkness Trust me. As a writer read my poetry! Kill.Me.Now. Some people say it is beautiful. Just a thought. A thought you gave me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 13:06:06	@beyondxdarkness No Pollyanna but there can still be some beauty in every emotion. Art in every one. Art has come from a lot of pain.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 13:01:15	@beyondxdarkness But can I say you could take those things that touch you and cause the pain and look at them almost backward?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 12:56:42	@beyondxdarkness *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 12:55:26	@Bipolar_Senpai Okay. Blink better soon.

16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 12:51:50	@Bipolar_Senpai Oh no! *puts cool cloth over your eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 12:44:02	I am not defective. I am not broken. None of us are. I only share my feelings and experiences honestly. I am not a loser. Neither are you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 12:06:41	A Call to My GP https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2015/10/09/a-c all-to-my-gp …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 09:14:58	@isseynfarran My best to you my friend wherever you are, what time it is. Do you like Sake? I'm having now and raise a glass to you. Cheers!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 08:20:32	And for those who don't know, #Sake is a fermented rice wine from Japan (mostly) and is 15% in alcohol volume. Look at other wines. *smirks*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 08:15:45	#SAKE !!! This one's interesting! Very nice. Hakatsuru. Exceptional spring water that almost cleanses your palate middle of drink!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 06:34:08	Starting Damaged Goods List with Witnesses for my Insurance Company now. Always know what you have of value and estimated worth.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 06:31:44	I have to tell him MY needs for HELP medically and "...see what they can do..." Despite my Doctor's Letter being Crystal.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 06:29:19	Now starting smoking again (quit for a few hours?) Also ordered a bottle of Sake to be delivered.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 06:24:17	The Manager of my Building made me cry because my things are getting ruined. They haven't done the rest of the Pest Control. Pillows mouldy.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 04:29:06	Have found Symbicort™ Will be used in due course.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 04:21:09	That's it. I have now quit smoking. Again.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 04:09:44	#EURO2016 Fletcher whams! Now 2-1 Scotland vs. Poland. Though be careful Scotland...still keep eyes open...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 03:38:56	@doc_rob Yikes! Glad we finished the boat! But seriously, that's not good!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 03:33:07	Absolutely! https:// twitter.com/Cfc_Craig/stat us/652204929218686976 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 02:31:33	Euro Qualify 2016 coming up. Scotland vs. Poland so good one. Very tired. Don't want to fall asleep! There's no sleeping during footie!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 02:17:50	@mentalspaghetti And how are you?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-09 02:16:23	@mentalspaghetti I'm still alive! Still sporadic with online business but I'm more online right now. And my crazy blog is still alive too.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 11:36:38	@Ascii211 Neurotypicals. People who don't have any mental illnesses or disorders. Term used by us...or generated by.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 11:31:40	Goodnight. I'm okay. And I'm NOT mentally DEFECTIVE. A BROKEN HUMAN. NTs think of #suicide too.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 11:28:05	Stop! Okay. Ridic.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 11:26:33	#PTSD #PTSD #PTSD No. You said never again. Just a flashback about why you did. Blip on the radar.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 11:23:31	Fuck! All was good today. All my meds in a bag and I'm taking mine now to go to bed. I've got more than my bag here. Okay. Go to bed.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 11:02:40	I can't believe I just wrote that condensed version of Cordelia and Lear. #epicfailshakespeare
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 11:00:11	Cordelia isn't a young, stupid loser. Hey, crazy Dad! I'm back! Oh, you do love me??? You're not a loser! Shame we both have to die now.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 10:57:21	Or so it "seems" because she is trying to get out, her bitch sisters become losers in the end and poor Kent! Too late.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 10:54:45	But she's so young, kicked in the arse for not saying the "right" thing so she's banished as a stupid loser. She doesn't know what to do.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 10:51:57	Cordelia is actually really strong, a sacrificial lamb, so young to try and stand up to her crazy father against two bitch sisters.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 10:41:24	I've been told like I'm Cordelia in Lear more than once. She's interesting. Often misunderstood, contradictory, weak. Do you know Lear?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 10:08:41	Thanks for the Fave!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 10:07:38	Time for repeat all night. Love it. "Never Wanted This." Armin van Buren and Justine Suissa. More than love it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 09:31:05	I can somewhat Vogue. Look at her in the video. Then look at her dancers. That way not completely choreo for a non-prof dancer. @D8Iveta
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 09:23:40	You had to communicate with everyone so all the Martails like me actually looked like Madonna. I didn't complain! Just worked on her moves.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 09:14:53	Listening to music of our past Gay Pride WEEK Celebrations. I was a Parade Martial for two years. Wore a total Madonna Mic' Set *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 09:02:05	@D8Iveta Of all the styles of dance you do, what is your favourite and the one you find the most fun?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 08:11:51	Mercury in Retrograde. #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 08:10:00	Stranger beside me who I can't hear due to Auditory Processing Disorder who keeps buying me drinks and TOUCHING ME! #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 08:05:57	I came here to read. Pub+Hockey+Auditory Processing Disorder=Deaf. #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 04:52:26	The Five W's and the H with grammatical FUCKS all over them! #writing
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 04:48:31	I am SO fed up with where I live! They are TRYING to fix things, NOT fixing things! Should I blow up the Manager or the building? Or both.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 03:14:47	@pueblokc Ah! Motivation for you! Seriously deathly? Fully intubated on respirator. I am lucky to be alive. Don't try to die to everyone!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 03:06:53	@pueblokc A very good defense mechanism!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 03:06:01	@pueblokc Thanks hon but it's over now. Except memory loss regarding the event. Permanent. Maybe if you're scared of it, it won't happen!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 03:01:10	@pueblokc Well, there was a pretty strong reason in my mind but you can't do it for that type of reason--or any other.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 02:58:58	@pueblokc Learned my lesson. Never again. I just about took everyone I knew right along with me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 02:56:35	@pueblokc Found with no coat so Complex partial. Always unconscious. Then tonic-clonic on patio. Clothes torn to show and TBI.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 02:53:40	@pueblokc Years ago. Start of 2011. You know my cocktail. Those, bottle of red wine. Winter. Found outside. Two seizures I noted later.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 01:19:56	I AM COOL. Really cool. Even if look like a Hobo sometimes. A Hobo with wicked Nine West Heels. That's it. End of story.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 01:04:38	@pueblokc Oh, Sweetie. *hugs and kisses* Any consolation I know what it's like? Did you know I OD'd and in coma for three days?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 00:59:57	@pueblokc Ditto. But I'm really happy you're STILL here!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 00:58:51	What about a darker and shiny shade of Paprika! Cayenne is too red. What do you think? That could be combo. Me/Andy in Factory with Me/Me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 00:52:27	NOW *huge sigh* I kind of want Mahogany from Hades. Something like that. Stylish. Not Firetruck Red! Oh! Condiments? Wait just a sec...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 00:49:33	Although now my boring dinner table condiments are back (salt and pepper.) They do look fine, except they're boring condiments?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 00:46:51	@samwhatisit I've had multiple Hair Crises since. I could still do it. But for my Cosplay? Okay. One Anime Character.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 00:43:46	@samwhatisit Floating through my Followeringosphere. How are you Doll? Apologies about never getting back to you about my Genderbender Andy.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 00:37:15	@pueblokc And another friend from long ago. Haven't talked in a long time. How are you?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 00:35:28	@mentalspaghetti Hey! How are you? LONG time. I'm seeing people in the feed I haven't talked to in ages! So grabbing them to catch up.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 00:32:44	@beyondxdarkness So how are you doing today?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-08 00:31:23	Thanks for the Fave. I didn't know if the joke was too cheese or a groaner but I thought it was funny. But a groaner. *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 23:57:39	Trying to get out of bed now to go to shops. Damn migraine/stroke thing. Been days but running out of things.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 23:54:49	Try not to let NTs (or anyone else) make you feel like you're an inside joke, the brunt of, or just IT. Be yourself. Be happy. Be good.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 23:42:46	@D8Iveta It is easy to sit and ponder, let our thoughts wander. Be playful, make jokes. But don't go too far. Hubris is this?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 23:38:14	@D8Iveta I do not wish to place too much expectation upon you. No one should upon another, famous or not. Hubris is blinding me on Twitter.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 23:18:48	What's the difference between being sick and bedridden vs. lazy? When you stand up, you fall and WHAM! Hospital! That means you're lazy.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 23:08:04	@AliveinMe Yes. We can chat later. Wait until you feel better.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 23:06:39	@D8Iveta Oh, dear. Everyone is talking 2016 Calendar. Me too? *runs away like mouse*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 23:03:54	Absolutely adorable! https:// twitter.com/Cfc_Craig/stat us/651769676003954688 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 22:10:22	@AliveinMe I never am. But I'm human. Just so odd. First time ever about a problem. Bedridden now so can't even do bloods anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 22:05:23	@AliveinMe now that I'm acting strangely with my GP about it all. Plus the head injury. I've never cried and told her I was scared.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 22:03:07	@AliveinMe injury that I have now. You would know how that goes. Injury another story. But I just realized (duh thinking head injury)
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 22:00:59	@AliveinMe I wrote a Blog Post trying to figure out why. I don't want to say it's got anything to do with the strange thinking of a head...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 21:58:07	@AliveinMe Well, when anything happens to you medically you I agree no fear. I'm like that too. Except for something coming up.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 04:43:45	@Cfc_Craig CANM23 on tonight so good match. Vs.Cuba.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 04:40:08	Thanks for the Fave if I didn't say so already. Brain through a blender day. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 04:37:36	@Cfc_Craig Have all my Kit except Under Jersey long sleeves. They were so good at specially making my guy's Jersey. Last name so long!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 04:33:42	@Cfc_Craig I think I missed this one? *giggles* Well, Proud Canadian so definitely all but CANMNT. Men's National. Favourite player there.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 03:46:14	@Cfc_Craig At bottom lists all teams. Gives you idea of breakdown.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 03:44:46	@Cfc_Craig Yes, kicks ass we have women's. Check this out. @CanadaSoccerEN
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 03:43:17	@Cfc_Craig You can still swap out players for games competitive, on loan for competitions, but it's smaller. Due to all of it starting.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 03:39:59	@Cfc_Craig It's taken a long time for footie to build up and get attention here. Still a long way to go? It's kind of different? Maybe?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 03:36:17	@Cfc_Craig My favourite player too! WHEE!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 03:35:23	@Cfc_Craig Cool. I'm waiting patiently for my favourite Team of Canada's but probably lots of time. Points and Friendlies for 2008 FIFA!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 03:30:58	@Cfc_Craig Exactly. Sometimes everything can be like a big Bingo Game too. Have you gone to a match?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 03:26:18	@Cfc_Craig Good thinking. I was looking at the stats and they're not completely worn yet. Just need to keep pushing more.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 03:21:35	@Cfc_Craig Not bad. Sleepy. *laughing* Poor Chelsea. Getting some blows!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 03:18:10	@Cfc_Craig Hi! How are you?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 02:23:52	Excellent! https:// twitter.com/nickgenes/stat us/651461760575250433 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 02:11:55	@AliveinMe Awake brain surgery. First person I've known in person. What's it like? Sensation. Cognition. Everything right when doing it?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-07 02:08:07	Thanks for the Fave.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-06 01:14:46	Migraines won't stop. First time have sign of a stroke that these things mimic. Unilateral weakness on left side of body. Can't hold phone!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-06 01:07:25	@Bipolar_Senpai You're welcome and thank you for Following me back as well.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-06 00:20:45	@D8Iveta Why I wanted to talk. Feelings are getting hurt and I know why. Therefore, so should you. I'm not crazy. I want to help.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-06 00:12:15	@D8Iveta Thank you again if your Starred Tweets were really meant for me. However, I might need to leave for someone who needs you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-06 00:00:32	@svenbaumgartner Thanks for the Fave if I didn't. Remember, #Twitter wasn't working!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 13:38:56	@JerryDanielsen Thanks for the Follow, but I must ask because of your poetry. Did you pick me up because I mentioned I wrote it too?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 12:51:51	@rayvellest Thanks for the Fave! I am so pissed! And others too with this latest version. We're all having the same problems.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 12:24:47	@HardAspie I'm so pissed off at #Twitter I accidentally typed like I was txting you. Oy.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 12:21:07	@HardAspie Back sec.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 12:20:42	Okay. I'M LOSING FOLLOWERS, A GUY PUT ME ON A LIST, SHOWED UP NOW. POOF! GONE. #Twitter Get your shit together!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 12:14:20	@HardAspie I already have sweetheart! But they're more morose!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 12:11:40	@HardAspie Well, I shall try? Sometimes you can't summon the Muse, but She summons you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 12:09:38	@HardAspie *grins* As always I am happy to make you happy. My beautiful one.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 12:06:51	@HardAspie You're inspiring me to write romantic poetry right now. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 12:05:33	@HardAspie It's been so long but you're still as adorable as ever. It's good to see that things don't change.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 12:02:13	@HardAspie Thank you. You too with me. You always have. xx
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 12:00:18	@HardAspie Love you too babe!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 11:59:42	@Zinquefty Exactly! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 11:58:10	@Ascii211 *tucks you in*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 11:56:36	@HardAspie YOU. YOU! Where have you been? Unless ships in the night (weird expression of many that never make sense to us...) *love*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 11:51:37	@Ascii211 CookiesCookiesCookies... *pounce*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 11:45:59	@AliveinMe HEY! HEY! HEY! How are you! Been forever! Guess what? Seizure Free for over two years. Boatload of meds but we did it! You?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 11:43:01	Yes. That is what happened. A bit of a problem. Acute onset of #Aspergers and too low a treatment for #ADD The patient is now stable.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 11:08:48	Extremely understimulated right now. Damn #ADD Damn Brain. Okay. Let's work on something to get me going here. And NOT going! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 11:03:58	Called ex-colleague about ancient invitation to get together Both laid off at same job. Horrific #Aspie talk! Covered up back then. Okay...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 09:59:20	Throwing Out My Trash https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2015/10/04/thr owing-out-my-trash …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 07:31:24	@cratylus Thanks again for the Fave. I'll try and work something out with my Stylist.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 07:11:40	@cratylus Someone once told me for her blue was BAD.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 06:56:47	@cratylus Thanks for the Fave! Any suggestions? Black will be hard to cover roots. Something else really dark. Gonna goth it too.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 06:52:31	Oh, fuck. Two things I never discuss. ESPECIALLY in a bar. People are doing it. At least one guy is reasonable like me. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 06:19:08	@CanadaSoccerEN My friend who gave me his favourite UK National Jersey just gave me his #TFC Scarf! Not worthy! Wearing tied in pub now.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 04:59:38	I'm so sick of my life. It has become so hopeless, the only thing I can do to try and save it, is to dye my hair. Now, what colour...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 01:37:45	It's a good thing carrots don't drown. Mine has been immersed in dip for hours.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 01:35:15	@doc_rob Lots of options! My tux or twins with tinfoil hats are the first two most obvious.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 01:32:55	@doc_rob Tweet me when at your favourite talk, site, when you're falling asleep, whatever. Then I'll get dressed! *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 01:29:09	@doc_rob I'm going to go with "That little black dress" that all women have and some great shoes. Actually, DING! We'll time it!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 01:26:22	@doc_rob Thanks for the Fave, hon. I'm checking the dates now so I can at least walk around my apartment dressed up for you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 01:23:41	@doc_rob ACE! I'd love to accompany you. Evening Gown and all. Unfortunately, I can't afford airline tickets.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 00:25:00	Love "Documentary True or False." San Andreas etc. California Quake Faults! Then, no. Fine. Saw one: Cali Faults spread Quakes to BC Canada!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-05 00:04:58	@Zinquefty No worries. I'll email as personal anyway. SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-04 04:52:14	Some Clubs have the UGLIEST Kits. #footiefasion #advertising
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-04 03:30:46	Pipe Dreams aren't meant to be smoked. They're meant to be set on fire!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-04 03:22:16	@isseynfarran If you need to know my information since I am anonymous here, you can contact me privately, quick Follow/DM? I can tell you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-04 03:18:02	@isseynfarran Sorry to bother you again. If you do talk to TerengganuFC about my correspondence, it's my real name. You don't know it!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-04 02:58:59	God. I keep forgetting how much my #Migraine triptan (Maxalt) gets me so stoned and whacked out. It never used to but a total bonus.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-04 02:54:06	@doc_rob ALL BUGS SHOULD DIE! To hell with our Ecosystem. I hate bugs! And now, back to my regularly scheduled migraine...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 08:52:06	Alright, this must be said. Do not go to blacken an eye, if you see a Red Flag, notice how high. Taking high road as gracefully as possible.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 08:36:07	Okay. Here's an example of #Twitter being so RIDICULOUS! I'll Tweet and the Timeline will take me from Sept. 16 to a minute or few seconds!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 08:35:04	@doc_rob Thank you, dahling. Now let's get to work!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 07:02:53	AH! Je suis tres idiot! Eyes dying for hours! Why am I still looking at a bright screen? With sunglasses. Now blurry #Bundesliga
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 06:42:07	According to last update of #Twitter and up to present, I'm not the only person who is having problems. Even with push not just auto. FIX!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 06:21:33	Okay. Here's an example of #Twitter being so RIDICULOUS! I Tweeted and the Timeline took me from Sept. 16 to a minute or few seconds!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 06:12:23	@svenbaumgartner Thanks for the Fave! *laughing* But it's true! My Notifications aren't working. My RTs. BAH!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 06:05:15	Why do you hate me #Twitter I have never done anything to hurt you. You are the most Sadistic Social Mobile App. The second is #WordPress .
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 05:54:44	@D8Iveta Thank you for the Faves. I never got a chance to because Twitter wasn't wasn't working! Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 05:06:29	@beyondxdarkness Thanks again.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 05:02:01	#FF Everyone! *giggles*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 04:59:53	@beyondxdarkness Check it out. You could probably relate.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 04:57:54	@beyondxdarkness Having Asperger's upon all else, it is the strongest one for me. I have Alexithymia. Common for those on the Spectrum.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 04:54:40	Crap! No going out. Here come the stroke like signs and symptoms. It's so weird guys. Eyes blurry+PAIN! Dizzy, nausea, motor skills gone...
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 04:33:15	@beyondxdarkness Thanks for the Fave Sweetie. I Fave YOU back. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 04:28:13	@beyondxdarkness We can all feel like this. I definitely have. Hang on. Hang in. We're here and WE hear you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 04:23:40	@Zinquefty How are your visual acuity skills in your mind? Picturing something you can't see directly in front of you?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 03:05:44	@doc_rob Thanks for the Fave Sweetie. Now Follow me so I can get on the damn Ark!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 03:02:33	@doc_rob Then we collaborate with your tongue depressors taped tringularly to my upside down cane. Brilliant!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:59:59	@doc_rob Wait now. I've been using them for so long you wouldn't imagine what I can do with them! Turn them upside down. Better oars.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:55:34	@doc_rob Hey you! I'll come and help. Use my canes as oars? What do you think? Deal?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:52:44	@youshouldsee Yep. Exactly. That's why I'd wait for...? Let everything zapped settle and do again. But carefully, parameters different etc.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:42:08	@youshouldsee It depends upon degree of pain and injury. But hey, I can just keep using it over and over! For me, my ankles. Epilepsy crap.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:39:59	@youshouldsee Recently I got to the point of paralysis with all of the carrying, heavy lifting etc. and nothing. But it can help.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:37:55	@youshouldsee Unless IMMEDIATE onset of pain DURING Physio. Then you don't do anything else and use the TENS. At least for my Physio.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:35:22	@youshouldsee Oh, yeah? Before all of this heavy lifting and other things that interrupted Physio done after EVERY Session, pain or not.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:31:21	*head desk*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:30:06	@CanadaSoccerEN @isseynfarran #CanMNT I keep feeling like I'm going to throw up looking for the next home game. Need Accessible Seating!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:20:05	Has anyone else used a #TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Simulation) Unit? What for? How successful has it been for you?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:13:50	I think I'll go for a long(er) walk today. My legs have had more rest and I need to shop. If they bust up, I've got my TENS! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 02:08:05	@ukschizophrenic XX
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 01:56:01	@jamiecullum Been meaning to Follow you for ages. Love you on our 91.1 Try to never miss a show. Always so entertaining! Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 01:46:26	@annweideman And the emphasis on IF you have problems. The vast majority of women don't. Why take anything if you're feeling just fine?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 01:42:38	@annweideman Hi. Thanks but there's really no way to "cure" Fibroids. They're tumors. IF you have problems, medical treatment required.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 01:36:10	@TriniGirlBlue More like YO-YO! Because I'm a crazy little Girlie! But crazy=fun and interesting!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 01:34:02	@TriniGirlBlue S'ok. I have to STOP having my period NOW!!! I'm living with a perpetual head injury (stroke-like?) which is not good. YO.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 01:30:37	@TriniGirlBlue Already having problems that are extremely abnormal. Decision to try and have partial hysterectomy. But see new GYN first.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 01:28:09	@TriniGirlBlue TWICE I've gone to the hospital looking (well I can't see!) like I'm having a damn stroke! I have Fibroids are WHOO!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 01:25:36	@TriniGirlBlue But medical latest and not so greatest AT ALL are catamenial migraines mimicking strokes. So I get my period? FTW???
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 01:22:47	@TriniGirlBlue Meh. Though we've that for years, darling? I've been on/offline for so long too. I'm the rabbit of a bad magician. *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-03 01:09:22	And jump off that mountain on your shoulders like a Ninja Gymnast! https:// twitter.com/beyondmeadow/s tatus/648637835495534592 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 23:59:20	@D8Iveta You do not Follow me but if you could momentarily, to speak privately, I would appreciate it. Rather important issue. Thank you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 23:39:08	@D8Iveta Having tea and then meditating.

16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 08:20:37	@isseynfarran One more thing? Tried to contact your home team T for Jersey. I think they thought I was joking. Can I get one? Thank you!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 07:58:26	@isseynfarran *grins* So happy for you on winning the award.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 07:45:48	@isseynfarran Thank you for the Fave Issey. Can't wait to see the so special you!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 04:15:34	Changed my Twitter Profile. Change is good. Read it or not but it didn't encompass "more" about me. I could still add "MORE." *laughing*

16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 03:17:51	@Cfc_Craig Oops I should have put #Chelsea so everyone can be happy! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 03:15:54	@Cfc_Craig Hey. Since we first met I wanted to ask you who your favourite Chelsea Player was.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 01:49:37	@Cfc_Craig So that's the story. And @D8Iveta if you would like me to write you too I would be very happy. Only need an address. Thank you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 01:39:47	@Cfc_Craig @D8Iveta Suzanne Farrell is a Legend in the ballet world. Her beautiful Assistant made it possible to get to Suzanne directly.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 01:36:56	@Cfc_Craig Oh, about the letter to Suzanne Farrell? Just a poke to @D8Iveta because it had been THAT long since I told her.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 01:33:45	@Cfc_Craig @D8Iveta If you want to ask me anything, absolutely! I'd be more than happy to answer.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 01:32:38	@Cfc_Craig What is there that you need to understand? I wrote to @D8Iveta Do you work for her? You post so much. Press Agent?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 01:28:33	@Cfc_Craig What about what? What do you mean?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 01:26:22	@D8Iveta ls this out of line, but would you like a letter too? If so, please let me know. It will only take 1.5yrs! No, I am serious.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 01:19:48	@D8Iveta Procrastination? Do you remember I said I was writing Suzanne Farrell? It and I fell off the radar. For 1.5yrs! Write, gifts, NOW!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-02 00:34:23	@infopathic @mtaya63 @TimAllenMDJD / Thank you as always, but now for two inclusions in one paper! A great feeling. Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 11:01:11	Now it's time for the dance from all the gay bars we haunted. Then got pissy about for two weeks. Then go back for months again. Elitists.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 10:44:14	Finally listening to my Tony Bennett. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 09:59:16	As per last Blog Post, just cleaned up my wonderful gift of a Scottish Kilt Pin. Tip to cleaning silver jewelry? Toothpaste.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 09:22:01	Where Did He Go https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2015/09/30/whe re-did-he-go/ …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 04:56:21	I just read something that cheered me: "King Dookie of the Dunghill." That's a good one. In Canada we'll use this and already do more.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 03:59:57	@D8Iveta I wanted to make sure that I didn't come off as very aggressive and rude. Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 03:58:42	@D8Iveta I want to apologize for my last Tweet. I said I WILL ask you questions. I meant I probably will and forgive me if I sound stupid.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 03:30:39	A girl cannot live by TV and radio alone. Must get old MacBook. Dead but still iTunes stereo. Want "This Is All I Ask." Tony Bennett. Me?
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 02:26:15	@rmlupo xx
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 02:24:57	Please forgive me person on my floor I just flipped my shit on. I never do that and even though you do that to me, it is no excuse. *tears*
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 00:38:58	Don't get rid of all your immature and childish ways. Keep just a few good ones, so you can always play like a kid!
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 00:30:37	Never say you're a nobody. Thanks to @isseynfarran I didn't feel like that.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 00:20:35	When I'm anxious, desperate, a red flag about an issue? My hands shake. This has never happened before. Awesome Defense Mechanism.
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 00:07:13	The size of their frontal lobe if they really could estimate anything. https:// twitter.com/TriniGirlBlue/ status/639419535435526145 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-10-01 00:02:42	@TriniGirlBlue Hey Girl! EXTREMELY long time! How are you? Didn't know if you'd see. Figured not! Twitter Poetry! Check my Tweets. *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 23:54:04	Okay. A H'lo specifically. Hey @uh... @erm... @...
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 23:47:11	H'lo.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 11:39:25	@Zinquefty My salt and pepper looks maybe alright. But I'm getting an itch or feeling to change back. How I dress too. Makeover! O_o
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 11:27:53	@Zinquefty Dark brown but black wasn't a stretch being a goth when younger. Had dyed black not long ago but decided salt and pepper. Now?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 11:16:45	@Zinquefty Do you think I should dye my hair black again? SO need a haircut. You haven't seen but past shoulders! Anime cut with that? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 09:56:41	That felt good. I haven't written any of my Twitter Poetry in AGES. Let's just see if my biggest fan sees it! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 09:45:05	Time for bed before night is done. If another flood the inevitable will come. Get my knife, kick her door. Leaving blood all over the floor.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 09:19:34	Why use Social Media Apps to be an idiot when you already do it in real life? *laughing* #beentheredonethat
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:59:50	@Cfc_Craig So tell me something about you. Only if you're comfortable! No pressure! My location? Well, I'm anonymous here so DM.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:57:25	@Cfc_Craig Awesome! Well, I guess I'll have to keep an eye out for maybe a visit where I live!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:52:58	@Cfc_Craig So tell me about you? You met her? I see in the avatar? Where?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:45:48	@Cfc_Craig But just so you know, I'm not famous either! *wink*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:41:26	@Cfc_Craig *shrugs* I'll keep looking for my answers... I don't and won't give up on my artistic pursuits.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:39:14	@Cfc_Craig Test Me. All I wanted was a few answers to a few questions. It wouldn't have taken longer than a coffee or tea. Or a few emails.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:36:31	@Cfc_Craig Said nothing, not even Hi. We lived in the same city for God's sake! Do you want my CV? I did get a tiny bit persistent but...
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:33:32	@Cfc_Craig Seriously. I sent a Tweet just to ask this woman on TV about Program Consultation. I'm a Writer and Photographer. OMG.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:30:54	@Cfc_Craig *laughing* I can't type. I meant @D8Iveta was famous and NICE and I would like to meet her. A lot of famous people here? SCARY...
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:22:19	@Cfc_Craig Oh, just talking via Twitter. Meeting here. But of course I would still love to meet you. @D8Iveta you are a NICE famous person!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:13:54	@D8Iveta So not being a dancer, if I say things, two warnings. I WILL say things and forgive me if those things sound very stupid!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:11:06	@D8Iveta After that I compared and did some juxtaposition with my theatre background and dancing. Do you recall? You starred everything.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:08:02	@D8Iveta Do you remember what we talked about when we first met. Okay, you losing because you were so good and look where you are now!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 05:06:09	@D8Iveta I might be watching you a bit more. There is a reason for that. Not stalking! To broaden my own horizons.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 04:02:07	@Feeling_low @TimetoChange @Quinonostante Thanks for the inclusion as always. SO wicked my Blog Twitter Dunce shown! *laughing maniacally*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 03:53:25	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. Just do to the flood. Went to bed, then it happened in short timespan. So deprived.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 03:42:39	@InfiniteKnot Oh, I cleaned it all up. Not kidding. It is like rain! Then it slows down after a while. Sooo tired. Not much sleep.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-30 02:39:43	Whhhaaaa!!! https:// patientanonymous.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/whh haaaa …

16253011	patientanon	2015-09-29 05:50:27	@Cfc_Craig Hi. This is odd. I Follow @D8Iveta and big #Footie Fan. MASSIVE #CanMNT @CanadaSoccerEN but know lots about UK. Barclay's now!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-29 05:37:53	Still have my life in trash bags from the bloody Bedbugs. At least I'm eating now. I threw myself in a bag too in starvation protest.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-29 05:31:10	@hiltonarielruiz Hey! Missed you as a Follow! Sorry about that. I'm a writer so if you're interested in any literary collab let me know.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-28 05:14:43	Jason Statham Kicks Ass! Literally and figuratively? Well, I like him. #mindlesstweetday
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-28 05:06:42	@BipolarNews0 Thanks so much for the Fave! Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-26 02:25:51	@InfiniteKnot I actually do have several things on my blog that under COMPLETE Copyright. post-"ict"al"© The "ick" is italicized. Just One?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-26 02:18:43	@InfiniteKnot Hey! Don't forget it's under copyright! But it was a Tweet to me, and this is still back to you. So that should be alright?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-26 02:15:57	@Butterflywgs So how are you? What's going on in life?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-25 07:49:35	A couple in the pub here just won $1,600 playing the lottery. I had two scratch tickets worth $6 so I gave to them to say Congratulations!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-24 04:20:23	@InfiniteKnot This discussion was something we shared, understood, from being in mutual situations. How WE felt. Not at all how YOU FEEL.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-24 04:15:45	@InfiniteKnot Again to everyone, it means you can't understand, feel of much worse judge what someone is going through. We all struggle.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-24 04:13:03	@InfiniteKnot However, to anyone else reading this out there, I live by this Rule: "It's not a contest." I've said that for over 20yrs.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-24 04:09:59	@InfiniteKnot Or maybe we are all malingerers. Hypochondriacs. Then the worst part is we get so sick from our own Jenga puzzles? Give up!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-24 04:06:21	@InfiniteKnot It DOES mean we have to advocate very hard when we have comorbidities because so many people don't understand. What???
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-24 03:33:01	@InfiniteKnot TLC? I'm sorry. I don't know that word. What is it? "Tuhlik?" *laughing* Am I back to stubborn again? I know though. I know...
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-24 03:27:49	@InfiniteKnot Painsomnia! Love it! I gave birth to "Inzombia." Which is under copyright everyone. If you say it, you must mention me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-24 03:23:30	@InfiniteKnot Yes, try pacing but I can be stubborn over things. Granted, I would NOT have been stubborn with more time! Call it PANIC!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-24 03:18:10	@Joannahertzberg Thanks for coming back! Now you can make better jokes than me! Although in Canada we still use lots UK etc idioms and more!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-24 03:13:31	@CanadaSoccerEN #CanMNT I finally got my Jersey for Kit today! Very special one! Had to exchange Kit Walkout. Too big. More coming!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 13:29:43	Moreover, my body is a sick body so it even worse? And I don't have any Medical Teams or Therapists to get to me fast.. Med. Post. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 13:23:10	God. I need to get back to my Medical Posts. No doubt I'm nuking my body (or affected parts) with Lactic Acid Insanity! A body is a body!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 13:07:58	@isseynfarran I'm sorry. I keep Tweeting you. I'm not some crazy stalker. I want to meet, Then you'll see I'm very awkward, weird and shy.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 12:48:03	Mind-Body Connection. I'm in so much pain now I can't sleep. It's giving me #insomnia I almost feel like I have #fybromalgia Or maybe?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 12:41:21	Either way, after so much pushing of my legs and really my entire body, when I sleep tonight, I will be in pain. Aching, not tension.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 12:38:11	@CanadaSoccerEN @isseynfarran Build up of Lactic Acid is a big issue for athletes. I wonder if/how it might affect me having a disability.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 12:29:12	After doing so much hard work on my body and pushing it so hard I could no longer walk today. I used my TENS but it didn't make a dent.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 10:44:38	@NormaFowlen Hi, via a weird Twitter update, I never got your Follow. Please feel free to come back if you're still interested. Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 10:39:59	@Joannahertzberg Wait a sec'. You Followed me but now you're not anymore. Get stuffed and no humour unless you follow me back. Cow. *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 10:36:11	@Joannahertzberg Bring on the Brit Humour. Shoot your arrows at me. Guns, poison, noose around the neck and more. I'll be your own Rasputin.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 10:09:35	@Butterflywgs Thanks for the Fave hon and good to see you! Been ages! *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 10:06:50	Radio Station. SNARF! Led Zeppelin to "...what is love...what is love...baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me... no more..." LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 10:02:29	But the best is this totally spazzy radio station I'm listening to. 70's, 80's and 90's which is great, but some of the songs they play? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 09:58:46	Too much to enjoy. Clean clothes. TWO pillows (I usually have six.) MY DUVET! Remote Controls that weren't lost for the TV and BOSE WAVE III
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 09:55:02	Home now. Don't think I #HAZMAT Suit from the Fumigation but I can still smell fumeage. Going to wear N95 to sleep. But now? No sleep.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 08:35:31	@CanadaSoccerEN Thank you so much for the Fave! That means the world! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 08:03:00	@CanadaSoccerEN @isseynfarran #CanMNT Waiting in pub for man who gave me this. His favourite footie Jersey. I'll try to smile better later.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-23 05:22:54	Let the waiting begin! Treating my place for the Bedbugs! Can't re-enter for 4-6hrs. I'm going for 6 because of my lungs. Have N95 Masks!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-22 04:47:04	Back to Crapassbedbughellaciousworld... *sighs* Sorry, but the drinks are on the Bedbugs tonight! Cheers! *does NOT toast the bastards*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-22 04:40:27	@InfiniteKnot Thanks about me finding my camera. Moving things around and losing them is one of my #ADD Specialties! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-22 04:38:01	@InfiniteKnot What are you talking about thank you for the Blogroll? You've been on my Blogroll forever!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-22 04:35:13	I look like I crawled out of a swamp, but I'm actually dry, not wet.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-22 04:20:28	Not using cane. Way to go, Dipshit.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-22 04:17:44	Okay. Still so much to do but in clear to bag any/all clothes if I can't clean them. Will def clean nuff for 2wks. 2nd treatment. Tired.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-22 03:04:17	I'll get back to everyone who is taking or wants to. Just Tweeting during breaks here and there. Not ignoring anyone! Won't ignore you!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-22 03:01:57	I can use my mobile with surgical procedure gloves. Cool. They pick up enough of my warmth. Although some Doctors on phones when you're...?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-22 02:23:36	FOUND IT!!! It was just like...in a techie place...where all techie type things go, right? It was in a bag too. #fuckme
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-22 02:10:40	MY FILM SLR IS PACKED AWAY AS I HAVE LEFT IT IN ORIGINAL BOXES ALONG WITH DIGITAL MANUALS!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-22 02:08:26	Still packing my entire life into huge bin bags. Medical procedure mask. Way too dusty. Before I scream, "Theft" WHERE IS MY DIGITAL SLR!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-19 18:21:15	Back to uni party days. Whenever I do sleep now, in clothes including shoes. I find it therapeutic actually. You did it before so fun now?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-19 18:14:42	Whoo. Up all night and morning? Angry to I don't care to exhausted to...who knows what next. Sleep meds at sunrise? Fuck.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-19 12:12:17	Feels nice. Open patio. AIR! Music playing on outside speakers. Not getting wasted. Yet? *smirks* Nah. It's all good. Best is FRESH AIR!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-19 12:00:29	Uh oh. Being reunited with some friends and drinks on offer. Who cares. Still pissed off. I'll be fine. They'll be sure I get home safe.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-19 11:52:56	Good guess from my history lessons and pathetic geography lessons. Guess where a gent from Caribbean and speaks. Haiti. Didn't get Spain.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-19 11:34:48	Ah, time to see some folks I know that know me... I little further from my neighbourhood. The drink offers are coming... *sigh*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-19 11:15:29	And I was having a really great day today too! #ohwell
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-19 11:12:02	Sorry kids. I'm off the wagon. #seethingaboutwhereilive
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-19 11:09:57	My Bedbug Treatment? Could I be more pissed off? No. Furniture a foot from walls. My life in bags, but mattress to wall? I'm fucking 100lbs.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 10:50:41	@CanadaSoccerEN You know two people are footie mad when today I was going to don my #CanMNT for #AZE and a man is giving me his #LFT Jersey!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 03:38:28	@CanadaSoccerEN That's it. Time to bring out the Big Guns. Canada Kit for AZERBAIJANI!!! I know. That might sound stupid BUT IT'S FOOTIE!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 03:35:53	@CanadaSoccerEN Crap. Tottenham just scored against Az. It's okay. 1-1. Screw it. GO AZERBAIJANI!!! CRAP!!! Tot another while typing this!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 03:32:34	@CanadaSoccerEN Azerbaijani vs. Tottenham 1-0 First 5 min! YEEAAHH! Enough of the UK for god's sake. Wanna put my Canada Kit on for Az!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 03:20:42	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for my Money Fave. You kill me!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 03:18:40	@InfiniteKnot Two appointments next week but I made them via phone. Yes we talked about that! But out of courtesy, not coming in!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 03:16:51	@InfiniteKnot Thanks hon. I have just enough money to do all of it! *laughs* I can get more though. Yes, I'm hanging in.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:40:46	Okay! Time for some tea for caffeine! Get me pumped for Bedbug Laundry?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:39:14	@InfiniteKnot But I'm going to ask them for some N95 ones or even better if I can find. So far N95 are best I know.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:37:10	@InfiniteKnot Have to contact Government Disability Folks. My basic Medical Procedure Masks are okay for my allergies and lighter Resp.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:34:17	@InfiniteKnot Yes, me too. I've gotten to the point where I can't even handle regular household cleaning solvents. These? Leave for hours.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:26:08	@InfiniteKnot Like other species, they look different as babies and have to learn how to do whatever an adult whatever does.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:23:23	@InfiniteKnot Yes! The Kingdom of Klutter! I grew up with cats so kitty fleas sometimes? No more bites. I think only adults might bite.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:19:25	@InfiniteKnot I should stop talking about this.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:18:51	@InfiniteKnot Difference between Adults and babies. I think a Queen laid an egg in a kitchen cupboard. I just about died opening it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:16:40	@InfiniteKnot Like me, wake up with bites. Drawn to blood. If exposed, not cleaned up, bigger army. Can travel by any means. Found on me!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:14:01	@InfiniteKnot Nocturnal preferred space to live but can be active during day. Night come out like an army and those who have allergen?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:10:35	@InfiniteKnot Nope. People argue so much about how they live, what they want, the whole thing. This is my take based upon 3rd experience.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:07:32	@InfiniteKnot Just have to do some "Creative Shoving" in my closet.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:06:20	@InfiniteKnot I'm still nowhere close and want to die. All clothes but blankets, Duvet and Cover, whack of Pillows. Nowhere to put.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:03:57	@InfiniteKnot That doesn't matter much either. They don't care about wet laundry *laughing* It's just what is sitting there to be done.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 02:01:45	@InfiniteKnot The Bedbugs? They do not like heat. Why you need to do laundry and dry it well. Or I have some things I must hang dry.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 01:59:05	@InfiniteKnot But many for health that are "obvious." As in, you actually see them working. However, ones that are "hidden." Seizure Dogs!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 01:54:45	@InfiniteKnot Yes, the things they train dogs to do! Not just Police Work and that. Which is rather(?) overblown on TV.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-18 01:51:45	@n8wachT Awww. I don't even know what to say to that. Owlie make Lemur speechless!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-16 02:08:32	@n8wachT *giggles* Good to see you. Been a long time.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-16 02:07:22	Doing laundry like crazy. Not easy. Wee PA sick. Very heavy. Now my #Weightedblanket must be washed! He's never seen water before! *scared*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-16 02:00:36	It's really cool to watch the #Bedbugs Trained Dogs to sniff around and go mental over a spot that is/might be bad. Yes, Trained Dogs.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-16 01:57:01	I have fucking #Bedbugs from living in this place AGAIN! x2. At least no roaches but things crawl through our vents. No control.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-16 01:54:13	@lifefitenessmi2 Thanks for the link. Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-15 01:51:12	Thanks back! Don't know what I do to deserve the honours from you! https:// twitter.com/uniquenites101 /status/643448386910339072 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-14 09:47:56	Can't wait! https:// twitter.com/CanadaSoccerEN /status/643166094413438976 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-14 08:42:57	@AvdonBahlmann I will say I actually do like Milan. Great Players.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-14 08:37:58	@AvdonBahlmann Hi. I didn't know you were Following me. Thank you. I'll make a joke but maybe a little with F.C. Milan. I'm CANADIAN!!! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-14 07:30:15	@ZippityHoHum Okay. Seriously? I need to reboot fucking Twitter!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-14 07:07:40	@ZippityHoHum Right place here.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-14 03:21:15	There's so much footie going on now, all I do is wakeup, check what time it is and turn on the TV for games! @CanadaSoccerEN @isseynfarran
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-14 01:16:43	@SeanBeeson @ZippityHoHum I feel the music you listened to when you were a teenager you NEVER stop playing! Bass and treble formative years.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-14 00:52:03	@patientanon Thanks for the Fave. We all have to stick together.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-14 00:31:25	I broke up with @CanadaSoccerEN because I just wasn't getting any answers from their site. But I love it too much so I have to stay. *sigh*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-12 09:19:48	Way to go. Way to fucking go you stupid bitch. That would be me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-12 09:05:44	@Zinquefty Mind-Body Connection.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-12 09:04:37	@Canageek Good. Glad it made it safe.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-12 09:02:42	@Zinquefty Hey, depression is depression and hiding under your blankets, hiding from even...the entire world? That sounds like depression?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-12 08:57:50	Back to feeling depressed all day and practically sleeping all day. Hep. can even go undetected forever as well. Maybe this will help me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-12 08:54:26	I'm being tested for Hep. A, B and C. Even why it is suspected doesn't matter! Mine is for my Immune System and...well, it doesn't matter!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-12 08:45:00	Wrote before ALL tests for my Liver now? Forgot! Even SUSPECTED communicable diseases? Report to Government. Like Medical Criminal Record!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-12 02:17:27	@InfiniteKnot Thank you. I think before I told you I'll take any support I can get! You too! 20yrs of wild drinking from Bipolar. Tough.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-12 02:05:35	@InfiniteKnot It's absolutely not and I have to stop.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-11 12:56:23	Going now. #PTSD must be tackled, handled, lived or survived through.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-11 12:53:49	No. Not as crazy as my last Tweets. It doesn't always come to you that quickly but #PTSD Hell. Can't define or narrow to a point. Just here.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-11 12:38:11	I'm tired of caring who likes me and doesn't in my life. Because they don't. Yes, what a pitiful Tweet. Poor me! Real me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-11 12:33:08	Lying on my bed looking at my legs down to my feet. How can you undo so many things. Learn your lessons. Paralysis. Please. From legs down.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-11 09:18:03	@ratedsports Thanks for the Follow. As we all know Footie is...well, IT IS!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-11 09:14:30	Gotta quit drinking but going out in style. Can only drink Vodka and Sake. So old favorites from past. White Russian now. #selfmedication
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-11 02:08:15	Now who doesn't love @simonpegg2 I'm watching "Run Fatboy Run" and I've eaten three full meals only half way through.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 04:24:11	@InfiniteKnot Also A LOT of effort. Neuro and GP will both call me and my Therapist will do Sessions over the phone if I'm too sick to go.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 04:21:49	@InfiniteKnot I am SO blessed to have put together my team (except Merlin #2) but he's getting ditched. I have a plan. But it's taken YEARS.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 04:18:00	@InfiniteKnot My Neuro also knows about the hysto stuff. All my Doctor's know everything about what's going on with me. He's cool with it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 04:15:33	@InfiniteKnot Already talked to my Neuro but just quickly over the phone to tell him I knew what it was. Going to make appt. for sure.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 04:12:02	@InfiniteKnot So with loss of SO much blood, the vasoconstriction just sucks it all up and I'm dying. During ovulation too.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 04:09:33	@InfiniteKnot It will also fix my dreadful anaemia problems because with Fibroids your periods can get heavier. Mine are so heavy.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 04:06:56	@InfiniteKnot Well with partial hysterectomy I won't have my period anymore and this is all catamenial. To do with me getting my period!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 04:04:04	@InfiniteKnot A full and ultimately all of the organs withdrawn through the vagina. Also amazing to look what is really inside you! *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 04:01:24	@InfiniteKnot It's so easy. No longer invasive like the old days. I watched a documentary years ago and so cool.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 03:58:41	@InfiniteKnot Moreover, it's generally the most procedure done for women with problems and don't want to have kids anymore.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 03:56:36	@InfiniteKnot That was the rationale for getting a partial hysterectomy. So much would stop them! Now? I think we definitely have to do it?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 03:54:28	@InfiniteKnot Oh! I missed this one! Exactly! Like you can control your hormones! However, for my extremely awful Fibroid Problems?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 03:49:57	@InfiniteKnot Absolutely!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 03:36:37	@InfiniteKnot Also, no Gyno appointment until early March. O.o However, I can call back on one day for cancellations. Thanks again, beauty.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-10 03:33:35	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. They really are brutal and sometimes incontrollable. Ergots not available here so have to work with my Triptans.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-09 09:01:03	@JustinTrudeau You and your #RealChange is the worst of Liberal Rhetoric revived from the past. Read my Tweets! You shame your father!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-09 08:54:26	@JustinTrudeau Those who are on ODSP, OW, barely making ends meet. People with no money to find housing. This is WHAT WE NEED!!! AND MORE!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-09 08:50:59	@JustinTrudeau You know what? All you talk about is the "Middle Class" getting benefits. What about people who REALLY need money.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-09 08:46:55	Oh, so loving you @Zinquefty https:// twitter.com/Zinquefty/stat us/641411665771241473 …
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-09 08:43:10	@CanadaSoccerEN Hey, it's okay! You'll still film it so it can be seen later. Looking forward to it but I can wait! #canMNT #CanadaRED

16253011	patientanon	2015-09-09 05:27:04	Try hard to be yourself. Who you REALLY are. Will others notice? You might be happily surprised. But the biggest surprise is YOU'LL notice.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-09 05:04:55	I'm going 3-1. Clearly ours is 3? *laughing* https:// twitter.com/CanadaSoccerEN /status/641355185932005378 …

16253011	patientanon	2015-09-09 04:21:39	On way home from GP. My "Liver of Stone" getting scuffed? Lamictal Levels a bit high so I can fix that. But bloods/serum ordered? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-09 04:15:00	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Fave hon.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-09 04:13:15	I give so many people I love gifts. Sometimes I think many times it's because I can't express my feelings for each of them. #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-08 11:58:12	@CanadaSoccerEN Their food is making me hungry dammit! I need someone to cook for me. Any volunteers out there?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-08 04:10:46	Folks, if you are giving me "Likes" and I'm not thanking you, no offense. I'm only getting Notices when never before.

16253011	patientanon	2015-09-06 06:09:07	@CanadaSoccerEN @isseynfarran Soccer has meaning to me. First sport played as kid. Only girl on all boys team. Wanted me off team! I STAYED.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-06 05:57:04	So loving @CanadaSoccerEN and @isseynfarran wonderful to hear of your past career and experience during the last game. Fabulous!

16253011	patientanon	2015-09-02 04:19:33	@stephencrose Thank you Stephen. I appreciate your care very much too. I slept for a long time. Much needed. Feeling a bit better today. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-02 00:25:09	@InfiniteKnot Or, I'll call again... Just need to relax for a bit, you know? I'm so spinny I don't feel capable of calling. That's not me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-02 00:22:16	@InfiniteKnot I had already taken my meds so I just went to sleep. Maybe my GP's backup will call me back. Didn't yesterday. GP vacation.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-02 00:19:32	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. Was like the old Suicide Hotline joke. "Hold, please..." My battery died as soon as I was going to call.
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-01 12:55:45	I think I need to call place for help. It's really good. See if any beds. Not psych but SWs. Again, get help when you're in trouble!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-01 10:48:08	I could be killing myself slowly with a huge #TBI and #selfmedication but you can't think clearly in this state. So happy for help coming?
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-01 10:34:56	Try not to commit #suicide no matter how hard you're getting sucked into the hole. Fight! I almost died and took all the living with me!
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-01 10:26:45	@ukschizophrenic XX
16253011	patientanon	2015-09-01 09:35:31	I've got my BOSE Wave III to kill my neighbour's ears, but my BAZOOKA $10 USB Desktop Speakers from my bed REALLY doed the job! Yes, $10.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-31 23:42:10	@stephencrose We are changing the world by only sitting quietly, merely pondering it, and/or observing it with our eyes.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-31 01:43:24	@scanman I'll probably contact you when I wake up and my battery does too. "Ding!" Time to die! Maybe for both of us. *giggles* xo
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-31 01:40:41	@scanman Vij, going to DM you more details about my presentation, MRI etc. You might need to check out details MRI's for IAC'S. Relevant.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-31 01:35:07	@youshouldsee Yes, should be. Publisher has few more adapted Classics mentioned on back flap, but didn't see Wuthering Heights. Love it!
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-30 10:51:56	When you wish upon a star, there are very high probabilities you are wishing upon a planet. Sorry to burst your bubble.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-30 09:54:53	@chrisga42086279 Oh, dear. In my sorrow, I didn't realize it was a Fave. Thank you. I'm so sorry.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-30 09:52:57	@chrisga42086279 Thanks for the RT.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-30 09:45:19	I'm never going to be with anyone ever again!!! *weeps*
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-30 09:43:37	I'm never going to end up with the girl I met today from the #anime and #manga shop. I'm listening to sad songs by The Smiths. *hangs head*
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-30 08:37:46	Couldn't resist buying THIS today! #manga version of "Emma" by Jane Austen.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-30 07:07:51	@Ascii211 I'll take that as a compliment, sweetie.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-30 06:39:38	@Zinquefty Thanks for the Fave hon!
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-30 06:38:28	Girl in store while shopping with @Zinquefty Gorgeous! Would date me but employees can't date customers. Said call if new job. She agreed!
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-30 06:30:58	Out with @Zinquefty after buying WAY too much #anime and #manga Now having WAY too much #sake
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 20:31:09	@scanman Okay. I'll give it a shot. Best lingerie too in case I die. Must look my best! No, my Therapist is awesome! So laid back!
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 20:14:05	@scanman People with #Asperger 's/others on the Spectrum always put their clothes on backwards. Never done that with my underwear though.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 20:09:25	@scanman Well, I'm half Pakistani. How's that! You'd never be able to tell though. I was more dark as a kid but now I'm more white. Huh?
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 20:03:28	@scanman Hey baby! I'm a Pro! This was third MRI, had three EEGs, CTs? A million X-rays! I'm surprised I don't glow! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 19:59:41	@scanman Crap for some things. MRI is better. But presentation and entire event screams, "STROKE!" And in Canada, we don't pay.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 19:57:28	@scanman The CT was clean. My Doctor in hospital was pissed off. I couldn't get one when inpatient. The faster the better! CT crap too
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 19:54:37	@scanman You can fucking swear to me Vij'. How long have we known each other? As far as my ovaries keeping them. Partial hysterectomy.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 19:51:26	@scanman Yes around there, Internal Auditory Meatus, 8th Cranial Nerve so it shifts lower, even to Cranial Spine!
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 19:44:46	@scanman I even questioned the value of an IAC at first. What? I can hear! My GP is on vacation but back soon. She'll kick their asses.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 19:40:13	@scanman Hi Vijay. You know Dr. PA is always on duty! Just a consult with Colleagues. Seemed too to me. An IAC? Internal Auditory Canal.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 19:34:08	Your welcome! @uniquenites101 @GAautismmom @AngelaBryanta53 @lemarocain1962
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 03:05:14	I think I might have someone else Following me who is in #Radiology If so, sorry I didn't contact you directly about my #MRI I can't think.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 02:38:12	Regarding my last Tweet. Slow delivery of my #MRI to my Doctor. IAC'S, stroke. Would appreciate any #Radiologist #Radiology input. Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-29 02:27:20	My #MRI from hospital hasn't been sent to Doctor yet. Been week. Possible stroke. IAC's ordered. @scanman my friend, ideas? Also Hi Honey!

16253011	patientanon	2015-08-22 10:05:03	@gueveracheche Wait a minute! My spelling deceived me! It is the Spectrum. I no longer work with graphics and I'm half asleep.

16253011	patientanon	2015-08-21 01:36:04	@uniquenites101 @ihearingdevices Thank you too and you're very welcome!
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-21 01:34:47	@InfiniteKnot *grins* Excellent to hear I'm not the only one!
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-19 11:52:39	Okay. Time to shut it. Laters.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-19 11:51:27	Wait. My #TBI and Tweets @catdeeley ! I'm living in "Oh yeah. I forgot that." World. So not my meds making me sound all stupid. Head Injury!
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-19 11:43:48	Yes, yes! I've taken my meds! Probably why I'm being such an idiot. Back to some kind of abnormal, unpredictable, messy #TBI tomorrow.

16253011	patientanon	2015-08-07 23:32:51	@harriekd When you get a #TBI your brain and body is a wreck. Well, they can be if it's a really big one and this is one of my biggest ever.
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-07 23:29:22	@harriekd I recently was in hospital for maybe a stroke. That's the #TBI part. Before, got Twitter Followers, Faves, etc mixed up incl. you!
16253011	patientanon	2015-08-07 23:17:19	@harriekd OMG What the hell! Uber #TBI Crapness! I thought someone was you and they were you but were really someone else. No Twitter today.

16253011	patientanon	2015-08-07 01:41:32	@JNChaney That's one of the things I like about the Anime and Manga World. Certain tastes or no clue but certain Publications? Score.

16253011	patientanon	2015-08-05 10:09:23	I hate having a massive TBI. Everything I say hurts people or makes them mad. Can't control my emotions, impulse control, more. Train wreck.

16253011	patientanon	2015-07-17 10:36:35	Can't decide which Tallis Scholars CD to listen to. Allegre Miserere plus Palestrina or only Taverner. Taverner wins.

16253011	patientanon	2015-07-14 10:59:14	The absolute worst about being in a long term #PTSD state is a brief period of clarity. Then only to get thrown back into the meat grinder.
16253011	patientanon	2015-07-14 10:47:40	I rarely ride the #PTSD Express Train with no stops until the end destination. When it stops? You're still dying. Now? Long trip I think.
16253011	patientanon	2015-07-14 10:39:09	It's a really good thing I don't own a gun. I always say this. I'd be dead faster than I could pull the trigger. Two days non-stop #PTSD

16253011	patientanon	2015-07-11 08:32:07	Okay. As hard as it is to play DJ for you all, it might be supremely annoying. So. The end? Paul Weller is a genius. Mark Hollis too.

16253011	patientanon	2015-06-17 01:36:39	Wait. My head covered brain is not clear. I'm a full believer in Free Speech even when it's disgusting. We also have a Communist Party here.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-17 01:32:04	Wait a minute. BANDANA IN PROTEST! Hmmm. Okay, enough.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-17 01:29:48	I'M ONLY A BIGOT AGAINST BIGOTS!! Between that statement and my twisted, outrageous sense of humour? But I really don't discriminate AT ALL!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-17 01:20:14	Going to do laundry wearing a ridiculous Che Guevara bandana I bought in Cuba years ago. Tenants will think neat! #onlyguiltyoftwistedhumour
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-17 01:07:59	There's an "odd" building across the street from me. Forming Political Party? Seem Anti-Semetic, Black, Asian, Gay...
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-17 01:01:26	@BipolarHotMess You are most welcome!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-16 09:30:53	#SYTYCD It's back! Time for a New Season! Yes, I love the show. If you think it's stupid nuts to you!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-15 23:59:13	@searchholistics Thanks for the RT.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-15 22:49:36	Great. #Twitter Crash! Locked me out completely. Appropriate as I'm now sitting in the waiting room for my #Therapy Appointment. *wry grin*
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-15 22:11:08	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Fave. Sober PA stops when she knows something might drive someone over the edge. Revisit it later. Hurting me!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-15 22:02:54	@InfiniteKnot Granted, it's a slippery slope. Where do you draw the line of hurting ANYONE when you're not sober? You can't think clearly!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-15 21:59:32	@InfiniteKnot People. Ultimately. I think what it all comes down to is anything you say when altered that hurts them.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-15 21:55:40	@InfiniteKnot And yet, my Blog is the Real Me. So okay, see me all drunk, not making sense of trying to make sense of what I feel.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-15 21:52:29	@InfiniteKnot Some people have said it's okay when I've done it as they have too, but I'm very hard on myself. Drunken Blog Posts too!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-15 21:49:32	@InfiniteKnot Indeed. Fine to josh and be crazy on Twitter but when drinking next day I've felt so awful like I have a Twitter Hangover!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-15 21:43:45	@alphabetania Hey! Good to see you! Long time. My Carb Levels have always been good. Now I'm told to just eat period because I'm too wee!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 14:48:17	Too much damn potato in the water so definitely nighty. Take care all.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 14:45:45	Oh, nighty. More of music and if you can figure out my visual stim in that Tweet. For some reason #Portishead is ringing in my ears s'okay.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 14:35:24	@ukschizophrenic Thanks, luv.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 13:45:29	Chillin', relaxing. Tunes. Free from band if still on offer. Check #PositivelyDark
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 13:41:27	@MyBipolarLife02 Cheers, mate. PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 13:17:54	@Canageek Don't fret love. Wait! Where's my remote for my stereo!!! Did that make you smile? Just really hard times right now. xx
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 13:00:56	You need to get out in the real world and not suffocate online.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 12:53:48	Ah, the only one I CAN trust? *shakes head and sighs* Even online "family" say through #Twitter has lost its shine.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 12:48:31	Oh dear, it's an email from family right now. Should I ignore it? Let's see which member. Lovely.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 12:45:55	@NewDawnDiaries You're most welcome.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 12:45:06	@MyBipolarLife02 You're welcome.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 12:44:06	@ukschizophrenic XX and back?
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 12:43:06	Which member of my family is going to crucify me first? Including me?
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-14 10:41:19	Writing emotionally overwhelming emails should never be done when really drunk. That might apply for Tweets as well.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 11:09:11	Any actors out there? Definitely live stage! Until I went skydiving, biggest rush ever. End, close then open curtain, walk to audience.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 10:26:07	@D8Iveta Check your stars. I'm there. Guess what. New computer "broke." Can't see things on Mobile! Back to you guys so no withdrawal.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 10:19:07	@D8Iveta I'm not sure if you remember me but I said I was OD'ing on you and Nick taking on Ballroom Blitz. Then we blitzed about your loss.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 10:04:25	@NewDawnDiaries You're very welcome and definitely reciprocal.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 10:02:20	@MyBipolarLife02 You're very welcome again!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 05:10:22	Okay, going to rest. Home from hospital 0300hrs? Later? Think so. Give new antibiotics a spin and see what they'll do. Have fun, kids.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 05:04:44	@MyBipolarLife02 You're welcome, and thanks for all of your links too. You must be really busy there.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 04:51:54	@fulolitalago8 Knew it was Spanish! All the "Romance Languages" are similar. People think English is in the that group. No, it's Germanic.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 04:35:29	@lovekoan Indeed.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 03:18:21	@Rhiskiboi91 That is, only if feel comfortable and okay with it. I mean, we just met! But my email is on my blog if you want to contact me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 03:16:02	@Rhiskiboi91 Your profile mentioned a lot about history. I'm working on a project and I was thinking maybe you could help me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 03:12:51	@Rhiskiboi91 Hi Ryan. I'm sorry if it took a long time to get back to you. WP did an update. Now things are weird. Or I should say working.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 03:07:35	@reesdoc Nor do I give out anything I "know" or don't know. Every time I say I'm Dr. PA disclosures everywhere! Even citing papers by peers.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 02:59:30	@reesdoc I'm not a Professional but was on my way. Medical Newsletter came to me personally as Dr. Perfect for blog! Dr. PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 02:49:57	@BipolarHotMess I positively love your moniker. THEE Bipolar Hot Mess. AbsoRadTotallyFab. Signed, Wee PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 02:27:58	@CarneyBoettche If anyone said my work was like Miller's I'd die on the spot. It can't be too soon though. I have Gallery Space booked.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 02:22:21	@CarneyBoettche However this really freaked me out. Shot I took 20yrs ago at abandoned brick factory. Near identical to that famous one!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 02:16:56	@CarneyBoettche I'm Lee Miller. No doubt unoriginal choice but shoot same things, style. I have the sarcastic wit etc.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 02:11:10	@CarneyBoettche Thanks for the Follow. Who's your favorite photographer for inspiration, visual-whoa, my shots look similar? Your "idol?"
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 02:03:15	@lovekoan I figured it out right when you emailed me. My ex-gf and how ugly that went on and on. Great to be scared for your life! Panicked
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 01:53:39	@lovekoan Unless you ARE another person, not involved in my last Tweet, please step forward and identify yourself--via email or DM.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 01:50:00	@lovekoan I should have known by your spelling. Now you know where I live? All contact was ordered to cease immediately!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 01:36:06	@lovekoan Miss me. Why so? Because I'm not on Twitter so much? I've still got my email address. Use that to talk. Don't be shy!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 01:26:56	@EnigmaAnonymous Thanks, Sweetie. I can't even type on my mobile here! Time to grab baby stylus. New antibiotics now so let's hope.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-08 01:22:24	@MegaSaadov Thank you for the Fave.

16253011	patientanon	2015-06-07 13:20:23	Not at my regular geographical hospital obviously! They are terrible! This a great one downtown.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-07 13:16:01	The Dr.? My new "prescription" came right from a med cabinet IN THE ER!!! He said he felt so awful for being so sick and wanted give them.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-07 13:12:13	Gave a girl some smokes as she was really upset. $25 cab ride but too much. Unsafe transit. No money. All her friends gave me $5.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-07 13:08:29	The uber-kindness of people. Just got out of hospital AGAIN since the antibiotic for the pneumonia has nearly me. Diapers for sleep!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-03 09:38:12	Different hospital than 1-4. Better. But I hope they admit me somewhere. At least nurses know I can't walk and said stay in bed!
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-03 09:38:12	911 for the inexplicable pneumonia! This is the 5th time. Fell with Paramedics. I'm not safe at home. Also wanting to sleep with 103F fever.
16253011	patientanon	2015-06-02 01:01:56	@pkomarek Thanks so much for the Fave.

16253011	patientanon	2015-05-29 08:06:00	And that famous person? We went out for dinner and drinks a couple of times.
16253011	patientanon	2015-05-29 08:02:58	You also know the resto is good when you ask them not to serve your meal and hold it because you're going for a cigarette. I am now.
16253011	patientanon	2015-05-29 07:58:18	Today #epicfail in all I tried to do. I am now treating myself to a VERY expensive dinner, cross from a condo of someone famous I know.
16253011	patientanon	2015-05-29 01:52:25	@Zinquefty Lighting bolts? Maybe they're not. They just look so sideways? O.o I bought it years ago. Don't remember what Surplus Guy said.
16253011	patientanon	2015-05-29 01:47:26	@Zinquefty that would account for the three chevrons. However, the bird and lighting bolts. I'm guessing bird is eagle. All patches as U.S.
16253011	patientanon	2015-05-29 01:43:12	@Zinquefty HA! Loving the new Twitter handle. So a friend said my #cosplay Rank was Chief Petty Officer 3rd Class. Boss of all POs below...

16253011	patientanon	2015-05-29 00:30:26	@InfiniteKnot The whole house didn't fall down. It means you have to get back to the point of very painful self examination and triggers!
16253011	patientanon	2015-05-29 00:27:38	@InfiniteKnot some trigger and you do end up drinking for so brief a period doesn't really mean your not "sober" anymore. It didn't continue
16253011	patientanon	2015-05-29 00:22:21	@InfiniteKnot ONE time. Then they continue and all is right for them again. Back to being sober for long periods. I think if you have
16253011	patientanon	2015-05-29 00:18:37	@InfiniteKnot Thanks hon. I've seen people feel so disgusted with themselves for only having a drink or just two in AA. But it was just that

16253011	patientanon	2015-04-20 21:03:30	@medivizor It was difficult to write because of the limited space of Twitter. Otherwise it might have been more clear. Or not! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-04-20 20:59:17	@medivizor The Tweet after re: talking about a drug in pharmacological terms was a joke "resume" for you. A small peek into what I do know.

16253011	patientanon	2015-03-23 06:58:56	@Zinquefty Thank you. Need your uh...c's right now as life falling apart. Whenever you want to come? As per last Tweets. Close and will cry?
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-23 06:53:41	@Ascii211 Yes you are right as PLF basically.
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-23 06:52:07	Apparently I've hurt both of them with machetes, I've been a selfish bitch from the womb. NTs so blame my #Aspergers as excuse for all I did

16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:41:52	@Ascii211 Looked like a drunk bird.
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:40:57	@Ascii211 BUT THE WIND!!! PRESSURE!!! I just fell when you're supposed to arch your back to check if your chute is okay. I just flew. Tiny.
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:37:13	@Ascii211 Weird to explain. Grab here. Step here but you have to put the opposite foot out first so you kind of cross your legs.
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:34:48	@Ascii211 Minimum air for a jump is about 3,000 ft. No lower! Hardest thing is getting out on the wing. You have to do this almost dance!
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:32:23	@Ascii211 ...as soon as you're out of the plane. Professional Jumpmaster there to help everyone out after we're taught everything all day.
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:29:59	@Ascii211 First jump called Static Line. You're actually attached to the plane so you don't even pull your square. Just pops open...
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:27:23	@Ascii211 Nah. All professional. You can just go to places where they offer to do it for people. First jump and any jump period totally safe
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:21:49	@Ascii211 hang on! So you have to learn to land properly.
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:20:48	@Ascii211 ...you always see? Wtf name huh? Your reserve your yank from your chest but it's round. Army! Heh. No strings to control. Just...
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:17:39	@Ascii211 ...pull your reserve. Yes I've been skydiving. Thing is, strings are attached to your square-which is really a rectangle shape...
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:14:31	@Ascii211 Parachute Landing Fall. If your for first chute is all knotted up or your strings are as well or on their own, you have to...
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 09:00:50	Oh. Now it's Hyper-ballad that was dedicated to me from a LDR. About jumping off a mountain. Maybe I should change this CD? ∗crosses eyes∗

16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 08:42:20	@Ascii211 HA! You haven't met my family. Over my balcony and doing a PLF was MY WAY of relaxing.

16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 08:38:29	@Ascii211 However, that does not overrule my psych issues. Not 100% ∗Aspie wink∗
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 08:36:40	@Ascii211 No kidding! Me being an #Aspie , well a lot of us have our areas of perception and thought where we can excel. Mine is LOGIC!

16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 08:28:03	@Ascii211 Called for hospital. Always fun. Obscene stress with family. My Outpatient SW thinks I on the ball. Addition back
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 08:24:49	@Ascii211 A LOT. Uh. Ok. Tried to jump off balcony but not really die. Just mess myself doing a PLF. Feet stuck for bad physics, geometry.

16253011	patientanon	2015-03-17 08:12:23	I'm supremely out of my mind. Thank god for my ACs. Only things holding me together. I never knew needing #ADD meds up could do this to me.

16253011	patientanon	2015-03-13 06:37:35	I'm home now. From hospital. Exhausted. Napping on off but #Detox and #Withdrawal always terrible. Even did #selfharm in ER. But discharge.

16253011	patientanon	2015-03-12 11:17:10	My phone is frozen somehow but I can't do the PLF. I think I need to go to the goddamn Ward. Self Admit is a bitch but hey gonna jump?
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-12 10:29:09	Plus no weight of gear. Freefall of my body alone. Yes, I have done skydiving. That's why I'd need to do damn good PLF. To break me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-12 10:25:03	Rather injured as I wouldn't have a chute but it's too low for a chute anyway. It would be a total dead round low altitude but wind.
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-12 10:21:03	Fuck me I want to do a PLF off my patio right now. SO many times! PLF = Parachute Landing Fall. I wouldn't die. But get MAYBE MESSED UP.

16253011	patientanon	2015-03-02 01:31:06	@rmlupo Now I'm taking a huge, long vacation from technology (lest mobile which can't compare with a machine) AND I'M LOVING IT!
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-02 01:28:08	@rmlupo I think I want to go back to that original plan even if it will take weeks. Too much rush to get me up and running.
16253011	patientanon	2015-03-02 01:26:19	@rmlupo Still don't have my Mac. Problem when I got home to do my data dump. Original plan was not stock but factory build.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 08:03:31	S'okay. Beautiful crescent moon. Translates to every male around me having Testosterone Menstruation.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 07:33:33	@rmlupo Indeed. My dead machine was the original MacBook. And yes, funeral after 11 years. Very solid! No fuss, no muss. They run themselves
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 07:25:21	@rmlupo Then there's the entire issue of doing my own data dump from my old machine onto the new. Backup. Sexy LaCie though! A Porsche! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 07:22:03	@rmlupo I'm so exhausted from being broke and dealing with workarounds, buying other peripherals later, I haven't even touched it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 07:17:02	@rmlupo ∗sends you Mac love∗
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 07:15:32	@rmlupo Good to hear positive response but BOO HOO about the battery! Yes, charge intermittently but always do a dead to full regularly.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 06:58:55	I also got a case. Check out the cocoon GRID-IT. Elasticity of a 3D Crossword Puzzle. Stick a whack a what in it!
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 06:41:47	Got new Mac today. MacBook Air. Some SNAFUS along the way but most importantly I needed a new machine yesterday. Literally. Or days before.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:56:36	@StrangeChicken8 I think they didn't do any introductions because he already knew he was going to meet her as her avatar. Understood.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:54:17	@StrangeChicken8 My heart would actually be torn to shreds by a computer program! It would!
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:52:37	@StrangeChicken8 Me having a problem with it? I don't know. I've had LDRs with people and fateful disasters. I'd end up the same with AI!
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:46:34	@StrangeChicken8 And yet, she is still understanding parts of the real world like she's on crack. Eventually they break up. Lot my memory.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:43:37	@StrangeChicken8 She doesn't see it as a problem because she's a computer program way beyond the others to make people's lives easier.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:41:47	@StrangeChicken8 The truth comes out. She's been virtually "cheating" on him. He loses it because he can't live without her.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:39:25	@StrangeChicken8 Recall, she was different and intelligent. So she was wandering all over the online world, not just spending time with Theo
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:37:20	@StrangeChicken8 She loved creating the avatar of herself. She was enjoying so much freedom and open space. Learning about the world!
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:35:18	@StrangeChicken8 So he runs back to his computer and some things have changed a bit. A twist. Online sex with him was no longer enough.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:32:58	@StrangeChicken8 That's why he fell so hard for her in online form. Seeing her "for real" kind of made his already unstable mind teeter more
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:30:15	@StrangeChicken8 This was pivotal. Very. Samantha was different from the other AI System Women. She was almost TOO real.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:28:00	@StrangeChicken8 I'm too tired to quit reading but I recall "Samantha" the computer generated woman created a physical avatar for him.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:21:18	@StrangeChicken8 Okay. The blonde was Scarlett Johansson.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:19:12	@StrangeChicken8 I do recall, I think the woman was...what actor? Oh, bother! I can see her face in me dumb arse head! ∗runs to IMDb∗
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:16:19	@StrangeChicken8 I have a terrible time remembering media. Which is good. I can keep watching the same movies and books over and over.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:13:25	@InfiniteKnot ...at some point. Depressed, afraid, knows more than telling me? I'm praying. Thank you again for your care. You are so good.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:10:20	@InfiniteKnot I told him to call me back (quickly) to know the results as we always communicated that way. He then said he'd call me...
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:07:49	@InfiniteKnot When I spoke to him last night he wasn't making jokes about it all as in the past. We talked of the situation and procedures.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-25 04:05:12	@InfiniteKnot Hi you. Thanks. He's an older man who has been struggling with heart disease for years. Normally he's in a state of humour.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-24 10:57:57	Currently icing hand on and off. All bruised and swollen. Huh? O.o #clumsy

16253011	patientanon	2015-02-24 06:09:49	Official Funeral Announcement: baby MacBook has died. Tomorrow after the service I gotta get an immediate solution. For 11yrs. I love you.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 23:45:31	Oh, crap. I have a cold/virus. My ferritin has dropped so another IV Infusion. They take almost 4hrs! Bring lots of entertainment!
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 22:47:07	People with epilepsy have an uncountable number of nicotine receptors than people who don't have epilepsy so even if you don't seize be safe
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 22:41:50	Some things are the same with the Detox/Withdrawal and alcohol but it's all the nicotine receptors in brains of people with epilepsy. Taper.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 22:25:38	Not so stable right now. It's a bit different. Since I joined #AA I've made it though Detox/Withdrawal there. Now nicotine. Quit yesterday.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 22:17:16	@InfiniteKnot I will stay silent about who gets battered and judged BY OUR OWN COMMUNITY for god's sake. It's disgusting.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 22:12:36	@InfiniteKnot Another phrase I live by is, "It's not a content!" We all have issues and you can never measure another person's pain.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 22:09:16	@InfiniteKnot Because of my Blog, Twitter and hearing many people say even worse things than I did. It gets me so angry and frustrated.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 22:06:14	@InfiniteKnot You're welcome. Heat of the moment but, reason. Not an excuse. I live by that rule. Now I have actually broken it!
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 22:01:04	My Therapist in gone until March 23. Declare me beyond survival now. What's the point in waiting? OMG I wrote I five page letter to GP!
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 21:51:41	No Physio today. Sick. Legs and feet probably need more rest anyway. How stupid is this? In trying to lessen one injury, developed another
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 21:38:05	I apologize to everyone else and you as well @InfiniteKnot I did not wish to cast any of us in negative light. Heat of moment.Tweet deleted.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 07:43:32	I think the cold weather is making me write useless Tweets.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 07:42:21	Weather will keep me inside so I won't go out and drink after a REALLY shitty day. That's good.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 07:37:43	SPAZ Weather? Will fill like -30 degrees C° tonight. O_o
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 07:34:21	Oh, warm car. Just got on Accessible Transit. Home. Bed. GP yesterday, Asshole Merlin 2 today, Physio tomorrow, AA on weekend. Fun? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 06:22:56	I just totally ranted about my last few Tweets to this server at Starfucks. I told her everything! She started ranting along with me! HA!
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 06:02:12	I am now in a Starfucks waiting for Transit home. I've got lots of time. Retail Therapy at a Graphic Novel shop nearby. Evil.Prick.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 05:56:22	One good thing is I found my wonderful Merlin 1 is still in practise! I called him as soon as I left. He might be able to help me somehow.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 05:45:39	That's it! I've had it with Merlin 2! He won't increase my Biphentin a measly 10mg because he thinks I'll have a heart attack or something!
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 02:53:34	@InfiniteKnot Well I couldn't be doing this without all the support you have given me for so long! Forever! And not just this, so much more.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 02:02:30	@StrangeChicken8 He only wanted to picture him mind. Broke up with AI, blond in future? Okay. I'm being a total SPAZ. It's called IMDb? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 01:55:22	@StrangeChicken8 Oh, wait. Blonde? Oh, dear. A real person or virtual persona? I maybe he did both! Remote to AI for date. But no visual.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-19 01:48:59	@StrangeChicken8 Hi dear. If I remember correctly he did. Because remember him spinning around with all lights in the Trailer?
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-18 08:57:12	@CalliCoop Thanks. Know bartender here now. We've shared lots of personal information so I told him about the #AA Drink free. Love to me.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-18 08:53:05	If anyone wants to Tweet or email me, that's fine. Computer practically dead so can't see people all the time though. New Mac coming. #AA
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-18 08:44:57	Okay. Fuck it. I'm out of here. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Not drinking it. No more Twitter right now too. Sorry. Home! #AA
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-18 08:38:28	@InfiniteKnot Thanks too dear.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-18 08:37:36	@CalliCoop Thanks for your support too hon. Shaking now but not from the cold weather! #AA
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-18 08:35:17	@CalliCoop Drinking water. Keep going outside for air to try and focus. And it's FREEZING air. VERY cold here! Another one now. #AA
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-18 08:29:39	Sittin' in my local pub. Ordered a drink. Haven't touched it. TRYING to read but just keep picking it up, looking at it and thinking of #AA

16253011	patientanon	2015-02-14 07:01:42	@StrangeChicken8 YES! I have! But I cried at the end.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 12:50:12	@moritherapy Thanks for the Fave. Winter is going to be a lot longer. Will the joke get too old? LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 12:43:06	Limping, Flapping, Time for an #Aspie Bed Dance. Stressed about #Therapy tomorrow or just waking up. Meddy and Beddy. Night.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 10:50:43	I hate to say Twitter's so damn naff but it is. Except for very important DM-ness just now. It's really kinda naff now so I must leave.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 10:47:38	@moritherapy Lots more snow, lots more loud music! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 10:13:02	@samwhatisit Thanks again Ands for the Fave. I have something to discuss with you. You inspired me. An explanation via DM though.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 06:19:04	@StrangeChicken8 Yes. It is emotional but I love the piece done by the artist. You can probably figure out which one is me. Cyborg.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 06:15:50	I'm out. Said I'd get off silly Twitter but I have messages. Although I don't always get them via Plume so not ignoring. Need computer.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 05:09:06	Okay. I'm going to go out and play in the blizzard. I need to test my injured ankle again. love to all.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 05:07:20	@Zinquefty My 1TB external is called a Porsche! Fancy Pants! I drive a Porsche now! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 05:06:04	@Zinquefty So I let baby just rest for a few hours and no more lock out, working fine, did the backup. Now, everything/final before new one.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 05:04:47	@Zinquefty All just had to be done slowly as she didn't want things to bust with too much read/write. Which it almost did BEFORE the backup
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 05:03:47	@Zinquefty Oh! It's all done! Just slowly to the Storage Mount for initial save and she partitioned things so proper backup.
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 05:01:50	It's a full on blizzard here. Maybe go out tripping and falling in the snow for some "exercise." Being in bed all the time hurts. 50/50?
16253011	patientanon	2015-02-09 04:57:09	Okay. Hours on Twitter. baby MacBook is giving me the Spinning Beach Ball now. We both need a break. Some changes so a backup later. Ugh.

16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:23:31	@Ascii211 Oh boo! That stinks. TV okay? Bundle up and watch that and/or movies?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:22:32	@Ascii211 Okay. My bed is yearning for me or I'm yearning for my bed. Something like that. Bye dear.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:21:06	@Ascii211 Oh, bless you. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:20:19	@Ascii211 Email me whenever you want and I can send the photo. Then you can get an idea. No rush. Do it when you're bored? *smirks*
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:17:22	@Ascii211 Might have to do everything on the cheap but will be selling on the cheap! $1.00!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:16:23	@Ascii211 Also it's not going to be shown that fast. I need Pro's to look at my work, would like to mat/frame on my own but yikes more $$$!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:13:21	@Ascii211 Well, only fair if we're collaborating and if it's not too hard to do. And if doesn't bankrupt me! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:09:59	@Ascii211 Oh, not your bad. I just can't understand that stuff anyway! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:08:56	@Ascii211 Meaning, I will give you credit as well as my name when it's up for sale. The second I want to keep for my own collection.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:07:27	@Ascii211 Unless you are unbelievably famous or have a great career on the rise. In return for some payment I will add your name to it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:04:21	@Ascii211 I've secured Gallery Space before even having work to show! It's TOTALLY backwards! You need your work to get the SPACE!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:01:50	@Ascii211 Bear in mind, I don't have much $! I think I'd like two as well. This is RIDICULOUS for an artist!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 11:00:13	@Ascii211 As far as my photo and the etch. It wouldn't have to be huge. Why don't I just send it to you and we can talk size and $?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 10:58:26	@Ascii211 Okay. Didn't know if you put anything up after that. The document? NO CLUE. But the pictures looked cool! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 10:18:16	@finicprint Thanks for the Fave about me sounding stupid and loving Chiodo! Cheers, PA
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 10:06:35	@rehanadesigner She also gave me a smaller book of Chiodo's stuff. One piece I've nicked as my avatar! Sorry Joe but I need it! TO SURVIVE!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 10:03:23	@rehanadesigner Someone gave me an old (1994) behemoth of it and so cool! I have a wee museum in my apartment.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 10:01:50	@rehanadesigner Okay. I'm not at home so I don't have it. American Annual of Illustration or Design or something? Duh. Do you know of it?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 05:58:59	@Newerth_N Thank you very much for your Fave!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 05:56:00	@DrCCheung Hello. Thank you very much for the Fave about my Tweet about Therapy. Very much appreciated! Cheers, PA

16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 05:37:00	@TimAllenMDJD Thank you for the RT!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 05:35:53	@Ascii211 Hi hon. Haven't been on Twitter in a long time due to tech. issues. Can you direct me to the Tweet? Thank you!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 05:33:49	@InfiniteKnot Oh, yeah, but I got you in the DM Land so all good now.

16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 05:10:06	@NataliaAntonova I don't have FB but I really just wanted to say hi. ∗pounce∗ How are you my smarty sister?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 05:05:14	Was thinking of hopping on Twitter to clean up the mess made by my old phone. But now motivation because @histopathology published me!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-27 04:55:00	@histopathology @LeanLaboratory @pathpedia Thank you so much for the inclusion. Very flattered! Also, in Newspaper Terms? Prime Real Estate?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-26 11:45:29	Two Days of Technological Bliss http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1OX
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-24 04:29:19	Time to turn everything into magma and then crush it. But not my ankle too. Flop Bed Pillows TV. Minimal walking! I'm good at cane hopping!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-24 04:20:12	Seriously overdid it in Physio. Even the slightest bit of pain can become Volcanic later. My right ankle is Vesuvius.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-24 04:05:50	@MrsCupidStunt Thanks hon. New phone seems to be picking up things old crappy one didn't! You're support means a lot. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-23 23:24:41	That's my good old green but how did I get stripy? Turn that off! #epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-23 23:19:26	@patientanon Better green?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-23 23:18:12	Whoa. This thing is fast! I'm too green though.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-23 23:16:56	I just got a new phone. Quick test here as downloading apps. Plume the problem or my older phone?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-17 05:51:03	@InfiniteKnot Then I can get back to you. If I was home I'd find you in my own email! Thanks hon.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-17 05:48:08	@InfiniteKnot Hi. Did you not get my DM? Phone dying now but think I have your email. Email might be better. Can you just email me a hi?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-17 05:41:57	@EMBEEDUB @NOWTORONTO How many people on their deathbed will scream, "I wish I never joined Twitter and every other social media app!"
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-17 05:41:57	@Ascii211 Pinned Tweet. Tres confused.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 11:18:03	Leaving Twitter RIGHT NOW because I NEED MY BAUHAUS!!!!!!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 11:18:02	Currently listening to: "Following the Silent Hedges...Needing Some Other Kind of...Madn..." Love this song. Name that tune/band. Dead easy.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 11:15:10	@Ascii211 Okay, gotcha! My phone is so sucky! I was just sort of teasing because we were talking so much about art. So it was hey...? LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 09:25:05	@Ascii211 Hey. Why haven't you Followed me yet? Am I not dorky enough? @Canageek can vouch. Seriously.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 09:08:30	@bezyzewymowo At that point, the pressure might be basically enough to travel further backward to the man's bladder.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 09:06:56	@bezyzewymowo If a man was having a certain problem ejaculating, it would end up rising to the urethra and not coming out externally.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 09:05:14	@bezyzewymowo Yes. It is a medical condition. The urethra is "a tube" where a man urinates. Extremely close to where a man would ejaculate.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 08:23:54	Okay. I'm on my machine and all of those Twitter Dings are not showing up...anywhere. Maybe in a day or two? *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 08:17:56	@samwhatisit Now I offer a beautiful, yet contemporary for year 2029 Ballroom Dance for the Fave you gave me. *extends only one gloved hand*
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 08:10:22	@samwhatisit Many thanks for the Return Follow. *curtseys then quickly spins to a bow*
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 07:47:01	This is ridiculous. ∗sings and dances and punches walls∗ I'm gonna go freeze my arse off, switch satchels, and grab baby MacBook.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 07:34:57	Manual sink? Flush me down toilet with it? I need my fucking computer. Run home and get it? ∗fuming∗
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 07:32:55	I'm getting Twitter Messages. But I can't see them. My crap phone must not be syncing. No emails. Toss phone in toilet. Flush. SINKING!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 07:24:16	Ok. Set my cane down to answer my mobile. Ceepy, greasy guy asks me to join him. NOT a good night. NOT TO BE POLITE! I'm always polite.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 07:17:11	I think I've calmed down somewhat. Will someone out there lose Ryuk's Death Note Copy so he can drop it on my doorstep please?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 06:57:13	Clearly I lose the ability to type when I get upset, hey guys? Concentrating now. I should probably get off Twitter. Unintelligible.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 06:51:47	Remember what yove got it. Cuz can vanish like that in u ghost lt wayd
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 06:51:47	Fuck me. I'm goddamn. Friend in pain. Lost job.quit due to being blamed for oh just gorgtbit
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 06:40:31	@ukschizophrenic I want to dance with you! XX
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 06:39:27	@InfiniteKnot Hello? Waiting patiently.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-15 06:37:49	I love my Respirologist. Even though I'm still smoking but have cut back, he said just keep working at it. My lungs are fine from the CT.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 14:56:06	@n8wachT My phone is dying and I should go to bed! Talk later oeky? Good to see you again. Nighty, Lemur.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 14:45:52	places are shocked at how nice we really are, helpful and so much, so lovely. But assholes are everywhere. Still, everyone loves us.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 14:45:51	@n8wachT Awww...oe ∗grins∗ But you know the whole Canada Polite thing isn't a stereotype. Everyone I've talked to who's come from other
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 14:34:49	@n8wachT Yes, we are so polite and that. We'd bump into a Terrorist and say, "Oh, I'm sorry. That was my fault. Please, go ahead."
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 14:31:15	@n8wachT I'm doing shit. Read my last Blog Post for some Owlie/Lemur cheer.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 14:31:15	@n8wachT We're only involved as Peace Keeping or Keepers. I'm surprised they give us guns because we don't fight!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 14:27:29	@n8wachT We're now under some Terrorist Alert but I don't think any of them care about Canada. We have no military ANYTHING!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 14:25:02	@n8wachT Oui. C'est tres difficile, mais je suis Charle. HA! My awful French. But that is correct. I remember that much of it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 14:18:26	@n8wachT ∗curls tail around tree branch∗ How are you?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 14:14:55	@n8wachT boo!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 14:05:32	A Note From Addiction Central http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1OV
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 11:44:29	@D8Iveta Wait. Maybe I can see a slow Tango in my head. Maybe I'm crazy but it's the Latin undertones. Oh, you just tell me if you wish.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 11:44:29	@D8Iveta I will say one final thing. You must have the most AWESOME CD Library for teaching dancers! And just listening to on your own.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 11:26:49	Alright. Moving on to Getz, Gilberto and Jobim. People, do not deprive yourselves of this amazing ear gear.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 11:21:24	@D8Iveta I'm just trying to get an image in my head. If I can. Which clearly I can't!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 11:21:20	@D8Iveta There are various tempos of Latin Jazz. Although not right for a Tango. A slow one maybe? ∗laughing∗ Shades of gray?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 11:05:19	@D8Iveta Hi. You must know Getz and Bonfa's work. Toss in Gilberto. What dance? One CD I have says Samba all over it but anything else?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 09:54:52	Okay. Time to go home and this guy? Totally insane. Trying to sing some kind of Opera(?) and wasted. Definitely to go. Buy kids.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 09:53:08	KABOOM! Huge crash! *sighs* Can't wait to get to my fave #Mac store. Going to buy all of their stock.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 09:47:50	@GuylyPosts Then you'd probably love me because of my ADD and Asperger's.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 08:57:25	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Fave! True, yes?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 08:50:08	Could it be any colder? It is minus 400 degrees Celsius outside!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 08:37:06	@TimAllenMDJD We might need to talk even though my Respirologist is VERY good! *laughing!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 08:31:00	@samwhatisit Thanks for the Follow. Feel free to reciprocate should it suit? Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 08:25:19	@rehanadesigner Hi there. Thanks for the Fave about my nightmares. Although kinda weird. AHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Nightmares! Kidding.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 08:22:59	Not a “Secret” to Go to AA http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1OP
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 07:18:23	@MHcarers *laughing so hard* In trying to catch up with things I think I said thank you right now for the same Fave! BWAH-HAH-HAH!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 07:11:52	@MHcarers Thanks for the Fave about #Aspies and being at parties. TORTURE!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 07:09:16	@Pixelh Thanks for the Fave! I FINALLY got Twitter to get me to Follow you. It just wouldn't work before! Follow back? Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 07:05:55	@H_Stonehenge And may I make a suggestion? If you don't already? Toss in wicked Cosplay and Goths and Geeks and...and...in one vid. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 07:03:21	@H_Stonehenge Thanks for the Fave way back. Trying to catch up around here.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 02:52:40	@infopathic Secret Handshake? My eyes aren't working and they found a "lump" that has to go to Histo STAT! Do you have a search engine?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 02:39:06	@infopathic Hey there is! You put me in the daily sometime around Christmas. I think. Content/Stories etc via @patientanon
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 02:39:06	@infopathic I've been published in the .li format elsewhere and I can never find myself! I've signed up for you regularly.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 02:31:13	@MelissaLShell What took me so long to Follow you? You always put me somewhere SO many times. I think thought I was Following you already!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 02:12:37	RT me MORE!!! Don't you know how SPECIAL I AM??? #ridiculous
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 02:05:32	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Fave hon.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 02:03:53	S' ok. Purposely waited outside with no gloves so techie ones back on!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 01:46:21	Putting them away now. Outside too snowy as cane.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 01:44:55	I'm not sure but the gloves seem almost more intuitive. I'm not sure. Anybody else who have a pair have something to say? Or maybe not.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 01:39:50	Trying out my new techies gloves for when you're hands are cold outside. So groovy! And I am outside and it is snowing.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 01:23:51	The only time you quit #Therapy is on a temporary basis. Right after your Session until the beginning of your next one.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 01:14:25	Just finished #Therapy and waiting for my ride home. Exhausting Session. GOOD EXHAUSTION! Therapy affects you in all ways but don't quit!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-13 01:03:42	@InfiniteKnot Thanks hon. It already seems to be after only three meetings with this woman. Complicated as just filling forms now. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-10 02:54:19	@InfiniteKnot Thinking doing Twitter stuff. Followers and huh? But I only turned it on was transport to a doctor tomorrow. Ah...hah, right.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-10 02:50:37	@InfiniteKnot Thanks hon. Bit better today. Physio tomorrow so that should be interesting. Can do stuff that won't make me fall. *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-08 22:44:42	Ciao now all you lovely guys and gals. Need to try and get that 103 Fever down. These high fevers can somiemes make me act a bit...strange.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-08 22:41:15	I'm waiting. Monitoring. If it went away? #EPICWINFORMYBODY !!!!!!!!!!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-08 22:38:36	And I don't become rather delusionl with the fevers that go so high for immediate ASS IN ISOLATION!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-08 22:36:20	The Bloody Pneuomonia might be back! Already 103 Degrees and that's my benchmark. I can't lower it that myself.Could be D/W but too high!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-08 22:31:44	Okay. Didn't say anything bad to hurt anyone. Whew! Delusional dreams and I am not Delusional?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-08 10:24:11	Tired. From stupid Twitter and other crap. I'll try to get back to Twitter stuff later unless all of my technology explodes. Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-08 10:18:08	Okay. Things might be busted everywhere...oh! There it is! The one about my Social Worker! Nonetheless, things still busted? OFFS!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-08 10:15:57	Working with Outpatient Social Worker to try and fix my life. ∗laughing∗ She rocks. I'm making so many notes for her to fix my life. Whew!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-08 10:07:48	Okay, maybe my last Tweet will show up some day? FFS!!!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-06 13:36:17	I'm just trying to talk like a character in a book. It's called "acting." Like being on stage or even in film. I still need music though.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-06 13:32:07	I kind of want depressing stuff. It'll fuck me all me up ya'now? Well if you don't you're missing out on a big thing. And I mean BIG!

16253011	patientanon	2015-01-06 02:02:59	Ankle Tweet. No sense. I really CAN'T go out or do anything. I'm sure you get it. Ankle injury. Cane all the time too. Even in apartment.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-06 01:54:14	#interdentalfricatives I studied Linguistics in uni but not Spanish. Okay back to the football game. I can pick up some words though! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-06 01:54:09	I really do anything or go anywhere as I busted up my right ankle AGAIN! Not going for Physio on weekend. No exercises. Only TENS. Ankle
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-06 01:54:08	I'm watching a Football game between Real Soledad and FC Barcelona. The commentary is in Spanish. Guess who is unilingual? This is fun!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-05 06:23:41	Thank You and a Bit Late! http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1OK

16253011	patientanon	2015-01-02 04:26:46	Good god I cannot wait to switch to a new mobile carrier. It's not Plume I don't think. My phone, software and carrier! Also GO Mac!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-02 04:26:45	Maybe best New Year's spent alone ever? My Quefty on the phone, email to my sister, music so loud to blow up my building and party favours!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-02 04:26:43	I could go on my dying Mac and know everything I've sent will be right in the stream. I'd destroy this phone but the carrier might buy it.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-01 12:06:45	None of my Tweets are showing up again here. Except one. Yay.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-01 12:06:36	@NataliaAntonova You're the winner sis' The only one I can see. How's our little brother doing? I hope okay!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-01 11:47:22	@Canageek Hope you're feeling better and the family is well!
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-01 11:47:14	@NataliaAntonova Love you darling. xx
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-01 11:36:40	@electroboyusa Hello, dear. How art thou? Electrofied Boyish as usual? But come now. How are you doing?
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-01 11:36:39	Time for some music maybe? TV loaded with 2015 crap. Or perhaps just sit in silence listening to the city, its sounds through my window.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-01 11:36:39	I think I shall listen to music. But the sound of life outside my window does sound so beautiful. So hard to leave it and make the choice.
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-01 11:36:37	@EnigmaAnonymous Oh! I missed this! Sorry! Thanks hon. x
16253011	patientanon	2015-01-01 11:36:37	At home. Happy Nude Year. Talked to my Queft. Don't feel so alone now.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-31 01:28:31	Back to bed after a bit beaten up. Small space for Police, Father and Paramedics for me. He was #delusional but he didn't mean to hurt me.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-31 01:22:30	I should have used hashtags for #delusional throughout the entire thread but I didn't know I'd be saying the word so much!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-31 01:18:18	Oddly I was her "Angel" when #Delusional too. To be an Angel in two different people's Delusional States. What could that mean?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-31 01:15:56	Trying to think back as a kid. No. Couldn't really get so close when mom was delusional. Different circumstances?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-31 01:14:20	Maybe his "Angel" as he called me caused him pain too.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-31 01:13:00	I only know with us if I started to treat him gently and softly with care, his eyes would go wide as a child's but then he'd push me away.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-31 01:08:15	The flip side is when the delusion or mood state becomes negative. Get ready for all hell to break loose! I wasn't anything specific then.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-31 01:06:37	Adrenaline doesn't make you feel the pain of getting close to someone delusional when they see you as something positive. I was an Angel.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-31 01:01:56	New day or just later same day. Whatever. Except I have NEVER seen someone act so violently when psychotic as he did. Wow. And I hurt lots.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-30 15:10:27	I got physically plowed in all the ordeal. They called the Paramedics. I spoke to one and said just bruised scapula. WRONG!!!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-30 15:10:26	Nightmare of meeting a new person. Pub, okay. Home okay for a while but...police and paramedics for me, cane girl.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-30 15:10:26	Lots of fighting to restraining this guy who was really sweet. Just totally so mental but SO sweet! I hate that!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-28 06:12:22	#cutthroatkitchen marathon on TV all day today. Love it!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-27 12:17:08	Instant Sickness. Gotta scoot. Take care everyone. I think I might be sick for a while this time. I didn't make it last time. Can't talk.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-27 12:10:41	What to do when you need some help? Ask someone close to you. If you don't have someone close? Right now for me look at your life and THINK.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-27 11:59:53	@D8Iveta So again I apologize for seeming aggressive if I did. Artists have a fervor and a hunger at times taking away proper cognition.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-27 11:55:40	@D8Iveta If anyone ever viewed some of my photography and said that was so similar to my Idol Lee Millers work? Another reincarnation?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-27 11:48:10	@D8Iveta We as artists must explore learn and become who knows? With my epilepsy and writing I feel I'm a reincarnated Dostoyevsky at times!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-27 11:41:44	@D8Iveta However I never meant to push your boundaries personally. That is not a proper thing to do, artist or not, any person or not.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-27 11:31:14	@D8Iveta I must apologize for what I asked of you before. Remember! I am not a stalker! It's just Artists cross boundaries. We are meant to!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-25 16:00:25	Fuck you Plume for not "Authenticating" me. Given my recent news I am now "The Queen of Authentication." I NOW RULE THE WORLD.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-25 15:40:09	Mom and non-bio dad are lunatics! Enjoy rekindling your insanity! Just have to make a list of all I need and want from mom before goodbye!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-25 15:11:29	When I found out mom and evil non-bio dad reuniting I thought I was gonna puke. I actually took some Gravol. I don't know if I'll sleep.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-25 15:09:59	I divorced non-bio dad and all the other assholes on his side years ago. If my mom gets back with him I'm going to have to divorce her too.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-25 14:58:36	More Christmas Trauma! Bad already from family stuff but just got email from mom saying getting back together with abusive non-bio dad.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-25 12:59:21	Okay. Goodnight. I should get some rest for nothing to do on Christmas Day tomorrow. *gives huge grin then wry grin then rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-25 12:46:01	Speaking of numbers, I can't "count" (lame) how many times I've looked at a clock and it immediately turns to 12:34. SPOOKY.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-25 12:41:21	I have exactly 1,000 emails in my Inbox at the moment. I LOVE round numbers!!! #Aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-25 12:36:26	Where's my sweetie? Oh, there he is. I need some love. @ukschizophrenic XX

16253011	patientanon	2014-12-23 08:33:49	Oh shit. How am I gonna get sober after 20yrs when the #Bipolar made me mental? I don't know. #Addiction
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-23 08:30:18	@Canageek Know what's funny with my Hamper? I always ask for kids stuff but ONLY after the kids stuff done. Got Advent Calendar!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-23 08:27:21	@Canageek Thanks, babe. x
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-23 08:26:20	It's just the fucking temptation. #Addiction
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-23 08:25:21	I might not be around for a while but not like ignoring. Just fighting to not kill myself. Uh, sorta half joke. I can do Detox & Withdrawal.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-23 08:21:42	Christmas sucks. #Addiction sucks. Stting petrified with the last drink I fucking really have finish and one smoke left. Going to try AA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-22 03:38:43	Going to bed. Phone off. Let's not forget how parties affect #Aspies I'm typically so overloaded from social I think I'm going to die now.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-22 03:38:42	I hate Christmas enough and sure, that's how he feels about me but it's so hard to fall into some bizarre trap of guilt.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-22 03:38:40	I want to wear this cute black skirt to a Christmas Party tonight but I bought it when I weighed more. It's not as short. Mr. Stapler?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-22 03:38:40	I broke another straight man's heart tonight. It's happened so many times. Always need to be gentle . He walked out not with no goodbye.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-21 06:18:15	It's also going to be a total Fashion over Function. I'm going to freeze!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-21 06:18:14	I want to wear this cute black skirt to a Christmas Party tonight but I bought it when I weighed more. It's not as short. Mr. Stapler?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-21 06:18:14	Self-Tailoring. Whenever I couldn't get to a Tailor fast enough, I'd use a stapler to keep things in place.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-21 01:20:24	I CANNOT BELIEVE I WAS DITCHED TO GO SOMEWHERE AFTER GOING TO THE BATHROOM AND PAYING MY TAB!!!!!! I walk outside and gone.

16253011	patientanon	2014-12-14 03:59:10	@Zinquefty Then we have to further to where shop is by Onion up line to shoot across. Anyway, clothes on! Was just waiting with heating pad.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-14 03:57:46	@Zinquefty I'll get all dressed now and leave. I count the stations plus "Cane Time." Not sure when I'll get to Onion. 45min? Bit less?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-14 03:56:05	@Zinquefty That makes sense as it stops at Onion Stn. I just thought close enough to me so less waiting? NO WAY are you going there w/o me!

16253011	patientanon	2014-12-14 03:44:51	@Zinquefty Oh. Was I supposed to meet you there?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-14 03:33:46	@Zinquefty I'm so wee you could pick me up, throw me around, bounce off the wall, spin me on floor, jump on the bed forever.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-14 03:33:45	@Zinquefty Sorry, missed you because I've been shoveling things my place to pretend it's clean and organized. Leaving 1300hrs is fine.

16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 07:08:50	@Zinquefty Okay. $ for that so I can pay you back? Or buy pizza, give transit, pay for what you want in shop? Heh.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 07:05:49	Wasting la Battaria on Twitter. Do you know know "la Battaria" means drums in Italian? Just random trivia from my brain.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 07:05:48	RT @Pixelh RT if you love someone... I love everyone on the planet. No! I do!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 06:23:51	Did I already say I left my Winter Boots at Physio today? Because you can't do Physio in them. I have no Winter Boots for a week. #fuming
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 05:51:47	Going to shop for #Anime , #Manga , #Graphic Novels and #MartialArts flicks tomorrow! WHOOEE! None I can afford but the Sacred IS the Sacred.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 05:41:12	I just made up this poem and sent it to my friend. Then I asked him if was SURE he wanted to visit me? I was ... http:// tmi.me/1eTYVb
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 05:12:24	@InfiniteKnot I never answered Plume! Mobile App for Twitter.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 05:10:54	@InfiniteKnot I bought an Acer Netbook for school and after three months it broke. Friend who was programmer tried endlessly to fix. Nope.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 05:08:51	@InfiniteKnot I've never installed virus software. There's no matter. I could go on. Expensive, yes. I always say you get what you pay for.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 05:06:18	@InfiniteKnot They are so beautiful and so intuitive! No CDs to install software like a printer. Plug in USP and go through steps.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 05:01:49	@InfiniteKnot I just went all trial and error because I learned that whatever I did wouldn't destroy it! I'm Mac now, I'm PC dumb.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 04:59:19	@InfiniteKnot Well, I always feel behind a bit too but this is how I "sound" so techy. I started to just learn on my own. No more phobia.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 04:56:30	@InfiniteKnot Dinosaurs! Back then it was DOS programming language and we got to learn how to see our names show up in all sorts of ways!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 04:53:53	@InfiniteKnot I had one computer class in high school. Let's teach kids about programming and some other shit to dumb it down.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 04:52:05	@InfiniteKnot Then the Company came out with the Commodore 64. I swear huns! Look this up! Google it! Also I never understood WTF!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 04:49:13	@InfiniteKnot I don't know how old you are but I'm 44. There was NOTHING when I was a kid except a VIC-20.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-13 04:46:21	@InfiniteKnot Oh! I'm really not that tech savvy as you say. I had "Tech Phobia" for SO long before being a Tech Dinosaur.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-12 05:19:51	@MaraKatz12 Thanks for the Fave!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-12 04:49:20	@Zinquefty Okay. Be a good boy at work!

16253011	patientanon	2014-12-12 03:13:59	@Zinquefty baby could mount as other drive and that would run through desktop speakers. But they're LOUD! More than you'd think. Bringing $

16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 12:24:17	@Zinquefty I SO love that image!!!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 12:22:02	@Zinquefty Although if we go the bath route we MUST do it with shot glasses!!!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 12:21:10	@Zinquefty Well the way I'm breaking my sobriety these days and the costs of bars just get the fuckin' Stoli. *rolls eyes* Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 12:19:20	@Zinquefty Buy a couple of cases and we can have a bath in it!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 12:17:10	@Zinquefty Chose "it" being Vodka to drink. Beer and wines were deadly for me.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 12:15:50	@Zinquefty Stolichnaya (Столичная) Like the Russian? Yes. That's why I chose it as a non-allergen and they are all the same. So Stoli okay?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 12:11:21	@Zinquefty What did I drink forever? Looking at list for allergy in processing etc.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 12:09:37	@Zinquefty Well fuck Smirnoff. Lowest of the low. Absolut is pretty cheap but no flavoured crap. So many running through my head. What...?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 12:02:44	@Zinquefty Okay great. Send me the deets in an email. Can you get me up a wee bottle of Vodka for our night? You'll bring something for you!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 11:54:00	@Zinquefty Okay. Saturday, come to me and bed stay? Then no flying rush to get home? What do you think? Dinner and such. Hang, sleepies?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 11:50:38	@Zinquefty Well, want to come to me first then two bed stays? Or come Saturday and one bed stay?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 11:47:50	@Zinquefty God! I'll need Physio after Physio! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 11:46:21	@Zinquefty So logistics? I have Physio on Friday but will be home mid-afternoon say?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 11:45:24	@Zinquefty Oh well yeah that shop! And the Hirsute Arachnoid? I'm still on the hunt for more Martial Arts that takes us down into China!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 11:40:02	@Zinquefty What's the weather this weekend? I'd have to fix the bed as always. *laughing* I could definitely use some Quefty love and Vodka.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 11:27:22	I SO suck I lost SO many Followers! WHAAAAA!!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 11:24:51	I need a Valium. Fuck. Missed Divided Dose. Ah. *gulp*
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 11:22:45	@Zinquefty Yes, my Dark Lord. Why did I just call you that? *giggles* I am better but just squeaking back online. Shite time for a visit?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 11:05:48	*glances sideways* I've lost a lot of Twitter Followers. *laughs maniacally* Speaking of WRITING! And fuck popularity. Tunes...
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 11:03:36	I thought a good Post to write now. Pfft. Even, Every, All Writers have points where they get so <emotion> they can't write. Me.Too.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 10:59:54	Dear Lord. You have to shake your head at all of this online bullshit and want to blow it to shreds at times.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 10:56:18	Apologize to people who say you write Posts where you have trashed people on your Blog. That should cover things here "Alex Moran?" Sorry.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 10:52:47	Don't write Posts on your Blog that trash people.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 10:51:40	Don't trash people.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 08:40:31	I'm not a slut, I swear. Unless you want me to be. I prefer <insert VERY LARGE WORD> pervert n
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 08:36:26	Okay I'm gay. But just saw my gorgeous Croatian guy so sweet. Slept with him ago and with some gymnastics first orgasm from intercourse!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 08:19:55	If you don't know @AspiePenguin is my caretaker. He does a pretty good job of helping me. I do a pretty good job of not helping him.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 08:09:30	@AspiePenguin Thanks buddy. I know I never say it enough for taking care of me but, yeah. I love you.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 07:03:48	Maybe I should go back to Seizemic. That's an old joke with the spelling, me having epilepsy and all. A lame joke.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 07:01:18	Okay. Fuck. I keep sending Tweets and it says it can't Authenticate Me. Read me now? AUTHENTICATE THIS!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 06:34:59	@Ascii211 Yes. Bookmark? Filed under a Category on my computer of Blogs.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 06:24:44	@J_cold You already know what I think of you. You're a wonderful person.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 06:21:18	@Ascii211 You sound confused. Are you? If so about what?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 06:09:14	@Ascii211 Will have to look at your stuff on proper sized computer. Have you Bookmarked so examples there?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 06:06:52	@FlotillaOnline You're welcome. Already have you Bookmarked. Thanks for Following me too!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 05:14:58	@Ascii211 Or you said Acrylics. Thinking not an etch? We're stupid. See Self-portrait first? o.O
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 05:10:37	@Ascii211 What about size? I don't know a thing about etching.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 05:08:34	@Canageek If I used those with you I would probably be okay if you had it.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 05:01:12	@Canageek Okay honey.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 04:57:20	@Canageek Thanks for one vote I'm Cute! Hope to see you at Xmas if not buried under my duvet in despair or worse so INSANE go see my MOM!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 04:26:23	*scoots back onto Twitter* Just wanted to do a "Cute Poll." Tweet me if you think I'm cute. *scoots back off Twitter*

16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 04:16:58	@Ascii211 Oh, not bad. What about a portrait? Been trying to collaborate with an artist of one I took of me. Any medium they do.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 04:14:00	@ukschizophrenic Want to come visit you babe. Been to UK twice already. Exiting Vic Stn like Sci-Fi or Dystopia. Save my pennies for you. xx
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 04:07:39	@InfiniteKnot Did you get my reply about my photos? Plume is being dumb.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-11 03:46:07	@Ascii211 I think I muttered something about a low income? I work for the government. Just not how you think.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-10 22:47:32	@D8Iveta Point me in the right direction and I'll gladly buy it! I'm sorry. I hope I don't sound so stupid in all of this!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-10 22:47:32	@D8Iveta Partnering (different) would be fine. Great to see differences? If something exists could you please let me know?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-10 22:42:27	@D8Iveta It's sort of like buying a Jazz CD and it is a collection of several artists when you are looking for a full album of one.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-10 22:40:14	@D8Iveta What I meant is there more of you in a collected form from any period than clips here and there?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-10 22:40:13	@D8Iveta I'm sorry if I sound stupid.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-10 22:40:13	@D8Iveta I was wondering if there is sort of "more" of you in a collected form? Not a Jazz CD of selected artists when you really want one?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-10 22:18:59	@D8Iveta The part about Suzanne is true though. She has a lovely assistant who probably thinks I'm either crazy or dead. Both happen a lot.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-10 22:11:26	@D8Iveta Ok what I meant. I was too afraid of sounding like a stalker so I ended up sounding SO stupid!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-10 00:19:03	Maybe more online stuff later. Gotta seriously chill to deal this with this again. And please god last fucking time!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-10 00:16:33	@ukschizophrenic Detox and Withdrawal Whoa, just Whoa now but I know more to come. Up early and can't tell. Feels maybe days! xx
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:24:18	I guess that means goodnight then. Take care dearies.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:22:07	As soon as my phone is charged I'm going to bed. It's almost there and I'm more than there!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:20:20	Okay Plume. You just go there! That's right everyone! I have 32 DMs from people! No. I don't think so. Ever.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:16:58	@Ascii211 That's a very intersting prospect though. I'm on Government Disability thought! Name your price!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:15:52	@Ascii211 Ego or reality! But eerie. Similar. I need another set of eyes! If anyone even THOUGHT I was close to Lee Miller I would die.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:14:18	@Ascii211 Sorry, speaking of art just got back and I was talking about Lee Miller who is my IDOL!!! I kind of even shoot like her.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:12:53	@InfiniteKnot Lee was very sarcastic or odd in her sense of titles and whatnot and I am too. Reincarnation? *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:11:34	@InfiniteKnot But freaky eerie, I shot almost a match to one of her most famous shots ever and I hadn't seen it. I was WTF?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:10:04	@InfiniteKnot Also Lee Miller is my IDOL! If anyone said I did anything like hers I'd die.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:06:00	@InfiniteKnot The downloaded were from Digital SLR and the actual photographs themselves were taken from my Film SLR. They are older.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:04:38	@InfiniteKnot Some are actual photographs so they would have to be scanned and I could email them to you. I do have some I downloaded.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:02:42	@InfiniteKnot Oh. I think I had a bit of a glitch in the Matrix. There are the Photos on the Pages on my Blog but for my other work?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 12:02:36	ARGH! Okay. Get baby MacBook out and see that I have 32 DMs? o.O
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 11:48:03	Updating Direct Messages on Plume. A red box that says 32. My phone sucks and doesn't sync my email accounts all the time so I miss Twitter
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 08:06:13	Name That Tune http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1O7
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 05:26:40	@Ascii211 Well, the first question is are the pieces done?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 05:17:57	@D8Iveta So I really need to get to Suzy now, her 29 stitches and hopefully you. If it's a problem don't worry. I'm not stalking!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 05:07:16	@D8Iveta I might be able to walk down the street and have coffee or tea with Karen. Rex? Well he spent YEARS here so maybe property held?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 05:04:24	@D8Iveta I don't want to be a total idiot in the Timeline but here's idiocy. I have direct access to Suzanne but haven't done a thing.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 04:58:54	@D8Iveta May I ask you a huge favour? Could you Follow me for just a bit so I could ask you a question or two via DM?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 04:38:18	In public library but could have taken alternate route. I'll let it go this time. #hadenoughstalkerexgirlfriends
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 04:27:05	OMFG! My ex-girlfriend just walked past the cafe/pub where I'M SITTING!!! Back and forth a few times. I THOUGHT I made it crystal. Outside!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 04:16:27	Physio was good today. I learned something they actually teach to dancers & football players. I'm small enough to be a dancer but football?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 04:06:26	@Ascii211 Ok.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 03:45:28	Cheers to #NelsonMandela I don't think anything else needs to be said in this Tweet about the great man he was.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 03:38:20	@Ascii211 Even a Jet Pack would do. Please, Santa?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-06 03:35:22	@InfiniteKnot Photos?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 10:38:10	It’s Never Easy http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1O1
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 06:03:53	Before my battery dies decided to sit read get cheered up. Book is Bite Me A Love Story by #ChristopherMoore SO good. Need more of him!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 05:43:15	Sneaky Thought. My bent cane is telescopic. Only use it for Accessible Transit. Then fold it up in my bag so the Physio folks won't know!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 05:24:53	Battery dying on mobile. Computer means music! #uselesstweeting
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 05:21:51	Run home to grab computer to monkey around on or read. Decisions, decisions. Computer means work, not just monkeying #procrastination
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 05:17:54	@Ascii211 Something to make me fwy waewwy high? Pwease? Wee PA has only done skydiving. HIGHER! HIGHER!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 05:15:39	@Ascii211 Thanks for the Fave too. Got caught up in the maelstrom. Can you build me a rocket for Christmas? Pwease? Just something?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 04:49:20	Yes I am out of bed outside excercicisng for Physio tomorrow. Missed Session last week from a migraine but looks like I'm still looking ok.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 04:49:20	@Canageek @Ascii211 @theglitzkrieg As per last talk of medical care if you look have and I have it, Government Covered Physiotherapy.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 04:40:36	I swear I just saw #MichaelStipe walk into a library down the street but the guy was dressed too well. LOL! Sorry, Mike.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 03:12:26	Okay...time to go. Rest for Physio for tomorrow when I really should be exercising for it. *facepalm* I blame the current state of my life.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 03:10:22	@Ascii211 ok leaving cutie. go read your dictionary. lmao!!!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 03:09:52	@Ascii211 Don't worry you'll be fine. I always say a writer's two best friends are a Dictionary and a Thesaurus. Have your Dictionary. xx
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 03:07:23	@Ascii211 You're not going to building the new machine ALL the time so the German Dictionary will just take it's place MOST or the time!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 03:06:13	@Ascii211 You're not going to lose it sweetie. I'm a writer. The Dictionary is just going to be put on the shelf for a while.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 03:04:29	@Ascii211 LOL C IS a LANGUAGE! *runs away*
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 03:03:50	@Ascii211 Then with the vocab you have to match it to the reprogramming that you've done. Tech. building a new system from scratch.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 03:00:43	@Ascii211 You need to take that process and vocab and work backwards then. Take the overwrite and think reprogram. Or program?
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:58:00	@Ascii211 Totally clueless but estimate is 3-4 months and you'll get it back. I was taught Parisiennes too (sp? ok.) Quebeqois? *sound!*
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:54:49	@Ascii211 Think I actually found a group where I can get it back! Work on it and WHOO! Granted best way is Immersion. Throw me into Paris!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:53:43	@Ascii211 Taught it in school being a Canuck but didn't take it further beyond High School because not going to study in uni. Now lost it.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:52:14	My "Terrible French 101" lesson is over for the day.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:50:46	@Ascii211 Could have just stayed "le bon chance." Je n'ais pas quois. LMAO! That's correct.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:49:15	@Ascii211 "Favourite" but pronunciation. Also, gendered language so I femininized the good luck: la bonne (chance--same.)
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:47:36	@Ascii211 I don't speak French at all. Tres, tres mal! Thank you for encouragement with my blogging? The Fave. I think that's same word.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:45:30	@Ascii211 Merci pour la bonne chance avec mon blogging. Et toi, mon ami!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:37:57	Oh bugger. I rather violently injured my cane. I don't want to go out and get another one. And can I "hide" it at Physio tomorrow? Can hide.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:34:41	@Ascii211 @Canageek @theglitzkrieg *snarf* You sound like you have the same type of humour as me so I Followed you simply upon that!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:32:21	@Ascii211 @Canageek @theglitzkrieg I know about the costs. People have told me. I can't believe! $8,000 to have someone and a wee bandage!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:24:39	@human_is But precisely as you name suggests, I AM human. IN.GREIF. LICKING.WOUNDS. I don't want to move from my bed. Seriously no drama.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:21:18	@human_is Thanks for the Fave too. Was thinking of getting more into it but I'm becoming more of a sucky wuss. Every minute. #notadramaqueen
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:17:04	@Canageek @Ascii211 @theglitzkrieg Yes flaws in areas of our health system but an arm wrestle with the US? We'd win hands (or arms?) down.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:12:14	@MelissaLShell @BipolarOutLoud @anniebananie76 Thanks as always, love. SO flattered. More to add to my Resume as a Writer? *smirks*
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:10:43	@InfiniteKnot Thank you. So much. For always being there. The break up was just so WRONG but so RIGHT. UNhealthy. And you know the sobriety.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:08:50	@BipolarOutLoud Thanks for the Fave! Much appreciated!
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 02:07:01	Oh. Well must have been some stupid Twitter problem as always. *sighs* Present and accounted for...maybe.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 01:31:53	I see only some of you in my email but I imagine others may have contacted me. I will be coming.
16253011	patientanon	2014-12-05 01:11:02	@D8Iveta Thank you for Fave again re: Theatre. You are a darling. Proof that there are famous people here don't ignore nobodies like me.

16253011	patientanon	2014-11-26 08:23:19	What else did I miss??? o.O Bye Plume.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-26 07:53:45	Later dahlings. And don't even mention blog activity or my blog period. I'm beginning to despise it. Again. Forever.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-26 07:51:43	Ok. That's it. Must haggle with Antique Dealer early in the morning. Yes, I'm really happy about that.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-26 07:47:46	@D8Iveta You know what I forgot to tell you? Said not a dancer but extensive theatre work. Think of both. The same? Feet are actor's lines!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-26 07:36:41	@J_cold I will too. Absolutely! I think you might do a better job though! Well, maybe not. There are two people involved!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-26 07:26:21	@J_cold Who knows about what I tried to write before but I never got this. Tango broke my phone! This made me cry. I love you.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-26 07:14:08	Thank you for the Fave hon. I love you.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-22 06:58:48	Smaller than regular decks and basic under but it's hellllloooo! AUDREY!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-22 06:53:14	I collect playing cards. Of course something has to be special, different etc. Two decks of a Breakfast At Tiffany's in a gorge tin.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-19 05:43:50	@FarrellBallet Thanks, guys! I've been Following you for a long time so I appreciate your Fave and being noticed. Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-19 05:37:39	@D8Iveta Nonetheless, I'd love to sit down and have a talk about Suzanne Farrell. George too but mostly her. Legendary! @FarrellBallet
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-19 05:21:18	@D8Iveta Thanks for the Fave! *laughing* I'm not a dancer but I know the most simple shoulder lift based upon bodily mechanics and gravity!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-19 04:20:03	*runs around and starts checking all possible places for water leaks* I'm actually quire handy for a... "GIRL!" *hatesgenderstereotypes*
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-19 04:16:46	Seriously? Is my apartment flooding someone's below? There goes not only the prioritization of work, but the work as well! *huge face palm*
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-19 04:08:22	@J_cold I love you. When things get heated, I try to be the biggest fire extinguisher possible. The house WILL NOT burn down in flames!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-19 04:02:17	@J_cold All of my comments are in the Timeline. Just look my Profile. Eventually we'll dance like this in a video clip I'm sending you! xo
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-19 03:42:47	Okay, kids. Gotta run to try to get organized. Virtually impossible. Like climbing K2 at the moment!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-19 03:39:48	@D8Iveta You were too good to win. No brain required. Owner of Arthur in New York? Proves what I said. You go girl. You go! Take care, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-19 03:25:14	@D8Iveta Errr...but not in a "Stalker" way or anything like that. LOL! You just look so beautiful when you dance. Also Nick as a Tap? What?
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-19 03:20:53	Ok, I love So You Think You Can Dance! #GuiltyPleasure @D8Iveta You should have won! I'm sitting here watching Blitz now over and over LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-17 23:12:20	@J_cold As I said, we just needed to see each other, right? #s#sorrynote #hadfun #awkwardfathermeeting #hilarious
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-14 08:47:19	I don't think I've ever been so happy to feel so utterly disgusting and extremely ill in my life! #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-14 08:45:12	Wanna heave, appointment tomorrow morning, I should probably get offline and rest. And take a boatload of OTC meds. And some prescribed.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-14 08:41:32	I wanna get clean so bad. Someone just sent me a DM they'd eat broken glass. I'd eat more harmful things to rid me of this evil! #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-14 08:37:01	FINALLY I can stop drinking? Beer sick. Wine sick. Now my Vodka making me sick. Helluva Detox and Withdrawal but SOOOO worth it! #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-14 06:57:29	Science is finally catching up to what it's like to be a #wombtwinsurvivor That makes all I've told you is possible. My Therapist loves it!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-14 06:53:14	Different clothes, voices, attitudes, ages, personalities. And no, I'm not delusional, Schizophrenic, hallucinating all over the place!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-14 06:43:38	Super Crazy? I talk to them and see them despite them being dead. Well in my head, not ghosts floating around. #wombtwinsurvivor
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-14 06:39:01	If all of this sounds crazy there's more. I'm a multitude #wombtwinsurvivor I have four twins that died but I hung on. #wombtwinsurvivor
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-14 06:36:17	@GUBLERNATION I have two eyes that can't always see, all my fingers but missing one ear. Like that painter guy. I can still hear though!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-14 06:30:20	Jason really gets going with emotional stuff. Was just writing something I'm upset about and BANG! Pen across the room? #wombtwinsurvivor
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-14 06:25:32	Been a long time. Only Jason has the power to radically change my writing. Amelia did but only when she first showed up. #wombtwinsurvivor

16253011	patientanon	2014-11-13 21:37:46	@tsundere_girl Baka cannot DM you back. I'm sorry Big sister or Big Brother. *bows in apology*
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-12 15:44:15	Who said sleep was mandatory anyway. Who invented the clock anyway.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-12 15:41:21	@J_cold And remember, anger is fear disguised grasshopper, if you can catch the pebble from my hand.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-11 09:39:01	Okay, bye. #totallyuselessonlineforhowlong Guess what? I don't really care. It's tedious. To the point of exhaustion. I need a real life.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-11 09:33:02	@AfricaReddit Thank you very much for the Fave. Rodriguez and that whole story is #epic and so much of SA is already so! Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-11 09:28:16	@MaraKatz12 Yep! You got it. Totally downgraded because it's worse than a B-Movie! Smarty Pants!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-11 09:26:56	Seriously. C-Movie about Ancient Greece was actually putting me to sleep. I want to sleep. Bad Historical Films make me want to sleep.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-11 09:24:22	Watching C-Movie about Ancient Greece. *snooze*
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-11 09:23:12	If you don't know him check out (Sixto) Rodriguez, his AWESOME music, and a story of being totally unknown to South Africa Teen Rebellion!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-11 09:08:43	@J_cold I love you babe.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-11 09:01:21	@J_cold And from me right back to you sweetheart!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-11 08:57:57	Hi @MaraKatz12 Nice to meet you!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-10 02:54:20	@Canageek @MaraKatz12 You just mentioned something brief. Like a short phrase or something because we haven't talked in so long. Hi Mara!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-10 02:53:55	If this even gets up I have to go off Twitter. Computer in worse shape now and crashing. Not happy.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-10 02:48:51	@J_cold What am I going to do with you! Uh, yeah. Ok. Take that question however you'd like it! *rolls eyes* Rhetorical for me!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-10 02:44:37	@Canageek *jumps on back for piggy back but falls because too klutzy* Hi hi.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-10 02:43:08	Also why does it say "What's happening?" in the box? Why not "What's not happening." Be Creative! "The Green Peas of Twitter Right Now!"
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-10 02:31:47	There were words in this little box that said: "What's happening?" Well, my nose is running so I'm reaching for a tissue right now.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-10 02:04:50	@J_cold You should know that by now! xo
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-10 01:50:23	@J_cold #iwishyouwereherewithmealways
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-10 01:49:28	@J_cold You like my calves huh? Anything else? *raises eyebrows* Well at least I stayed in one piece after "No Strap B-Ball!"
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-01 09:08:51	@J_cold Thank you. It was 5ft. of dirt. You saved me. I'm coming...following...if I let go of your hand. I'll be right behind...just wait...
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-01 09:04:52	Do my bloodshot eyes deceive? My love has found the graveyard and stopped the shoveling of the dirt over me! Her hand so warm. Now I leave!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-01 08:51:33	Look at the undead time! Look at the undead time!
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-01 08:47:57	Okay. Where am I? 5ft. under. Not being online forever. Spending Halloween in an empty bar (i.e. I'm a loser with no party invitations.)
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-01 08:41:37	@J_cold Thanks for the Fave hon.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-01 08:40:40	@J_cold Would you just get the fuck over to my apartment? *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-01 08:39:39	Yes. It is true. PA the dead is undead or is still dead or undead or something. She can't use her steth to tell due to lack of online rigor.
16253011	patientanon	2014-11-01 08:35:46	@J_cold Yes it does sweetheart. You, me and the Dodge! I told you he'd be in the middle. Until we have to "move him." Ahem. *laughs* xoxo

16253011	patientanon	2014-09-24 04:37:10	Sorry about suicidal madness last night. Figured out problem I think. Too many groups/appts on almost every day of week. My brain and body?
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-24 04:36:59	Watching "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" on baby MacBook. While on Accessible Transit. Don't feel like reading and long trip.

16253011	patientanon	2014-09-23 22:43:42	@CalliCoop into my brain. DTs vary. I'm a small case but sick. No hallucinations but my hypervigilance goes sky high. Bit of weird paranoia
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-23 22:43:24	@CalliCoop I don't know if you got the last one. Detox and withdrawal. I was just thinking anatomically the best way to shove a a huge knife
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-23 22:43:24	@CalliCoop I will. There's just a lot of Detox and Withdrawal whether I drink or not right now. I was just trying figure out how Dr. PA

16253011	patientanon	2014-09-23 06:36:56	Antique, curiosity, WTF buyer coming Wednesday morning. There's only one really big thing (okay couple others) Hope he takes it.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-23 06:29:50	@Zinquefty I can totally understand the "skip it" stance because why bother talking when nobody is listening. Merlin #2 is like that.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-23 06:29:27	@Zinquefty Thanks for chiming in hon. The irony of you and I being #Aspies who are so fucking honest now talking about lying. *laughing*

16253011	patientanon	2014-09-23 06:13:21	@Canageek It wasn't a question of judgment. Just more open ended. A conversation starter for people to express their experiences.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-23 05:55:07	Has anyone ever lied about their medical problems or how they feel so it won't go in their charts?
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-23 05:52:11	I'm thinking of getting a tattoo. I don't know though. More damn money I don't have! And I still don't know... >:(

16253011	patientanon	2014-09-23 04:02:24	BOOOO!!!!! I must at least lie down. Therapy today put me in a bare knuckle fight against a guy 6'3 225lbs. I'm only 5'2 and maybe 105lbs?
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-23 03:57:46	What am I doing online. I'm tired. I want a nap. But watch me nod and this guy will ring me. Need to sell furniture and stuff. ...zzzzzz...

16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 07:22:50	@alinapete I had a mouse in my place. They always run and hide if you breathe. I'd put on Jazz and it would come out and chill with me.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 07:17:33	@pueblokc Hi. How are you? I know this has nothing to do with your Tweet but I just caught you. Haven't been online very much.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 07:11:06	But in a way there's so much shit happening all around it's like I don't have time to pop my clogs. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 07:07:10	I just want to beat the beasts. There are too many going on right now but I have no choice. And some of them frighten the shit outta me.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 07:00:11	@ukschizophrenic And your little faves as we always do make me so happy. God. My hands are shaking!
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 06:57:33	@ukschizophrenic I have always felt a love for you (please don't be scared okay?) because you're here & always inspire me. Is that alright?
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 06:56:50	@ukschizophrenic I should tell you about my mom. They said Schizophrenia years ago when I was a kid. Kicking and screaming they took her.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 06:56:50	@ukschizophrenic She always did and never gave love to my sister and I. So I'm very proud of you for saying this. About the love.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 06:52:06	@2BipolarChicks Thank you! The cretin got it earlier!
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 06:52:05	@ukschizophrenic I know now. What I can piece together in my mind but she's never thought she's been sick. She gives everything to denial.

16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 06:52:01	THE CRETIN (ME) IS STILL SO SORRY! IT ALSO SHOWS HOW INSANE I GET WHEN ADVOCATING FOR PEOPLE! sorry... *runs away*
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 06:29:53	AGAIN. SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY APOLOGETIC FOR USING THE N-WORD. I KNOW IT'S BAD. IT HURTS. MAYBE I'M NOW A CRETIN TOO!
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 06:29:53	SERIOUSLY, GROSSLY APOLOGETIC for using the N-word. I NEVER DO. Just for emphasis of the cretin. I advocate for everyone!
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 06:17:41	PA SCREAMS AT HIM!!! PA SCREAMS AT EVERYONE!!! DISCRIMINATION!!! I'M GAY!!! PA IS IS READY TO EXPLODE!!! Ap
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 06:15:42	I just gave a cretin guy (but he wouldn't know that word) who hates niggers, only fucks sheep, and knows only a few words: That's so faggy.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 03:11:45	There are holes in all the documents I can find so far. How the hell did this get missed? Fucking TRIAGE? Heeelllooo...records coming in?
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 03:08:50	...starting to dissociate. What shape was I in and what did they do to me when I tried to off myself and ended up in the ICU. Problems.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 03:06:54	Excuse me while I disappear. Documents signed for to read. Will I shoot off into PTSD for the rest of the day? EMS reports. I'm already...
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 03:02:55	@crythecrawling attractive lady to be with, you know where to find me! xxxx *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 03:01:52	@crythecrawling Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that! Well, if you ever become single and you'd like a nice and so I've been told...?...
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 03:00:00	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. It's the Physio. I don't want to interrupt it. Full course so I can still keep working on my strength etc. while InP.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 02:57:33	@InfiniteKnot I've actually "planned" my time for admission and to wait for a bed. It will be a long time. Other medical issues first!
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 02:54:15	@InfiniteKnot When I go Inpatient for the three weeks it will be A LOT more intensive. I'm just starting the OutP. so lots of time. No rush.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 02:52:21	@InfiniteKnot Yes, we do cover ways to cope, set goals and it's not just about substance use etc. We can talk about anything time permitting
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 02:19:33	@InfiniteKnot Thanks hon. It's very hard work. Way more than my regular Therapy I do on an ongoing basis too! I've got SO much in my head!
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 01:10:58	@InfiniteKnot So I didn't have the strength to fight it that long. I live in an area with nowhere to go. Nowhere that doesn't serve alcohol!
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 01:09:54	@InfiniteKnot The other night I just got trapped in my regular pub for hours due to maintenance and I couldn't go back! Chemicals used!
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 01:08:31	@InfiniteKnot Well, that is SOME help with the Outpatient Group. It's intense and two times a week. Then more stuff of medical nature.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 01:06:51	@crythecrawling Happy you took it as a compliment! I often joke I use Twitter as a Dating Site. And a very unsuccessful one for me.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 01:05:00	@InfiniteKnot Not going to kill myself! As you can see, still here!
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 00:59:51	@PartDAccess Hello. Thanks for the Follow. Could you please Follow me back? I need to go back to past roots of this blog: medicine. Cheers.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 00:49:57	@SASpalding Thanks for the Fave waaaaayyyyy back ago re: me ghostwriting and whatever the hell else we could do as a team! x
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-18 00:40:40	@2BipolarChicks Sorry it took me so long to get back to you. Thanks for the Follow Invite. Please come back to Follow me if you'd like.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 12:01:44	@EnigmaAnonymous Yes, that is the case. But I fear I won't find a woman to be my partner anymore. Not at this point. Sleep now. Talk later.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 11:55:12	@EnigmaAnonymous Oh, my! Have you changed sides? Or just playing for both?
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 11:47:15	@EnigmaAnonymous I know. I want a gf or partner like her. A tuning fork for my heart that she wears around hers. Okay I'm getting all mushy.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 11:47:15	@EnigmaAnonymous I should try to go to sleep. Despite the smell in here. Meds taken. OMG. Enough about hot women anywhere! I'll never sleep!
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 11:31:41	@EnigmaAnonymous NO. How many other forms of art over so many centuries has the world seen? Has it not been eroticized too? Or some parts?
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 11:27:52	@EnigmaAnonymous I won't comment on q. I'm too sick. I am SO, SO, SO hot for the older sister, mother, whatever. Is that crazy? I would say
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 11:19:16	@EnigmaAnonymous Ah! You know Gilg! Holy Shit! We have a lot of genres in common. But how embarrassing is this. I'm hot for sister #yuri
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 11:16:03	@EnigmaAnonymous Someone you and I both know gave me VERY good advice about Twitter. That person said you have to have a thick skin for it.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 11:10:02	@EnigmaAnonymous Yeah, I need to rest and somehow get this smell out of my place. Love you sweetie. xo
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 11:10:01	@EnigmaAnonymous I should just shut my phone off now. Go back to the last DVD of Gilgamesh. Awesome plot and the character drawing!
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 11:05:18	@EnigmaAnonymous I mean honestly. I get back in this world and it seems good for a while. Then I want to just kill myself.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 11:02:05	@EnigmaAnonymous Thanks honey. I'm so online and offline. Someone keep me here or just kill me. Pathetic.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 10:59:43	@crythecrawling I know. That was too much. I can never find any women to be with me. And if I find them nice they're always straight. Sorry.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 10:56:50	@crythecrawling I see you're following me. I hate doing this over my phone. You're pretty. Very attractive. I'd like to have a girl like you
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 10:49:22	@crythecrawling Oh! Thank you. I don't know if we're following each other but feel free to follow me. *wee grin*
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 10:44:08	I croaked on Group for tomorrow. I can barely breathe in here, fuck drinking myself to death. Medical mask and #anime I'll do.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 10:37:17	I think I saw a message? Crap pizza and my open window still isn't helping. I just haven't done my Will yet.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 09:31:19	@SASpalding Thanks for the Fave...even though I know this is late in saying so.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 09:26:49	@InfiniteKnot Sorry babe. No. No suicide.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 09:25:07	Laughable really. A scale? You can't. Online, Offline. Be very careful who you meet online though. They can decimate your heart. I know.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 09:17:41	Well, I guess that's how it goes. Just like real life. People get know each other, relationships happen and then they stay, last or don't.
16253011	patientanon	2014-09-16 09:14:47	You know. The first person who said to use Twitter for connecting, my Blog, I just looked at my Profile and it's scary. They're all gone.

16253011	patientanon	2014-07-23 02:35:54	@InfiniteKnot That's a long time to keep drinking. This needs to stop immediately. Because my drinking has increased so much it's entirely

16253011	patientanon	2014-07-23 01:21:07	@Asdquefty There's the story. Fuck it.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-23 01:21:06	@Asdquefty Now Apple has upgraded my exact model. Mine redundant. Was going to repair and I need other parts too but I'm buying new now!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-23 00:48:53	@the_cairn This is a total sick #anime bed day so just checking few replies. If you have any more info could you DM so I don't lose it LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-22 03:30:40	@MrsCupidStunt Okay. *salutes*
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-22 03:30:00	@MrsCupidStunt I've gone through Detox before. You can have some really fucked up dreams too. Once SOMEONE famous every night for a week.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-22 03:26:55	@MrsCupidStunt I'm fucking in Detox/Withdrawal and I've almost worked a full business day? o_O LMAO!!! All sweaty, fevers, then chills.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-22 03:25:06	@MrsCupidStunt Hi, hon. Just wrote to someone else I got stuck in Non-PA Land. I still have to do one more VITAL thing and then CRASH!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-22 03:22:43	@the_cairn @SixxAM @NikkiSixx Oh, 'geez! Stuck in Non-PA Land! Haven't even gotten to it yet! Ms.Detox/Withdrawal might flop over soon too!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-22 00:00:50	@Asdquefty If you didn't see my last Tweet baby is really starting to go. Construction all over store area. Might have to courier in my 1TB!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-22 00:00:50	An #addiction makes you very selfish, self-absorbed, full of so much denial you can't quit for YOU. It has to be someone else. Found her.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 23:58:47	@the_cairn Thank you for saying I don't suck. That makes you totally, definitely NOT suck. Going to now have a looky at what you sent me...
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 23:58:43	@MrsCupidStunt Time to get onto my computer! SPAZ o.O
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 23:58:42	Oh Fuck You #Plume and #Twitter Grrrr...just talking about my Mac dying and you freeze up!!! #fucktechnologyperiod #justfuck
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 23:49:38	@Asdquefty The store will do it. Just have to get to the (awesome) woman I've been working with forever to see how it works.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 23:45:04	@EnigmaAnonymous Hugs to you too. Again if I didn't reply. baby is really starting to go too. Construction all over store area. Courier 1TB?
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 23:45:02	@MrsCupidStunt Thank you for your support. That means a lot. I might have already thanked you. I'm on my mobile and don't know what's what!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 23:45:02	@Asdquefty Me too. Couldn't keep up with what everyone was saying! #LOFNOTC IS HUGE! I did make a friend out of it though so that was cool.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 03:19:29	Signing off everyone. Take good care of yourselves.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 03:18:06	Anyone else want to abandon ship? You have every right to. When drinking #alcohol now MY #addiction is SO destructive, it hurts everybody.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 03:09:37	*crying* I'm not having a pity party, whining, looking for attention. Just so hurt and surprised! I still suck though. #alcohol #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 03:04:51	*crying* #alcohol #addiction #itotallyfuckingsuck
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-21 03:02:27	My addiction has taken over my life on Twitter. I a wrote a totally inappropriate DM to a long time friend. Tried to apologize now. Blocked.

16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 11:48:41	Good or Bad night? Everyone try and be safe. That's all I can say anymore. Please do it for me and everybody else out there.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 11:41:41	Be careful how you Tweet and DM. It can actually change or even destroy your life. #viralsocialmediapps
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 09:58:31	PA on the move now. Might not get a signal but yes, I could. So talk if you want. Fanks.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 09:58:30	I think I have a signal?
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 09:34:35	@EnigmaAnonymous Thanks honey and hugs back to you.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 09:29:50	Oooh... It's #LOFNOTC !!! I can have my brain explode by trying to keep up with the timeline!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 09:29:20	Anybody else around here I know or who knows me?
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 09:27:14	@MrsCupidStunt Thanks honey. xx
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 09:15:50	Not sure if my brain's always on crack because I'm a writer. I always make unintentional puns. I said I just said I swear like a "semen."
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 08:19:28	@MrsCupidStunt With all that's so messy with me I need inpatient care. No way could I do outpatient. So I'm going Rehab. *scared*
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 08:17:10	@MrsCupidStunt I'm getting there I hope. Consult for proper medical Detox and just have to sit on waiting list. But I should qualify!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 08:13:24	@MrsCupidStunt Well done! PA just picked the genetic short straw for addiction (and everything else!) LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 08:09:50	@Asdquefty I know! Out of the blue and WTF! It's church but I'll enter any one despite my feelings. Just kind of interesting you know?
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 08:06:26	@MrsCupidStunt Of the "Non-prescribed" three. Not super bad. MJ, alcohol and snow.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 08:04:43	@MrsCupidStunt Partially been there with some on the list. Definitely with a couple? Do hospital settings and prescriptions count? LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 07:45:59	@MrsCupidStunt And pot, heroin, benzos, oxys and percs. Coke, acid, booze, finding partially used cigarettes on the ground, picking them up.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 07:40:22	RT @MrsCupidStunt Lithium. And everything else.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-19 07:39:04	Drinking has Membership Privileges. Upscale owner of Resto I go to asked me to spend time with his entire family. Can't see it with others!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 02:03:42	@InfiniteKnot I missed this one. In hours. Oh you're so sweet and funny. But I know you speak the truth. Maybe some tea. Let's try tea.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 02:01:27	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Fave...
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 01:35:19	@InfiniteKnot Thanks hon. x
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 01:33:25	@InfiniteKnot But then you have to pay for it later.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 01:32:50	@InfiniteKnot Other things too. But I can't make everything stop! So I go back to what is familiar. Over so many years what soothes me.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 01:29:50	@InfiniteKnot I know exactly what's going on right now. I'm in SEVERE PTSD HELL re: at least two things. More connections? An excuse?
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 01:28:00	@InfiniteKnot Things being so basic I either don't care about or damn well forget about them. CBA! I'm going for a drink! I know my triggers
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 01:24:50	@InfiniteKnot However, I know when I need to go. Things are becoming out of control. I can't manage my life anymore. I'm forgetting things.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 01:23:31	@InfiniteKnot Thus, it does not make me feel very good about doing this (haha.) I also am very hospiltalization-avoidant.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 01:21:29	@InfiniteKnot Thanks hon. They say the easiest step is admitting you have a problem. I have been admitting I have a problem forever.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 01:14:46	@RedditPsych Thanks for the Fave. That really means a lot to me. Now more than ever.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-18 00:36:08	Rehab.Needed.Now. For the first time in my life, I have actually woken up craving a drink. *bawling* Now physical, not just psych #addiction

16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 12:04:50	Blah. Tired. Log. Off.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 09:02:34	@prtycleverfilms Let's just say it might be of interest for you folks and I to talk. Quite. Muchly. I'm wearing Binoculars. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 08:53:47	Well, I think I got to everyone. *head spins*
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 08:36:38	@AutumnRinaldi I like what I see. I am just getting to a whack of Twitter Follows now. Could you please Follow me back? Merci. PA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 08:10:58	@philosophy_muse Hey, could you Follow me back? Not sure if you're there? DM'ing so should be? Way overworked and confused...
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 08:06:23	@SymmetricalArt Sorry I'm so late but would love a Follow back! Thanks, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 07:56:44	@prtycleverfilms I know I got back to you really late for your Follow Request. Could you Follow me back please? Cheers, PA
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 07:12:25	Well, What the Hell. http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1LD
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:46:34	Anyway, whatever...blah, blah...talk to GP and Therapist. I just need to do the background work and say...I think something's missing!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:42:45	Yes that would make sense because I was fucked up but I think a typo with the times. Says the Paramedics got me there in 1hr. and 15min. No.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:40:19	The times don't make sense as the Paramedics picked me up and I was in a coma. Maybe they revived me in the ER but I slipped back into one.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:36:53	Then there was A LOT of talk of a prolonged QT prolongation and arrhythmia. QT prolongation is not good. Basically too long and you die.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:27:52	Something done so which way did things happen? And my heart, my breathing, full intubation (thoracic) so ventilator. In ER I think then ICU.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:24:10	Also SERIOUS Medical Research to do. Analyze loads of Labs. They did SO much to me. Also missing records. When I was in ICU. The coma.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:20:47	I know! "It's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood..." It IS a gorgeous day. Get out in the sun. Place with secured Wi-Fi. Try and do a bit?
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:08:05	@CalliCoop So are you. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:07:38	@InfiniteKnot Yes. It absolotuesly sucks and I wish I'd never started when I was almost 20 years ago? Oh, well.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:06:13	@InfiniteKnot Never kittens. I'm part kitten. Or cat. x
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:05:48	@InfiniteKnot Oh, nonviolent here. I would never kill anything (unless it's some stupid inanimate object-like a story I'd written?)
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:04:25	@projectania What is/was my pressie? Let me guess. A mention on Twitter? Love ya. x
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:03:36	@projectania Hey Babe! Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner. Sick as all hell with drinking, relationships from HALP!!! Not even online!
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:01:55	I'm already not well. I spelled a word wrong and it's underlined in RED!!! Detox and Withdrawal is a BITCH so fuck it. #addiction #alcohol
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 03:00:02	Due to said "VERY triggery song" if I dissappear, you'll know why. Don't worry though. I'll just be "DEAD" online. Not in real life. Fanks.
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-16 02:58:21	Listening repetitively to VERY triggery song, while trying to find people who have become new Followers. 10 years since I last checked?
16253011	patientanon	2014-07-10 10:31:59	And now a personal slight that is pissing me off but I should try to leave as a slight. Music. Headphones. Try to blog again someday.

16253011	patientanon	2014-06-23 11:27:46	And after that last Tweet? We all have our (my) moments. And it's been a helluva long time! K2 Triggers on my wee been. But I'm still cool?
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-23 11:15:30	Nothing like a lot of vodka a well done #cutting not too deep and wrapped tight. Oh. Wait. That's not really good stuff is it? Hmmm...

16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:59:37	@InfiniteKnot Twitter is freezing everything. All levels can be good as a lot of clubs require a certain level. High. It even said at the
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:59:37	@InfiniteKnot Yes but the all - did I say ages? LOL! I meant stages. That's good because a lot of times clubs say you have to be @a certain
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:46:13	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. Have to call woman to see how it works as all levels so who knows?
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:38:06	To tell you how close I am with Gabriel at ...saltedlithium I am in on his sidebar in a picture with a sweet hover and we have met in person
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:34:28	Thank you if anyone knows anything about Gabriel at ...saltedlithium and you contact me. His blog is now Private and asking...
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:30:59	We've been close friends for years. Contacted and nothing. Anyone know where Gabriel is from ...saltedlithium? Worried. Please DM or email.
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:22:30	So yes all. Twitter fixed the problem. I'm back. I came very close to "Blogging Suicide" but I didn't do it.
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:19:30	@InfiniteKnot Oh, yes. I forgot. I have found some things to do. If it's a good club I might be able to get my French back!
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:17:36	@InfiniteKnot Never burn bridges and welcome anyone back into your life with an unlocked back door.
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:16:07	@InfiniteKnot and not stupid. Things have always been talked about and agreed upon. This will be too. She's like me. Or at least FOR me.
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:14:04	@InfiniteKnot I was so pissed off in my head going back and forth I just said fuck it. Never tried this so who knows. We're both responsible
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:12:14	@InfiniteKnot More negotiations. She suggested this a long time ago. But now BIGGER! Take a serious break then come back to try as friends.
16253011	patientanon	2014-06-20 01:09:56	@InfiniteKnot Hi, hon. Good to see you too. But holy crap. I decide to come back to blogging, Twitter breaks. I mean, for real?

16253011	patientanon	2014-03-19 23:17:05	@BeyondMeds I'm already on it so it's just a titration to a higher dose. Meds and heads are always different. Thank you for your well wishes
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-19 23:00:32	Fuck it. Been two weeks. Only feeling Lamictal side effects? My tea makes me think. I can't think at all now. Oh god.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-19 22:56:27	That's why quitting smoking can be downright hell for us and even dangerous. That's why ONLY TEA as a stimulant made me go crazy.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-19 22:54:10	Oh, I wasn't clear with the nicotine receptors. People with epilepsy have millions more than those who don't have epilepsy.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-19 22:51:29	I still have to write the damn post of how the Neurochemistry works on my blog! But if you read this, you can see I'm still too messed up.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-19 22:48:04	Well two prices. I need to make Ach and with kicking the withdrawal/detox the neurotransmitters aren't getting necessarily through to me.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-19 22:46:30	And I KNEW this med would kick the withdrawal/detox in the ass. Tell my Na++ to STFU, deal with their gated channels but at a price.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-19 22:44:56	So many of those receptors are do to having epilepsy. I don't know if I'm finally through with the withdrawal/detox. Because med change!
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-19 22:43:32	It's been two weeks since I've had a tea. It's been two weeks. Even that sent me lunar because having millions of nicotine receptors.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-19 22:16:03	How the HELL did one of my OWN comments get marked as Spam in Akismet? I guess it's "Omen." I'm (seriously) thinking of shutting down PA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-10 09:33:26	If you're an #Aspie or anywhere on the Spectrum, know it was a typical communication gaffe, have you still wanted to rip the NTs head off?

16253011	patientanon	2014-03-09 23:29:05	@Magnusmode #MAGNUSCARDS #autism lost the pen I brought somewhere in the store! I can also forget my list but the real topper beyond that is

16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:57:09	@InfiniteKnot totally crazy big! OMFG! So I just have to wait. Call into office back as my personal nurse who told me, I forgot to tell. I
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:52:42	@InfiniteKnot would be necessary right now but I don't even know what I'm walking into right now! But I'd ALWAYS get one if was something
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:50:39	@InfiniteKnot Music now. See where my brain takes me. Oh, I NEVER miss appts! I'm just totally shocked right now. I don't think a second

16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:44:00	@InfiniteKnot She put it on her desk and kept thanking me. We have a different(?) relationship. We love each other. She saves me. No matter.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:40:07	@InfiniteKnot when it was taken in time due to the lighting. She was shocked that I actually took it. It was a nice little one. I framed it.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:38:08	@InfiniteKnot You already have it! But metaphorically, it's yours. I gave her a photo I took in Pisa and explained to her the geography and
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:36:06	@InfiniteKnot you for everything. I owe her my life and have told her she could have it. Then I laughed and said well, you're my doctor!
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:32:59	@InfiniteKnot No my GP is Ace. More than. She's VERY Pro-Specialist and that's what you want in a GP. Not someone who thinks they can treat
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:26:42	@InfiniteKnot *rolls eyes* Off to find cigarette. Certainly one won't make a goddamn difference now.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:10:54	@InfiniteKnot Thus, I'm freaking out and trying not to run for a cigarette! Can you imagine? Quits smoking 1-2wks only to develop cancer!
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:07:25	@InfiniteKnot I've never been sent to a Specialist for such a targeted, even pre-diagnosed condition where yes treatment options planning.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:04:25	@InfiniteKnot A Specialist when you know something is wrong and you're already anticipating forms of treatment. I've always been the former.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:02:03	@InfiniteKnot They said they'd see if they could fix me up. Now there's a clue? A specialist if you don't know what's wrong or...?
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 02:02:02	@InfiniteKnot Well, my instinct right now is to go and have a smoke! This was not expected. o_O Going to Lung Specialist. From there?
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 01:35:31	P.S. If you didn't get the horses and stripes thing? Horses and Zebras in Medicine. A version of Medical Diagnostic Ockham's Razor.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 01:33:32	As always great timing. Should I go get a smoke now for this stress? Well, I don't know what the horses are behind me so forget the stripes.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-07 01:33:32	Ok. That Pulmonary Function Test I did two days ago? Because I quit smoking? GP just called. Some preliminary lung disease. But not much?
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-06 08:33:11	@Magnusmode #MAGNUSCARDS #autism Hey thanks! Again phone dead and better on computer anyway. Take care.

16253011	patientanon	2014-03-06 07:08:21	That is to say #yuri and hentpuke re: #tentaclesex and other weird hentpuke. #yuri with women engaging in sexual scenarios and erotica, ok.
16253011	patientanon	2014-03-06 07:03:06	Can anyone suggest some decent #yuri in Anime/Manga? Mature. No hentpuke. Me? Complex plots, sci-fi, WTF and Classics: Bebop, Akira etc.

16253011	patientanon	2014-02-18 00:59:26	Quitting smoking again. Head Go Boom before. Smokers with #epilepsy need to be careful. We have SO many more nicotine receptors. A drug?

16253011	patientanon	2014-02-13 02:00:05	@InfiniteKnot Interesting you "like" your Insomnia. Most people hate it! Well, that's a total drag about the meds but sometimes it happens.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-13 00:16:05	@InfiniteKnot *nods* My head is VERY silly. It wanders all over and just won't SHUT UP at times. I agree. Everyone the same? VERY boring!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-13 00:13:52	@InfiniteKnot Gotcha on the meds. Well, maybe something might come along to help you. I sure hope so!

16253011	patientanon	2014-02-12 22:48:50	@InfiniteKnot something ridiculous I give a Valium push. Because clearly, something is on my mind stirring me up that would translate to...
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-12 22:46:41	@InfiniteKnot kicking me in the head! It generally does but I also take Valium prn for Anxiety. If the Seroqeul isn't working by 2hrs or...
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-12 22:43:57	@InfiniteKnot ...Benzos prn. Simple. Then every night. Then higher doses. Then no effect at all so an Atypical to hopefully act like a horse
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-12 22:41:02	@InfiniteKnot How far have you gone as far as the med route? My insomnia never used to be this bad. Years ago I started out just taking...

16253011	patientanon	2014-02-12 04:43:32	Already contacted someone I know well at Regional Area for my location. Look out @CDNOlympicTeam and/or/BOTH @CDNParalympics Here I come!!!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-12 04:39:15	#Olympics2014 Fever! No #seizures 7 mos. More strength, mobility. Going to fight to join @SpecialOlympics and/or @CDNParalympics Teams.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-12 04:16:17	@MyNocturnalSoul The Twitter stuff has been TOTAL nonsense but the reason is #Olympics2014 Fever. Although that is important to next Tweet!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-12 04:14:37	@MyNocturnalSoul Also don't worry about time. I'm not even in the online world so much right now. Twitter a bit. One blog I'm into a bit.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-12 04:13:08	@MyNocturnalSoul I'm sorry hon. As per my last reply to a Follower, busy too. You and I are really in tandem! Sick then busy...what next?
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-12 04:10:07	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. Unfortunately, not so much. Too much to do so pretty hectic. Terrible sleep as well so unfair there also! Total crap!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-09 11:38:15	WHOO HOO!!! Two medals for Canada in Ladies' Moguls! Gold and Silver! Plus won by two of the three sisters on the team! #wicked #Olympics
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-09 10:22:18	And so she spirited off in the night without much spirit. Staring forlonly at groceries strewn awry and even still forgotten laundry! *poof*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-09 10:12:31	I need to start making some intelligent Tweets. All I'm saying is dumb ass shit. Thank god I've got some intelligent Followers.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-09 09:53:42	*dies* #AspieShopping
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-09 09:52:31	*dies*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-09 09:50:40	If I ever eat again. Again. Ever. Thank you.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-09 09:49:39	Again.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-09 09:49:26	Finally went grocery shopping. So cold I have track pants under my jeans. Old jeans before I shrunk. Tired. I don't care if ever eat again.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-09 05:10:16	@pueblokc $$$$! Technology stinks but if there's anything decent around or gets developed I need it to control me!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 12:06:47	I just put up a silly Stress Free Zone type. Believe me. I wanted worse! But then I'd probably start getting pummeled or killed. Next war.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 12:05:09	Still I couldn't resist putting something up on my door apart from Spidey to be a bit more than cheeky. Still I try, TRY to stay low profile
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 12:00:45	Holy Fuck! WWXXVII on my floor tonight! The biggest screamfest yet! I couldn't even hear my TV. It seems I'm being a real Aspie Spaz lately.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 08:34:34	@DianeFudge @tcm #TCMParty #ClassicMovies #31DaysofOscar Started by #AmandaPalmer #LOFNOTC Losers On Friday Nights On Their Computers LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 08:32:36	@DianeFudge @tcm #TCMParty #ClassicMovies #31DaysofOscar Actually you might get a laugh out of this one. I haven't been back to it in ages.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 08:19:59	@DianeFudge @tcm #TCMParty #ClassicMovies #31DaysofOscar I just have to look at everyone who's been talking back and forth with me. Tired.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 08:18:39	@DianeFudge @tcm #TCMParty #ClassicMovies #31DaysofOscar Hi, I've already been making Tweets today to the party and am loving the month!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 08:15:23	But it's so nuts! I've been stuffing my face ALL DAY AND NIGHT LONG. *dives into another donut* Whatever again.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 08:03:22	You could maybe say my body needs for after a whack of #anorexia business but I never #binge NEVER! I have been eating better too? Whatever.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 07:59:58	I think I've eaten a million grams of sugar (and I'm not stopping!) plus more food. Totally ravenous! Days like this sporadic. Today? o_O
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 05:25:56	@InfiniteKnot I hope you have these good weekend too. Any plans? I have no food so grocery shopping will be the highlight? Laundry too? Yay.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 05:23:20	@InfiniteKnot Me being an exhausted Aspie? God knows what might come out of me and be misconstrued. I've had a huge dose this week already.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 05:21:11	@InfiniteKnot I tend to just learn how to do things by fiddling around, trial and error. Unless someone can show me of course.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 05:19:12	@InfiniteKnot Oh dear. My sarcasm isn't coming through. Well, understandable as I am a very exhausted Aspie. I'm not a techie at all!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 04:55:38	Ticked, Test, but Thoughts http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1Ku
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 02:33:03	*crying as all O. Wendell Holmes Secretaries sing Happy Birthday* 80yrs. old. Never had children they, were all his "sons." #TCMParty
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 02:21:29	OMG. Just whisper @tcm and #TCMParty and you'll never be able to WATCH your movie! Your mobile won't shut up with Tweets about you! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 02:13:42	@Lieder_pdx @tcm @willmckinley *laughs* Thank you so much for the warm welcome. #OldMovieWeirdos #tcmparty
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 01:44:23	@tcm Also loving your February Schedule, in terms of the awards, both winners and nominees. So many, so often. Great! #TCMParty
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 01:43:09	@Juliethejarhead Thanks for the Fave and with all this new talk to me, thanks to @tcm too? Waking up to "The Magnificent Yankee" #TCMParty
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-08 01:21:29	@tcm Cheers, thanks for the invite! #TCMParty
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 11:35:44	SO glued to Turner Classic Movies right now. Talk to everyone on Twitter in a month or two? LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 08:23:03	Oh! "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is on tonight! Apologies for delays to any Tweets. Due only to Great Cinema and no form of rudeness.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 04:57:37	@AuRtist Cutie. Thanks for that.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 04:27:06	Need a shower *pyjamas explode* #iamatotalspaz #aspiesrock #nobodyshowerseverydayadmitit
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 04:21:09	Need a break. *head explodes*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 04:15:03	@AuRtist You're not alone, babe. Well, definitely not with me here! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 04:13:31	@HuffPostCanada and @EpilepsyOntario My Mac is old and dying. Think you have my words. Also thanks Huff for hook up with EO. Awesome.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 04:09:44	@HuffPostCanada @EpilepsyOntario http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1Kc
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 04:06:26	@AuRtist NO! It's called being Aspies which we both are! I do the same thing all over the place! I get totally misunderstood and OUCH!!! xo
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 04:01:12	@AuRtist Oh, I can stick to word counts alright, slash and burn with editing not so bad but how I slashed and burned? ROTFLMAO!!!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:59:03	@InfiniteKnot Very! I told someone last night that I actually prepared questions like a job interview LOL! Now I have to find it for them.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:58:08	@AuRtist Oh, I know not implying. Me? /sarcasm
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:57:20	@AuRtist time to get that post up! EO wanted my 2yr story in 500 word count. How's that for a writer's brain? With this writer's brain gone!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:55:33	@AuRtist even other provinces as well. I totally forgot I have a contact with medical knowledge. I'm so bloody stupid! Well took me a long
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:54:32	@AuRtist Indeed but I just thought of something. I can find out. Quite quickly about your inquiry there. Just a few keystrokes and maybe
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:52:10	@AuRtist But in answer to your original question, I would say not as good. Not publicizing because I can't see this only happening in ON!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:50:52	@AuRtist 2-3 years. I haven't even been online for long patches. Bedridden? Majority of the time because of this bullshit!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:49:56	@AuRtist I could run around and see what is there for all of them. Although not to be selfish? It's been a bit of a rough ride for the last
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:48:56	@AuRtist that Epilepsy Canada would serve as the overarching place to assist all of the country and direct everyone to each province but...
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:47:35	@AuRtist Also I don't know what other provinces do to help people with epilepsy and if they go so far as to what EO does. One would "think"
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:46:27	@AuRtist I'm not so sure about that because it's not like I can drill down into what "seems" to be going and greasy palms that always exist.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:43:54	@AwarenessPhotos Okay, thanks. Consider yourself warned!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:40:29	@InfiniteKnot Oh I love all my doctors. Taken me all my life to find such a great team. We collaborate, I guide my own treatment! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:38:31	@InfiniteKnot No time was cut too short for shopping. The test? I don't care! After so many years I'm a Human Pin Cushion! Thanks for fave!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:32:43	@HuffPostCanada and @EpilepsyOntario Feel free to read and RT. Thanks, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 03:14:46	If You Have Epilepsy in Canada? Don't Worry. You'll Be Fine! http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1Kc
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 01:17:51	@AwarenessPhotos Also, my original post? I'm cranking another one first. Not sure if I can do two but I'm pretty flaming mad so maybe?
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 00:59:57	@AwarenessPhotos One frequent and always recurring theme is that it's a piece of crap, I should stop blogging and destroy the damn thing!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 00:58:07	@AwarenessPhotos It was sort of a "dare" from a doctor who is unfortunately no longer blogging. Mine has morphed into so many things.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 00:56:55	@AwarenessPhotos Thanks. After 7 years I don't even know what my blog is about anymore. Actually from the first day I had no clue LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-07 00:14:33	@MyNocturnalSoul And how is Dr. PAs patient feeling after a few days now?
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 23:44:10	@AwarenessPhotos So it is definitely my pleasure to meet you. Also if you thesis work done, I would be more than happy to discuss that too.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 23:41:48	@AwarenessPhotos I'm not happy now with misunderstanding, discrimination, stigmatization, bias and even people finding mental health funny.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 23:37:25	@AwarenessPhotos @AwarenessPhotos Hi there. I kind of followed/unfollowed etc as Tumblr isn't liking me me these days. LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 23:35:05	@AwarenessPhotos I might be reading you from your top story alone for a blog post I'm going to write today (hopefully). Too much to do!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 23:29:09	@AwarenessPhotos But let me tell you. Serendipity? Karma whipping down Samsara? You came into my life right at the perfect moment.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 23:23:03	Time for a post. Something about Twitter that wakes you up crying in your sleep needs to be addressed. No tea yet. Will it be a Drive-by?
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 23:12:07	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Fave hon.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 11:32:36	Take care everyone. Have good mornings, days, evenings and sleepies wherever you are in this mad, mad world.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 11:30:58	It's so funny how my Mac's speakers combined with my pair of externals make my BOSE Wave III sound so "different." Now time to use it.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 11:10:26	I'll write more about my artistic stuff later. Bugger me but I can't now. Maybe best on my blog as a post. But it's good I'm moving again.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 11:05:24	Disrespectful to Tweet re: what happened with this person. I've already contacted them. Otherwise my Twitter Page looks like Tabloid Gossip.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 11:02:39	Although I'm still pretty upset that someone took ME for a crazy stalker! I GET crazy stalkers! I'm really sad about this but move on...
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 09:33:06	@FroggyPrinceMom Actually, I might need a little more time. I'm not fully equipped for my Archaeological Dig at the moment. LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 09:26:19	@FroggyPrinceMom Oh, boy! Going to have to dive into a whack of paper files. Not on my computer! It's okay. Need break from other work.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 09:16:38	@FroggyPrinceMom LOL! People are so surprised when I say I did that! An "Interview?" Let me poke around to try and find it. No copyright LOL
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 08:57:26	@FroggyPrinceMom Uh. That's the only thing I can say about healthcare in the U.S. Your system boggles my mind. I don't understand it at all!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 08:56:01	@FroggyPrinceMom I'm not sure if I still have the list on my computer but I know I have it somewhere. I think? Let me know if you want it.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 08:55:08	@FroggyPrinceMom No, I really did! I prepared a bunch of questions and treated it like I was giving them a job interview.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 08:54:07	@FroggyPrinceMom I see. I hope it goes well. You know what I did when I was looking for a GP and ended up with Sweetie? I interviewed them!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 08:39:18	@FroggyPrinceMom Uh, yes. That's rather the whole point. Trying to find someone new?
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 08:25:08	@FroggyPrinceMom Go for it! I think we all need good doctor days every time we see them!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 08:11:53	@FroggyPrinceMom Oh, I'll be fine! Today was Merlin 2. He can be funny that way. On/off. I always think: Is he have a bad day or wha...? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 07:23:11	@FroggyPrinceMom Sweetie GP is so on the ball with me and has never done a single one! She puts in orders for all concerns. NOT CYA!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 07:21:15	@FroggyPrinceMom Yes and it's CYA for the doctors involved! I had one done a millennia ago with Dr. Asshole. Total CYA. Merlin #2 today same
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 06:43:02	Sure, I'm not drinking now but I told him, "I have a Cast-Iron Liver!" It's true! After everything I've put it through? I'm also not yellow.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 06:39:49	My (one) doctor I saw today wants a Liver Function Test. Are you kidding? With all my meds over the years and drinking for 20 odd years?
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 06:18:06	@TheWriteSprite Yes. We seem to be in a bit of a conumbdumb. You can't trust lawyours. Without much thinking, I propause an even split!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 01:43:43	There's #GraphicNovel shop near my doctor I'm seeing today. If I have extra time? Lord help me! I never leave said stores empty handed!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 01:30:55	15 minutes until I have to enter one of the biggest Snow Globes ever manufactured. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 01:27:01	@TheWriteSprite Just notice something about your Profile. I have the Copyright, Trademark and Patent to make up words. Right from the womb.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 01:13:13	@trevorellestad The dare to my Follower comes through! He didn't like DMs, I was SO embarrassed by what he said! I can feel myself blushing.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 00:56:35	Holy crap! I finally got my lazy ass on #LinkedIn last night after months. A friend who left my life ages ago connected to me! WHOA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-06 00:03:53	@trevorellestad I didn't thank you properly for what you said last night. I was just so shocked and amazed to hear it. Thank you Trevor. x
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 23:57:37	@irishgerrie Thanks for the RT! Especially THAT one. A lot of people don't people understand my sense of humour.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 12:26:55	NOTE: For those who do not understand my sense of humour I am not seeing my doctor to seek help for taking illicit drugs. I don't take them.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 12:20:47	Shit man. The dreaded Inzombia. Set alarm. Have to. This Dealer? Totally unreliable but I'm out! Need a fix ya know! Now! Seeing my doctor.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 12:03:20	Folks, the bed/office/closet/pharmacy is getting pretty out of control. It took me almost 10 minutes to find the Remote for the TV.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 11:51:46	I just dared a Follower to do something I'm about to regret. Well, all's fair in love and Twitter!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 11:25:20	Alright. I should maybe go flop on my bed? Relax? Get back to my #LeeMiller Biography. She's my IDOL! IDOLATRESS? LOL! Inspiration Central!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 11:15:59	Older but very tiny and look very young. Can pull this off in a heartbeat. Except shopping. Why did I throw out those clothes! *kicks self*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 11:14:02	Call me. New ringtone. "Smothered Hope" by Skinny Puppy. Told you! I am reinventing myself as the little #Goth teen that I was.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 06:40:33	@sdmattpotter Thanks for the Follow. I don't live in your area so it's highly unlikely I could submit any work to you though! Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 05:44:28	@AuRtist After I rescue my tea & have a cigarette. Trying to cool it down. The last was too hot. Burnt tongue. Spit it out like 4yr old. LOL
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 05:40:13	@AuRtist Oh hon! *massive hugs* I can see how that was hard. Maybe a help to get it out as a release? Sometimes that works? Going to DM.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 05:32:28	@InfiniteKnot Thanks for the Fave cutie. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 05:31:34	@AuRtist Okay on computer now trying to do a bunch of stuff (quite unsuccessfully.) Let me take a look.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 03:26:59	@InfiniteKnot *nods* Let's add to that a magic wand for everything!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 01:53:00	@AuRtist No worries! Whenever you can catch the time! xo
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-05 01:47:03	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. I kind of feel if I drink again, then I try to stop again, will it take a month to detox? Detox is not fun either. LOL
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 08:03:58	@AuRtist The best way to catch up would be email for sure!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 07:02:32	@AuRtist Well don't worry about being lazy. A LOT has been going on since we've last talked. I've also taken long breaks from being online.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 05:45:47	@InfiniteKnot I'm getting stuff in a loop where I get sicker and it takes longer to detox. I've gone from a few days up to 14 now!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 05:40:49	@InfiniteKnot Thanks. I haven't been in a bar yet but just remind myself of the problem. Each time I detox, even just at home from a bit?
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 03:41:34	@InfiniteKnot AHA! A three month no payment plan too? I'm much more liquid now (reverse pun) since I'm no longer drinking. Extra cash.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 03:18:23	@InfiniteKnot for a lot of other third party SW. Anyway, I live off gov't assistance so repair to get as up to date as possible. No.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 03:15:52	@InfiniteKnot My machine is great. Except I need a new battery and personally a bigger HD and stuff. It's rock solid though.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 03:15:52	@InfiniteKnot What if it even goes so far as to become obsolete? Buy new then! I love Apple but they just did it for money.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 03:15:51	@AuRtist Hey! Good to see you pop up! Are things well?
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 03:04:18	@InfiniteKnot I know! Apple made my machine redundant in that its OS is no longer supported by any browsers. Not safe. Also OS too old for
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 03:00:38	Just a nanosecond of power loss in my place while listening to iTunes? Crash to iTunes itself. Playlists aren't saved in Library. Bye bye.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-04 02:55:46	Buying new #MacBook Pro! Loss of Playlists in iTunes wasn't machine's fault. Weather so bad to kill ISP all night affected me too.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 12:05:40	@AspiePenguin and I are getting ready to watch #PuppyBowl He can't wait to ogle the Penguin Cheerleaders. I'm just going to chill and watch.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 05:53:20	Fuck. Lost all my Playlists in iTunes. Any ideas to get them back anyone? All my music looks there. Doing reboot now.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 05:27:27	That's it. I'm buying a new MacBook. Fuck money. Slowly waiting for my entire iTunes Library to come back to me. Opened with 500 songs!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 05:27:27	Now THAT was a BIG crash! I NEVER crash with an Internet drop! Thank god for a native files and easy importing. We're coming back to life.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 04:10:00	@MyNocturnalSoul No problem! I hope you got some good sleepies. Now you listen up to Dr. PA. Get lots more rest. *winks*

16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 03:29:28	*pondering buying new MacBook instead of repairing current one* Still paying off debt from unexpected crap but quicker than expected. *want*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 02:33:00	@cabel Oh Bravo! I suppose nothing was ever known, understood or even discussed HOW long ago they discontinued Internet Exploder for Macs?
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 02:26:06	Thus when quitting smoking (which I want to do) having #epilepsy and needing a constant flow of nicotine in me? Careful and with my doctors!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 02:22:27	Sick or not #epilepsy neural network means I must smoke. We have SO many more nicotine receptors than others. Some folks are okay. Not me.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 01:58:58	@MyNocturnalSoul How are you feeling? OH! My tea feels so good...so warm for my throat and chest... *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 01:56:20	Knew it. Writing long and important comment back to someone and *poof* Everything I'd written gone from my blog. Now I REALLY need to rest.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 01:43:27	After huge loss (ISP all night , Total MacBook Crash-never!) I have to find what I was doing. Mac auto-save for apps but certain blog...?
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 01:36:42	@MyNocturnalSoul Yes, love. Please do so. We'll relax and recover together online! *giggles* x
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 01:11:57	@MyNocturnalSoul See my last Tweet. You can't do ANYTHING when you're sick. That's my excuse anyway.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 01:09:04	Time for tea, maybe some food? I think I have a fever inducing delirium. It sure did sleeping last night! Tea=Caffeine=Function. Let's see.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 00:59:58	I have now made a total 16,000 Tweets! #whocares
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 00:29:11	@HardAspie This one here means you are so grateful you can use your term, object etc. because you could confirm all its details in Wiki!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-03 00:24:20	@HardAspie With the last one I thought you were saying: "Like dumb fucks! Fuck service!" Like dealing with people in call centres for help?

16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 11:28:53	I FUCKING HATE THIS!!! IT HURTS!!! STUPID #BIPOLAR YOU WERE CONTROLLED FOR A WHILE AFTER THE LAST MED CHANGE!!! Okay. Wee break. Step back.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 11:21:38	Bloody hell! The same song blasting over and over again? Then WHAM! BOOM! See ya Saturn, Jupiter! My #Mania is shooting way past you! Oy.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 11:17:10	Although, dear readers. Please note my Tweets do not show how #Manic I am now. It just HIT NOW! Hello #insomnia My heart is beating SO fast!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 11:11:30	I can't stop cycling and need my #meds adjusted. Severe #bipolar madness right now. Like immediately. I need some Valium. Like immediately.

16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 11:07:45	Time for good ol' "Comorbidities Overlapping OCD." Listening to "Never Wanted This" by #ArminVanBuren feat. Justine Suissa. Neighbours=FTW?

16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 11:01:28	@HardAspie I was trying to work it out like an acronym with no spaces. *nods*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 11:00:22	@HardAspie *displays less crooked Aspie face and smiles* How are you hon?
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 10:59:21	@HardAspie Sometimes I feel the same way...uh...yeah...sorta...right...in agreement. I think. *displays crooked Aspie face* x
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 10:30:58	Tell me how stupid I am again. SICK and should be IN BED! No, I'm on Twitter. My blog next? Do NOT expect intelligence from me right now.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 10:22:14	Tell me how stupid I am. My mobile is at 1% charging and I'm using it for Twitter. It keeps going down to 0%!!! On computer now. SPAZ o.O
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 10:20:27	@natashalarry *bigger grin*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 10:06:15	@natashalarry It's only been a few Tweets and I'm feeling the love! I think we're going to get along very well. *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 09:53:31	@natashalarry *grins back* Thank you for the RT. They make me feel special. No! Really! Faves too! It means someone is reading me. LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 09:36:30	My last Therapy Session was maybe not so productive as I thought. My Therapist's son was sick. Perhaps my Therapist is now sick like me.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 09:29:22	@natashalarry How the hell did I miss (not) following you? #twittersucks
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 07:47:35	Everything is ssspppiiinnnggg... Should probably get off my computer and crash on my bed. Yup. *kisses to all from behind surgical mask*
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 07:35:37	Knew it! Infection! Sick! WHOA! That came on fast! Maybe it will be out the door just as fast! Temperature almost 101 degrees. o.O
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 07:16:05	We are NOT going out. Needed to take Gravol. Sick with infection? So tired? Must always go lactose and sugar free or it gets worse. UGH.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 06:43:37	I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Or anything in the entire world. I'm too into blasting #SkinnyPuppy right now. "Assimilate" to be precise.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 06:40:41	However, now we can no longer hear, "We still have time." I'm blasting music WAY too loud. Enthusiasm for shopping quickly waning. VERY.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 06:38:17	Even though I'm computer-glued too exhausted to read! Imagine my enthusiasm for shopping. We keep saying, "We still have time." Uh, yeah.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-02 06:29:07	I should be going grocery shopping but the weather is snowy winter wonderland in a BAD WAY! My friend for muscles and I are computer-glued.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-01 02:42:45	@unsuicide HA! OMG. Quel Spaz Drag! That's what you get for me being barely online.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-01 02:18:19	Ok. Plume is doing weird things since an update. I gotta run. My ride. ACK!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-01 02:10:51	@InfiniteKnot I LOVE SOUP. Except for a couple. Gazpacho and Italian Wedding. I think that's it. Feel free to email me recipes!
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-01 02:08:38	Hi @unsuicide how are you? It's been a while. Could you email me to tell me since I haven't been online much? @Healthy_Minds #BellLetsTalk
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-01 01:47:44	Okay @AspiePenguin let's see if this works buddy.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-01 01:37:34	Well. It appears Plume isn't so DVNO. Lost updates, Mentions, DMs and all up that business again! Time sync and see if they come rolling in.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-01 01:27:31	I also downloaded the ringtone "Stress" by Justice for my personal email account. That was chosen for when my mother emails me.
16253011	patientanon	2014-02-01 01:22:46	I spent all day yesterday downloading ringtones on my my mobile. I chose DVNO for Twitter. No need to ask how cool I am. #egotistical

16253011	patientanon	2014-01-25 04:40:46	@InfiniteKnot Thanks again. I agree!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-25 04:39:28	@CoolR1a Thanks again for the Fave! I can be even more insane when NOT sick so consider yourself warned! Bloody hell I can't even type now!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-25 04:32:32	@CoolR1a That was supposed to be in the timeline and not a DM! I wanted to make everyone laugh but my mind is melting from my #migraine
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-25 04:21:36	@InfiniteKnot Thanks about liking my blog post too. *feels all warm and fuzzy inside* x
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-25 04:19:27	@InfiniteKnot Hey! How are you! OMG it's been ages! Look at me with my #migraine At least my mobile screen is smaller and not so bright!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-25 03:54:51	Okay. I tried to do a bit of Twitter stuff fast but I woke up with a killer #migraine I feel like I'm gonna heave. Back to bed! Bye folks!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-25 03:52:16	@ThatChrisGore Hi. I think you got me through PodCRASH but you can Follow me both there and here. Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-25 03:48:21	@JohnRoche99 You just have another (new) Follower now! Thanks for the Fave where I was mentioned within it. Faves make me feel special. LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-25 03:37:18	@RealDanTennick Thanks for the Follow. I'm picking up a lot of folks regarding music so that's great. Always good to check out new tunes.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-25 03:31:54	@CoolR1a Thanks for the Follow. Nice array of topics you cover! Impressive! I'm not doing much these days. Also I know nil about Physics!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-25 03:18:59	@EffeckClothing Thanks for the Fave.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-24 10:10:25	I'll be an Ice Cube #Goth LOL I'll try and work on that.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-24 10:08:33	I do currently own some clothes to #Goth me out. Good pants and how many Dr. Mart's? Love 'em. After the dye shopping! Winter here though!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-24 10:03:55	I'm going to reinvent myself as the little teenage #Goth I was. My hair is long enough to spike and dye! I wish I still had those clothes...
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-22 06:51:10	But don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be. So darlin' save the last dance for me...
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-22 06:36:18	I still have to work on my Blahg. Clean that big piece of horse shit up. *stares at keyboard mouth hanging open*
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-22 06:34:17	Holy Fuck! I'm missing Twitter Followers and just people all over the place! Blog Followers? Post stuff from people too? *tears hair out*
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-22 05:39:14	These external speakers cost me $10 and with my Mac's volume you can hear my music in the hallway! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-22 05:36:39	AHA! Let's see how much bass these little external speakers for my MacBook can handle! Time to dance everyone! WHOO!!!!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-22 05:32:59	@MakeMoreCoffee Oh, I know that silly girl. I was just being a silly girl in response. Because I DO know I CAN be an ignorant fuck at times!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-22 05:29:11	@MakeMoreCoffee Oh. Sorry. My Tweet was about my mobile. Maybe you did the Fave for the other person. If so, oops. *toodles and hops away*
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-22 05:26:02	I'm trying to do too much at the same time. That's "supposed" to be called "productivity." Right now, it's called "FRUSTRATION!!!" LOL
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-22 05:23:22	@MakeMoreCoffee Yes. You definitely are worth it and always have been. Even if I'm a bit of an ignorant fuck at times. Still, see above.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-22 05:18:50	@MakeMoreCoffee Thanks for the Fave. I think I actually fixed my shit ass mobile! I'm not even a techie either! The Luck Fairy came to me?

16253011	patientanon	2014-01-11 22:39:45	@HoneyxHawk Or, I might get up on that chandelier again and wreak some havoc. You can read my post yesterday about my head and more.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-11 22:39:44	@HoneyxHawk *grins* Now how did I know you were...sorry for not getting back to you sooner.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-11 22:39:44	@HoneyxHawk The more was going on Manic Shopping Sprees! Mission Accomplished. Three books of my idol. One hardcover rare? Sounds DROOLY!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-11 22:39:44	@HoneyxHawk I was too busy swinging on, from, whatever the #bipolar chandelier. Med Change! STAT! This might be my last Tweet. Ah meds...

16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 11:45:03	I should just go to bed. Even THAT would be much more exciting.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 11:38:53	Right now, nothing but Intellectually Eradicating Movies and Completely Sadistic Weather.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 11:31:50	@pueblokc Ouch on both fronts hon. Sorry to hear you were in hospital too. I hope you're feeling better. x #crohns
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 11:26:04	@HoneyxHawk *giggles* Thanks for Fave again too. Faves make me feel loved. *beams* LOL
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 07:50:23	@HoneyxHawk Thanks. Things are fine. It's just the general "life things" that get in the way you know? And me staying out of trouble LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 07:29:59	@HoneyxHawk Thanks for the Fave too doll. xx
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 07:29:34	@HoneyxHawk Piece of work I have in a book by Joe Chiodo. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was perfect for me! And you can tell who is me?
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 07:24:19	@HoneyxHawk Loads of trial and error. I'm sitting where I am for now though. See if all is good; no more changes? Yes. My Avatar. OMG! LOVE!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 07:22:49	@HoneyxHawk Herculian med change but it's made a difference. Huge. Med changes always make you sick and ick for a while though.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 07:21:43	@HoneyxHawk If I can keep going for a year I'll get my DL back. Don't have a car but rent one and visit my sister? I was sick with that.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 07:20:18	@HoneyxHawk I'm slowly on the mend. Just from this issue but love, it's been so long! Seizure free since the beginning of August!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 07:16:16	Okay. I think I've read enough Legislation today. Blah, Blah Code of More Blah Blah Section 219.3 iii)...not excluding...219.27. 28. and 45.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-08 05:03:47	Am I an "Advocate" or a "Lobbyist?" Sometimes I get confused. Maybe they're both the same? *raises eyebrows* Time to pick up the phone now!

16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 08:29:25	@Araldia I'm the reverse. It's the BIG THINGS that keep me from using my computer. Like icky big LOL
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 07:03:57	I was going to write a post but time took me away like a wave on an ocean. Or something. Maybe time for #RenandStimpy on TV. Or something.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 06:59:09	I was laughing so hard the other night. How do you know you're getting clean from #Detox and #Withdrawal ? YOU WANT A DRINK!!! LMAO! #addict
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 06:56:23	I figure with the #Detox and #Withdrawal I'll be clean soon. Still residual retro and anterograde amnesia problems a bit. ARGH!!! #addict
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 06:53:48	I'm still pretty tired with this #Detox and #Withdrawal but I can eat now. My head's on pretty straight LOL headaches, nausea meh. #addict

16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 06:33:35	I'm having WAY too much fun listening to music and freezing. Music doesn't keep you so warm. Even if it rocks. Did you know that? Truism.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 06:26:53	I don't give a shit what I wear around in my building. Even where there are cameras. Sometimes I even wave at them. Say, "I'm a SPAZ" o.O
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 06:20:12	I could go get my mail. Today's attire: not regular or hospital pyjamas. Scrubs my Gastro gave me. He's a guy so I'm drowning in them. LOL!

16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 05:38:44	What day is it? Anybody know? Oh. I'm on my computer now (with my pen in my mouth) and my computer can tell me the date. Is this earth?
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 05:34:33	Where the hell did my pen go? Oh, it's in my mouth. Where it always is when I'm working on a computer and have to write simultaneously.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 05:16:41	No reference #trivia Song. Easy for some? "...you rescue me you are my faith my hope my liberty and when there's darkness all around..."
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 04:57:39	@Recovery_Tools Hi there. I'm back to getting online a bit more. Still working on a Detox and Withdrawal at home. Sucks. But follow back!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 04:51:23	@BipolarAdvantag Hello. Yes, another person I've been late to contact. I'm still here so you can follow me again! Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 04:31:29	@OZGAmusic You nailed a big part of my musical repertoire! Sorry for the late follow but come back to me now that I'm (semi-)here. *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 04:29:01	No Google or any other references allowed #trivia Who was James Taylor's song "Sweet Baby James" dedicated to/written for. Tweet me back!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 04:21:23	@TimNLambert Hey thanks for the follow! Sorry I took so long. Not dead or rude so you can come back and follow me now! Cheers, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 04:12:21	I shouldn't even be online. #ADD Omen. I just went into the bathroom to try and make my tea. Yes, PA you WILL get better. More time. #addict
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 04:08:08	Jesus Christ I need more tea! However, bless you Andy Prieboy and "Far Side of Crazy!"
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 04:05:48	@AimHorror Don't know if I can get a feed to follow your blog. My Mac is in need of serious repair. It's not liking Tumblr. Boo!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 03:43:20	@Araldia No way! My MacBook needs serious help too. Like hundreds of dollars work of help. *head desks multiple times*
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 03:36:00	@AimHorror Hey, I know I'm late in getting to you. Thanks for the follow to me. I like you! Come back to and "re-follow?" Up to you. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 03:30:48	I need a new Medic-Alert bracelet I think. Wee PA has gotten more wee. My bracelet can slide off my hand now. Not very good is that, is it?
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 03:26:51	@HoneyxHawk Really sick and so much fucking shit raining down on me. I just couldn't TOUCH my Blog, Twitter, emails hell my computer period!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 03:25:00	Speaking of DEAD and RUDE! Hi @HoneyxHawk I still love you and you've never strayed from mind since I promised to email you *hangs head*
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 03:21:49	@Araldia I'm just trying to catch up with my Follows from waayy back since being offline for so long. They probably think I'm dead or RUDE!!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 03:19:09	@Araldia Way to go my sweetie. I've thought about shutting down my blog a million times so you are NOT alone! xx
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 03:17:48	@Araldia Then I posted a link to your blog for all to see! *ducks*
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 03:16:59	@Araldia That "Crisis" is what we all go through is shutting down our blogs! So go to this person and tell her to not to do it! Go now!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-07 03:15:41	@Araldia I left a comment on your blog about continuing it and then I sent a Tweet with a link to it that "someone" was having "The Crisis!"
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-05 12:18:54	I Can't Keep Trying To Fill All The Empty Holes In Your Life http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1JH
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-05 08:45:28	Please don't be mad at me @Araldia I was only trying to help. *stares at you with eyes full of sugar* I think I'm probably in trouble.
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-05 08:43:06	Okay. How did I do @Araldia by telling everyone to read your blog http:// mergedidentity.wordpress.com / Because you CAN'T shut it down! Am I in trouble?
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-05 08:38:54	Everyone! We have yet another "Should I Shut My Blog Down Again" Crisis! Tell this person NO!!! KEEP IT UP!!! Read http:// mergedidentity.wordpress.com /
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-05 06:52:07	@travelbelles I'm so memory-defaced. I promised 3 years ago or more to put this other Blog of yours on mine. Feel free to slap me. Done!
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-05 06:13:31	Once finally clean and can leave my apartment not a single drop. Stuck in cycle where every Detox and Withdrawal makes me sicker #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-05 06:11:28	I can't even believe I'm on my computer. Photophobia! And no energy? Every day in bed. How long is this going to fucking take? #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-05 06:08:44	Day 10 or 11 of still going through Detox and Withdrawal? I can eat now. That happened 2 days ago. Tired. All day in bed. #addiction
16253011	patientanon	2014-01-05 05:43:54	*bows down to @GlobalComment for placing me on thy list of Blogs* Why the hell didn't I follow you before! I'm dumb. Follow me back please?
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-29 04:29:53	I'll Buy the Last Round http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1Jw
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 05:18:22	@BeyondMeds Thanks for the Fave!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 04:38:48	@Canageek Okay love. Then like I said before, you're both there and here with me! xx
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 03:59:07	@Canageek It's alright. My birthday is a few months after Christmas. I'll even pay for shipping? Or you can send it when you get back?
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 03:55:48	@Canageek Yes! I'll take one of those please! We can go shopping when you're back? Never got around to it. No, the SFU Hoodie!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 03:53:07	@Canageek You silly boy! It's okay. I guess you also forgot what I selfishly asked for as a Christmas Pressie? Do you remember? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 02:46:17	@BeyondMeds LMAO!!! Thanks. That made me laugh "outside" the Mania! Purely on my own! Take care.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 02:37:47	@AspiePenguin Oh! I've never seen @patientanon go this high! RED ALERT! No wonder she was starting to get so bad yesterday!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 02:36:00	Do I talk to anyone today? Probably not. I'll say some Manic shit and...there goes another relationship. *shakes head and laughs* Okay music
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 02:33:53	HAPPY FUCKING CHRISTMASSSSS!!! #bipolar #manic #ivegonecrazy o_O
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 02:30:52	Would you like a side order of Valium with your Mania? No thanks. I'm seriously trying to watch my wait... #bipolar #manic
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 02:25:47	I have SO PISSED OFF close friends that I don't even know if they're coming back! Just the other day? Just recently. Just last night.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 02:24:25	It's not even anything to do with Christmas either!!! BWAH-HAH-HAH!!! Total triggers from so many other people. Relationship DEATHS.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-26 02:22:50	Christmas has now given me another pressie. Right now. I'm out of my mind MANIC!!! Seriously out of control. Also dissociating like crazy!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 12:46:15	Everyone Makes a Christmas Post... http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1Jk
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 07:46:48	Alright, @patientanon That is it! *slams laptop shut* I'll let you listen to music though. Unless you become further unruly. Today is... OH!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 07:44:01	What @AspiePenguin ? Are you going deaf? P-I-S-S O-F-F!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 07:42:52	@aspiepenguin What did you just say to me @patientanon ?
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 07:41:25	@AspiePenguin Will you gimme a break! Piss off!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 05:50:48	@TriniGirlBlue Here you have to be seizure free for a year to get DL back. I've done it before once? No car but rent one to visit sister!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 05:50:47	@TriniGirlBlue Thanks hon. End of December so with my horrific Dyscalculia that means 6 mos! 6 more and I can drive and again!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 05:50:45	@NataliaAntonova You too. Love you as well honey. xo
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 04:14:29	@TriniGirlBlue No problem. Not jelly. I'm still WAY on/off with my blog but at least I can maybe look at it sometimes!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 04:12:14	@NataliaAntonova If this makes no sense, just a plain, "Hi!"
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 04:11:09	@NataliaAntonova I think you asked me to guess what your working space was like at the time. I guessed what type of chair you were in.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 04:08:00	@n8wachT I don't regret shaving my head for Cancer Awareness and Support in any way. I just kind of want my hair back now LOL! Ages to grow!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 04:04:15	@n8wachT But more on PG-Rated Bendability? My bedhead today. A little tuft up to look like yoe ear! oe oe
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 04:00:58	@n8wachT *laughing* As per me being a brat and more, we'll talk about how "bendable" woe both are via email. @AspiePenguin is ALWAYS right.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:57:26	@TriniGirlBlue No seizures since the beginning of August and mood cessation too-unless triggers! And you? Also laughing at husband. Fry hair
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:55:12	@TriniGirlBlue Pretty good actually. Trying to get back to my blog in not too much of a non-whiny way but MEDS! Finally on insane change.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:31:43	@NataliaAntonova I think we both died in shock I got it right! Keen observation maybe? You're far away but a mental image and personality?
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:27:57	@NataliaAntonova Hey Sis'! How are you? *jumps in your lap to rock back and forth* I think it was SO long ago I guessed what chair you had?
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:24:31	@TriniGirlBlue BOO!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:22:00	@n8wachT I protested (or tried!) but there was some strong Pressie DNA happening there.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:18:52	@n8wachT @shiv379 @YogaChicky and the other person have also mailed me pressies too. Sometimes from all over the world!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:16:05	@n8wachT I even plugged into a radio station in iTunes to listen to music and what was going on. I was dusted but a very sweet thing to do.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:12:36	@n8wachT We did Tweet and actually call periodically, but I was still left alone for long extensions.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:09:58	@n8wachT You know I'm in "Canada" so far but talk about a time difference! I had to stay up all night for those cheeky...LOL.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:06:48	@n8wachT Although this was pretty funny. I had @shiv379 @YogaChicky and another person call me as the clock hit midnight in bloody Sydney!!!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 03:04:19	@n8wachT Our Christmas Marathon should be interesting. You might be tired if you can't bend time so much being the further ahead.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 02:45:25	I got an amazing Christmas pressie. My period. It hurts. A LOT. Thanks you stupid fat bastard. Picture bleeding your coat each month!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-25 02:32:28	@n8wachT Well Mr. Timelord you sound pretty powerful. Can you make it bend like it almost goes away? <insert bad Matrix quote re: no spoon>
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-24 11:37:02	@n8wachT oee! oee! It's Christmas Eve there! I wish I had something to put in your stocking. I guess just moe. For now? *giggles*
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-24 09:09:36	@n8wachT Also film hasn't lost its humour value. Narrative of boy as adult, period piece. Say 50s. Family spazzy, kids nuts. MAYHEM!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-24 08:09:46	@n8wachT And happiness not about the technology stuff LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-24 08:08:37	@n8wachT It's oekay. Long! Take time. Watching movie now and resting anyway. I know yoe're there? Never worry with yoe?
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-21 09:49:20	@ukschizophrenic xx
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-21 08:44:57	@n8wachT How's Owlie doing today?
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-20 02:31:28	Self-Indulgent Blogging http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1J9
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-19 07:58:39	Love Lost But Time to Love Myself? http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1J7
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-19 05:52:26	Yeah. That Guy. Part II. http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1J3
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-18 13:53:44	Yeah. That Guy. http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1J1
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-17 04:14:24	@rmlupo Thank you for replying. It means a lot because I wasn't whining or looking for attention. Anyone who knows me here? No spotlight.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-17 03:45:33	I'm also still not well. I should have been hospitalized as planned, not sent to that Detox hellhole with no medical care. I've relapsed 2x!
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-17 03:33:09	But nobody has to leave me alone as I screamed in pretty much an Aspie meltdown, even tantrum! If things are so ugly why make them worse.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-17 03:28:26	Heh. That, err, sceamy thing? My last Tweet? Um, bad Aspie Communication Issues now. Christmas is very bad for me. This year very bad.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-16 12:28:22	Leave me alone. The time for hell of Christmas and more has started earlier. As of now. It's begun faster than any year. Storm begun.
16253011	patientanon	2013-12-13 09:41:18	Not a Hospital But a Prison http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1IO

16253011	patientanon	2013-12-01 09:07:58	@shiv379 hey got your email address don't think I have much more to cover other than what was said except withdrawal stuff so can off now
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 06:48:36	@HardAspie @shiv379 Okay. Time to stare at an open fridge for a half hour, maybe eat, flop back on my bed, see if I have a fever. Have fun!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 06:40:39	@HardAspie @shiv379 Yes. Someone met through blogging said to me you have to have a thick skin to use Twitter. I agree.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 06:37:50	@HardAspie I totally agree. Always mind body but food terribly unappealing. Even still. Big hugs sweetie. You're marvelous too.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 06:34:55	@HardAspie I think we BOTH share the same honour! I hope you're not eating and choking at the same time! o.O I should actually try.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 06:30:09	@HardAspie It also means a lot when people like @shiv379 contact me. If others & don't contact me that is fine. If they don't care fine too.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 06:20:51	@HardAspie I hop on the damn screen with a problem and got a bloody tinfoil hat that immediately zeroes in on me. I think that's worth a lot
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 06:16:45	@HardAspie That's hardly tiny bit, what tiny bit, how tiny it is, does it matter, how much does it matter...IT MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME!!!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 06:15:34	@HardAspie For the tiny little bit that it matters you care? Are you fucking kidding me? You're all over me with love and care!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 06:08:53	@HardAspie I was off Twitter and to come back when I read the last thing you wrote here! You broke my damn heart, woman! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 06:01:16	@HardAspie It hasn't happened in SO long! Changes with my body brain meds. Maybe no surprise?
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 05:58:56	@HardAspie It's not so much unavoidable across the board. It's just where I'm surprisingly finding myself now. But drinking like this?
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 01:30:45	@shiv379 @HardAspie Thank you for the cuddles hun. Going to try to eat. Only have one tin of Ensure left. Bugger!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 01:28:20	@shiv379 @HardAspie GP said to call Monday to check how I'm doing and what they're doing so she'll probably call and say wtf.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 01:25:31	@shiv379 @HardAspie No. Just working so hard to get into that one unit, great psych floor. Faxed all forms with GP on Tuesday.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 01:19:48	@HardAspie @shiv379 No drinking today. Beddy & try to eat. *shakes head* Great combo I am to totally avoid food. Eating Disorder, Alcoholic.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 01:13:53	@HardAspie @shiv379 I'm not all insane, dying, needs detox ASAP! But never dealt with anything close to this in 20 years!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-29 01:09:25	@HardAspie @shiv379 Yes. Never knew it could happen so fast among heavy drinkers even if abstention for a while and restarting! Nuts, huh?
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 13:56:32	@HardAspie @shiv379 Just for example of how cluckfoxhousefuckerey it is, how about some withdrawal when you stop and while you still drink.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 13:26:20	@HardAspie xoxo
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 13:09:34	@HardAspie Thank you. Haven't been around so much lately but I love you for always being there for me. xx
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 13:06:38	I've gone back to 20 years of trying to deal with things but it's gotten too levels I can't even believe. And psych issues. Big part. No AA!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 13:02:49	I will admit I have admit I've never been so sick in my life. Paradoxically my med increase IS keeping my stable but too many triggers.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 12:58:13	Anyone else reading this who knows me well can email if they wish. Thank you. But if you choose not to it's alright. It's a lot to take on.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 12:53:48	@shiv379 No do think actually do have cravings physically when never did. Bad. DM me your email. Complicated. Withdrawal in different ways.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 12:01:47	@shiv379 That scares the right fuck out of me! Never like that! My body has never had any "cravings" but now it feels like my brain needs it
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 11:58:20	@shiv379 Nah. Not right in the morning but I used to think it was just psych triggers. Now I think it's physical addiction.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 10:33:11	I don't know how much they paid so far, but they also gave me money to slip in my pocket. Should save for tomorrow? OMG.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 10:30:25	I can't stop drinking. How could it get this bad? I keep looking for money everywhere to go out and drink. Tonight people have paid.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 10:27:35	Try to lower my alcohol consumption and she keeps repeating to me that I will promise to go straight to hospital if I I'm seriously suicidal
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 10:24:33	Meanwhile my GP knows I'm a hopeless case? I'm sitting in a bar getting wasted like every other night? All she can say to me is try..try...
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 10:19:55	I went to see my GP. We are trying to get me into the best hospital unit I know will be the best for me. I was there before. It was so good.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-28 10:14:05	@shiv379 Thanks but trying to stay safe. Hopefully. Until hospital and the exact floor I want to go too. Been before. Beat stay ever. xx
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-26 07:34:47	Going to Hospital http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1ID
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-26 00:34:40	@shiv379 Yes. I hear you. I'm all totally spazzy because here I am showing up on Twitter but not on my blog! OMG. xx
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 13:24:31	@shiv379 Thanks hon. Good to hear from you. *hugs back*
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 12:54:00	@StimtasticAspie It's a stunning piece (I think) by artist Chiodo. I can't stop looking at it. It's me. It's called "The Embrace."
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 12:50:19	@StimtasticAspie Big #cyborg hugs Have Manga to talk to you about and yes. Send you a picture of me. Upset sad cyborg. Need email.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 12:43:36	*twitch twitch click* Time for my maintenance and upgrades. #cyborg
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 12:37:28	@StimtastasticAspie Huh? Head is blind, eyes can't speak. Did you just say something about hugs?
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 01:25:31	Well, batt dying. I think that's my mobile telling me I have to figure out what the hell to do with myself now and today. Ugh. #lifesucks
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 01:18:54	@EnigmaAnonymous Well it all depends on the #cutting You do recall the times when I had to suture myself don't you?
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 01:15:17	@studentsanity #thingsyoulearninCBT When you feel you're done with it, go back inside. What was upsetting you might not seem so big a deal?
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 01:12:44	@studentsanity #thingsyoulearninCBT be completely immersed before you even know it. You'll find beauty? Interesting things. Maybe surprise!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 01:09:27	@studentsanity #thingsyoulearninCBT SO much is outside! Look! Hear! Feel! Smell! Touch! Do them all! Even at the same time! Your senses will
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 01:05:00	@studentsanity #thingsyoulearninCBT and makes you happy. If you are inside and feel trapped go outside. I feel this is the best way anyway.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 01:02:33	@studentsanity #thingsyoulearninCBT Immediately stop what you are doing. Get up, walk away and go to a place that gives you great pleasure
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 00:54:47	@studentsanity #thingsyoulearninCBT Insane Norepinephrine. Insane Adrenaline. I proved myself wrong. I was higher than a junkie on crack!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 00:54:47	@studentsanity #thingsyoulearninCBT My second point. CBT on me. If I get wingy and freaked out, this is one thing I've done. It's physical.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 00:49:38	@studentsanity #thingsyoulearninCBT hours! I didn't want to stop but the sun was going down and I hadn't layered up enough for the night.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 00:47:31	@studentsanity That's my second point though. So one day I FINALLY got out on my bike and went cycling around like crazy! I was riding for
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 00:45:07	@studentsanity #thingsyoulearninCBT where I can practise #CBT on myself! For the most part. That's what nine hospitalizations will give you.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-24 00:41:05	@studentsanity #thingsyoulearninCBT You know, I had tried that for ages before and I still felt like crap. Yeah. I've gotten to the point
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-23 03:59:58	@patientanon That would be when you "do" wrap. Not "don't." re: this about #cutting Automatic Typing!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-23 03:52:16	@EnigmaAnonymous Hmmm...fashion gear for #cutting? It would still have to be tight enough easy to remove to not disturb bandage beneath!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-22 12:20:17	I'm going to rest and stop using my mobile now. My #cutting is raising my arm and interrupting proper blood flow. Take care folks.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-22 12:16:59	Remove the wrapping immediately! You are losing blood flow to other parts of your body and your #cutting could become a medical emergency!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-22 12:14:18	For example. If you have done a #cutting on your arm make sure you can move your fingers easily with no no numbness. If they turn blue?
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-22 12:10:54	Make sure that when you don't wrap after your #cutting is definitely not too tight. Signs will be numbness around the area or the location.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-22 12:07:36	Then I thought about "instruction" about #cutting No. We do it. So do it safely. So if you have to wrap in any way because you can't tape?
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-22 12:03:01	Someone gave me a Fave me for me last Tweet about #cutting To talk is one thing and that is good. It can reduce stigma and help others.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-22 11:57:57	@BloodBathaway Thanks for the Fave re: #cutting I'll say more in another Tweet.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-22 11:39:05	Just don't put too much pressure on. Blood needs to flow to heal. Can't believe I'm giving lessons on this. But safe #cutting . Really? True.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-22 11:35:49	Ah, it's a bugger when you run out of tape but you've got all the other supplies for #cutting Dr. PA has lots of other medical gear. Fuck.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-22 10:00:02	That's right! after two emails to support, they can't fix me blipping to Twitter! Cust. Serv. SO Rocks.

16253011	patientanon	2013-11-04 23:53:01	@Channelomics Math is the only discipline that guarantees you a correct answer. I believe that is why nobody understands my humour. A few?
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-04 23:48:22	@Channelomics T'was just a joke. You have yet to understand the theory of Patient Anonymous Humour. Actually more like a mathematical proof.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-04 23:27:12	@Channelomics Things are getting pretty rocky in my life these days. Loads of gasoline and a match is pretty painful you know?
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-04 23:21:32	@Channelomics If we whittle things all the way down to the charges of ions and simply their channels could I still self immolate? Thanks!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-04 23:14:37	@Channelomics Okay. I know I have ridiculous amounts of electricity running through my entire body. I also knew this BEFORE The Matrix.

16253011	patientanon	2013-11-02 05:53:17	@pueblokc It's only when I'm online (now) where I can see missing activity. I hate it! It's fucked! But again, at least I can see people!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-02 05:50:55	@pueblokc at all to an email system. Moreover, all the apps are merely vehicles to use Twitter. I don't know of any that would fix things!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-02 05:48:45	@pueblokc Eventually the emails come through but not Twitter stuff unless things are synced. This is a social media platform and not related
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-02 05:44:20	@pueblokc Thanks for the RT too sweetie. I can see it now. Due to the sync crap I lose Twitter info. It's all to do with gmail.
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-02 05:28:25	@pueblokc Feel the need for an auscultation, do we? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-02 05:22:27	@readheadgirl Not very many and we end up with a lot left. Stuff donated or bought where chocolate bars and big stuff are really cheap!
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-02 05:16:35	@readheadgirl I went as Dr. PA! Scrubs, my steth ($$$!) gloves, I even have masks with happy faces so them! Left BP cuff upstairs ($$$!)
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-02 05:09:18	@readheadgirl Excellent! If you didn't catch it I went down to our lobby to hand out things. Always loads of stuff left so we take some home
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-02 04:51:10	@readheadgirl How did it go last night with my nephew Henry?

16253011	patientanon	2013-11-01 05:29:42	@readheadgirl I remember those days. You have a costume on under your coat. o.O Just tell him the most important thing was he got dressed up
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-01 04:41:59	@readheadgirl I mean, they're little kids. Even though it's Halloween I don't want to give them iatrophobia! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-01 04:37:41	@readheadgirl Always dress up as Dr. PA! Have all the gear. Scrubs, steth, pressure cuff, masks, gloves. Bald now so maybe a bandana?
16253011	patientanon	2013-11-01 04:33:01	@readheadgirl They had stuff out in the lobby here and I've always done it but said I was too tired this time around. Nah think I will.

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 09:12:05	So let me ask you all. How do you dress for a funeral?
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 09:00:35	And you know, people might be thinking so much about me, so much about you, in real life or online, but try not to lose who you really are.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 08:50:41	Blow job guy left thank god but now I've got some guy trashing the place where I lost the job I loved and had for years. You just can't win.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 08:34:28	Only for a cigarette though. I still haven't paid my bill. What the hell??? #neverlookedlikeaprostitutebefoe #wearingfuneralclothes
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 08:29:26	Terrible to say but this might be my funeral. Not my friend's mother's. I tried to take his icky offer as a compliment but then ran away!
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 08:26:11	Less then the going rate for a blow job??? o_O Obviously I said no. He said think about it and has now bought me more to drink.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 08:23:02	I kind of clued in and said I'd NEVER be a prostitute and sell my body! Uh, no. Not me. Then he said $40 Huh? For what?
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 08:19:43	your income. I'm a writer and blah, blah, other skills but it would have to be under the table. Under the table indeed #aspie PA !!!
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 08:16:57	Ok. Does THIS happen at any kind of Irish Wake? Older guy I know asked me about working. I said being on government assistance they chop
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 08:16:57	Apparently now I'm at an Irish Wake with people buying me drinks. Well, the family was Irish! Fuck me.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 05:57:30	I saw so many extended family members as I was adopted and have known R. for ages. I am drinking even though I shouldn't be #selfmedication
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-26 05:57:30	I am just home but out after my friend R.'s mother's funeral. I have lit three candles on my table for each of her her children.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-24 10:06:21	No that's not her decision. It's her body's. It was fine during but let me tell you, it REALLY HURTS when you have #fibroids #GBLT
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-24 10:02:43	Yes "gay" or "lesbian" PA slept and had amazing sex with a man. It will be the last time ever though. Not by sexual orientation. #GBLT
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-24 09:59:14	Maybe a post? Shocking! I hate labels but sometimes we need them. Where is that sweet guy I had sex with the other night??? #GBLT
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-24 09:59:14	@StimtasticAspie I've been told both. Crazy Good; Crazy Bad.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-22 10:56:04	Sorry in bad place for a signal for first Tweet. I was walking down the street and heard so loudly, "Hi PA!" nobody there I knew. Read on...
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-22 10:47:17	I stopped. Back into head. Was that you buddy? Yes. This "integration" is happening really fast! Too fast? More stuff! #DID #PTSD #wombtwin
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-22 10:47:17	Ok! I think we're seriously integrating. I was just walking down the street and I heard a person say, "Hi PA!" #DID #PTSD #wombtwin
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-22 10:47:17	It was loud as hell! I kept looking around for someone who knew me. Back and forth. I asked Bruce because it was a guy. #DID #PTSD #wombtwin
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-22 10:12:03	Random Fact: Don't rinse cooked pasta. It should be left boiled alone so your sauces absorb and it envelope it for a better taste.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-22 08:24:15	Wow. My bald head is getting cold. Where's my hat. And YES I do have hair normally. READ MY BLOG!!!

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-22 08:04:50	Oh, I still have power while I sit upon my beautiful Steed. It will disappear at any moment though. The power that is. Not my horse.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-22 08:01:27	@StimtasticAspie Ah, I take it back. Go ahead and drive me crazy. *winks*

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-14 12:15:15	@CalliCoop Oh hon. Don't really have much to say on that but maybe just take different things in slow but steady steps?
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-14 12:11:08	Oh boy. Asking the twins for help and nothing but spankings for drinking. They're right though. #ptsd #DID #wombtwinsurvivor

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-14 10:21:57	@StimtasticAspie Did you get my replies? My phone was buggered at the time?
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-14 10:17:23	@ukschizophrenic I still want a picture of you where I can really see you. Then I can file you away and keep you safe too. XOXO
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-14 10:12:34	I really do think all you, my blog and Twitter followers keep me going somehow. I've got you all saved away in files to keep you safe.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-14 10:09:41	I just got another blog follow. Thanks if you're not even seeing this on Twitter! But thank you all of my blog and Twitter followers...
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-14 08:25:49	I think I'll go next. But not before I shave my head for kids with #cancer
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-14 08:24:14	Oh I'm also out paying respects to a guy that died recently in our neighborhood. "Death in everywhere, there are flies on the windscreen..."
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-14 07:38:39	Post in Draft on blog. Friend's mom dying any minute from #cancer But found my dream for YEARS come true? I can shave my head. Kids' Wigs.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-13 10:30:46	Try to sleep to go before a Judge tomorrow? Like it will matter? #PAsucks
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-13 10:27:29	A friend of mine used to say, "You do the crime, you do the pay the crime." Imminent crash tomorrow. Ok. I'm in jail now. Guilty tomorrow.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-13 10:05:52	Bloody hell! At least I managed to stop listening to #DeadCanDance #manic #bipolar #depression
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-13 10:04:36	Is it time to stop blasting the Chameleons UK and what is the definition of "blasting?" #manic #bipolar #depression
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-12 08:12:51	Okay. Back to rest and I ain't sayin' nutton' to nobody else around here. Except the Manager of the building tomorrow. Even if he cares.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-12 08:06:27	No. I don't think so. It was a bizarre "gift" from someone who is very unstable. If he sees that I haven't accepted it? He could get worse!
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-12 07:57:52	He even signed the front page. Ruckus in the hallway! Let's play a combination of Twister and CSI! A woman was leave it so they can see it!
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-12 07:50:29	I think he's gone off them (again.) Been inside all day but just went to get mail. Book outside my door about Alcohol and Substance Abuse.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-12 07:43:08	I'm increasing my meds so on/off online? But can't hold back on this one! #Bipolar guy on my floor. Really sweet and quiet. More med talk?
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-10 11:05:01	In fact, if things are cached on Twitter and someday show up, I'm turning off my fucked up phone. So there. #ihatetechnology
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-10 11:04:44	My mobile is fucked. Maybe Twitter will cache my Tweets. #ihatetechnology

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-10 10:00:43	@Magdeline81 So. Topamax, Lamictal, Biphentin, Clobazam, Seroquel, Valium, Maxalt and Prevacid. That last one is for GERD though. Not head.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-10 10:00:43	@Magdeline81 I always say the "Magic Eight" to try and help me remember. I also take them for different reasons for all of my comorbidities!
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-10 10:00:43	OMFG! Leonardo Manco and his capture of Lisbeth Salander! First two editions of six in Graphic Novel Trilogy. Sensory Stopping. Amazing!
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-08 01:58:37	@StimtasticAspie Of course I still love to learn more! xx
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-08 01:55:44	@StimtasticAspie adult to get to the big city to reincarnate my love for #anime So I'm not as full of knowledge compared to lots of others!
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-08 01:52:26	@StimtasticAspie Oh right. Because of me going all gay with the #lgbt tangent, I never finished the problem. I had to wait until I was an
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-08 01:44:48	@StimtasticAspie in real life! I look back and OMG I was so bloody gay when a little girl! Definitely born gay! LMAO!!! #lgbt
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-08 01:40:22	@StimtasticAspie Star Blazers! God, I was so gay back then and didn't have a clue I wanted to be Derek Wildstar and fell in love with Nova
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-08 01:31:42	@StimtasticAspie Wee PA watching weekend cartoons and what the...? WOW! What is this? Not the same! I love it! VERY old but a classic.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-08 01:30:23	@StimtasticAspie a story to my #anime history. Grew up in a small town where there was nothing but that was after my introduction to it.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-08 01:25:13	@StimtasticAspie Oh not to worry love. Right now I'm having fun with Brand name Seroquel. See my blog? LOL I've never seen #Bleach but...

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-05 04:56:31	Scratch that last Tweet. The Graphic Novels are based on Larsson's Trilogy.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-05 04:52:04	Just bought first two Graphic Novels of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. *drools* Two books for each three films if I've got it right.

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-05 04:46:16	@Magdeline81 start rambling on like one of their Professors in Medical School who put them to sleep in class.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-05 04:43:36	@Magdeline81 Although maybe not completely? I tend to guide my own treatment with all of my doctors. They even tell me to shut up when I
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-05 04:39:04	@Magdeline81 Thanks. Let me know if you need any consulting services. *laughing* I've been known as Dr. PA on my blog for ages. A joke.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-05 01:43:59	Hi ho, Hi ho. Off to my Shrink I go. La, La, La, Dee, Dee, Dee... I'm too tired to make any more rhymes.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 13:29:18	Take care everyone.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 13:24:38	It's time for me to for me to stop making Tweets and definitely DMs even though the latter were meant well. But should not have been sent.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 13:13:44	You know what though? Jail isn't that bad. Trust me.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 13:10:31	What time is it? About to lose my mind? Forget that. I just heard a guy say he went to jail and "...it was no big deal..." Fine, jail time.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 13:02:05	@YogaChicky Thanks hun. Very few options for treatment and this is promising. Heading in good ways, x

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 12:51:18	@YogaChicky Two meds so hard but no seizures from the beginning of August and some calming of the horrid mood issues of the TASE that
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 12:49:12	@YogaChicky No it's insane. Do we go as far as x2 or x3 from my original dose? o.O But I finally got someone to listen? Somehow?
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 12:46:30	@YogaChicky Well I think maybe good? I've been so DEAD online and bedridden. HUGE med change and maybe my only chance of getting well?
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 12:42:46	@nerd8192 I didn't know you were diabetic sweetie. My issue is anaemia.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 12:35:45	@EmperorNorton lines. They speak for themselves.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 12:35:00	@EmperorNorton Wow! Nice! I haven't seen your face in a while. The gradients and shades are amazing. I don't need to anything about the

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 12:22:23	And that has nothing to do with being a Womb Twin Survivor and the Blog Post I wrote about that earlier tonight.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 12:20:12	Sometimes with all my comorbidities I think I can scare the hell out of people and I can't form decent relationships.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 11:56:43	I must say it's nice to be back here and on my blog after so long. Maybe because I'm feeling better with the meds? Not questioning it.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 11:52:49	@StimtasticAspie We should talk about Anime and such if you'd like. Maybe other shared interests? Feel free to email me. Prob best way.

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 11:46:16	@PanicPandaCat Topamax is tough. It's a temporal lobe med so it's on/off. Problems there? Golden. Iffy? Adjunct? Nuttin? Nuttin? But it is

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 11:39:57	@PanicPandaCat Thanks for the cuddle and the drastic weight loss is the increase in Topamax higher than what I take. Normally! Right now
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 11:36:31	@PanicPandaCat Also what the fuck's up?

16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 11:06:03	Nothing is worse than waiting for a response where there is conflict, confusion, misunderstanding and YOU are the one who MUST stay silent.
16253011	patientanon	2013-10-04 10:58:49	@BullyVille What a coincidence. I just did that today. It wasn't particularly pleasant. And still isn't. But the Vodka down here isn't bad.

16253011	patientanon	2013-05-16 00:24:39	Haven't Been Around. Thought of It But Other Thoughts Took Over. http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1E6
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-10 00:36:39	I laughed so hard when I had my first pelvic ultrasound. Didn't think it was invasive. Then, "Hello Mr. Dildo!" as the guy unwraps condom.
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-10 00:30:47	And to give you guys a laugh about getting all lubed up for pictures? For pelvic insertion of viewer that looks like a dildo.
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-10 00:23:52	Time to get lubed and rubbed all over the belly for pictures. For Renal? Drink lots of water hour before for the pelvic. Belly is abdominal.
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-10 00:20:53	Why was there creatinine there first? The RBCs and fuckin' WBC counts in my second sample. WBCs for god's sake! Now in waiting room. Waiting
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-10 00:17:01	My GP is excellent but should I be concerned about newer health issues and tests done stat? Third urine and now ultrasound for nephrology!

16253011	patientanon	2013-05-07 02:07:17	@snickerjelly Yes. Poor foot. Stupid gimpy foot. xo
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-04 14:18:24	Dr. PA always on duty! *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-04 14:16:01	@patientanon It's very sore now. If I'm going to sleep in a tensor just for my foot and ankle I'd actually like to make a splint for my leg.
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-04 14:11:43	Got comments. Thank you. Will respond back of course! Have another tensor. Of course Dr. PA does! Pain radiates to tibia area.
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-04 13:33:19	Ok. Either my phone's on the blink or the pain is making me do loads of typos. Sorry about that.
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-04 13:30:20	Maybe I should I should just sever my foot from my body. That would solve everything. I've got loads of canes. Get a prosthetic?
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-04 13:25:27	...in an incomplete immobilised injury. But leaving it not immobilised at all? I think that would be worse. Fuck.
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-04 13:21:05	I don't want to really have to sleep with it in a tensor now. But it needs stability and rest. I just don't want to be kicking...
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-04 13:17:51	Otherwise you risk cutting off blood flow. I overdid it tonight while out for a bit tonight even after giving my foot lots of rest.
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-04 13:13:38	How to properly wrap a tensor bandage. The basic and very important rule is make sure you can put at least one finger underneath.
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-02 04:10:57	@Feeling_low @marielouiseplum @psychbot To anyone who watches it despite the movie footage, the orchestra DID play that way physically! Yep!
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-02 04:07:10	@Feeling_low @marielouiseplum @psychbot Thanks for yet another inclusion. You're diggin' my tunes still? The video for Glenn Miller is fab.
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-02 02:01:06	Only in a tensor and that ain't so great. And a sandal to go outside. Can get pretty floppy. WHOO! One crazy assed #epilepsy #seizure WOWZA!
16253011	patientanon	2013-05-02 01:56:58	Ok back from GP for crazy foot from crazy #epilepsy #seizure X-rays done. Who knows WTF o.O Actually hoping for fracture to get more stable.

16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 02:10:16	@Kn0ckYrself0ut Instant Follow because you just gave me a combination of a smirk, snicker and a giggle. Then a hiccup.
16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 02:07:29	@Kn0ckYrself0ut OMG! What a fabulous RT. Only another writer (not true) could appreciate that! Not true? Anyone could. True? I'm a writer.

16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 00:54:27	@RebeccaAbbottGF I agree but I can't find you on Twitter. Still, answer = yes.
16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 00:47:23	@shiv379 @HardAspie life too! Not just a body. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 00:46:44	@shiv379 Yeah. Review discussion with @HardAspie Save me typing it all up again! More crap too than just the medical. Of course! I have a
16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 00:45:15	@S_daVanport Thanks. You too!
16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 00:44:47	@HardAspie would presumably mean issues with clearance. Ok. Enough. I'll stop now from drowning you in medical information!
16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 00:42:59	@HardAspie it wasn't bad. Just "a bit." I can't even remember it she said low or high or not! That's why need to look things up! High would
16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 00:40:51	@HardAspie look into some things as when I got the call from GP's office I was asleep. I forgot to ask for the actual measurement. She said
16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 00:39:33	@HardAspie off a bit. NEVER had problems with that! Which makes total sense as Creatinine has everything to do with your kidneys. I need to
16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 00:37:58	@HardAspie Anyway, a bit concerned as it's affecting other systems of my body. Hopefully nothing. Just fine but more tests as Creatinine is
16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 00:36:40	@HardAspie bit concerned that after being so sick for SO long and EVERYONE knows why (if you don't people loss of epilepsy med cold turkey.)
16253011	patientanon	2013-04-14 00:35:20	@HardAspie I'm crap. But trying not to be. If I can. If that's possible. At some points. Or even ever. *shakes head and laughs a bit* I'm a

16253011	patientanon	2013-04-02 02:39:40	Actually that last tweet might not be true. Maybe I've just worn watches with numbers all my life. I'm not now & it's a bit hard. #Aspergers

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 03:54:38	Okay we need to leave. I thought it was only ME having "One of Those Days" but it looks like we BOTH are!!! *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 03:51:53	@AspiePenguin That sounds very nice @patientanon I'm not at all used to you caring for me. That sounds delightful. Thank you.

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 03:47:26	@AspiePenguin What's up with the echolalia today? You just repeated exactly what I said!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 03:45:52	Yep, come on buddy.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 03:17:38	@Canageek lol let's see if I still have my Clobazam my entire life is hinging on that right now.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 01:21:58	@pueblokc Me too. *major laptop throwing fantasies* I've not had a drop of tea either. That, priority number one. Thanks love. x
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 01:20:00	@pueblokc HA! I think everything ran like crap long, long before ANYONE thought of ANY backdoor shit! *wry grin*
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 01:18:49	@pueblokc dicking around here no matter how stubborn I am to try and fix it. I need to try and be stubborn re: other things.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 01:17:59	@pueblokc time for this atm. Wasting time on #twitterbullshit Obv. I'm pissed off. But I have too much to do and I'm so tired. no more
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 01:16:35	@pueblokc I'm not getting #Plume or any other notifications from ANY other #twitter app I have! I'm in a vacuum of #twitterhell I don't have
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 01:15:08	@pueblokc Idk wtf are you doing #twitter Now Deck's messing me up with potential #phishing when I log on and I can't set up another acct.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 01:01:15	Hi Twitter. Are you going to play nice now? Am I still fucked up now? I'm on new platforms now. Are they not playing nice now? #twithack
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 00:57:40	Next I'm going to look at web interface. At least it doesn't look like I'm shooting out spam, shit, phishing malware crap to anyone anymore!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 00:56:18	@snickerjelly just take time for Twitter to catch up for my acct. but FUCK ME!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-26 00:55:20	@snickerjelly Ok. I finally got THEIR msg I was "compromised" but I'm still buggered in a lot of ways. No msgs incoming. Trying reboots. May
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 23:38:07	@snickerjelly So it asked you for your Twitter PW, you gave it, then tried to change it, and Twitter still asked for the old PW. Yes or no.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 13:23:03	@Canageek haha funny boy!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 13:18:38	@Canageek Yes. Three of them. I owe you! TY!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 13:04:11	@Canageek TY for the offer of picking me up last night for bed. Slow cane walking. And you do take pills. Silly Pills. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 13:00:18	@pueblokc Thanks sweetie x
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 13:00:18	@snickerjelly Did it change your Twitter PW?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 12:48:07	@snickerjelly something. Not sure where that link took you and why/what PW? What happened?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 12:48:02	@snickerjelly flash! Then I saw a few typical ones in the public timeline that make you look like an asshole for repeatedly promoting
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 12:45:29	@snickerjelly usually something about a pic or what a person is saying behind your back. They can run through all of your contacts in a
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 12:42:51	@snickerjelly Oh dear. This Twitter hack shit happens so much. First time only for me now. The msgs all tend to look the same. DMs are
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 12:37:03	@Numbaholic to dying when I ended up in a coma in the ICU for three days. xo
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 12:37:03	@Numbaholic I'm glad he's still with you. I can understand the pain of suicide too. And yet the mind state that takes you there. I was close
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 07:23:53	Others, hopefully I won't lose what you said as I never got notified (obv.'cause my acct. is fucked!) Just a quickie for me online now!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 07:19:56	I'll just send a general note of thanks to everyone who let me know I'd been hacked. Time for new PW!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-25 05:31:01	Even worse I'm hungry. You have to be very careful when in major #epilepsy situations. No sharp knives! I'll find something maybe.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 15:20:57	I hate being "paralytic.' Todd's paresis. I've seized and now it's taking my entire upper body just to try and move my legs #Epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 15:14:11	Fuck me all to hell #Epilepsy and #Aspergers too! Now hobbling around with my cane and can barely walk. Not like this in ages. My legs? AH!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 14:56:24	Right now a foetal overestimated #Aspie Not liking myself or even knowing myself. Nothing moves and everything moves. I sit. Watch. Scared.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 14:38:31	@Numbaholic Maybe I forgot this too *love*
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 14:35:45	@Numbaholic Bless you. Oh dear. I think that's all I can say to this response right now. Or bloody hell! xxxx
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 14:32:39	@Canageek Like I don't know that? Good grief. Are you on LSD right now or something?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 13:10:39	@Canageek You're ridiculous. She's just someone I'm talking with along with some other people.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 12:29:57	Still out for some stupid reason. Met this young gay girl. That's cool. She's also got both major epilepsy and mentalness. Life is weird.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 10:29:44	I really like my new wallpaper I chose for my phone. Pic of my writing about two Psychiatrists and contrasting models of... #amiobnoxious
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 10:18:49	@MakeMoreCoffee Melatonin did sweet fuck all for me. Ditto Tryptophan. I used to get away with benzos prn but that was 500 years ago.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 10:18:48	@MakeMoreCoffee Oh yes your email. Coming! Out but lost Wi-Fi. Thank goodness mobile linked so I just had to type a bit into it to save!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 09:25:08	@bridsm Like I just wrote to someone else. Right now might lose my Clobazam exactly like a year & a half ago. Potential epilepsy devastation
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 09:22:28	@MakeMoreCoffee Mail me some seeds! Probably won't be as chewy by then. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 09:18:15	@shiv379 The worst right now is the possibility of losing my Clobazam the exact same way I did a year and a half ago. No joke. Fuck me.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 09:16:18	@MakeMoreCoffee anxiety. But think about it. If my sleep meds aren't working it could be due to anxiety?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 09:14:03	@MakeMoreCoffee Sometimes it can still be so bad I need to do a Valium push. It's ok though. My docs know even though the Valium is for
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 09:11:56	@MakeMoreCoffee I take Seroquel for sleep as over the years my insomnia has become completely unmanageable. Except for some heavy duty APs
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-24 09:09:07	@MakeMoreCoffee I'm SO glad I saw the pumpkin seeds when I went shopping! Haven't had in years and if you're feeling like a snack HEALTHY!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-21 10:52:21	@MakeMoreCoffee *nods* you'll do it. Here have some pumpkin seeds. ()()()()()()()() Eating some while watching a movie.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-21 10:41:55	@MakeMoreCoffee to you! Things are now beginning to randomly occur that make me spin backward on my own axis. For indefinite periods of time
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-21 10:35:24	@MakeMoreCoffee I was on Zyprexa years ago and about 20lbs. too. Disappeared when off med. Now on Seroquel and nothing. Also will get back
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-21 10:30:33	@bridsm Actually we're both about the same size! Tiny!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-21 10:30:32	@NataliaAntonova Thanks
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-21 10:30:32	@Numbaholic Thank you. The Womb Twin Survivor stuff I'm trying to work on along with everything else. I hope I helped.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-21 10:30:32	@MakeMoreCoffee I've got a fair bit of variety. And yes researched med info and articles. Happy you like my wee blog too *smiles*
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-21 10:22:25	@YogaChicky No was saying how to stop hiccups involves diaphragm. Hyperventilate until you can't stop hold breath for as long as can. Works.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 17:19:32	@YogaChicky of years. Plus it's the area of the body that gives you the hiccups! Spasms. I know how to really get rid of hiccups. Do you?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 16:40:00	@YogaChicky Thanks. I do regulated w/ meditation but I can see where you're going I think? Diaphragm? That's a biggie as I've sung for a lot
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 16:33:50	@Canageek Yes. I am.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 16:33:50	@bridsm Yeah has been little one. Always thought of you that way. Just this sweet girl I could cuddle up with. What's going on? Nightmare.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 16:30:33	@MakeMoreCoffee am and all the rest. Also there's a lot of stupidity. But take your time reading it. No sorries. No worries. x
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 16:29:00	@MakeMoreCoffee speak the truth with no agenda or anything else. Just my perspective and on a personal level what has happened to me who I
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 16:23:39	@joqatana Uh, yeah. I don't even see that or a partner in my future. Broken PA
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 16:20:17	@MakeMoreCoffee It's ok. My blog is extremely open and very raw. I
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 13:03:42	Batt dying if I don't respond. Thanks everyone.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 13:02:51	@joqatana No problem. Yeah! I'm trolling Twitter for hot, gay or bi women who are into BDSM & want a relationship so I started here. #gblt
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:57:28	@MakeMoreCoffee I'm not officially Anorexic but complicated re: weight and clothing etc for a while. Search my blog 4 night eating syndrome
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:57:27	@MakeMoreCoffee I'm wee and I don't eat very well. 'Nuff said?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:57:00	@MakeMoreCoffee or night eating disorder. And we can talk about it. It made me gain as it really can! My baseline is 100lbs. Think there?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:50:34	@snickerjelly Meaning, going ok because of a huge chance I'll get crazy sick. But you know that.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:50:34	@snickerjelly That's funny! Got your comment on my blog that was really cute and funny too! Like I wrote today I still want to keep it going
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:48:29	@joqatana of Twitter! *laughs* So if you want to talk more about that or anything else feel free to email me.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:45:44	@joqatana Nor is it in mine. Even some of it on my blog. But I'm just saying I'm not going to get into all of my kink in the public timeline
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:39:33	@TheKyleConrad Thanks. Haven't been on Twitter much for a long time. Back more now. We both follow each other so I thought I should say Hi.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:38:04	@MakeMoreCoffee ok
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:35:37	@MakeMoreCoffee I have to tuck when I go out. Always cold. At home not so bad?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:35:37	@Canageek Et toi, aussie. #myfrenchsucks
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:32:34	@joqatana or it doesn't mean shit and I'm just being typically embarrassingly arsey. *winces*
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:32:28	@joqatana Oh you are killing me with what you're telling me! Not so good for wee PA a sub? I don't know if we should take this off Twitter
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:23:15	@HardAspie *random hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:23:14	@TheKyleConrad Hi Mr. Kyle. We haven't talked really so thought I'd do an introduction. Pleased to meet you?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:20:41	@alinapete I'm so far behind with your work but awesome! YAY!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:17:09	@joqatana Of course I love it. Why wouldn't I? Not being crazy is soooo out of vogue.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:17:09	@bridsm Yo!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:13:32	@Numbaholic It could look like DID or psychosis but a form of talking with others in my head who are all clear to me. Study done and now
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:13:32	@Numbaholic with me it is considered like a breakdown of the ego. My unconscious is talking 2 me. My dead twin/s are. Not sure if this helps
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:13:32	@Numbaholic the recognition of the dream. I've been doing a lot of work here trying to figure things out with my lost twin/s in the womb.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:05:48	@Numbaholic becoming detached or released a bit. Then stuff (for lack of a better word) is reaching your conscious level-but only through
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 12:04:30	@Numbaholic One thought and this might sound #Crazy but Freud did offer us a lot. While you're dreaming there could be some of your ego
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 11:59:31	@Numbaholic of anything that's been like a premonition. The only thing I can come up with is repetitive roles but that's not literal.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 11:57:00	@Numbaholic Whoo! I hardly ever remember my dreams but after a fair period I've gotten pretty good at lucid dreaming. Trying to think of
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 11:41:48	@joqatana Fet Scene so indeed. Whoops! Shit! My garter just popped off my stocking AGAIN! Also Stay ups suck. I got so sick of them!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 11:37:41	@joqatana Oooh. You're pretty! Maybe you shouldn't have told me that! But as always. You're straight. I spent several years in the BDSM and
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 11:34:23	@joqatana #Aspie That last reply was just to summon the Wicked bot if it's still around. Amazing though. Love ya for it and love ya anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 11:31:15	@Canageek Nope. This is better. A few steps away and a good resto but loud music at night? Fine for me though to come read, write etc.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 11:31:14	@joqatana Wicked!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 11:07:36	Sitting and reading "The Last of the Crazy People." Timothy Findley's first novel. Not quite 1/4 through and I'm enthralled. #MustRead
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 10:28:25	You know you're an #Aspie when you undo your pants to tuck in your shirt in a public place. Yes, I just did this. And people saw too.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 10:16:55	@Canageek Oh some Google location shit? Well, hi #Stalker You do know things are going too far between us if you're now stalking me? Tsk tsk
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 10:04:27	Unfortunately my Neuro didn't write my new Rx for my Clobazam properly. He kinda missed the bid part. At least the torture of shopping done.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 10:01:14	I just walked up to my bartender sweetie here with the most pathetic expression on my face. She nodded at me I nodded back and I went to sit

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 00:51:52	@Canageek Thanks hon. Bloody hell! Maybe the bookmark will tick this time as I NEED THAT PAPAER NOW!!! C P Panayiotopoulos is like a Deity

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 00:43:51	@ukschizophrenic Online you don't come across as one. I think that says something! Plus we all put ourselves down & think we're assholes!

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 00:34:20	@brain_opera Does that make clear now?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 00:34:03	@brain_opera I was trying to say Hi and give hugs to as many people as per the other night and I just put my general thought in your tweet.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 00:32:54	@NataliaAntonova Excellent. And don't forget. YOU'RE glamorous too! I'm still crazy. Even more than my current baseline. Check my blog?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-20 00:30:25	@snickerjelly Funny where we live .Great things around us but we never take advantage. We need to become tourists in our own cities etc.

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 09:12:42	@differently People don't help anyone and just say I'm an upstanding Christian or whatever and they're really assholes. Nope. Sorry.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 09:11:31	@differently Indeed. "Hidden" Rules like I said and who knows what else. Toss that mandate out the window too! That's my issue w/ hypocrisy.

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:56:33	@differently my sister rocks out and parties with people from her congregation, they drink and get pretty loaded sometimes. But how is THIS
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:55:30	@differently right now. My sister and I have had long talks about the JW beliefs and it's the most sound religion out there! Seriously! Also
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:54:28	@differently another religion that doesn't have the same fucked up shit but it's only hidden under some dark cloak. I will tell you right
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:53:30	@differently blood thing, anti-gay whatever, the 140,000 only make it to some sort of "Heaven." The latter is NOT true. But you find me
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:52:24	@differently did go to church briefly. My sister is a JW. I ALWAYS say this. The JWs get the worst rap out of them all. Fine they have the
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:51:09	@differently You know what? *ding* You totally rang and bell in my head and this is the perfect antidote for the trauma I suffered when my
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:44:51	@electroboyusa Thanks for the RT. I know you just did it because I gave you a kiss though.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:43:07	@differently that enough to explain anything? Everything? It's still kind of quirky in my head but my head is MORE than quirky LOL
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:42:02	@differently church as a kid briefly but we were never raised in a religious home. I just wanted to/ended up singing in the choir. So is
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:38:02	@differently rituals. Despite what the hell ever about god or anything, he said you would just love performing the rituals. Also I did go to
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:36:54	@differently he grew up Catholic. He said it would totally appeal to me more than any others since I'm an Aspie and there are repetitive
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:35:31	@differently things together if I can. As far as participating in the Catholic? I was told by my ex-friend J. about things going on there as
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:34:11	@differently observe and learn just what makes the clock tick. What's really going on? What are people believing (or claiming to) and tie
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:32:36	@differently a big ass dose of faith right now! I'm not saying I'm going to get it by attending church services or anything! But I want to
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:31:10	@differently about everything on the planet so I must be blessed as a cat with 900 lives instead of 9. Part curiosity but ultimately? I need
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:30:05	@differently hypocrisy. Still if your faith makes you a better person that is a good thing-even outside religion. I have always been curious
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:27:50	@differently Faith is a very powerful thing. I only have issues with organized religions that are basically cults (well all are?) and
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:26:22	@differently were to read it with an open mind. And heavy hitters! Bertrand Russell! Einstein! Ok. So back to faith and beliefs and that.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:24:53	@differently no clue. It is not so much of an argument against atheism but a philosophical stance. Which could blow atheism apart if you

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:19:47	@differently person too. Know that. So back to me wanting to attend any/every religious service possible. I am an atheist based upon
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:18:14	@differently the value of her beliefs and that I truly knew how important they were. I went on blah, blah to say that I am a spiritual
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:16:42	@differently complicated email, I told her to pray her brain out re: the impending Clobazam situation and me losing it again. Thus, I proved
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:15:08	@differently a non-theistic philosophy Buddhism. Although it can co-exist in Western form with any faith. Whatever. Before I responded to
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:13:43	@differently my sister. Messy stuff and such but she is a devout religious person. She knows my views as even though it is not a religion

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:01:00	@differently No problem to ask. Bit long and complicated if you don't mind ongoing tweets! After a long time have gotten back in touch with
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 08:01:00	@differently fuck this. Lemme get baby MacBook. Another mention not notified can't open link. Jesus! Sorry I just couldn't resist that!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 06:41:04	even though I'm not Jewish! Whether I participate will be my own choice but the Catholic rituals I know I will.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 06:38:19	want to bear witness to what they believe and how they react and participate in it due to that fact. I can already knock Shul of my list
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-06 06:35:52	I've decided I'm going to attend services at as many different people's religions and/or faiths as possible. Even despite my own beliefs. I

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-05 12:37:40	@Zinfrared I was definitely excited but no. She was fucking gorgeous and fucking straight...or confused? Either way a big fat ARGH!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-05 12:35:42	@Zinfrared I have no clue about prices. I had a girl come over to my place cook full Japanese meal and brought Sake. Don't get all excited.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-05 12:22:25	Off to find new CD... this is a very stupid and useless Tweet.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-05 12:22:25	@Zinfrared Yes. Sake is wonderful.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-05 12:22:25	@Zinfrared We didn't get a chance to listen to much music on NYE. Any suggestions? Granted you haven't seen all my CDs. Just kiddin'
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-05 12:04:52	I find it kind of ironic I'm drinking wine from this part of the world right now. *shakes head* Life is surely or unsurely a lot at times.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-05 11:56:48	That said, currently trying a Shiraz from New Zealand given to me. Wow! How long has it been since I've had a taste of Zealander Red!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-05 11:55:58	The perfect Red Pour. Red wine glasses are round. Shaped like a globe. You fill to what is about 1/4 but deceptively looks near 1/3.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-05 09:08:24	I'm back. If I lose my Clobazam for the second time that is just the way it will be and the path of my life (or part of it.) #buddhism

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-05 04:56:21	I better call my pharmacy. I could be SO fucked up again if I lose my Clobazam AGAIN. Better finish crying like hell before calling though.

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 11:42:11	And I think I'll add a Valium to the rest of the cocktail. Prophylaxis. *expects rough night ahead* Enough of the insomnia ok brain? Please?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 11:38:02	Ok. I'm already in a stir. Somehow my mobile just crashed (?!) Plume is getting my tail feathers ruffled completely my batt is dying. MEDS.

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 11:15:20	@HardAspie to create one doesn't seem to work. I've tried but things are too unpredictable! So I just wing it and do it on the fly I guess!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 11:11:04	@HardAspie important to keep me stable but any sort of proper one disappeared when I lost my job got sicker...you know the deal. Even trying
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 11:11:04	@HardAspie Exactly like my comment of minimizing my feelings. Drilled into my head from a kid. I can't feel bad. Schedules have always been
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 11:04:38	@HardAspie take time to deal with some heavy stuff. The kind of stuff where you have no clue if you'll be fine or not but you have no choice
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 11:02:01	@HardAspie WHOA. You are psychic. That last tweet says it all. And I may be minimizing that I'll be ok. In some ways alright. But I need to
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 10:59:44	@HardAspie More personal crap going on so definite issue. I'll be ok though sweetie. *big hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 10:57:21	@HardAspie TASE time too so even worse. For quite some time I just wait around at night until meds! But they take a while to kick in. Blah.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 10:52:26	@HardAspie Lately or for ages yes. *rolls eyes* Try to do stuff and it takes forever. Concentration pfft. Can't figure out what to do anyway

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 01:02:26	@PanicPandaCat Do you know what you just did to me by reading your msg? Or maybe what I did to myself. I need to lie down. Feeling weak.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 00:58:40	@PanicPandaCat And how exactly did you know I have a penchant for being held up against walls while being kissed?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-04 00:58:02	@PanicPandaCat I didn't see this like it disappeared as fast as you did! Could you come back and kiss me some?
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-03 01:21:48	@CalliCoop LOL You know, I drank more than I expected and didn't feel drunk either. I don't get hangovers too and people hate me for that.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-02 09:22:56	@Zinfrared @EnigmaAnonymous indeed and we still have some snow lying around. Slushball Fight! HA! We'd be so drenched and filthy.

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-02 04:15:49	@Canageek Thanks re: the pic. Looks I have more gray hair than I actually do I think. Yes. We will work it out. Not today though. Exhausted!

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-01 06:09:25	On bed close to jazz induced coma. Thinking of what to do next and when. Haven't "properly" entertained in? If you can't remember long time.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-01 05:25:20	Just "invented" a marinade. Not without spilling it all over the floor and me as well. I need a break. Didn't take ANY time to decompress!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-01 05:25:20	Bye bye jeans! I hope you marinate well!
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-01 05:19:53	@CorinaBecker Yep. That's all you can do. I have a Dietician and I eat healthy. I just don't eat my healthy food enough!

16253011	patientanon	2013-01-01 01:22:44	Typing while this guy driving is SO hard! Maybe I should use my voice recognition option. If it could hear me over the noise.
16253011	patientanon	2013-01-01 01:19:30	@CorinaBecker Lol could tell my on/off history of #anorectic behavior but for now let's just say I've gone from 105lbs. to 101lbs. in week

16253011	patientanon	2012-12-31 09:55:23	And finally the wine (and food) If I feel drunk at all anymore it's exhaustion. I'm not having any photophobia. I'm a bit nauseous but that
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-31 09:55:23	could be food related as I said before or the Typical Absence Status Epileptics. I really wanted to keep that out of things but it does make

16253011	patientanon	2012-12-31 07:25:10	I think any buzz I'm getting here is because I haven't had a drink in so long. Even though I said it was only 12 days that could be a 12
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-31 07:08:23	Insane news: after 1/3 of a glass I feel kind of loaded lol! Like an intelligent teenager who's never had a drink in their life!
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-31 07:01:33	I know you guys must think I'm a total asshole idiot but more good news. Along with Gravol I have fizzy water and gingerale at home.
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-31 06:56:48	crazy until I got here I was so scared! I think that may qualify somehow that I really don't want to drink?
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-31 06:54:57	but be careful with my cane! Good news: I'm finally getting at least SOME exercise for my legs! Bad news (or something) I was shaking like

16253011	patientanon	2012-12-21 10:54:11	Ok time to try & shut the party down. Meds & all OTC stuff taken. Try & read? TV? Might be saddest book or show ever & still bust a gut.

16253011	patientanon	2012-12-21 10:05:15	Oh fuck me! I'm still laughing and everything is still hilarious. I think the only way this will stop is when I take my meds but too early.

16253011	patientanon	2012-12-17 11:18:58	She seems cool with it and I won't go overboard. Maybe it could actually be a useful tool. Dissect the lyrics and just WHY?

16253011	patientanon	2012-12-15 14:09:26	Fuck You Legs. Haven't felt this in months! Longer! Need all upper body strength with cane. Great. Now laundry downstairs. #epilepsy #NCSE
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-15 11:51:32	Just emailed my mom about stoopid christmas and if I could maybe come over. This one is gonna be bad. Already bad and not even close #ptsd
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-15 05:39:53	Note: that last tweet was not sexist in any way. To be as close to this guy and another for comfort? Nice to have a woman to cuddle. #gblt
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-15 05:32:59	I have another blogger visiting me tomorrow. I feel like I'm running around like a good housewife for him now. Why ... http:// tmi.me/CDwlz
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-15 03:47:39	@loveme01 #goth #style #black #Lml Hey.
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 12:43:23	@Canageek You can't fool a fool a boy. I know. But your suggestions sound good. Well no force to watch anime! But food and eating help ok.
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 12:36:23	@Canageek Oh yes? Good for you! I hope you guys connect? Keep me posted!
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 12:25:31	Turned down my speakers a bit lol! Funny story? Just listened to Oh l'mour by Erasure. Years ago one of our gay ... http:// tmi.me/CyY1c
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 10:31:03	Time for some good old peripheral bondage again!
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 10:24:36	Oh god. Music. Now. Set up baby with speakers as I finally fixed that sound output problem. Not just only headphones anymore.
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 10:21:18	Tonight I have severely been a wounded bird, ever so thankful, on my knees in gratitude for two small favours from a gossipy hag. Check?
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 10:18:06	Living in this Co-op is a combination of Chess, a Rubik's Cube, any psychic ability you've got and playing dumb. I'm working on it.
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 09:04:57	Shutdown in 5...4...3...2...
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 09:02:25	I hate to say it but I can't get to all of my comments tonight!!! #anythingisbetterthannothing
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 08:16:52	@Canageek ARGH! You're just adding to my workload! Pfft. LOL. Shit. I may not get to everyone tonight. Spoke too soon?
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 07:45:47	@Canageek I just hope I don't miss any comments. My Inbox is a disaster and baby is acting up. Making typos again... *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 07:44:18	@Canageek Thanks. Nothing like a good haircut to boost you up a bit? And travel was pretty fast too thankfully.
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 07:37:50	*crosses eyes* *walks outside for a break*
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 07:37:18	I'm on a roll! I'm going to get to all of my outstanding comments unless my battery dies! Although I could just run home and get my cord.
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 06:30:37	So far one compliment on my new hair. I'm not #vain at all. Really! Does constantly staring in shop windows negate that fact too?
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 05:48:34	@EnigmaAnonymous Hi hon. Good to see you too *hug*
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 05:44:00	A new Hair Guru in town? Still out so it's getting mussed but that's what I want! I think I could be a #goth again. Going out when home!
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-14 02:27:31	Hurry, Hurry, HURRY!!! http:// wp.me/p3M8c-1Ak

16253011	patientanon	2012-12-12 11:16:56	Reason being, I think there is a massive way you can MAKE yourself feel lonely. And it's scary. So I want to talk to you all again. Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-12 11:13:20	Instead of whining of all the people I've "lost" on Twitter and blogging folks. Wrong approach. I need to start talking to you guys. Okay?
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-12 09:16:08	Olympic Bar Relay Race. Person bought me a pint. Tarbender put it down. Across room for more folks, back to me. Empty swiped from my hand!
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-12 05:58:07	And I'm still working on staying calm re: money to try and to fix baby, new peripherals. Ultra-uber-fab to see right after emailing her. HA!
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-10 08:48:05	@Zinsomniac uh oops
16253011	patientanon	2012-12-10 07:49:17	@Zinsomniac Hard to tell with new med change. Days are on/off, up/down. Literally one after the next. It has screwed up my hormones though!

16253011	patientanon	2012-12-01 10:11:37	Out enjoying a glass of red wine. A bit of snow here so for fun I wrote "Don't Give Up!" on the sidewalk. Someone walked over the "G" Ok.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-26 12:44:45	Which is the best #deadcandance album? Ohhhh... it's tough! I'm going to say "Spleen and Ideal."
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-26 11:26:08	Oh Harry I can't wait for you to return from Rio. We need more Consolation. Perhaps me the most? I have always served you well #boomerbible
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-26 11:14:56	I have every right to do whatever I want. I am now an Arch Harrier #boomerbible And who said #skinnypuppy wasn't relaxing. Harry never did.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-19 06:06:07	@spectrumdweller Thanks hon for thinking of me and saying you haven't forgotten. Take your time. No rush. Take care of you first.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-17 10:36:05	Ah what the hell. I'm exhausted, my mobile is dying. Let's get baby MacBook and maybe stare at my email? No promises any work done though!
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-17 10:24:58	@caylamclaughlan Hi thanks for this. I'll check them out with a bajillion other follows etc that I am WAY behind in doing already. o_O
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-17 10:04:19	Painting all of the walls inside my building tomorrow with some kind of "sprayers." We have been told that they are VERY LOUD. Can't wait.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-17 09:59:02	@GUBLERNATION Also, hello. Manners imperative. Could you follow me for just a nanosecond and DM me? I am insane but not an icky scary "fan."
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-17 09:43:43	Bach rockin' it out on the organ in Weimar Germany is over. What next? Interesting as the pieces sound almost ghoulish in parts. Halloween!
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-17 09:32:26	@GUBLERNATION Somehow "The Gobb" (or less a 'b') doesn't have as nice a ring to it as "The Gub..." Or I could be completely wrong.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-17 09:27:10	Music Therapy: friend played bassoon as kid. I wanted to. HA! Bigger than both of us! Not playing now but uses hands if she was to relax.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-17 02:54:28	Finally, so much for café's shite tea that is outrageously expensive and won't wake me up.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-17 02:49:40	So much for Internet connection in a tiny cafe. So much for my brain too incapable to write. So much for books I brought to read. Yet? Duh.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-17 02:43:42	So much for my allergies and immune system. I'm just fine! Woman ugh. So much for transit pushing time back. I must wait for hours now.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 23:09:15	Time! Time! Time! Starting to work on Twitter stuff because I'm way behind. Now run out the door but will bring baby if can get signal.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 23:02:20	@HardAspie HUGS back but sleep was poopy to say the least! Now gotta get a move on to meet accessible transit. Only half dressed *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 12:22:09	@HardAspie thanks hon but now I'm hungry! Going to lose more sleep now.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 11:12:52	Night all. Meds and the genius of Mark Hollis right now. Idk about sleep. Anxious about tomorrow. *shaddup head*
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 10:50:44	Good. Killing battery. Can't travel long trip w/ partial power! Ugh. Me on partial power. Early appt & must be clean. Takes 1/2hr. Epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 10:45:50	@Canageek Oh btw when got home late using paint sprayers that will be LOUD! Idk about my floor, time, wtf. May need to escape but we'll see?
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 10:33:20	@Zinsomniac And YES. Pretty good pizza place right across the street from me! Either that or I'll start doing some crazy shit cooking.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 10:33:20	@Zinsomniac Yep. Good sleepies very important! That's why I and the entire world should worship my bed.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 10:29:52	@Zinsomniac OMG. I can't believe you said hungry o_O Me too! Found great paper that made possible links to that and ADD. Vanished from web.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 10:20:51	@Zinsomniac Good you have a proper bed now too. Comfy sleep is very important for us mentalists!
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 10:16:50	@Zinsomniac Well you know my bed. Does that sound bad o.O Money? Buy what we want and do it at my place. Probably more fun that way anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 10:13:08	@Zinsomniac I'll even make you breakfast if you're well enough to eat. Or we'll lie in bed and watch Anime if it doesn't make you nauseous.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 10:02:00	@Zinsomniac Oh promise you'll come and we'll do it! It doesn't even have to be shots! I don't get hangovers so I can take care of you! OX
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 09:48:50	@Zinsomniac However next time you come we can get blasted with lots of shots and you can stay over! Omg. That would be hysterical.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 09:44:20	@Zinsomniac Oh no my pretty. Served neat (no ice) and a sipping drink! Especially the 12yr single malt whisky I just poured!
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 09:31:15	I need to relax with some tunes. This has been quite a day! A bit of vodka or whisky? Neither should affect my allergy testing. LOL
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 09:18:18	*dies*
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 09:18:18	It's funny too as no time to type and print what I've written. Now putting down my meds and dosages, times, Dr. PA now has doctor's writing!
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 09:12:47	Omg I'm so tired and turny twisty upside down I thought I was only taking 150mg of Lamictal. No. bid! 300!!! Making notes for new doc tmrw.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 09:12:47	SPAZ o_O
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 06:36:44	@YogaChicky thanks babe x
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 04:44:34	Just had therapy appt. I can keep her! She agreed with all of my "proposal" sliding scale too. I broke down, cried in gratitude and relief.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 02:24:53	Omg accessible driver to appt bought me tea as I'm early (haven't been to bank yet.) Pretty sure that's not allowed! Bless his kindness.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 02:02:43	@Canageek *laughing* well cuddles like last blogger i met who was also a guy.We were on my bed. Cuddles good from both of you.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 00:24:21	@pueblokc Oh no! *TRIES to kick irony in the ass* Please take care. x
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-16 00:18:17	@Canageek I was just being silly as we'll be on my bed etc.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-15 11:07:04	@ameliasprout violently ill out of nowhere, things won't heal or refuse to go away. Even picking up simple infections all the time.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-15 10:57:55	@ameliasprout Good to hear. Allergies are just the tip of the iceberg for me. I do have some I know. Biggest problem is why I keep becoming
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-15 10:46:45	Oh dear. Battery dying. Why the hell did they make my charger cord so short!!!
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-15 10:46:45	Well should try and settle in for now anyway. Take care everyone.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-15 10:36:07	@Canageek Oui. PA et toi dans? Avec mon... ok even with my mangled French I must stop. Got in himmel! That's Hebrew? Still people will talk!

16253011	patientanon	2012-11-15 10:02:29	Having visit from another blogger this weekend. #happy
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-15 10:02:16	@ameliasprout Thanks for the info. Having one done this week. 2-3hr appt with Immunologist. Longest appt in my life with a doctor!
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-15 09:57:41	@EmperorNorton Hi again Saxy. This was supposed to be from me but @AspiePenguin must have sent it for me when I was in the bathroom.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-15 09:39:55	Does anyone out there know the current procedure for allergy testing? Dr. PA is too tired to look up. 20yrs ago she did the scratch on back.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-15 09:28:03	Stereo broken so CDs via DVD players. My all region better for sound? Yep! Even had types of environments. One was bathroom! o.O #hilarious
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-15 09:19:35	@pueblokc Me as well. A total medical anomaly. Or worse?
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-14 12:46:37	OK. That's it. BED.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-14 12:46:09	I really should try and go to bed but going to hospital has totally screwed up my internal clock. I said I'd be back online sometime...
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-14 12:40:47	@pueblokc Well, I'll take responsibility then. Dr. PA was also there and solved a "Medical Mystery" with one girl (hint: epilepsy.)
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-14 12:36:44	listening to "The Guggenheim Grotto &quot;Cold Truth&quot;" ♫ http:// blip.fm/~1d823q

16253011	patientanon	2012-11-14 08:15:40	@pueblokc Thanks. If we count every stay however long this is number 11. Yes I am a professional patient. *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-14 08:11:02	@taralynn_poll Hi there. May have lots mobile contact with this message. Ready to admit myself to hospital I think you are asking?
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-14 08:07:40	Have 2 crucial appts this week. One with therapist I lost & Immunologist. Have decided 2 stay with therapist no matter what. Can't lose her.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-14 08:01:45	Hi all. Discharged today from hospital. Very tired but more or less in tact *laughs* Will try to get back to online world at some point.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-11 01:42:01	Getting ready. Just about no sleep. Knew I'd have to keep a watch on myself after losing my therapist. #hospital #selfharm

16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 11:39:02	@YogaChicky hey you. long time. how are you? just saw this and we're in same boat. I can't get knew so negotiating an overhaul for baby x
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 11:36:12	Odd. Wi-Fi now off, phone still saying no signal from provider yet I'm still here. Could it be? My dream come true? I'm a Cyborg!!!
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 11:28:06	@HardAspie it definitely does fit my current mood
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 11:28:06	@Canageek indeed but true question is when will meds kick in/work?
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 11:21:48	Let's test this. Provider down on phone Wi-Fi won't authenticate home network or anything. Tweets went through?
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 11:14:11	@HardAspie Cool! And music is all encompassing.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 11:11:38	Inzombiea #copyright #onlyifiwroteitfirst When should I even try to go to sleep?
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 11:00:48	@Zinsomniac ok will do thanks sweetie spaz ox
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 10:58:09	@HardAspie listen to "Reap the Wild Wind" by Ultravox.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 10:56:00	@HardAspie spazzy to see if it fit with the email offer. DING! Well it seems so to me. I express myself a lot through music. So re: emailing
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 10:56:00	@HardAspie You're welcome. We always hug. Well glad there is some good but the other. *sad face* Funny on a couple of fronts. I mentioned
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 10:56:00	@HardAspie you want to email me. Then one of my favorite songs come on by Ultravox. Then I had to listen to it a couple of times being so
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 10:56:00	@HardAspie music to everyone out there, then I mentioned my Auditory Processing Disorder. I was originally going to say I'm always here if
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 10:26:01	@Zinsomniac The music in the credits? Hard to read in a foreign language. o.O
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 10:22:28	@Zinsomniac Yes APD does. Dr. PA diagnosed herself after finally reading about it. Explains a lot. Mine isn't really severe though.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 10:18:43	@Canageek Weird how my buddy always replies when I mean it to be me! Ah he's probably jumping in when I go to the bathroom or something.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 10:16:09	@Zinsomniac just don't always know where to find what I hear if not listed. Also my Auditory Processing Disorder can get in the way totally.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 10:10:21	@Zinsomniac New avatar. Put pic of us up for another? o_O No. That would take Aspie Spazzy Limits too far. Anime music can be really cool. I
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 10:01:19	@HardAspie Hi how are you? Tweet including *big hugs* of course.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 09:58:31	So what is everyone listening to on their "broken" (mine) or non-broken stereos? Me? "if i was: the very best of midge ure & ultravox"
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 09:35:41	How about: "Can I help you guys set up the dominos and no longer sit in the audience anymore?"
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 09:26:48	fall or it landed right on top of me. Oh well. What can I say? ERM.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-10 09:23:55	sees me in the building. "I'm a REALLY bad cook!" I love those huge domino set ups and they tumble forever. Either I was the last one to

16253011	patientanon	2012-11-07 00:41:15	I just lost my therapist I've been seeing for a year. Bawling my eyes out on floor in front of office trying to reach GP.
16253011	patientanon	2012-11-06 10:36:07	But at least he knows I crush him and it took him forever to deal-shy, easily embarrassed. Ok now. Told him & he laughed like a school girl.

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-17 00:42:00	I am completely disgusted with this Typical Absence Status Epileptics syndrome I have. It turns me into an emotional and psychological

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-15 04:16:59	@KinkyPi can't deal with this now. If I remember you can import Bookmarks to Safari.

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-15 04:15:09	@KinkyPi You got it! For FF I need Leopard and my machine is too old. Like said, buy a new machine! From what I saw Opera will still support

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-15 04:13:45	@KinkyPi still using FF and baby needs work to get fixed anyway! So go with Opera for now. I can't buy a new machine *want* because of shit
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-15 04:12:32	@KinkyPi with the loss of FF I've lost all of its security features. Opera at least has that to its credit. Anything can happen to me now
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-15 04:11:26	@KinkyPi you check for me? Opera is at least supported I think. I took a peek and I think some other folks just said fuck it. Opera. Because

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-09 04:44:46	Watching documentary "Lone Twin" (again) Tissues are close by! Therapy tomorrow so talk of that? No. Other stuff I think. #wombtwinsurvivor

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:32:16	Okay, nini.

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:30:15	One more thing (because I can't shut up?) MP3 of the Moment is going to be rescued on my blog! I found someone with a server! Until then...
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:25:20	@shuiyinlo Thank you.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:20:02	@HardAspie *huggy huggy* Nighty Night.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:19:13	Ciao to all of you other hon's out there too.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:18:43	@HardAspie Nooooo!!!
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:18:33	@HardAspie Ciao hon. Should resty. Should beddy but restless.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:17:19	@HardAspie Or we just don't give a fuck and keep bouncing around saying "Huh? Can you say that again? Or did you mean this? Or that? Or I.."
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:16:13	I think I need to sign off now. I'm all screwy (well more than...) and I can't tell if my screen is too bright. *squints*
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:14:39	@HardAspie "Aspie Speak." It gets even more fun because then we can't even understand ourselves!
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:13:13	@HardAspie For example, I say "Multi Assing" instead of "Multi Tasking."
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:12:04	@HardAspie *nods* I like to make up my own.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:11:44	@HardAspie BWA-HAH-HAH. I outright REFUSE to wear them as I don't want anyone to know my name!
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:10:40	@HardAspie That was a massive joke but good wordplay. Wordplay is ace. Love it! Bring it on!
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:09:56	@HardAspie Name? I'm sorry. What did you call that?
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:09:03	@HardAspie And that's just the tip of the iceberg with my ADD. Where are my keys? Oh, in the fridge!
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:07:58	@HardAspie Socks! Shoelaces too. Leaving umbrellas behind somewhere. Forgetting pens when you need them. (Me) forgetting to renew scripts.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:04:21	@HardAspie Those are called our "good days." Hehe. You're making me laugh. You lose a rib, I keep losing bits of my skull.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:01:38	@HardAspie I know. Frustrating but what can you do? Harrumph.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 11:00:17	@HardAspie Oui mon chere.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:59:52	Is my music too loud for my neighbours? Piss off. Kiss my seizure-y arse.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:58:50	@HardAspie down I went with all my gear I was carrying. SPLAT! Head.Hit.Brick.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:57:34	@HardAspie Didn't have much of a choice! Body go boom and only "safe" place I could find at least a place to "lean" against something? Then
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:54:56	@HardAspie *grins* If we ever meet we can do it for real! Trying to think of one of my better head bonks. Brick wall?
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:53:03	@HardAspie Always unless you're not in my "Safe Touch Aspie Zone." You are though!
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:51:48	Okay. Safe to smoke. I'm not shaking and quaking anymore LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:50:44	@HardAspie HUGFEST!
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:50:27	@HardAspie Aspie literal darling? Sorry to point that out but we're both Aspies. I meant mental paralysis and then my body goes haywire?
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:48:55	@HardAspie Well, I've had enough head injuries for a lifetime? *shrugs*
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:48:15	Dislodge ribs? o_O
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:47:14	@HardAspie Dislodge ribs? o_o
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:46:36	@HardAspie paralytic!
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:44:46	@HardAspie Oh, chest stuff can be brutal. I mean, it's like you can't breathe! Of course that's painful! ACK!
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:43:59	@HardAspie than I would than under "normal" TASE conditions.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:43:34	@HardAspie Then it's like, okay, under stress, have this condition...could get ugly! This is why I think I may be seizing more and worse
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:42:27	@HardAspie Oh, totally. We underestimate things. Oh, I can handle it, but no. We have to clue in and then try to be prepared. As best we can
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:40:00	@HardAspie But a lot of this half hour shit was pretty big motor so ow. I just took the post-ictal therapy as best. Valium and Gravol.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:38:41	@HardAspie Yes. I am under extreme stress right now.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:38:20	@HardAspie in time. Otherwise...well, it still could have happened. I thought I was going to kick my GPs head off LOL
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:37:33	@HardAspie For me it depends what type but with some of the motor ones I get WHOO! I was in stirrups for a pap and just got out of them in
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:35:50	@HardAspie *cuddles close*
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:35:34	@HardAspie Mind-Body connection. Other issues in my life I think are making this one killer.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:34:47	@HardAspie I'm so tired for fuck's sake. That was crayyyzzzeee!!! *reaches for fizzy water for tummy* A big part for this TASE go 'round is
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:32:43	@HardAspie Thanks lovey. x

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 10:30:22	Okay. For maybe several reasons I've been seizing for a half hour intermittently. Pain. I'd really like a cigarette now. #epilepsy #seizures

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 04:33:48	Yes. I am now somewhat better as per what @aspiepenguin wrote earlier on my blog. My Tweets have been all over the map lately as well. It's
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-08 04:30:17	@alphabetania @ekverstania Yes I am. I haven't been online much and I had no clue. Thank you for not thinking I was a total offensive bitch.

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-07 04:01:16	@rescuedMango Thanks. Even if the person is out of their mind it still hurts *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-06 09:58:22	Ok enough of those Tweets and that shit. PAthetic. Laters.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-06 09:55:37	I said to someone I once knew I had the Reverse Midas Touch and everything I did touch turned into shit. She said no but bye. She was wrong!

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-06 06:43:20	Well that little tantrum felt nice. I always take the high road which I hopefully have done but I don't think it's over yet. #helpmebuddha
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-06 05:55:28	My neighbour is so toxic and so insane he should be put away forever. This ongoing game of Mental Chess is over. Check.Mate
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 11:14:19	@PanicPandaCat Whoo! Spankies! But not sure if I'm getting them 4 talking abt kink or the email confusion *ponders being bent over your lap*
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 10:36:53	@spectrumdweller Also sorry if my response sounded weird. Seizure brain blow up, doped up and Twitter problems so had to type up fast.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 10:19:46	@spectrumdweller Indeed filming our twisted lives. I did consider an upload etc. Maybe RENT ha ha some type of can. No iPod. Idk abt mine
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 02:11:34	@PanicPandaCat Oh. Unless you were saying put my hands up if it helps because I couldn't find the thread. Oops. Feel free to slap me.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 02:03:40	@PanicPandaCat I don't mind some chat about it but hello world, this is all I love about BDSM my fetishes, fantasies & what I want to do.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 01:53:28	@PanicPandaCat Too sick & weak for that one. Unless I'm lying down! Should maybe get into our kink off Twitter? Email better? *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 01:45:10	@EnigmaAnonymous Hi sweetie. Thank you too *hugs*

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 01:28:10	@KinkyPi Going out was a yay but the dissociation after definitely wasn't a yay.

16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 01:17:29	@spectrumdweller though. But wanted to strap it to my head or something so viewers could see everything through my eyes. Needed something
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 01:17:26	@PanicPandaCat Dammit! I still can't see anything in the convo thread now that it loaded! *throws hands up in air*
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 01:17:20	@spectrumdweller the Rent Dream is still alive!!! You know I had this idea to film myself being all epilepsy crazy sick. Don't have camera
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 01:17:19	@spectrumdweller No you certainly do not make idle propositions! If the invite was a prior Tweet I'm sorry I must have missed it. However
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 00:20:17	@leonc1963 Oh I finally got a convo to load! "Thanks" was a dumb reply. I should have said, "You're right!" Take care x
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 00:08:53	@HardAspie *hugs back*
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 00:08:53	@PanicPandaCat I can't read any of the damn thread on my phone! Bad connection! Will check later. x
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-05 00:08:53	@leonc1963 Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-03 12:10:03	I'm cancelling therapy. I'm not fit. I'll say that I'm sick. Became I am.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-03 12:06:22	to other people. Maybe I have gone totally mad! But remember the massive PTSD and Dissociative Amnesia. Ok. Enough. I want to puke again.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-03 12:06:22	And the worst part of it you really do feel like you're insane, you can't trust your own judgment and how the fuck can you explain it to
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-03 11:53:20	I can still feel Bruce hanging around. Not talking but not wanting me to take my meds. Fuck you Bruce. I took my meds. #DID #ptsd #insane
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-03 11:44:03	For a severe Emetophopic I really wish I could throw up right now. Even if I could pull off something bulimic no. I'm anorectic all the way.
16253011	patientanon	2012-10-03 11:20:14	My first kiss went a little like this... excuse me miss...if I had it my way... she won't ever get enough...if I had my way... Ok. Dreams

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-29 23:18:24	my phone and my computer I might too. What's the point of Twitter if I don't get my updates?
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-29 23:17:33	if I get it from your address I'll try and contact you. Then you can get in touch with Twitter about account hack. If this goes on w/ Plume

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-28 09:02:43	As for replies and stuff too I see something wrong. Didn't get them. Try and sort later but kinda a mess. So hope you all see this x
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-28 08:59:08	Over and out. Relationships aren't in the cards for me anyway. Done. Unless some beauty falls into my lap from Saturn. Maybe? #glbt
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-28 08:57:04	Is the moon in "Horny Man Phase?" Let me remind you again. I'm gay. And I looked like hell tonight! I'm cursed. No women for me? #glbt
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-27 02:27:52	from here. Disappear. Don't worry. Like I said hospital. They'll probably commit me forever as it's so out there but the point is to be safe
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-26 13:24:01	This is basically known as Survivor Guilt but it doesn't take away my feelings right now. I would really, really like to be dead and gone
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-26 13:23:46	I may have been a multiple. Yes try to heal but maybe better off to join them in their realm. Where I would be happier than being alive.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-26 13:11:34	the worst blow ever just now. I can't stop how it all works and no wonder people leave. Now I want to "leave." Join my lost twin or more as
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-26 13:11:06	Hospital? Oh fuck I hate the idea. Be ok tmrw? You guys don't know but I'm a Womb Twin Survivor and it's destroyed so much of my life. And
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-26 11:04:59	And now on the menu is some prime 4AD (record label) Cocteau Twins. I should try and sleep but tomorrow will be the same as all yesterdays.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-26 10:38:32	Oh fuck. Just had minor motor seizure in right leg. Not bad enough to have to put my drink down or cigarette out though! LMAO #epilepsy

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-26 09:50:40	A guy who really let me down some time ago bought me a slice of pizza as I hadn't eaten all day I bought him some sweets No point in grudges
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-26 04:19:53	@PanicPandaCat You never said anything back so to make sure that was sarcastic literary drama. I won't die if you won't marry me.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-26 03:45:39	Who else out there thinks @strombo is totally obnoxious? Oop! Battery dying! Good thing. Big bad @strombo will come and get me! *scared*

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-23 04:57:55	@PanicPandaCat divorced too. Maybe we could change that together? Grow a rose in a garden with no thorns? If you disagree I will accept your
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-23 04:57:55	@PanicPandaCat then put the ring in my mouth for safekeeping. And I almost choked on it. And I didn't catch you either. I have been forever
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-23 04:46:43	@PanicPandaCat Oh I fear I erred in my last reply. More proof I am a buffoon you would never want anyway. Not after I tried to catch you and
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-23 04:34:04	@TheRealSupermum You're welcome!

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-23 04:12:57	@Canageek True. I should remember that if I'm capable of speech!
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-23 04:06:20	I'm also kinda messy as I forgot to refill scripts. NO MORE SEROQUEL! MY SLEEP! Maybe that gave me my #migraine Or sicker on its own. I suck
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-23 03:36:42	Why am I online? Head been split into pieces with axe #migraine Ticked at messages waiting. Going through Follows too much though. Sorry!

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-20 09:58:13	It's rather scary how addiction can give us great insight. But when you end up really relying on that space and a lot of time there? Hmmm.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-20 09:49:15	Ok 4 pints and now a healthy glass of Cabernet. Therapy was good today. No. It really was. It's just the scary mountain I have to climb now.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-20 09:23:31	@PanicPandaCat Ok * bows down on bended knee* "Will you marry me?"
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-20 09:22:30	@angelsnest777 Thank you!
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-20 09:19:24	@mama_kass Ah well. I'm complicated. All ways around. A lot has changed since we've talked.

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 03:24:08	Q: How do you know when you need your medical textbooks and resources? A: When the word isn't in (my precious) Oxford Dictionary!
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 03:12:32	My allergies are driving me so mental I want to do a complete nasalusinusectomy.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 03:01:59	@LastSalmonMan Thanks for Fave & RT. So far I've done the dishes, make my first pint of tea (drink three daily.) Now pondering laundry. Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 01:50:09	@grandrounds Hi there. FYI the email address posted for the Subscriber List is insta-bounce! Perm fail, domain reject, email doesn't exist.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 01:31:18	Fuck me. I'm awake now so might as well exist. Need to try and do monotonous and repetitive tasks that require no thought.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 01:19:50	@PanicPandaCat somewhat warmer. *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 01:19:25	@PanicPandaCat it's just going to have to be online for now. We have gay marriage where I live! I can't remember the Netherlands. Yes? It is
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 01:17:59	@PanicPandaCat #5 is pretty cool too. You can same me your damsel in distress! But about this Domme (and other) *raises eyebrows* I suppose
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 01:16:29	@PanicPandaCat Also LOVE, LOVE. LOVE the pic on the front page! Are any of them you? The last I'm guessing is you. #1??? We have to meet!!!
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 01:13:24	@PanicPandaCat not my Domme. Well, you could be both but I don't have a baby fetish. I'm not a lifestyler so you could play both roles.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 01:12:09	@PanicPandaCat pout on face* We talked about your url and sites etc. And just talked. Shit! You were going to adopt me and be my fucking mom
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-17 01:10:45	@PanicPandaCat Uh, yeah. Whoa. Wasn't really expecting that as a response! But I just figured out who you really are! And so far away *huge

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-16 08:01:41	@Canageek Thanks sweetie *hugs* It's time to stop trying anything on baby and go with the tunes--which aren't SO dark? Yet?
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-16 07:57:26	Christ! Even my mouse is hating me right now. SERIOUS Karma issues. #igiveup

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-16 06:02:23	@PanicPandaCat Just looked at your profile to PROVE I need order. Mistress of none? You can be mine? *makes very odd face but with smile*
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-16 05:58:55	@PanicPandaCat Who needs order? Oh, bloody fuck I do! And that's just one thing. I need a hell of a lot more! AHHHHHHH!!!
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-15 08:33:19	Weird. My Tweets are kinda showing up out of order. Well I'm out of order too *shrug*
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-15 08:27:24	Just starting to look at free e-Book about being a surviving twin when mine lost in utero. Woman researcher one too. We've been emailing.

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-15 08:06:44	@mama_kass Oh sorry you're feeling bummed. Or were? I hope things are better now? x
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 11:37:59	I try to live a good life but the only problem is others enter it. o.O
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 11:37:58	@mama_kass Hey. Been a long time but a "Hi" if not a talk?
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 11:11:41	Everything is going to be as it is even though the future does not exist. My past is Samsara and teaches well. Get it together PA #buddhism
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 10:21:52	@bullcbull @joqatana Even if a woman doesn't know she's pregnant! Thanks. x
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 10:21:52	@bullcbull @joqatana I'm so sorry to hear that. The development during the first trimester is huge. That's why miscarriages happen then.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 10:21:50	After trying to sort out who knows how much rubble in my life (unsuccessfully) time for some #deadcandance "Spleen And Ideal" #whatamess
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 05:33:05	I can't even look at the site right now. There was a free book to download? But I don't think I can even be online right now. Signing off...
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 05:28:19	Pick.Me.Up.Off.Floor.Now. I found a mega-site-info-etc. about twin survivors where the twin (mine) died in utero. I can't move.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 04:28:48	@tiidgey to think of me. Yes wee PA is sentimental. Be careful hon.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 04:28:03	@tiidgey for me or give me gifts that's fine. Actually when anyone gives me a gift whatever it is it's special because they took the time to
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 04:26:48	@tiidgey Happy Birthday! I know how hard they can be for some of us. I'm not particularly fond of mine. But if people want to do nice things
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 03:53:09	Poor @aspiepenguin I'm trying to help him out for change o_O I'm writing down Follows for him but let's hope he can manage (and not die!)
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 03:48:53	I have so many goddamn blogs Bookmarked I'm gonna die before I can read them all! *ponders* Never mind.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 03:41:37	Fuck me. How do these Follows just "show up" in my list and I never got any notice beforehand! #twittersucks
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-13 03:24:55	@nurse_w_glasses Odd w/ my Tweets recently. @aspiepenguin spoke in my own voice. I think I was too busy fucking up my life. #epicfail

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-11 05:16:29	recognition but anyone can play #licensecargame ! The only rule is no vanity plates. So you look at a license and come up with something
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-11 05:15:03	I'd like to introduce a game but someone has taken my hash. So let's call it #licensecargame It's based upon my very simple #aspie pattern

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 12:06:59	@my_fight_within Hi can't engage in long talk about how you feel now as trying to sleep. But saw this so wanted to reply.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 12:02:13	@ukschizophrenic Oh I forgot lovey-dovey. Your goooooaaaalllll!!! Tweet. Totally reminded me of scene from Trainspotting! Ace!

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:58:39	@TriniGirlBlue Yeah that's why I wasn't sure but yay Macs!
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:49:17	@TriniGirlBlue Wasn't sure I could insert it in Twitter but from my Mac symbols. #mac #macsrock #apple #applerocks
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:40:43	@TriniGirlBlue Thanks. My health is 5,000 or more to ∞ fucked. That's tiny but an infinity symbol.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:38:25	@TriniGirlBlue Annoying is uber-fun sometimes. Until it drives you almost over the edge. That's why I want it now LOL
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:30:00	@TriniGirlBlue Email me the song LOL
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:29:27	@TriniGirlBlue Continuing infections all over. Why am I always so sick? Did it all kick off when I lost my Clobazam last June? Body nuked?
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:27:56	@TriniGirlBlue almost crawl on my hands and knees to a Walk-In Clinic for antibiotics (that sort of helped.) That's just the big stuff.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:25:22	@TriniGirlBlue in August? Extremely sick, dangerous "side effects" physical, neuro. Then in April there was a gastro "thing" that made me
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:23:16	@TriniGirlBlue Hi hon. God only knows what's going on with my body. Did you read the stuff on my blog about being in isolation in hospital
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:13:03	@fragmentz Physically I still have to my doctors but psychologically I am very committed to face things head on. How are you?
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:11:23	@fragmentz Granted I still am. But I'm now working very hard to try and deal with those things (and how they link to other issues) right now
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 10:09:24	@fragmentz Ok if you're comfortable with that. I'm not bad. Idk. Working on things. I keep talking about how damn sick I am so screw that!

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:50:26	Oh hon I know those feelings too. What's been programmed. Maybe we should sum it all up as (and I've said this before) "Blogging is Stupid."
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:41:50	@differently nothing you're doing or have done?
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:41:03	@differently are doing this and that, have their own problems, their own lives. So essentially, try not to think it's so big a deal. It's
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:40:00	@differently Interesting thought. Though, I came up with a statement while practising CBT on myself--"IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU!" Other people
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:36:39	@ukschizophrenic Thanks for the fave again sweetie LOL xo
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:35:45	@differently don't know what to say. I've gotten responses to posts that I think are useless and it's like, why is everybody here for this!
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:34:29	@differently Yes maybe prone to making you feel like shite if you write a really important post and nobody comments but maybe they just

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:29:39	@differently I don't give a toss about attracting readers either. I have no clue why I even blog period at times LOL But I'm still doing it
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:28:35	@differently You have now been added to my Blogroll! I will never understand blogging. It's totally bizarre. never even thought I'd have one
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:18:31	@differently may just pop out of the woodwork. I think I've lost some Follows--makes me sad. Esp if I know them. But new ones are great!
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:16:32	@differently in a whorehouse! No offense new followers. I write so I like to say funny things at times. But I don't get it! So new people

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 05:00:43	@differently *nods* I'm really feeling that now too since I've been so sick, all I talk about is being sick, PA shut up! We're tired of that
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 04:59:23	@differently You're preachin' to the choir baby! God, that's all I can think to say right now! Words right out of my mouth hon x
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 04:51:33	@ukschizophrenic Oh, yes. One other problem? I think it was made clear but we'd never get it on. I'm a girl. *laughing so hard*

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 04:43:18	@differently with past (or even present) societies (i.e. reading) as you'll fuck up the present and the future. I tossed that out with the
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 04:41:02	@differently some, kept some up. Before I would never delete any posts as I lived by "The Prime Directive." Star Trek. You can't meddle
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 04:39:46	@differently As in drive-by shootings! It's like I'm just out of my gourd! Then I wake up the next day and I'm totally aghast! I've deleted
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 04:38:31	@differently YW. Again I know but once you get on a roll you just can't stop! I've done the same on my blog. I call the posts "drive-bys."
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 03:22:54	Ok got up less than hour ago. Sleep probs can you say? Threw pillow across bed the other night. Just want to lie here but need baby to read
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 03:22:53	@fragmentz Back to more Twitter crap, I lost a lot of Follows. I thought either my blog (and I) sucked or it took me too long for new ones
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 03:22:53	@fragmentz as I was so sick. Don't sweat it hon. I'm still trying 2 work thru other folks. Shit you can even BUY Follows! Gimme a break!

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-09 02:54:54	@fragmentz Do you already know the person? I'm guessing not. I was all spazzy when I first using Twitter. Check person for follows comments

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-08 10:23:14	Flaking on my bed listening to Duran Duran's first album. I'm a teenager all over again! No. No. Not good years! AHHH!!!
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-08 09:56:50	@CanvasMinds You are most welcome and right back at ya!
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-08 09:23:45	@ukschizophrenic LOL Well I'm not a bear. Idk Not Andro but casual and can femme up? Pics on my blog but can send to you.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-08 09:10:53	@ukschizophrenic Somehow I just knew we'd get on. I love you already! *jumps all over you* Forget stone but about 5' 2" & a bit over 100lbs
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-08 08:26:34	@ukschizophrenic Have friend in London (Canadian working) Just abt died when he said close times. He's gay too. Last visit I was 2 sick 2 go
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-08 08:14:37	@ukschizophrenic I might miss a lot in real time but I can go back later and read your page. Have fun honey! xoxo
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-08 08:06:01	@ukschizophrenic WHOO HOO! Email me about your night out! I want all the deets. NOTHING is TMI! I'm gay btw. *giggles*
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-08 08:00:26	@differently I understand completely. I've been there. Drinking, deleting but know that everyone still cares for you here. They do.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-08 07:07:38	I'm out. Trying to write. Decided to Tweet. Oh. Someone put beer on my table too. That's kind of weird.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-07 05:08:17	@HardAspie Thanks sweetie and big hugs back.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-06 08:36:16	@HardAspie All I can say is you're so right. Feels I'm fighting a battle now front line w/ bows & arrows. Before I was in war with a rifle?
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-05 23:45:34	@Zinsomniac Cool. Hope the interview etc. goes well. Wish I could be a fly on the wall for some reason. SPAZ o.O
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-05 23:43:13	@HardAspie Maybe because I am so precisely scared of being this sick, death is not a problem. Even should it occur after I type this.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-05 23:41:41	@HardAspie Interesting. Makes me want to go back to my past & measure it all if I could? I make jokes re: being so sick but it scares me.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-05 11:29:15	Has anyone out there felt perfectly happy to die? I am. I'm not saying I want to right now or am suicidal. But to die right now? Quite fine.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-05 10:36:11	I can't believe I'm back on Twitter so much right now. Guess I don't have so much of a life than I did in the past... *silence *
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-05 10:36:09	I now command everyone to listen to "May I" by Gordon Lightfoot. Trust me.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-05 10:09:27	Wait. It's my entire body not just my legs. Another reason to just kill me.
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-05 10:05:28	Been laid up in bed for days (again) so could finally get out today. My legs are sore. Yes with Wonder Cane. Shoot.Me.Now. Lame horse?
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-05 09:00:31	@thePsychit You're most welcome and the same for following me #Asperger #ADD #Psych #Bipolar
16253011	patientanon	2012-09-05 08:33:01	@joegerstandt My resting pulse rate at the moment is 92bps. In order to check my heart I'd need an EKG! *grin*

16253011	patientanon	2012-09-04 02:57:19	I lost my mala (Buddhist rosary simply) Found after looking for several days! I think there's some kind of message for me regarding that.

16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:44:06	@missxsometimes you want we can take this offline and talk about it as a) it's personal and b) a lot of ground to cover! That is if you feel
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:43:03	@missxsometimes Oh, ok gotcha. Excellent place to start if you're not sure. Parental Units as resources! I didn't have luxury of that! If
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:14:22	@Zinsomniac I've missed that SO much since you've been gone. Also SPAZ O.o "whatever" of the day *laughing* OX (_)
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:12:42	@Zinsomniac SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:12:32	Ok. going to try and work now. Actually just saw people here for me so had to pop on. Take care everyone.
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:11:12	@Zinsomniac apps. won't even run on it! But thanks! I'll give it a try. Or just stop tweeting from my damn phone altogether! Battery killer!
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:09:45	@Zinsomniac Hi hon. Yeah, iPhones kind of turned out to be a bust, huh? No, cheapest phone I could find with oldest version of Android. Some
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:08:28	@missxsometimes That is to say, unless it has gone undetected/undiagnosed for me. But I covered it all up and didn't say anything for years.
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:07:36	@missxsometimes thought to be genetic but different from a Developmental Disorder. You don't just wake up and say, I have Asperger's or ADD!
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:06:29	@missxsometimes You may get away with it all your life and be Bipolar Free if no stimulus/stimuli triggers it! Bipolar/Scizophrenia strongly
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:05:04	@missxsometimes For example take Bipolar. You could have a "propensity" to have it but you basically need a stimlus to trigger the illness.
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:03:42	@missxsometimes Asperger's and any form of Autism is a Developmental Disorder means you are born with it. You don't aquire it later in life.
16253011	patientanon	2012-05-24 23:02:36	@missxsometimes Hi sorry for the late reply. I have had Asperger's since I was born. It's the same with everyone on the Autistic Spectrum.

16253011	patientanon	2012-04-03 09:46:29	PA is "a little" unhappy. Maybe that means she should turn the volume down "a little" with the Bauhaus. Double Dare is good to blast.

16253011	patientanon	2012-03-25 10:01:09	Although Mr. Skinhead guessed my age as 22. Holy shit! O_o I guess that's a bit of fun?
16253011	patientanon	2012-03-25 09:54:12	That would be the skin was here with his girlfriend. Also, poser but fun to mess with him anyway. PA bad? PA needs some fun.

16253011	patientanon	2012-03-23 04:42:45	I'm pretty sure that's against the rules with a passenger.
16253011	patientanon	2012-03-23 04:41:33	OMFG. Driver gave me his personal business card when we joked (I DID) about going to party at gay bars! O_o

16253011	patientanon	2012-03-09 13:12:44	Having a taste of being a bit better if it doesn't come back? I'll have to remove myself from the online world again. Damage Control. Okay?
16253011	patientanon	2012-03-09 12:29:08	Ok TASE crying over. I usually try to fight it but too tired. Best to let it out? Got ambushed by family stuff. Thought I was fine.

16253011	patientanon	2012-03-03 09:28:17	And also"Why am I here and the other one's not?" Twins bond faster than you think in utero. My twin. On my mind entire life #ptsd #losttwin
16253011	patientanon	2012-03-03 09:13:32	"I wonder why I'm still here and the other didn't stay?" I just learned I said this a lot when young. My twin died in utero. #ptsd #losttwin

16253011	patientanon	2012-03-01 13:04:17	@Canageek Yes, I don't think he will screw me like the last "friend" I met. Who was mental but in a bad way.
16253011	patientanon	2012-03-01 12:53:15	Made new geeky friend. And such a gentleman. Even did up my coat for me today in horrid weather. Has ADD but I think Aspie too? *love*

16253011	patientanon	2012-02-17 04:33:02	I just had a huge seizure in my Neuro's office waiting for my appt. Shaking so much the chair was banging against the wall. Seriously. O_o

16253011	patientanon	2012-02-09 10:47:52	Well enough of this suicide crap. No matter what's going on it's being dealt with. Post or not, whatever time length, all there is to it.
16253011	patientanon	2012-02-09 10:37:25	@HardAspie Absolutely! I can't handle that Aspies can't feel empathy bullshit! No way.
16253011	patientanon	2012-02-09 10:33:49	@Dannilion Yeah. But thanks hon.
16253011	patientanon	2012-02-09 10:31:52	@HardAspie Hey, we Aspies can just "know" at times right?

16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 11:57:28	I'm so fuckin stupid. Now that I've drugged myself up to think clearly it was a very bizarre seizure. My right parietal lobe got cranky?

16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 11:20:04	WTF! No.Joke. Should not have been so out of it and paralytic! Get up, grab cane just before I wipe out. TASE stuff gone for now. Tingling
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 10:31:02	Eyes blurring. Idk why. Stupid broken brain. But too much stress and sick must now make pseudo-heroin girl go bye.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 10:26:18	@mmmumma That will do it. Rest, chicken soup and stay warm *wraps blanket around you* big hugs
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 10:23:34	@SheikYurbouti Thanks. Not now considering I'm all heroin like but not knowing because I've never done it. Can't move myself so forget bed!
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 10:20:18	@moodmonster Awww. Thanks but what could I do? We met in hospital too hehe.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 10:18:01	@mmmumma No sickness allowed. I have enough for both of us and a lot more around here. In fact if I know you, no sick. Or all no sick.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 10:13:52	@SheikYurbouti ACK Indeed! If Bedridden was there she would have ran interference rolling around.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 10:11:16	@mmmumma I totally agree even though I have no idea what you wrote. Unless it was something else and I disagree.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 10:07:36	I don't know how to explain it as far as doing drugs. Maybe like heroin for some? Just sinking into abyss and don’t care as so tired.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 10:03:27	I'm so tired I feel like I could pass out without my sleep meds. These numb times are so rare. Nothing matters. Sweet relief.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 09:59:36	@mmmumma Hehe. Proof positive as I didn't even get this notification.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 09:57:13	@CorinaBecker Good
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 07:01:42	You know the more I've isolated myself I've isolated all of you. Not looking for attention just true. Repetitive writing as well. It's ok.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 06:20:35	Question of the Day: Am I more ridiculous in public or just when I'm at home?
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 06:16:33	@CorinaBecker If still bad after few days, off to doc.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 06:15:16	@CorinaBecker Warm water with a bit of salt. Gargle several times. Then again few hours or so later. Keep up with it until better.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 06:09:29	It's really snowing out. Hmmm. Never used a cane for a toboggan or sled before.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-21 06:05:15	I just winked at a guy using a Mac. But it was a Mac wink not a... #gblt

16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 06:30:13	Should've stopped ages ago but WTF Twitter! No email of weirdos plopped there, I think I'm following ppl I don't know. My REAL ppl there?
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 04:18:32	@buttonista *laughing* Maybe I should start watching it. Wonder if we get latter episodes or current ones.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 03:59:03	@buttonista We have BBC Canada. Unless it's not BBC and ITV what there. Jst laughed so hard. Oh, think I saw spot of Black Books hour l8tr!
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 03:56:24	@buttonista and I saw it flash by when on the menu looking for something to watch! Not on basic cable. So prob some UK version of BBC? We
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 03:54:37	@buttonista I thought so. We've had Corrie over here for decades! But they got everyone digital cable in the building (lots more channels)
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 03:42:02	@buttonista for the "or" there.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 03:40:46	@buttonista Oh was going to ask. Are you into Eastenders? or
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 03:29:14	@buttonista percolating in head about it. I have for a while. Several posts. I just suck too much to write 'em!
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 03:28:23	@buttonista Thanks lovey but now I'm going to have to search everyone out. I mean, I've lost some followers I know? Knew? Funny. I have post
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 03:26:04	I need a break but at least this is a repetitive task. I can hyperfocus (for how long?) and not have to think too much. Thinking=Bad. *nods*
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 03:23:08	Ok this should be fun. I know I've lost followers. Aspie Penguin still has them. They booted me because my blog sucks? I suck? They're gone?
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 01:12:23	I need "To Do Lists" for my "To Do Lists" for my "To Do Lists."
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 01:07:02	Ok it is becoming v. hard to type w/ baby MacBook because of battery connection. That plus ISP is killing me. Two tech things now. *scowls*
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 01:03:05	It's Gravol time! I've been trying to limit taking my Gravol and Valium while being sick but that hasn't been such a good idea at times.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 00:25:22	Ok I seriously have to stop pissing about. Seems to be some kind of window where I start to crash or idk. Thus MUST type up Neuro notes! Ugh

16253011	patientanon	2012-01-20 00:12:56	Friend R. back from London for Xmas. Brought me more Fortnum & Mason tea, Royal Blend of course *PA lifts pinky and takes cucumber sandwich*

16253011	patientanon	2012-01-19 23:48:35	and unfortunately some happy PTSD tossed into the mix now. Must increase meds and must "deal?" with PTSD. How are you luv?
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-19 23:46:47	@buttonista Ok I'm like where'd you go in scrollville. I'm tired. All saps my NRG these days but understandable. Back and forth epilepsy...
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-19 23:40:51	@mindofmedusa Ok, here we are and if I have any celeb questions, I'll come straight to you!
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-19 23:39:46	@mindofmedusa Twitter seems to be growing increasingly stupid. (G)uber. HA! Sorry. No, last night had to crawl out to ridiculous meeting.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-19 23:36:31	@mindofmedusa Always email server overload so too many? Or even the server thinks I'm whacked for what I want to say. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-19 23:28:39	@mindofmedusa This didn't get to you re: emailing The Gube and me being gay, wouldn't know a celeb if I tripped over one & non fan stuff...
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-19 23:24:04	@mindofmedusa Although I did once "see" Ralph Fiennes. He's really tall. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-19 23:19:55	Always email server overload so too many? Or even the server thinks I'm whacked for what I want to say. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-19 23:07:41	@mindofmedusa I'm already following you when I got your follow. How did that happen? Well, whatever. I have a total boy crush on The Gube.

16253011	patientanon	2012-01-11 03:36:20	I should probably rest now. Maybe careful bath. Idk. Can't think straight. This syndrome really screws up my head. #epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-11 03:32:57	As per my last post broken technology will have to wait for broken me. Too sick to go now. And for sure not safe alone.

16253011	patientanon	2012-01-07 01:03:25	@phoneutria_fera Oh dear. I'm rather a mess. Epilepsy business since start of June and now a lot of PTSD from holidaze and other stuff. You?

16253011	patientanon	2012-01-06 09:10:14	@seanuglyavenues LMAO! Yet something else I've never heard.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-06 09:07:37	Meds and crash out on bed countdown. A book too but may remain closed.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-06 09:05:22	@seanuglyavenues Much better! For I am silly too. *wee grin*
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-06 08:57:31	@seanuglyavenues Don’t say that! Well maybe if you walk with a limp or something. Old term though. Still who am I to tell you what to say!
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-06 08:29:20	@seanuglyavenues Further to that I have no clue how many people follow my blog with all the ways to do it. Ah, whatever.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-06 08:26:49	@seanuglyavenues WOW. I have never gotten a Tweet like this! *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-06 08:24:34	@maialideth I'm sorry about that sweetie. We can share each other's misery? *hugs*

16253011	patientanon	2012-01-05 05:50:52	That said, I may have to turn off baby MacBook and stop working. Ugh. Also take the Gravol that I can't remember if I took or not (oops!)
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-05 05:45:00	OH NO! Hoped I'd be ok? Now more nausea than before, dizzy, headache. Seeing some weird spots. Temps fell by 12-15 degrees! MIGRAINE!
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-05 05:07:39	Well if I still feel like I'm gonna heave in a bit, I'll know I didn't take the Gravol!
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-05 05:05:16	Did I even take the Gravol? I don't remember. Well, I didn't take the Valium! *gulp*
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-05 04:51:21	Christ. Haven't even gotten to blog comments and to think I have to read a bunch of legal jargon-y shit too? *head explodes*
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-05 04:47:30	YAY!!! Time for more Gravol!!! Should I hold off on the Valium? Let me take another break and see about that. #morefrustratedthanbefore
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-05 04:00:40	@kimmieCollas Indeed. I can't believe how long I've just been doing this. Then my blog. Oh, then some "real life" things? Still sick but...?

16253011	patientanon	2012-01-05 03:24:22	I need a break. I'm going blind. Now watch my ISP crash so I won't be able to do anything. Just when I've managed to get online to do stuff.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-05 00:01:48	@Splinteredones Sorry to hear you were sick. I hope a bit better? I'm also having probs w/ my ISP. Have to go to shop but if laundry so bad?
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-04 23:28:00	Going 2 try & touch blog/other stuff today. TRY. Poor woman waiting forever & I need 2 work. But panic attack re: laundry yest? OMG. #ptsd
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-03 00:56:07	@AspiePenguin Thanks little buddy. Said things more astute than me? I'm not me. Or wasn't last night. Another me? But I know how to find me.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-03 00:32:32	There's something wrong. The red pill or the blue pill? Unplug me. Now. I've been living in a dream world. And it's killing me.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 11:44:02	Funny the crap I write here or or my blog. Public Domain! Would anyone take my words? Total hack if so. Good luck beyond vanity publishing!
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 10:49:04	Idiot! That was basically a year ago. For anyone that knows I'm sorry if it upset you. I will take on all of your sadness. Please let me.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 10:34:39	Or I can tell you at least what it was like for me to be in a #coma
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 09:48:08	Question. I'm clueless about this WEGO health thing or whatever. Anyone know? Emailing me like crazy!
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 09:44:33	That last Tweet isn't meant to knock people with cerebral palsy. I just REALLY want a certain person to see it. They'll like it I think.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 09:39:54	Kept hearing all these bangs from unit above me when playing music but not cranked! Just found out she has CP and drops a lot of stuff.

16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 09:21:41	@Canageek Methinks it's the holidaze and Twitter can't hold up with traffic. Plus your connection. And thanks for the vote *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 09:16:59	@Canageek It's ok. Unsick PA would be better with?
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 09:15:16	Oh. I seem to still be here. How did the transport back from Saturn go so fast? Seizemic is slow so though so evening things out?
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 07:38:43	Ok dunno what to do. Music? Bye folks.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 07:36:07	@AspiePenguin You nailed it buddy. "Normally" today is "The End!" Hey maybe I'll wake up all happy and gay tomorrow. Wait. I'm already gay.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 07:18:29	@Canageek I was dead asleep at midnight New Year's Eve too. Sick PA needs sleeps but calls etc. for emergencies totally.
16253011	patientanon	2012-01-02 07:14:33	Happy New Year. There. I said it. #fuck2012

16253011	patientanon	2011-12-29 01:44:52	@garbosmc The biggest problem will be psychological. I'm not having issues at all physically. No cravings or anything.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-29 01:42:48	@garbosmc issues will be nil? I'm already so sick I wouldn't know the difference! Not funny but seriously. I'm not that bad off anyway.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-29 01:39:41	@garbosmc Good to hear you're not drinking so much. Yay you! I'm pondering my options: cold turkey or very reasonable taper. Any withdrawal
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 10:01:00	I think I replied to everyone. Hard a bit on my phone and don't get notifications. So nini. Gotta go. Be safe all.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 09:57:05	@KinkyPi *wee smile* I think the poor little guy may have lost his patience with me altogether by now! Let's hope not.

16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 09:50:52	@garbosmc I laugh so hard now because I'm on a large cocktail (haha) and still drink. I must have quite the strong liver!
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 09:48:33	@garbosmc is when it becomes a regular pattern. Even too regular! One doc I had wanted me to do a liver function test before meds!
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 09:46:01	@garbosmc That's heavy. I started with the Bipolar in my early 20s and ppl were shocked how a wee girl could hold her liquor. Biggest prob

16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 09:30:05	@MentallyGB Ok good sign? You're in my thoughts for the call. You can make it. You did this far right?
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 09:27:12	@garbosmc enough so we keep going or another is that we can end up going faster. Our brains go into overdrive. They say more! FASTER!
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 09:23:44	@garbosmc An interesting theory I read re: genetics. When we drink we lack an "off" switch that other ppl have. So we don't feel when is
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 09:20:02	@garbosmc Hi. My biggest problem is well, I'm an addict (speaking honestly) I have a long and intense drinking history and genetics.

16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 08:48:28	@youshouldsee Ugh. I'm ok with ppl I know in case of trouble but had neighbour do that recently. I gave her very polite shit.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 08:34:30	If you don't use #PAsucks you just might suck as much as she does! Or more. No fooling!
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 08:30:52	For anyone who might get upset about #PAsucks started some time ago. Join in on the fun. hashtag it everywhere!
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 08:26:55	Heh. My poor blog. All I could do was respond to one comment left a week ago! Twitter Follows I'm coming for you too! #PAsucks
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 08:21:15	@MentallyGB Well if it helps I think it's really good you're not in hospital. Sounds like progess to me. x
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 08:17:00	@MentallyGB Sorry hon. Forget me just being plain old epilepsy sick. Whatever. This time of year and I don’t always get along.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 08:08:08	@bipolarparent Thank you *hugs back*
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 08:05:10	@MentallyGB Uh yes. But for me it's not just been tonight!
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-28 08:01:09	Ok this self-medication shit's gonna stop. Seriously. As I sit reading with beer. But now cocaine is falling from the sky! No just snow.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 12:50:34	Ok now bye. Did eat. Pain. Phone off.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 12:47:19	Forget self-medication. My body weights a tonne. Typical Absence Status Epilepticus is non-convulsive. You can't see it. Mine=Bad.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 11:39:40	WHAM! Not to do with drinking folks. Typical Absence Status Epilepticus time! I have to move very heavy limbs to get up from bed. To start.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 09:40:47	Oh, well of course with all this pathetic drama, we need music! Bach Organ from Weimar Period? Okay.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 09:36:46	@youshouldsee You are so sweet. All is fine. Take great joy if you will regarding my issues typing on my phone. Kbcsabirgvj. Laugh at that.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 09:29:53	@Butterflywgs Thanks hon. I've just worked so hard with my drinking and we all know guilt there. Brief anaesthtic for hearts broken?
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 09:15:26	@youshouldsee Thank you. *tears up after fighting* Denial is hard but "Merry Denial Day!"
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 09:10:15	@youshouldsee Oh no honey. I have a sense of humour that is, well, rather "different". It's okay and thank you for my Tweets x
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 09:04:05	Christ. Are these like than my drive-bys or worse. Drunk with undetermined shots of maudlin.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 08:58:10	@buttonista Thank you and love to you. Good thought? Friend in London home now. Save my pennies and you want to lay eyes on me?
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 08:54:14	@youshouldsee Thanks for the fave, even if depressing? x
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 08:43:57	I never showed any signs of the self-medication so now you all know.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-27 08:40:26	I'm drinking myself through the holidays. I don't know what else to do. It hurts. I hope that at least one person won't think less of me.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-25 07:56:03	My connection is not working. The irony. Best to you all for your holidays and such. PA.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-25 07:52:06	It's going to rain on X-mass day here. Or so says the forecast. Excellent. I don't want to see the sun tomorrow.

16253011	patientanon	2011-12-23 12:14:57	That said, signing off. Not that my view/s say any of YOU are pathetic. Just something I thought of a bit ago re: Twitter. Nini.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-23 12:08:48	Countdown to shutdown but how pathetic to still hang on to a social app? #futureblogpost

16253011	patientanon	2011-12-09 11:08:37	Always be honest no matter the cost. It may hurt at first but the outcome will be bliss.

16253011	patientanon	2011-12-06 08:55:39	@HardAspie Thanks hon. Tomorrow will be exactly half a year (I did the math) I've been dealing with this Clobazam disaster. I'm tired.
16253011	patientanon	2011-12-06 08:45:44	Have been continually doping myself up since my eyes opened this morning. Time for more Gravol and Valium. Not one of my better days.

16253011	patientanon	2011-12-01 11:07:34	@HardAspie Indeed. The IOC should really get it together and add Wordplay as an Official Game. Duh.

16253011	patientanon	2011-12-01 10:29:50	@HardAspie You keep going but my path is no more difficult than others. Neurology? That is difficult but Dr. PA knows it fairly well. x

16253011	patientanon	2011-10-15 00:18:39	Ok. I've got a comment that seems to be pulling in too much activity for Akismet. There's only one new/recent so sorry, if you're real, bye!
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-15 00:14:32	@Splinteredones I hear ya. I'd never where mine! Screw that! Makes me a bad patient but my seizures were under control before this nightmare
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-15 00:10:42	@Splinteredones As awful as that sounds for being sick it's good. Sweat it all out when you sleep too.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-15 00:09:54	@Splinteredones Oh really? They've given you a helmet? That's heavy duty. With all my craziness I don't have one!
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-15 00:08:51	*deciding whether photophobia too bad for contacts and sunglasses again* Oh silly me! I forgot I can make my screens black in FF! Duh.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-15 00:01:55	Oh, and sorry about your poor wee bean. I know what it's like. *gently kisses bean*
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-15 00:01:12	@Splinteredones Any fever? Fevers are good. Means your body is trying to really kick any infections ass!
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-15 00:00:31	@Splinteredones shit. I've had enough head injuries for the rest of my life thank you very much!
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-15 00:00:03	@Splinteredones Ah, head injuries! So far I've had two concussions I know of (but prob more?) I can't remember. But with my seizures holy
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 23:58:40	@Splinteredones Oh, you're sick? I didn't know. I hope you feel better soon. *sends warm blankies and lots of chicken soup*
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 23:57:10	@Splinteredones However, my Dysgraphia isn't as bad so at least I can write numbers!
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 23:56:15	@Splinteredones Go you! A calculator can barely help with my obscene Dyscalculia. Seriously. My case of the Learning Disorder is THAT bad.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 23:52:28	@Canageek Thanks. If I can help, I'm not one to just sit by and watch people drown in whatever probs they have. That would me pretty shitty.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 23:26:16	Sound u don’t want 2 hear! Car accident outside right now! Think all are ok. Police tho. Did First Aid at crash. Luckily all ok then too.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 23:15:01	Haven't written a post since the 9th or something. Will do that off the top just to shake things up a bit in my thrilling life. *wry grin*
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 23:08:24	@buttonista xo
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 22:51:37	@Splinteredones Oh wait. They were thrown to you. Just woke up. Pitiful excuse for terminal stupidity but I'll use it.

16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 22:47:23	Slept forever but don't be jealous insomniacs. Epilepsy has its (high) price. Should be ok to book appt w/ Neuro Monday. #epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 22:35:25	@Splinteredones ditto
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 22:31:55	@Splinteredones *sitting on edge of seat*
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 22:28:02	@KathrynSMarks now i'm confused too. Gabapentin does what that i said?
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 22:24:29	@FroggyPrinceMom forgot the hugs.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 22:21:20	@FroggyPrinceMom Thanks and say hi to the Little Prince for me.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 00:49:52	Wait. Those legs. Probably because I'm seizing non-stop both with convulsions and without? Maybe? Or who knows...
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 00:44:23	Gravol (dimenhydrinate) makes you SO bloody dehydrated! *hobbles off for another litre of water*
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 00:38:03	MUST get all info for Neuro done ASAP. Another damn seizure yesterday. Legs heavy, stiff, sore all the time. Dunno why. #epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 00:33:54	@BobbiSheahan Thanks for the RT!
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-14 00:16:28	@BobbiSheahan I can't remember if I got back to you but you're welcome. @AspiePenguin says you are welcome too.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-13 22:39:28	@FroggyPrinceMom I mean, even looking at this screen is killing me and I just turned it on. Time for the old contact lenses and sunglasses!
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-13 22:38:51	@FroggyPrinceMom physically, psychologically and emotionally. So write up my notes for Neuro to hopefully understand and increase dose.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-13 22:37:19	@FroggyPrinceMom This all started in June. Some improvement back on my reg. dose but not enough. Still seizing w/ no control, still sick
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-13 22:36:21	@FroggyPrinceMom needed epilepsy med. Pharms couldn't get any from suppliers O.o Never heard such a thing! But other meds too not just mine.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-13 22:34:14	@FroggyPrinceMom Hey hon. Oh boy. I'm fizzin' all over but in the wrong way! Idk if you know the whole long tale but had to quit v.v.v. much
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-13 22:32:21	@KathrynSMarks that seem questionable or too weird not to be? For June and July tally is 21.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-13 22:31:40	@KathrynSMarks Thanks hon. Gotta finish the report for Neuro. Now at Aug. Sept. Oct. Then book appt. Interesting to count seizures or things
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-13 22:23:50	@_RobertJordan I totally agree.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-13 08:13:44	My best to everyone. Facing true disability in the face changes a lot of your thinking. Even though other thoughts still pop up. Be well. PA
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-13 08:04:07	Sry 4 not talkin & Twitter Follows. Seizing bt still here. Big banger Simple partial 2nite. Ended w/ rare Gelastic. Going 2 Neuro soon.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-11 03:18:26	May cause other weird strain as tiny diff in script? Eyes can adjust? Rest for a bit more. Go outside to see what THAT looks like!
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-11 03:15:28	Good decision PA. Put in those old contacts and some sunglasses. Totally turns down the photophobia volume but odd as things have diff tint.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-11 03:08:36	Ok old contacts and sunglasses. Haven't worn contacts in years! Might start again! Need a bit to adjust now. They wrap around your whole eye
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-11 02:57:34	Holy photophobia but MUST get this work done. Maybe should grab pair of old contacts and put on sunglasses. Hmmm...
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-11 02:55:52	@Aliquant Gotcha. I say #WorldMentalUnhealthDay Or maybe that stinks.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-11 02:53:03	Signed on to see email: "Hey Sweetie. Woke up this morning thinking about you." Oh really now. My wonderful cousin. I love him.
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-11 02:50:25	@Aliquant World Loony Day? Didn't know but wouldn't surprise me. Every day is World Loony Day for me. Apart from Loony Loony, how are you?
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-11 02:48:02	@FroggyPrinceMom PSA: PSA also stands for Prostate-specific Antigen. It is measured in tests for prostate cancer and other things. Dr. PA
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-11 02:23:42	@HardAspie clearly not with it as no need for that to be a DM! Thanks, and you too. x

16253011	patientanon	2011-10-10 08:26:06	I think I might be having actual Absence Seizures after all. Idk but too short to be Complex Partials and I am GONE. Then just "back."
16253011	patientanon	2011-10-10 08:19:52	@TriniGirlBlue indeed i think we'd have a lot of fun. better to be crazy with someone else than alone.

16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:43:36	@mmmumma *nods again* WP does make migration so easy but to take things back to another platform? I know you can somehow back up your WP
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:40:09	@mmmumma True enough. Although based upon my blog maybe I should take back what I said about being all about the content? *ponders*
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:39:14	@mmmumma Well, I knew I was all about the content going in before anyway. #tryingnottosoundobnoxious
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:38:13	@mmmumma Hehe. Well you're way beyond me! I took a Beginner's Web Design course and OMFG! Let's just say I'm all about the content, baby!
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:26:14	@mmmumma LOL
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:25:49	@mmmumma convert on a lot of themes. Also headers and other column widths and man!
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:25:24	@mmmumma It gets maddening! The biggest functional feature I have is MP3 of the Moment so I can't lose that. It's been a pain to try and
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:24:35	@mmmumma *nods again* Yes sometimes WP can get a little "excited" about new themes? I've only changed mine once but have played with others.
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:19:19	@mmmumma *nods* The translation widget/tool sounds great!
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:14:43	@mmmumma However one thing about WP and the .com version that ticks me off is we can't use java. *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:13:20	@mmmumma and am just now. Was in middle of post and finding/adding links and connection just hanging to my own blog.
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-05 00:12:34	@mmmumma NO! Don't go back to crappy blogger! Well you can if you want. I was just noticing problems right now. Haven't been online so much
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-04 23:58:21	Either WP or my blog is broken. Well I already know my blog is broken. In many ways. Reboot.
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-04 23:56:55	@mmmumma cool
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-04 23:55:22	@mmmumma You never do to me. Besides that was to someone else in a foreign tongue. I know you speakish moreish thanish england
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-04 23:53:18	@mmmumma That looks cool. None of my business what you said but nice.
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-04 22:18:38	Does anyone happen to have a spare diaper?
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-04 04:37:39	shit. because it's friday, doctors all gone. just contacted social worker to maybe find out if clobazam is available on inpatient basis.
16253011	patientanon	2011-06-04 04:10:06	Great. Now I'm I'll ticked off and irritable. If this turns into some Bipolar shit storm (which I didn't think it would!) fucking inpatient?

16253011	patientanon	2011-05-28 23:28:00	@TriniGirlBlue No. Will email you my address as Twitter is weird and I've lost DMs before and that.
16253011	patientanon	2011-05-28 23:27:06	@TriniGirlBlue you my address now.
16253011	patientanon	2011-05-28 23:25:46	@TriniGirlBlue Well you don't have to be peach! I can call you something else! That was just first thing that popped into my mind. Will DM

16253011	patientanon	2011-05-28 23:18:09	@TriniGirlBlue Cool. You're a peach. Or something else if you don't like that. I still have something I said I'd send to another blogger 6
16253011	patientanon	2011-05-28 23:11:39	@TriniGirlBlue I just open a jar of Pataks!
16253011	patientanon	2011-05-28 23:11:23	@TriniGirlBlue That would be good and anything else that would survive. Even though conceived in Pakistan can't make a decent curry at all!
16253011	patientanon	2011-05-28 23:07:07	@TriniGirlBlue You could mail me some good curry but prob wouldn't survive plane ride.
16253011	patientanon	2011-05-28 23:06:01	@TriniGirlBlue Haven't had much room for self what with moving. Then with the "list" that caused probs and whoa. Want my new address? Hehe

16253011	patientanon	2011-05-28 22:55:16	@TriniGirlBlue Oh and yeah, didn't expect any of the stuff to happen that did. That made me so messy and non-functional for online world.

16253011	patientanon	2011-05-28 22:53:04	@TriniGirlBlue that can maybe explain but have only made couple of posts and can't even reply/get to comments that makes me feel bad as I am
16253011	patientanon	2011-05-28 22:51:56	@TriniGirlBlue slowly trying to get back and try and engage with everyone. Even made a list to post to tell everyone why and what happened

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-20 01:39:51	May/should have answer about Co-op place by end of day? Now it's really time to throw up (apart from still being sick.)
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-19 21:23:20	I feel like I need to take a bath in hand sanitizer but that would a) be pretty icky and b) not be good via internal routes to one's body.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-19 21:18:58	After making it through last night, we now return you to the Regular Sick PA. CRASH! (again.)

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-19 03:54:57	Been offline all day dying to hear about my Co-op interview tonight. Was "told" should be no problems and I'm actually first in line! OMFG.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 22:37:53	@KeithsWife35 Thanks. I always feel bad and worry that I'll offend someone. That's why I wanted to explain my "rationale."

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 22:01:32	@KeithsWife35 By all means. Thank you. I am very flattered that you asked. I've got you Bookmarked for now. My blogroll needs a lot of help

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 21:57:56	I'm going to do everything "right" today *sits eating breakfast* Not that I think it will help. #notsuperstitious
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 21:48:42	Ok I literally just woke up. Haven't even gone to the bathroom or take my meds. Had to check email first I was THAT crazy. Today=Nervous Day
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 21:45:44	@KeithsWife35 Journalling is great for any kind of medical problem you have. Not just psych. Good for you and again glad you got relief!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 21:43:49	@Aliquant I just lost The Game!!!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 07:01:53	I have an "Achilles stomach." Well, no. I have an "Achilles brain," too.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 06:48:12	Gee PA a bit dehydrated? I just downed the entire bottle of water I use when I go cyling. I gotta KILL this virus. Within the next hour! LOL

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 06:41:17	Okay I have to get off this website ASAP! Their animated .gifs are killing me! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 06:38:56	@mmmumma More like my ADD Hyperfocus is battling with my ADD lack of concentration! I'm sick too. That's also a really big problem!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 06:35:14	Crap! I'm tired and can't concentrate so I'm not paying attention to what I'm reading. Wasting so much time! *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 06:05:51	@KeithsWife35 they have to go the hospital? Saddest thing to see them get treated as drug addicts! Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 06:05:10	@KeithsWife35 Whoa! That is brutal. I have heard similar things from others. Some of them have to get on opiates but in an emergency and
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 06:03:54	@KeithsWife35 Yes it is true that Anticonvulsants act as prophylactic meds for migraines. Great you got some relief!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 05:02:09	@buttonista It's okay. I don't have enough power to jinx the entire planet. Wait a sec...
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 05:00:32	@buttonista moon fell from the sky! Next we will no longer be rotating around the sun, all will be black and death imminent!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:59:46	@buttonista I was waiting for one of us to bring a wolf into it. You make me laugh. Had to find the moon. Oops. It finally happened. The

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:57:03	@buttonista Yes I saw you mooning over the moon. Being over the moon by seeing the moon! How lovely!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:56:16	@buttonista Thanks. I'll try to work with baby MacBook on its side somehow? x
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:55:44	@goingthroughell no response. Not getting the PWs is killing me.

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:48:24	Man I gotta try and get some work done. So far this day has been a total write off. *huge sigh*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:47:34	@goingthroughell Oh, thank you. I just had to check if I'd added you but nope. Will now. My blogroll needs a serious overhaul.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:45:25	@goingthroughell There. Comment just left on your blog. *grin*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:38:59	@goingthroughell Also apart from this blog crap sorry you feel lonely and that right now. Me too quite a bit. Yep. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:37:49	@goingthroughell you choose to do it, I can probably assist?
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:37:32	@goingthroughell and then you just bring yours over. Tweaking will be required but you can also set up test templates. If you need help if
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:36:25	@goingthroughell You should be okay if you want to migrate. Just set up an account (i.e. sign up for a blog) look at the pretty templates
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:34:43	@goingthroughell java running on your template *runs to check your blog*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:34:14	@goingthroughell Oh no worries hon. Also to migrate to WP is really easy. Just the click of a button. The only issue is if you have anything
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:21:04	@goingthroughell Oh, one more thing I wanted to add. I don't know of Blogger can do it but with WP you can back up your blog. Just in case.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:19:38	@SheikYurbouti My nutty brain just won't work that way. I have to be really wiped (sick or exhausted) and even then, very rare.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:17:10	@SheikYurbouti LOL you always make Bedridden laugh. Except she can't take naps.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:16:03	@goingthroughell That may help?
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:15:56	@goingthroughell me from the very beginning. So I'm not sure what else to say. Those are just some of my experiences. Maybe a wee break?
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:15:04	@goingthroughell but the blogging world is tres bizarro! I've picked up new readers and lost old ones so many times. Others have stuck with
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:14:16	@goingthroughell I feel like a total idiot. Like every (any?) readers I have will never come back to me again! O.o I know it's frustrating
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:13:22	@goingthroughell wanting to "disappear" REALLY dumb PA (like that was gonna work.) I'm blogging about the same damn thing every day now so
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:12:40	@goingthroughell can end up making the decision in the end. I've taken breaks (only to come back 24 hrs later-dumb PA) I've locked it down
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 04:11:53	@goingthroughell I know that feeling so well. Okay maybe not deleting it but I have had so many "blogging crises" over my years. Only you
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 01:22:40	If people could keep these pesky infections in petri dishes where they belong, I would be a MUCH happier PA!

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 01:05:51	Ugh. Nausea kickin' in and I have to go out! Not far but 10 ft. seems like climbing a mountain. #ilovevirii
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-18 01:00:09	@my13thsadday That almost looks like two weird eyes staring at you! O.o

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-17 03:41:35	Ah, to hell with it! I'm already dizzy enough and my tummy is crying for some Gravol! It just means I have to get out of bed to get it...

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-12 21:58:07	@FroggyPrinceMom I always tell the landlords because a) it will come out in the end on the application as in "proof of income" and b) it

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-12 21:52:53	@FroggyPrinceMom for hours and hours for days. Ironic when I'm not fit for work and I AM working bloody 8hr days under high stress! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-12 21:52:13	@FroggyPrinceMom Right now as I just started working I decided to relax and organize my Bookmarks! Well shit! I've been working at this
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-12 21:51:23	@FroggyPrinceMom I might have come up with something that just popped into my head now. Will contact SW. Might work but pretty dicey!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-12 21:50:30	@FroggyPrinceMom afford at the moment. So this is messy as probably the biggest DEADline of my life. To hell with writing!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-12 21:49:44	@FroggyPrinceMom Thanks hon. It's just really screwed up as I'm going on disability but in transition so I don't have as much as can really

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-12 06:36:30	@TheSpindleshay You see there's a problem w/ time. I need more than "a week" to know if I got this place. If I didn't or don't two weeks?
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-12 06:33:52	@TheSpindleshay Okay, okay. I don't have any of the others at my disposal right now anyway. *wry grin* xo

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-12 06:28:27	I saw my Social Worker. I think she is now starting to panic. Not good. I'm going to sign off now and crawl under something extremely heavy.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-12 02:33:52	A commenter (spammer?) said I had a gfeeegf interesting gfeeegf site! Okay.

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 06:25:48	@blissfulblues Thanks hon and ditto. Don't forget that! *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 06:25:00	@bipolar_foodie away. That makes it even more difficult--when you develop personal relationships and get to REALLY know the person
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 06:24:07	@bipolar_foodie Yes. Online is good for support but it's NOT enough, should not be used as support IRL yet too bad some of us weren't so far
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 06:10:53	@blissfulblues You see? There's a LOT of melty-downy stuff there that I've told you. Why I'm reverting and fighting back pretty hard.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 06:09:46	@blissfulblues Thanks again hon. Had some good stuff happen recently but today, just one of those days where I feel very lost and lonely too
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 06:07:00	@bipolar_foodie *nods again* You just want to help so much. Or at least I do.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 06:06:30	@bipolar_foodie *nods*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:52:26	@blissfulblues never, ever any "ends." *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:51:58	@blissfulblues It's okay doll. Everything will work out in the end. Sometimes it's the hardest getting to that "end." Even then, there are
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:48:03	@bipolar_foodie True enough. I've gotten upset reading other psych stuff on blogs via empathy/knowing the person etc...
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:46:07	@blissfulblues situation on top of that! Can't even believe time now. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:45:25	@blissfulblues Thanks hon. I've just been away from what I've needed to focus on for a bit so all of this is making one hell of difficult
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:42:05	@bipolar_foodie too. Oops. Reading other people's stuff can be not good at times.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:41:08	@bipolar_foodie Thanks hon. Place yest. perfect but saw he was showing it again today. Think I read/saw some other things I shouldn't have
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:39:26	@blissfulblues Wait online stuff may take longer. More to contribute to my meltdown. I may have no choice but to lose my stubborn streak LOL
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:36:21	@blissfulblues "think" about having my meltdown? *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:35:41	@blissfulblues longer. Then I will maybe sit for a bit and think about the sorting and where I can stash any of it? Or I'll maybe sit and
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:34:10	I know (as in you're not telling me anything I don't know or is stupid.) The online stuff now I am currently doing shouldn't take much
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:30:54	@bipolar_foodie that might make me sad in the sorting. Probably but idk.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:30:18	@bipolar_foodie Still flats as yest. was fab but no guarantee, more sorting of stuff here, maybe even some packing, going through some stuff
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:28:37	@blissfulblues But NOOOOOOOOOO I have to be a big, fat, stubborn arse. I'm reverting to old behaviour because I'm panicking.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:27:38	@blissfulblues I should just trigger myself to all hell, go nuts, freak out and start bawling all over and let the shit fly! Purge myself!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:26:26	@blissfulblues Can't really say abt triggers so idk why I'm just shutting down emotionally--which I KNOW IS STUPID!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:25:19	@blissfulblues I know. Better days ahead but contrast in 48hrs is upsetting me too! High then a sort of crash? Also potentially triggery idk
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:23:36	@blissfulblues Thanks *hugs* Idk. Send me some TNT, a blasting cap with short fuse wire? LOL Just you responding is good.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:18:13	@blissfulblues Had good day yest. maybe "too good" as today kinda messed up. Couldn't hang onto it forever, right
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:14:53	@blissfulblues I need order in my head right now and I can't get it! Distractions externally, internally, can't make things STFU!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:12:46	@blissfulblues Thanks hon. I shouldn't even be on here, my blog, fucking anywhere except the main stuff. Just about typed "pain stuff" LOL
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:10:56	@bipolar_foodie A few things. Things are all muddled & I can't think straight but have to focus! Can't get shit out of my head or something
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:04:07	@bipolar_foodie In other words I'm being more of a stubborn ass as I should just let things out. x
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:03:14	@bipolar_foodie Here you go: oooo Now don't take them all at once! Right now I'm being a stubborn ass. And upset but fighting to ignore it.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 05:01:12	@blissfulblues my emotions out when I should but choosing to fight the chaos like hell instead. Being idiotically stubborn. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-11 04:59:15	@blissfulblues It's just things are really confused in my head right now, too much swirling around and I need to get a grip. Refusing to let

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-10 07:17:06	I think I've found the right way to glove up with all these cuts (now that I've just logged on.) Now I think I have to log off. Must rest.

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-04 00:42:37	I somehow seem to have lost my land line. Or my dial tone. When ppl call me it goes directly to my VM. So that would my service is working
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-04 00:41:40	@buttonista will just have to call someone who buys antiques and it may sadly be like an "Antique Chop Shop." Sad 2 ruin such a lovely thing

16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 23:21:53	Definite tea break! *twittea*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 23:21:31	Okay, so far we've done "Camping" and "Sports." Now it is just "Furniture!" left! This is only craigs too! *faints*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 22:59:57	I have NO clue what my crap is worth in selling it online. Looking at similar but these other sellers could be totally in LA-LA-Land!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 21:49:54	@Sickchickie Thanks for the #FF
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 06:39:56	I need to sign off now. Just looking at my computer is making me want to heave. Correction: I want to heave anyway! Laters folks.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 06:35:08	I need some more water. Am currently living in The Desert of Discontent.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 06:33:00	Oh help me now. I think it's time to stop. Been going non-stop for I don't even know how many hours. #immovingtopluto
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 06:28:51	@bipolartude That's funny. Hmmm...visa, no way to pay for my meds and health care?
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 06:17:31	*PA wondering if she should stop working now*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 05:38:52	@bipolartude Absolutely. I had a place lined up but it appears they have screwed me over. So now I have to find something else by month end!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 05:22:48	@bipolartude Hey new avatar. Well the moving sitch is NOT good. I'm broke and can't afford where I live anymore.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 05:09:20	Maybe I should stop & take a rest but I'm afraid if I stop then I'll full stop and then get nothing else done for the rest of the day/night.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 05:03:42	Oh! UPS guy here. Well, not like THAT gave me energy. It was just a box sitting there waiting to be shipped! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 05:02:14	@bipolartude I just typed up my list of stuff to sell. Too dusted to put them online now. Maybe it's time to shift my online work to flats!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 04:59:56	@bipolartude LOL Thanks for the fave. Seriously though. I'm starting to fade. I have to keep going but... *hangs head*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 04:28:12	I don't know how much more I can take of this shit.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 03:38:22	@bipolartude Okay, I'll give you that. It has been a little while so changes could have happened.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 02:47:18	Now the joy of finding out how much an a 60 year old console stereo is worth that belonged to my grandparents. So much for family heirlooms!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 02:32:44	@peejrarr Well that's what prompted me to get the haircut in the first place. It had been months and was unbearable!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 02:31:48	@bipolartude LOL Just what I need. Evil beings tearing out of my body wanting to kill me. Pluto. Still a planet to me even they said no!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 01:45:37	Where's my pen? Who took my pen? Gimme it back.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 01:44:28	So much more damn work! Plus I still have to find a bloody flat in exactly one month! I want to move to another country! Or planet.
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-02 01:42:06	Whew! 2 viewings, still waiting on UPS guy for shipment. Have I measured and described (and not forgotten) everything I want to sell? *sigh*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-01 04:20:44	I'm just gonna pull my duvet over my bed/office/closet/pharmacy tomorrow! To hell with that!
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-01 04:19:30	*maniacally making illegible list of things to do*
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-01 04:18:49	Whoops! Just about fell over drinking my pint of tea. SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-01 03:00:14	Haven't even had second cup of tea yet! *runs to kitchen to get tea* This is gonna be one hell of a day and night! #ihaterenting #slumlord
16253011	patientanon	2011-04-01 02:56:22	Fucking landlord wants to do a showing of my shite flat tomorrow morning. NOWHERE near ready for that! #ihaterenting #slumlord
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 06:04:05	Ok going to flop somewhere and try to calorie bomb myself. Even if they're just tiny bombs? So not happy.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 06:02:31	Don't think these fucktards are even going 2 gimme the place stupid bastards. After I jumped through hoops for them. #ihaterenting #slumlord
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 06:00:25	Can't do this anymore. At point where I don't know if I'm 2 tired 2 start crying LOL. Maybe something. But still need to toss more trash.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 03:36:02	@Sickchickie I made a file for a file for apartments and now I can't remember why I flagged things or what I did at all! Why I did anything!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 03:33:32	@Sickchickie My head is getting all dizzy, eyes blurry. I'm stumbling all over. Maybe I should have something to eat. Huh.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 03:32:16	@Sickchickie Thanks for the RTs. Maybe I scared them when I said I was going to look for new places starting today! #ihaterenting #slumlord
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 03:20:52	I even thought it was somehow still the weekend today too. #eternallystuckinatimewarp
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 03:18:50	I think this is going to be one of those days/nights when I push myself too hard and then CRASH! LOL! Though don't know how funny that is.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 03:16:57	OMG. If you can believe it these fucking idiots STILL haven't called back and it's been over 24hrs! As @Sickchickie gave hashtag #slumlord
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 01:17:06	*studiously looking for other apartments while trying to remain calm* More tea? #scaredoutofmymind
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 01:15:24	@Hopefortrauma Oh you're welcome. Sometimes I don't always know what to say so I try my best. I'm glad what I said did help.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 00:34:16	But just how quickly can I do that?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-31 00:34:02	Just got call from guy from Job Disability Place to catch up. That was nice. He feels same way about these new(?) landlords. Get backup plan
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-30 23:36:18	Just got call from gov't guy to try and help me find new flat! So pissed off now don't even want to live there!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-30 22:46:25	Plus it really would have helped to have SW here this month. I'm flying fucking blind here (well, not completely) but more like co-pilot.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-30 22:44:38	Goddamn prospective(?) landlords didn't call AGAIN when they promised last night! Time to start looking for an alternative. I can't believe.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-30 22:35:26	@EnigmaAnonymous Hehe. Thanks hon. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-30 22:35:07	@peejrarr Really? PA and peejrarr are twins! Yay!

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 23:21:05	OMG! This flat business is just one huge clusterfuck! The guy called me back. Just like so many things in life it's all coming down to money
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 22:17:52	@Sickchickie They ARE screwing with me! I pretty much confirmed it! Bastards!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 21:31:19	@Sickchickie SERIOUSLY mean that I am NOT popular. However, I am SERIOUSLY not happy with this sitch.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 21:30:27	@Sickchickie Just going to toss it up on my blog too as easier and then because I'm so popular *HUGE eye roll* everyone can see. And I
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 21:29:32	@Sickchickie Hi hon. Thanks. Just had thought actually while finishing that post last night for new "Plan of ATTACK!" My turn to be sneaky!

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 05:43:53	@mentalspaghetti Hey sorry it took me a long time, like fucking days but yay I'm verbose as hell too?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 05:43:12	@buttonista get the flat after all! Get to race around for a new one as I've given notice for April 1st!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 05:42:40	@buttonista Thanks but time isn't on my side. Also waiting for new(?) landlord to call when he said he would earlier. LOL on me if I don't
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 05:34:51	Oh christ I feel like I'm gonna pass out and throw up.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 05:33:12	I should be doing shit. Fuck me. So far I've been doing laundry and did the dishes. Absolutely ridiculous. #PAsucks
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 05:01:03	@amandajustice Okay. Thanks for the recommendation.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 04:19:24	@amandajustice That sounds good to me!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 03:54:49	@amandajustice Oh, right! I knew the author sounded familiar. Never read any of his books but I've heard they're really good.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 03:51:37	@amandajustice it's very hard though. We have to learn hard lessons that we can't control things. Anything?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 03:50:52	@amandajustice happens but I'm working (we're all works in progress-blah) accepting whatever comes my way. No matter what it is. Sometimes
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 03:49:47	@amandajustice Thanks. I don't really buy into the omen thing. Just kind of a joke there. I really have no clue why just about everything
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 02:45:39	While just outside a crow flew by. Is that a bad omen?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 02:31:28	Also current landlord coming over in half hour. Place is a disaster, I'm in my pyjamas, mobile dead and need it. #lifeisnotfunrightnow
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-29 02:27:51	Ok. Called guy for new flat. Said will call me in "the evening." I may/may not know what this is about. But he said b4 will call on weekend.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-28 22:44:09	I'm suck a dork. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-28 22:43:57	I'm fucking freezing in my flat. Where's the goddamn heat! Okay, apparently this is my day to bitch about everything! #gofuckyourself
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-28 22:42:35	I feel like I'm hungover. And no, I wasn't drinking last night!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-28 22:41:05	Dude hasn't called about the flat yet. Watch me not get it for some dumb reason then have to go madly dashing around for something month end

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-20 23:39:08	@mmmumma I must have missed that Tweet somehow as I can't find it. Sorry about that!

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-20 23:15:36	@spectrumdweller Thanks for you wee poem or ode?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-20 23:15:12	@mmmumma I don't have Tokyo Underground. Are we still discussing good Anime & Manga or the little character/guy in Paranoia Agent? Or both?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-20 23:05:49	@MelissaLShell Thank you for the inclusion and mention.

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-20 11:59:28	I'm so tired that I'm actually grateful. Even if I'm depressed this degree of exhaustion annihilates everything.

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-20 11:46:40	I never said I'd "DIE" my hair (dye) but never say never. Maybe if we can pull off the decent Bishounen that I want I'll see.

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-11 04:55:57	@YogaChicky But yes. WAAAYYY out there. I was laughing when she took that brief pause about being in the bathroom and doing what?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-11 04:54:10	Okay decided. Not going to make the calls. What's another day going to make? Done enough already today. #fuckit
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-11 04:52:31	@YogaChicky No no! It's okay. No trigger. Been dealing with mom's holistic heal all crap for years!

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-11 00:21:43	@bippidee86 ones, have email addresses mandatory and such but I don't like that. I feel it kind of scares people away, new readers, lurkers
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-11 00:20:49	@bippidee86 addresses via your own when you receive a comment. In fact there is a setting where you can make commenters have to be previous
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-11 00:19:55	@bippidee86 It won't do that due to privacy since your blog (or any) is totally public on the Internet. So you only get IP addresses email
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-11 00:17:22	@ihuckabee Thanks for the Follow. Had to laugh about publishing your work on Twitter. I know there's Twitlonger but besides that? Take care.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-11 00:14:36	@bippidee86 as I got to play around with their widgets and make my blog look all stupid and stuff LOL
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-11 00:14:05	@bippidee86 think it took me a bit too. Also I had a different template than I do now. It was fun though too after I had the bare bones done
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-11 00:13:12	@bippidee86 That's good. I can barely remember when I did mine as the last post telling me to move their butts over to WP was in 1997? But I

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-10 23:33:46	Okay finding some places where I might be able to reside but they could be scary. I still like Kooky Guy! I'm totally going for him!

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-10 03:15:38	@YogaChicky Yes, if only me. But so many of my actions have done things, not even my SA? One person gone perhaps already.

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 06:36:01	@YogaChicky I am The Queen of Guilt. Didn't you know that already?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 06:33:17	@TriniGirlBlue LOL Sure, a CT and errands? Riiiiggghhhtttt.....
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 06:32:41	@YogaChicky That's how I feel. Guilty too. Took them out for lunch today despite much protest.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 06:30:09	@YogaChicky Well she has/had been forever. Maybe she sees me as her little baby again? Or trying to make amends? Either way?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 06:27:02	@TriniGirlBlue On blog now.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 06:26:50	@TriniGirlBlue Not any yet today as it's been REALLY hectic w/ the CT and shit. But maybe later? Soon? I'm not sure.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 06:26:06	@YogaChicky Oh yes. She and her husband drove me to hospital today. She is still being really good-just overwhelming. *sigh*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 06:20:01	@YogaChicky Oh, well thank you.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 06:17:30	@YogaChicky Hi sweetie back. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 06:17:18	@readheadgirl Thanks hon! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 06:12:38	Hello. I'm now in out and in my wifi land. Hope you didn't miss me. Doubt it though.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 05:46:48	Or more outside than a wee bit already today. If I do and make it to my wifi land perhaps back later. Have fun.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 05:45:07	Okay, Day is correct. Time is right. I think we're good to go. Let's see. Might be time to try and get outside.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 05:24:10	Really stimmy O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 00:44:03	@TriniGirlBlue I hear you.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 00:13:18	@TriniGirlBlue Thanks hon. As for organization skills and giving you pointers? Don't hold your breath. Sorry to disappoint you there.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 00:04:30	@TriniGirlBlue though and that's really good. I've been trying to get back into the swing of things there.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-09 00:03:51	@TriniGirlBlue Not bad I guess. Trying to keep up with so much going on! I'm totally disorganized as usual. Have been doing some writing
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 23:55:31	@TriniGirlBlue W00t! *pounce snugglehugs back* How are you? Anymore good fishing?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 23:53:02	Boy I'm having issues with Twitter today! Sending myself messages not replying to people. If I get a DM I'll self-DM. I know it. O.o

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 23:47:36	@peejrarr I agree. We have a cartoon channel over here and I did stumble across something I really liked. It's a Canadian one called...
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 23:31:03	@mentalspaghetti it and you have a button so you can get them to haul you out for any reason even if it's just to scratch your nose!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 23:30:11	@mentalspaghetti They give you earplugs but they don't help. Also you have to stay completely still! But they talk 2 you all the way through

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:53:27	RT @patientanon : @patientanon Hey PA I definitely think you need some tea! / Just because Tweets to yourself make you feel less lonely
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:52:38	@patientanon Hey PA I definitely think you need some tea!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:51:12	I can't believe I just sent a Tweet to myself O.o Better get that tea going.

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:49:38	@mentalspaghetti Oui oui, mon cherie.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:48:29	@mentalspaghetti I suspect I'll only have an idea of a problem if they call for a Radiologist to take a look. Then if they take me to a
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:47:34	@mentalspaghetti Oh haven't gone yet. Still morning here. It's around lunch time. I hope they'll have work blankets! I'll be bloody freezing
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:46:22	@mentalspaghetti If people don't want my help or suggestions so be it.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:45:51	@mentalspaghetti Maybe but I still kept trying and modifying the comment as I knew it was long then realized I interpreted it wrong. 4get it
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:44:17	@mentalspaghetti Oh no, it's alright. I don't mind answering questions. If it was something really private I would just say so.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:43:39	@mentalspaghetti solve a big problem for that part of the blogosphere (med.) I even emailed the guy in case it was a tech prob. Never e back
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:42:29	@mentalspaghetti Ah that was a comment I left on someone else's blog. I couldn't believe it as it was so benign and I thought a good idea to
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:40:20	@mentalspaghetti Who did I upset with a comment? OMG. Who only knows? I could probably upset ANYONE with a comment! A particular post?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:36:40	@mentalspaghetti Hi. Thank you so much for subscribing to my blog. You're pretty brave and/or crazy for doing it! Be forewarned now!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:35:02	...where is that little one who deserves my thanks!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:34:39	@Splinteredones Well I'm glad it did resonate. I'm always flattered w/RTs though. Just when ppl compliment my blog etc. which reminds me...
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:33:04	have I been blocked or "rejected" with a comment before. It wasn't spam or threatening. Just a suggestion.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:31:28	Further I knew this blogger and we had a history in the blogging arena although not that close, arena itself. Problem solving issue. Never
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:30:05	Very disappointed other day when I made (I felt) valid comment on a blog & either blocked or error (Blogger) Sent e. to blogger nothing back
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:19:56	@peejrarr Tom & Jerry! Classic! They don't make them like the good old ones anymore, yeah?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:18:39	@Splinteredones Thanks for the RT on that one. After I wrote it and was still laying on my bed recovering I thought RT. Rest and Therapy!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 22:13:30	I just looked it my watch and it was an hour earlier than I thought. Damn! Could have maybe *tried* to get more sleep?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-08 07:34:20	Insight is exhausting. It's like your body is running a marathon to keep up with a firefly. #ptsd #dissociation #awesome

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 22:18:04	Tea time. I need to contemplate how I would like my day to be, as opposed to how it might actually be.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 22:16:13	@bark140 TY for the #FF too.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 22:15:07	I definitely should write today. Perfect day for it. All rainy and gloomy. I can sit here either brooding or in a meditative state?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 22:13:32	I sure wrote something last night. Holy Fucking Mother of God! Well, try to balance fear with fair, love with lesson, honour with honesty?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 22:08:18	Just barely out of bed now. Dunno if I can even write. Need to? *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 07:11:53	@peejrarr Yeah.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:52:05	@bippidee86 need to work out kinks with the WP blog. If not, okay but you do have to go through you settings on the Dashboard.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:50:44	the Blogger one and said I'd migrated to WP etc. http://bit.ly/hr9SyY I can let you how to keep things shut down temporarily if you still
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:48:45	@bippidee86 and same with the Blogger one. I had problems with people commenting on both and it was totally crazy. I shut down commenting on
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:47:57	@bippidee86 Another thing that you might (should?) do until your WP blog is up and running is make the WP one private in certain ways etc.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:33:59	@bippidee86 Okay when I just did it and went back to the home page it did it automagically. So is it asking you?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:31:28	@bippidee86 hierarchy. It may be the only way. Just don't nuke your Blogger blog...yet? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:30:32	@bippidee86 Okay looking at it from one of my test blogs. I'm re-importing mine just to see what it does but OPML is basically like a
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:23:46	@bippidee86 Is your blogroll showing up at all or is it asking you to choose the option?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:14:12	The Second Time in My Life? http://wp.me/p3M8c-1kE
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:11:13	@bippidee86 Knew it had something to do with programming language so let me have a peek
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:10:10	@bippidee86 Okay, well again they change things all the time. Let me Google
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:07:38	@bippidee86 Shit. Can't remember if it took all of mine but let me check my Blogger PA (yes still there) and try another import.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:01:43	@Aliquant are on the Spectrum so I always wrote it off to that. Still reading about the move so I hope you get everything in order soon! x
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 02:01:06	@Aliquant Ah. No! I totally get it! I used to get in so much trouble for talking like that too! No need to blush hon! It can happen when you
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:48:35	@Aliquant We're? Are you sharing accommodation? I agree. Moving is a HUGE pain in the arse. I'm working on me crazy ol' life. *nods*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:33:39	@Aliquant Hey we haven't talked in a long time. Saw you moved. How is the new place and how are things?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:29:12	Ugh. I'm going to have the call the pharmacy to deliver my scripts. I could only make it to the front of the house to check the mail.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:17:05	@bippidee86 Hangover Day and only one tea so far.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:16:43	@bippidee86 you want for your blog. Don't worry about any others for now. Just choose one you like. Or I guess you did? Sorry. Migraine
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:15:47	@bippidee86 Yes it completely is. But BETTER!!! Muah-ha-ha-ha-ha! So, once imported, stroll through all the pretty templates and choose one
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:05:14	OMG. I'm talking a lot. I need more tea LOL
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:04:57	@bippidee86 You just have to rename it. Like I have a few called PAtesting with a diff. template etc.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:04:17	@bippidee86 all together. I don't know if you need that much help though? But to start, I would pick a template. It can be changed later
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:03:22	@bippidee86 and I got sick and I flaked and I sucked. I had her set me up as an Administrator on the blog and then we could go through it
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:02:35	@bippidee86 Okay, I just took a look at your Blogger blog. Should be totally easy for lots of templates. I offered to do this for someone
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:01:50	@Narkyness MP3 of the Moment? GAH
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 01:01:38	@Narkyness With two sidebars I've tried to work with different templates and even my current layout overall and disaster! Also widgets like
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:59:15	@Narkyness Ah, thanks! You 'da best! I don't keep up with all of WP's stupid changes and that makes me look stupid but it's just a blog! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:58:18	@bippidee86 column styles to suit.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:57:58	@bippidee86 piss about but if you didn't have a lot of widgets and stuff maybe not so bad. Also with your layout of Blogger they had diff
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:57:06	@bippidee86 Oh another thing. Templates and current migration/layout from Blogger can be arsey! They may not fit well and then you have to
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:55:51	@bippidee86 to set up a damn blog first! Give me a bit and I'll poke around okay?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:55:16	@bippidee86 Okay, well been a long time and I know there have been changes. I tried to look at templates a long time ago and I think I had
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:54:32	@Splinteredones mean we're not feeling anything. It's just SO typical of the disorder.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:53:46	@Splinteredones Aspie Face (as I call it others too?) is where we (and others on the Spectrum) show no sign of emotion basically. It doesn't
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:49:47	@bippidee86 about? Have you chosen a template yet?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:49:30	@bippidee86 for the free .com and not the hosted .org Or you can pay to fiddle with the CSS but I know crap about that. What are u confused
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:48:07	@bippidee86 Okay. Yes the migration is excellent as it imports everything and you only lose anything that has javascript. That is if you go
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:37:53	@bippidee86 Yes I did it. Had old Blogger blog and still up! You have questions about migrating?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:36:49	@Splinteredones student talking to her professor LOL
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:36:31	@Splinteredones Okay good. I just like to be thorough being my med-geeky self. Even the last thing I wrote to you sounded like an eager
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:35:22	@buttonista was completely off limits because she's so mental.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:34:54	@buttonista to explain as you don't know relationship but she shuts her yap and I can now say whatever I want when before a lot of my stuff
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:34:06	@buttonista that. I was like holy shit mom! Normally she'd be out of tune with it and just ignore! Now I'm gettin' whatever I want Difficult
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:32:44	@buttonista something yesterday and I retorted quite sharp and terse and made a physical *shudder* mom told him to stop saying stuff like
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:31:33	@buttonista Absolutely. And I CAN'T STAND her husband! Creepy and pervy but I think mom's clued in and talks him down about it now. He said
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:30:18	@Splinteredones Oh that's fine. I just wanted to make sure everything I wrote was satisfactory and the information I gave was suitable.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:23:24	@buttonista didn't appreciate it but it's overwhelming on that fact alone & my mother is stuck in hypomanic land & has been for yrs now xo
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:22:04	@buttonista Thanks hon. If you caught it that was all the Aspie Social. Out for lunch for 3hrs with my mom and her husband. Not that I
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:20:47	@Splinteredones Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:17:44	@Splinteredones I'm going to DM you or email you or something. Maybe e. if that's okay? Also did you get the Geodon one? Was it enough info?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:13:36	@Splinteredones Or who I am? Who is that? It's really vague though. But the feeling is still there.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:12:52	@Splinteredones feel like I don't even recognize myself. Or...it's hard to say. Words...it's like, that person doesn't even look like me?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:11:55	@Splinteredones rather presumptuous! You may not want to talk about it at all! I've had moments though when I've looked in the mirror and I
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:11:18	@Splinteredones I see. I'm curious about that but you needn't talk about it here if you don't want to. You can email me. Or well, I'm being
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:05:26	@Splinteredones used to look all smiley and that and I can still smile if maybe in the mood but if not I can have total Aspie Face.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:04:40	@Splinteredones now. I think it's the Asperger's that I learned to hide so well over the years that I don't care about letting out now. I
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:03:45	@Splinteredones Yes I know others feel the same. I never used to mind photos and I'm still okay I guess but they turn out a lot differently
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-05 00:00:21	@soulflsepulcher Thanks.

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-04 22:44:50	Wonder if I can handle tea? I woke up and took a Gravol around 6:30 or 7:00am? I think?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-04 22:42:43	@mentalspaghetti Flattery will get you everywhere *winks* Just kidding. Blushing like a fool now! I opened the ruddy door though!

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-04 22:26:52	@mentalspaghetti Well you know Gevalt right? That's almost like a "step above" Vey. "Got in himmel" you don't find much in a translatable
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-04 22:25:27	@mentalspaghetti Got in himmel! And no I'm not Jewish. LOL

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-04 22:19:14	For the second time in my life my birthday present is a bloody migraine. Just one more reason why I can't stand 'em.

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:30:21	@soulflsepulcher yeah she's really good. i know what to say to "promote" myself for that type of community. just takes time.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:28:54	@blissfulblues Oh, just got up and poured the water at least. Now all I have to do is get up again to drink it!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:28:19	@blissfulblues Yes or remote controls.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:25:37	@soulflsepulcher yes and i've never been in this place in my life! so i need a lot of help! do have social worker at least.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:24:51	@mentalspaghetti @blissfulblues Okay don't overdo it! x
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:24:32	@soulflsepulcher member for their community and that. So have to think a bit. Also a waiting list for sure but maybe luck out? And $ but idk
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:23:37	@soulflsepulcher brief ones. It's for a Co-op (I think a nice one?) so I have to say a bunch of stuff about myself as to why I'd be a good
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:22:55	@soulflsepulcher I can never sleep during the day so no naps possible. I only made some notes about the housing form last night. Just some
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:22:11	Okay I have @mentalspaghetti 's what is your's @blissfulblues I can't find it.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:20:13	@blissfulblues comes out. 'Geez, I better check if I have your's and @mentalspaghetti 's blogs!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:19:32	@blissfulblues Oh, thank you. And don't say that about your blog! We all have something valid and important to say! Doesn't matter how it
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:18:48	@blissfulblues I just walked down the street to put on the kettle. Now I'm back on computer so I have to go back down the street to make it.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:17:52	@mentalspaghetti head hang too but I'll get on. I have to. Can't stay stuck in the mire forever. It won't do me any favours, right?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:17:05	@mentalspaghetti hair is still dark and with a few wisps of gray but I'll never dye it again. Salt and Pepper is nice. And thanks for my
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:16:01	@mentalspaghetti that will convince me? As far as cartoons I act like one so may as well *look* like one? When I was younger goth black! My
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:15:00	@mentalspaghetti We'll see how the hair goes but being anonymous I don't have any "full" face pics on my blog. Maybe if it's really wicked
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:11:23	@soulflsepulcher Oh yeah. That's early. Granted uber-insomnia for me these days w/ my fucking head! I woke up at 3am and thought that was it
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:10:18	@blissfulblues Yes, I should go to the kettle. God it's only in the kitchen! Not like down the street or anything! *head desk* No, head ow.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:09:36	@blissfulblues too. I always say oh, bother to everyone. Don't worry, you're not missing anything! But some people tend to like it?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:08:58	@blissfulblues I know. I'm responding to several Tweets and I'm not quite sure what I'm saying to everyone LOL Thanks for reading my blog
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:07:41	@mentalspaghetti You're sorry. Not as sorry as I am!!! *hangs head*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:07:15	@mentalspaghetti is/are NOT cartoons!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:07:01	@mentalspaghetti my Mac to give Hair Guru an idea? He'll probably laugh about me wanting to look like a "cartoon" character. Anime/Manga
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:06:08	@mentalspaghetti May not need to do much of that. It's everywhere! Thanks about the haircut news too. I have about five pics to bring in on
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:05:19	@mentalspaghetti head as I am having another CT next week. So I will probably put up the results for that? And scrounging for my mentalness?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 23:03:50	@mentalspaghetti Oh, then it has been a while. My suicide attempt. I started to blog about it then I stopped. I may write further about my
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:58:30	@mentalspaghetti You can scrounge around for that and whatever else you want though. x
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:58:06	@mentalspaghetti I've pretty much stopped blogging about it all as I felt it of no purpose and even completely irresponsible and dangerous!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:57:21	@mentalspaghetti Awww thanks sweetie. I'm fighting tooth and nail to be emotionally on the mend! Now just my head injury that won't let up!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:56:17	@soulflsepulcher Here's to caffeine! I'm a tea drinker but whatever! Cheers! Semi-early here. Although maybe depends upon your definition?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:55:19	@blissfulblues Twitter (obviously?) and sending some emails. Nothing to crazy but still knocking my brain around LOL *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:54:36	@blissfulblues I need the caffeine to be in any way productive. I did get some work done last night so have to finish that. Now just on blog
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:50:49	@soulflsepulcher Not fully awake yet but it's my own stupid fault. Hyperfocussing on computer and no tea yet! Better make it! And you?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:49:35	@blissfulblues Glued to my computer doing things and haven't made my tea yet! I think I have to go out today too and don't want to! You?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:42:19	@soulflsepulcher True. I know that so many doctors cannot stand dealing with drug reps!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:40:54	@pianomaths Maybe it makes you subconsciously think you're talking about either yours or someone else's shirt or jacket collar? *ducks*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:30:36	listening to "Blondie - "Shayla"" ♫ http://blip.fm/~12e5mf
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:25:20	The reason I wonder about it is I have heard it so many times from artists. Many times it doesn't "work." Eventually I feel it's overdone.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:22:34	I often I wonder if something is done so "often" artistically is it really so "effective?" Wouldn't its novelty or originality wear off?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:16:38	@pianomaths Yes, very cool.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:16:09	listening to "David Sylvian - Silver Moon" ♫ http://blip.fm/~12e57c
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:14:55	@pianomaths embarrassment but still loved the word! That would be wordsmithy me! Glad to make you laugh though. I aim to please.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:14:03	@pianomaths Well we dorks travel in packs and dorkiness rocks so both rock! Was told I was "Adorkable" by @Canageek and wanted to die of
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 22:07:19	@pianomaths Maybe your computer thinks you're the cutest! I know. REALLY dorky today I am. Hi too btw. Long time no talk?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 21:56:11	@buttonista I know you're on your phone but speaking of love, see my last blog post? x
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 21:51:21	@buttonista Quite as you can see by my last response! xo
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 21:51:01	@mentalspaghetti Hi. How are you?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 21:50:47	*smothers @buttonista with love* @YogaChicky @catatonickid @TriniGirlBlue I know. I can only take my dorkiness so far. Then it's loserdom.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 21:48:07	@buttonista And I "win" the reply! She loves me...she loves me...she loves...kidding. I'm a dork. @YogaChicky @catatonickid @TriniGirlBlue
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 21:40:49	@TriniGirlBlue @YogaChicky @catatonickid @buttonista No apologies ever necessary here. No such things as tardy hello msgs or tardy hugs.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 08:30:38	Bishonen Hair! And More? http://wp.me/p3M8c-1ks
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 07:38:53	Pooped. Bye.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 07:37:20	Okay, I think that's enough work for today. Need to wait to hear from references anyway so time to chuck it?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 07:12:27	I'm going to be up ALL night because on THIS houseing form I have to say LOTS of WONDERFUL things about myself to live there!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 07:09:54	Oh! I get it! *ponders ever using MS Word before*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 07:06:12	I don't even think the last thing I wrote made any sense. Oh, well. La, la, la, la, la.... *head starts spinning*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 07:05:00	I'm so stupid! I'm making notes and I'm saying that it only applies to one person when there are others on the form but there's only me.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 06:55:50	@YogaChicky @catatonickid @TriniGirlBlue @buttonista Aloha! Konichiwa!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 06:50:21	@catatonickid @YogaChicky @TriniGirlBlue @buttonista Yellow! I mean Y'allo! Or Hello! Yeah, that one.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 06:49:23	@tuuli1 Thanks for the RT I think I need to go grab my wallet before I continue. Second Question: First Name.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 06:46:21	Okay. First Question: Last Name. OMG! I knew this was going to be hell to fill out!!!

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 06:18:34	*stares at big long housing form* Okay, I am NOW turning of the news. Our city and province is beyond ridiculous.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 04:47:28	My head hurts now. Lots. Better start filling out that housing form. And start building my cardboard condo for my alley of choice? Heh.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 04:41:51	I haven't turned off the news yet and it will have to go all the way to the provincial level??? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 04:35:36	The news is now being turned OFF! *winces*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 04:22:47	Fuck that shit! I'm freaking out! #ihatepolitics
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 04:21:29	Oh man. I can't WAIT for the fallout for this and the "formal statement" tomorrow! I bet some advocacy group is probably freaking. Let's see
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 04:18:19	Now they're actually BREATHING the words of privatization of affordable housing? OFFS. That just cannot even happen! ARGH!!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 04:14:20	Perfect timing! When I'm working with orgs for affordable housing breaking news of loads of cash they "lost" and ppl may be asked to "leave"
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 03:17:58	Okay @AspiePenguin Thanks *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 03:14:53	Okay @AspiePenguin Also do you know if Spock is around?
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 03:08:52	Hey @AspiePenguin Dude, can you help me out here? I think I lost the form I need to try and fill out. Stupid damn long thing!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 01:36:36	Okay some laundry. Some dishes. Very good PA. Now a rather lengthy affordable housing application? That may have to wait. Nice place though.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 00:58:29	@mmmumma But it's also stupid because I can't concentrate. Harrumph.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 00:57:37	@mmmumma Last night I read about 1/4 of my new 800 page Graphic Novel!!! Insane!!!

16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 00:54:58	@mmmumma Typical Absence Status Epilepticus? I can't tell as my head's all kooky still. I've only had one day where I woke up feeling like
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 00:54:04	@mmmumma I'm REALLY tired today but have just started tea. Woke up REALLY nauseous but just finishing period so any lingering probs with the
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 00:40:09	Crap! Got so much work to do. *gets on knees and prays to Earl Grey* #twittea
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-03 00:30:40	Gravol! The Breakfast of Champions! Oh, my.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-02 23:35:25	I've been too stringent with following my Followers. *running through list*
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-02 23:31:52	@mmmumma So how you anyway. That is if you've forgiven me for being a RT brat, there.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-02 23:24:55	RT @mmmumma : @patientanon you can always be a stalker! Works for the #stalkers :D / The woman can give me hell at anytime for that RT.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-02 23:24:02	RT @mmmumma : @patientanon you can always be a stalker! Works for the #stalkers :D / Beware this woman! She's a stalker! KIDDING!!!
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-02 23:16:08	Maybe I'll just follow anyone and everyone who comes to me on Twitter. I don't really like that idea though.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-02 23:14:56	Twitter Follows hurting head. Who are you? What do you write about? Huh? Maybe lay down soon even though I just got up. Almost forgot meds.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-02 22:57:12	Funny but I think I know what kind of day it will be if I wake up in a certain way with the head injury. Today=sick. Yesterday=okay.
16253011	patientanon	2011-03-02 22:46:56	I wuv my cuzin. He make me waf and waf so hard. He wants me move to wiv wif him and stuff but he far away. I sad now.

16253011	patientanon	2011-02-26 01:53:00	Ah I'll keep the Medic-Alert Bracelet. Now I just have to put it on! Has anyone seen those clasps?! Have to use my left hand too! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-26 01:49:59	Too funny on hold w/ Medic-Alert and song playing is "Dust in the wind...all we are is dust in the wind..."
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-26 01:24:50	New Med-Alert Bracelet arrived but they fucked up. Both size and card. *sighs*

16253011	patientanon	2011-02-18 00:26:33	@buttonista symptomatic of something then? I mean not to scare you or anything.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-18 00:26:10	@buttonista I could be wrong as I only know so much about you but things they might find are lesions and tumors? You might be more
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-18 00:24:17	@buttonista you have any probs like that?
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-18 00:23:59	@buttonista Huh? Sorry but MRIs are done to look for structural or physiological abnormalities re: head probs like trauma epilepsy etc. Do

16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 09:41:39	Yes. uber-SPAZ stop now. Immediately. Laters.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 09:40:08	Okay, maybe uber-SPAZ O.o should resty. Apart from the Nigerian Apartment Scams that was contact from a "real" person? *twitch twitch*
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 09:37:04	Whoa. Just sent "interesting" or "original" email response back to someone about "living arrangements." SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 08:18:13	@PocketPennies Yeah? Well I hope it can get sorted one way or another so you feel better hon.

16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 06:59:21	@VandWsMommy but let's all try and have people heal. No more upset over it all.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 06:58:36	@VandWsMommy Even if I do sometimes use my own blog as a sort of therapeutic ranting space enough. But try and find a balance. Let's talk
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 06:57:18	@VandWsMommy heal and deal. I don't say that lightly as in "just deal with it." No. But there is no point in going on and on. Even for me.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 06:55:40	@VandWsMommy Hey there. Well there is value in discussion of it I think. Definitely on a general level. But at this juncture? People need to
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 06:07:02	No More Writing About My Suicide Attempt http://wp.me/p3M8c-1jp
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 05:39:30	@maialideth Yeah.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 05:21:56	@maialideth Well maybe when you feel more comfortable about it? I don't know. Maybe you'll get to a point and it will just happen? *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 04:37:50	@aspietech @maialideth There's more 2 my story than just bullying. When I was a v. little kid I felt empathy for strangers that was visceral
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 04:34:47	@maialideth @aspietech Well that's totally understandable and like I said you got through it right?
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 03:54:32	@OneWriter Thanks. I'm doing a pretty good job of slapping myself!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 03:41:06	@aspietech @mmmumma @maialideth I suppose different for all. That doesn't surprise me! Dumb thing to say but everything's different for all?
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 03:37:32	@OneWriter Okay. And I just got your follow on Twitter. Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 03:12:21	@OneWriter forever had a problem there and always feel so guilty but at least trying is good? And you're welcome.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 03:10:57	@OneWriter the boo boo's are done, even if they're pretty bad we can hope to try and learn from them. I am trying to do that now! I've
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 03:09:12	@OneWriter Well I know when we do make mistakes based upon how we already feel we do feel like hypocrites. I do! But I guess afterward when
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 03:06:36	@OneWriter It's ok. We're all human and we make mistakes. I believe in forgiveness for that and all things can be worked out. You know that.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 03:04:42	@OneWriter And you know what? I think it also means a lot that you said you were sorry to me here on Twitter where it's public. Thank you.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 02:59:16	@OneWriter Oh dear. Thank you for apologizing but you know my philosophy. I never turn people away no matter what. So sure we can be friends
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 02:34:45	@maialideth That could be and fear is so powerful. If you felt like it maybe you could just take it slowly.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 02:34:10	@OneWriter Oh not awake yet. Hope things are going well with your gal in the UK!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 02:33:46	@OneWriter Aww... thanks. You're sweet. x
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 02:33:20	@PocketPennies *nods* My sleep schedule has changed so much over the years it's positively nuts. Now I can't sleep at all w/o mega meds.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 02:22:56	@mmmumma @maialideth Yes smiling is good and laughter is even better. Laughter is SOOOO healthy!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 02:21:59	@maialideth but you will come out of it and back to breathing, calming down. You won't sink into some kind of abyss. You won't drown love.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 02:21:07	@maialideth release. I've learned that when you bottle things up it's just worse. Sure it may be scary. The thought of relinquishing control
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 02:19:50	@maialideth Oh, you will. It's just a release to the situation. You let things out through the tears and eventually calm down through that
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:52:57	@EnigmaAnonymous You're welcome. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:52:44	@maialideth long time to start crying again after stopping from all the bullying but now I just let them flow when I have to. x
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:51:36	@maialideth I would say don't hold back the tears hon. It's good for you emotionally and scientifically good for the body too. It took me a
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:25:46	@EnigmaAnonymous Is it your birthday today? If so, happy birthday. *toots party horn*
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:25:24	Okay. I just woke up a while ago from a VERY bad night of sleep. I'm making typos all over. Time for tea! #twittea
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:24:22	@maialideth True enough. I don't start falling apart or anything but I can get choked up as well and maybe a few tears may fall.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:23:35	you're off in you're thinking. Just my opinion though.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:23:20	@PocketPennies stable I can do 8hrs but when life is screwy? Insomnia, who knows how many hours, may get the 8 by sleeping is so idk if
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:22:22	@PocketPennies I don't buy that. I think it varies by individual, not to mention with us, our heads, meds. I know at least for me, when I'm
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:21:23	@PocketPennies Oh I'm sorry. I don't know if your body "shouldn't" need more. They always say that for adults we "should" get by on 7-8 but
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:20:02	@maialideth Don't know if it's my current emotional state or I don't try to suppress my tears anymore. I'm crying everywhere now! Who cares!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:17:23	@OneWriter Glad to hear that things are going so well for you. I was so happy when you were leaving and ending up where you are now.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:15:22	@maialideth I can explain the difference between the two. One is the first I know nothing about and other i… (cont) http://deck.ly/~g2EBI
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:13:16	@maialideth Oh yeah. Mary and Max even made me cry at points, too! Hey, wee PA can get emotional watching films.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:12:30	@maialideth Yep! The person/people who sent it to me as a pressie were so thoughtful to buy it for me. Perfect!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:11:40	@Dannilion Ugh. Codeine destroys my tummy. So much that I'm having it put on my Medic-Alert Bracelet along with allergy to Sulfa!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:09:44	@PocketPennies Maybe you needed the extra sleep and your body overruled. Is the stuff worth doing still going to be around later?
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:06:51	Just to pick up my follower/bot for the fora, great movie called Mary and Max .One character is an Aspie so you might want to check it out.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 01:03:23	@ThisIsMadHatter Super. If you feel like afterward, let me know what you think. Now you've got me itchin' to watch it today!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 00:55:44	@ThisIsMadHatter OH! Mary and Max is amazing! At least I think so! I got it as a Christmas pressie and just love it!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 00:54:41	I am going to work on things today. Despite the scary. I have to try and push aside the emotional scary and focus on the practical scary.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-13 00:38:45	Had two dreams last night with recurring theme and one with a recurring player. Hmmm...
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-12 05:00:55	okay today has been rather intense. think it's time to resty now. laters.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-12 04:31:59	Right! My Retail Therapy! http://wp.me/p3M8c-1iU
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-12 02:17:05	@readheadgirl Thanks for the #FF
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-12 01:43:34	WTF? Therapy place won't take me for reasons on referral from GP. Idk what she wrote. O.o Guess must be an ass place? All my doctors shite?
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 23:39:44	I don't want to work but my SW is coming and she just calls and says she'll be here in a half hour or something. Most annoying.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 23:33:25	Shit. I better start double-laptopping to try and do some work. I need more tea though. I can't really see yet.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 23:32:14	@maialideth *fantasizes of moving to Denmark to make fresh start*
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 23:20:45	@maialideth sure how I'd do now. Maybe slowly but they say the best way really is immersion.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 23:20:15	@maialideth survivie. I used to be very good with languages. Well only French really as I studied it in school. Being in Canada and all. Not
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 23:19:19	@maialideth Interesting. Amazing how some countries can differ so much. There are some where a person who only speaks English would never
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 23:05:41	@maialideth Cool. If I could work fine and would definitely love to go back to school. Again provided the English only thing is okay!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:40:32	@maialideth Oh we were also talking jobs. Could I get a job there only speaking English?
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:39:45	both of you @mmmumma It's just me doing it all. But if there's someone on the other end much easier!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:38:58	@maialideth still take you up on your offer. Even if it's still rather serious and frightening too. Oh and I mean serious and frightening to
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:37:58	@maialideth This is true but @mmmumma are DM'ing about ways to get me over to her. In a rather serious and frightening way! However, I'll
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:29:43	@maialideth people nearly dying and didn't know if they could do it again with me. I wanted to "die" all over again. That "killed" me.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:28:42	@maialideth True. That is one point of it. Although I did speak to someone that it was a Trigger for them going through so many others and
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:27:43	@Splinteredones A VERY small flat. Also me being mental, sometimes feeling sick and more comfortable. Plus, we can both work off our Macs.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:16:11	@maialideth things and then do it. Therefore (and for other reasons people) I feel horrid. Haven't even told my sister yet. Too scared!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:15:15	@maialideth Thanks hon. I put people and through hell and I feel awful about that. I know how bad it is to send those dumb "see you later"
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:11:59	Just got up a half hour ago. Ugh. TEA! STAT! Social worker coming to see me in bed today too @Splinteredones
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:09:17	Send me a DM if you want. If it's personal and/or I won't forget/lose it/ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:08:36	@Splinteredones That's a good sign as I have some "thoughts" about it right off the hop (and have for a while.) What other meds are you on?
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:07:24	@maialideth off for 12 years but I attempted suicide just a week and a bit or so. I've been blogging about it on my blog. *hangs head*
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-11 22:06:34	@maialideth boy. I keep getting surprised by who knows and who doesn't know. I'm so ashamed as I never thought I would again as I fought it

16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 23:22:14	@fragmentz YW. Oh, it was something! Which will all be publicly displayed on my blog. I actually started writing the first post in hospital.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 23:20:40	@berrioed I relly do now. Thought I could handle things better but obviously not?
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 10:21:39	@Splinteredones Thanks. Rest and find a place to live!!!!!!!!! *curls up in a ball and would cry if had energy*
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 10:20:39	@berrioed know that I need so much more help with what I need to do. I can't do it alone. Even if it's just talking to someone. I'm lost.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 10:19:36	@berrioed I'm not so bad there (other than what the concussive stuff might make me blurt out? maybe?) Psych? A Total Fucking Wreck. I now
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 10:18:23	@berrioed Not exactly what you would call stable? Idk. Need cane for MTBI (and it's repercussions) sorry couldn't resist pun. Emotionally?
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 10:09:18	@berrioed Hi. Yes. I'm back from a rather awful adventure.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 10:08:38	@blissfulblues Thanks hon. Me too. Can't do anything 4 concussions but just rest. If things carry on I'll tell Neuro but still usually wait.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:58:54	My nutty mommy was really good though. Brought me stim toys.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:56:36	@YogaChicky @catatonickid @shiv379 Yes, I will try. Should probably try for myself. However, hard to not do things when you... *hangs head*
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:54:02	@shiv379 Thanks. I do wonder abt that as I'm just this virtual entity 2 people. OK! Well, probably not the best time to go down THIS road!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:51:18	@blissfulblues I can't even sleep well as just touching my fucking head hurts! Big Fat Seizure (not that I remember!) Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:50:17	@blissfulblues I've got a killer concussion where the symptoms refuse to go away (can affect mood) let's not just forget what I did. Mood?
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:49:34	@blissfulblues I'm feeling really sick and really shitty but thank you so much as well. I'm not so stable physically or even mentally or idk
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:48:20	@shiv379 Thanks. I'm alive. I could have been dead. We'll see what's next. x
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:46:52	@YogaChicky Yeah, things are still pretty ugly.

16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:45:48	@catatonickid Public apology time now, love. I'll just leave it at that. xo
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:44:34	@catatonickid *giggles* "...now damn well wake up!" Had you been there I can envision you throttling my limp body to regain consciousness!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:42:40	@catatonickid LOL! Embarrassed by all of this indeed but it really is special. I don't think we ponder the opposite. No talk of me missing.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:41:07	I can't fit everyone's name in there but as for the word in the ICU? When @catatonickid said "unresponsive?" Excellent choice.
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:33:04	@catatonickid @unitybelle @sylv666 @Splinteredones @morevoices @blissfulblues @shiv379 @buttonista / Yes, I finally woke up in the ICU!

16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:26:19	@unitybelle @catatonickid Awwwww...I didn't think you looked forward to my Tweets? I generally look backward and sometimes delete!
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:25:08	@catatonickid reckoned correctly. I was discharged from hospital the day after she said. Smart little girly! *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2011-02-02 09:24:14	@YogaChicky Yep. I'm still on the planet. Don't know if that translates to okay...? But sure. Call. We'll just try and work something out?

16253011	patientanon	2011-01-12 04:16:47	Okay signing off to start Stage One of Official Freaking!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-12 04:14:53	Freaking about seeing prospective new flat. Have lots of time before I have to see it so more time to freak out about it. YAY!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 11:00:41	Oh my goodness. WP is showing subscriptions a bit differently now. I have more! Thank you silly people if you're one of them! Yikes!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 10:51:55	@bipolar_foodie And sleep for you too! I can actually "feel" my insomnia starting and I haven't even taken my meds yet. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 10:50:39	@bipolar_foodie Hi yes back online to check email and again do I need to re-follow or WTF w/ twhirl? I'm on baby Acer now. twhirl PC app.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 10:48:44	@blissfulblues Thank you again. Just online again to check email and see WTF with twhirl. Not all followers/no follows. Huh?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:50:29	Okay folks feelin' tired. Signing off.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:47:14	@bipolar_foodie Thanks, I can't believe I even wrote all of that on Twitter! OMG!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:37:07	@bipolar_foodie there is nothing I can do. Just see. Where the future will go.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:36:13	@bipolar_foodie right now. I have no control over all of these things. Many things. I cry. Things get bad at night and I cry a lot. But
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:35:00	@bipolar_foodie Nicer pfft. You're nice. Yes slowly improving? Insomnia still bad too. I'm feeling sad about some things but it is life
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:28:50	@bipolar_foodie Scratch that. I tell MYSELF to go away. I just don't listen to myself.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:28:14	@bipolar_foodie I don't even tell people to go away!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:27:26	@blissfulblues Thanks again *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:27:09	@bipolar_foodie Still loads of water. FLUSH! Tummy sore, not hungry but trying. Bit better? Kind of hard to tell w/ all the chaos of the day
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:23:44	@bipolar_foodie Nah, I wouldn't do that either. I don't tell people to do that. I'd speak up in a kinder manner? Yes?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:22:23	@blissfulblues Thanks again but it's not bravery at all! It's absolute desperation! I'm in a really bad sitch. Most people don't know. No.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:20:36	@bipolar_foodie No no. It's okay. I'd probably just say the same thing as I said before.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:19:36	@bipolar_foodie Oh ok. I don't take all swearing as derogatory. No. Funny still how words can resonate differently at times.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:17:32	@blissfulblues applied for a job today? Idk. Weird test thing. Also health stuff still worrisome. But have to do it. Can't just ignore it.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:16:11	@blissfulblues it anyway but it's my first steps so overwhelming. Plus two things in one day. Going to look at flat tomorrow and sort of
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:15:20	@blissfulblues Thanks. Well ball's already been set in motion! Just scary life stuff but need to do it. Idk if anything's going to come of
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:12:37	@bipolar_foodie Well idk if I will. Maybe. I tend 2 associate that term with being really mean. So I don't consider myself that way I guess
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:07:49	@blissfulblues How about you?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:06:16	@blissfulblues Pretty stressed but trying to hang on. Today was really quite something though! Tomorrow will be even more stressy! Eep!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:04:34	@blissfulblues Very cool bot. That's a good one.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 08:03:10	@bipolar_foodie Well I don't think I'm a bee-atch but others may feel differently? I will not argue that I am a bozo however. Forsooth.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 07:54:13	@buttonista Ok ni ni x
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 07:53:53	@buttonista Ah! I'm awful. Kill every living thing I touch! Or should I say plant? May kill a lot of other living things too. Like people.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 07:50:05	@buttonista HA. Trim off my limbs. They're becoming more and more useless every day! Actually, always liked Bonsai.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 07:47:33	@buttonista Or probably kick the hedge. Unless I found a cute hedgehog!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 07:46:51	@buttonista TY. Right now I suck so many bags of rocks I can't even find the damn hedge to climb up it. Even if I'd just stand & stare at it
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 07:40:54	@buttonista Heh. I know. I LUST my bed. I'm on the hedge about murdering myself right now. That would mean I'm "technically" not suicidal?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 07:38:15	@buttonista You could always murder your bed.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 07:37:36	@buttonista @YogaChicky Ah, come on! How could I not! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 07:04:25	@bipolar_foodie Yes that would definitely not be fair! I am not mean. So I will keep talking like a bozo. Just for you! *silly grin*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:53:42	SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:48:11	@bipolar_foodie I've also come up with a new name: Devilkene.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:47:35	@bipolar_foodie Well today has been kind of shocking? Still chugging back oceans of water to try and clear it. Maybe working a bit better?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:45:57	*pops Valium and will now STFU*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:42:38	@bipolar_foodie Maybe I should STFU.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:41:51	@bipolar_foodie Maybe it's a nightmare! Maybe I'll slip on the ice tomorrow and get a TBI! Maybe I should buy a lottery ticket!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:40:47	@bipolar_foodie Maybe I need the Valium. Idk if I can even afford the flat! If I'll get a job! If the flat's too small! Maybe this is good?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:38:26	@bipolar_foodie I took a Gravol earlier as I REALLY felt nauseous after that. I still haven't taken a Valium.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:37:01	@bipolar_foodie uh, I think I sort of applied for a job or something. And I don't even know if I'm okay to work. So, a little panicky?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:35:57	@bipolar_foodie Oh. I'm Kind of in another land. I'm going to see a wee flat tomorrow but haven't been able to leave my own for weeks and
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:34:51	@bipolar_foodie of that shit should have happened. It's like hang on a minute! Slow down! Who turned on the ignition of the steamroller! Me?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:33:21	@bipolar_foodie Yeah I sure hope so. You've been through enough and all today? That really was over the top. Not joking! I don't think all
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:24:11	Oh I didn't okay now.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:08:34	@bipolar_foodie things. I kinda lost any sort of decent communication skills a while ago. But I am thinking of you.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 06:07:25	@bipolar_foodie Uh. Wow. Just read your post. That's a lot. Like more than. Sorry. About it all and me not really saying more and better
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 05:41:24	Do showers wash of panic? I could try. Or just sit here. Not really moving. *twitch twitch*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 04:12:48	I still don't have much of an appetite but it looks like it's time to eat some Humble Pie! Ah, it's good for soul, in'it?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 03:53:00	Ok. WAY too much going on right now. WAY. *head explodes*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:33:41	More nauseous than before! *stares at Gravol* *stares at Valium sitting beside it*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:31:27	OMG! Prospective job email "thing!" Can't even leave the house I'm still so sick! I'm just so sick period! Better do it though? *trembling*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:28:30	@Splinteredones Of course dearie!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:19:47	@Splinteredones Don't worry. I speak in confusing ways. A lot.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:19:31	@Splinteredones my blog history etc. w/ Spidey. So wanted to say thank you because I was on my personal email acct. and checked Twitter!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:18:44	@Splinteredones The follow on Twitter. Since we're now talking more I "guessed?" But made joke as in Spidey Sense. Kind of a "thing" re:
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:13:25	@Splinteredones Thanks for the follow. On personal acct. right now but my Spidey Sense figured. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:11:59	@Splinteredones No doubt.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:09:03	@Splinteredones Yes. My last blog post was about going through hell to learn some assertiveness but at times I feel it was what? One-timer?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:07:03	Although just emailed someone about a loft/studio to rent. Always wanted one but watch it be a shoebox! At least I'm trying to do the scary.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:02:52	I need more tea. Trying to write an email to someone and it's taking me hours! Granted the "Devilkene" is still making me stoopid & in pain.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:01:11	@Splinteredones own feelings...yet?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 02:00:57	@Splinteredones Interesting. That angle makes sense. I can see that too. I guess I'm just not at the point of "allowing" myself to have my
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 01:48:47	@Splinteredones always beat myself up so damn much but why don't we BOTH say we're entitled to our feelings today. What do you think?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 01:48:08	@Splinteredones vanish and disappear completely. My, my! Aren't we just the cheerleaders and banner brigade of Twitter today! Ah, well. I
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 01:46:53	@Splinteredones I know. I'm so feeling you right now. I hate it. I feel like this lost useless purposeless not-even-entity who just wants to
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 01:14:19	RACIST ADVERTISING!!! Or am I overreacting? Korean tenant only at landlord's request? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 00:59:28	They also did a ^^ which is supposed to mean blissful or something? Now these folks are funny but lordy! WTF about the **
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 00:57:52	Is this supposed to be two kisses as an emoticon: ** I don't use them. If so why the fuck would anybody want to be kissing this on my list?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 00:47:10	Okay, one step forward by scaredy-cat PA (just opening an damn email!) one step forward to who knows where?!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 00:41:01	I want to quit smoking but people keep saying now is not the time with so much going on! Still I can be a stubborn little girlie! *ponders*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 00:38:06	@Splinteredones Actually, I was just thinking of buggering off here myself!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 00:36:57	@Splinteredones Oh you're welcome. I just saw that you're not feeling so well today and I'm sorry. But really I understand on both accounts!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 00:20:19	@Splinteredones I completely understand. Oops. Looks like I just negated everything. Unless neither one of cares what the other says?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 00:15:50	@TheSpindleshay Thank you.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 00:14:42	@TheSpindleshay Try and "unstupidify" myself? That sure won't be easy! I should probably go convene with Spock now.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 00:13:57	@TheSpindleshay Well, I won't argue that you're already sort of here but dangnabit! If I'm not so stupid I've got a lot of ARGH! Work to do?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-11 00:09:05	You really are terminally stupid @patientanon aren't you? Why yes @patientanon I think I am. Unfortunately.

16253011	patientanon	2011-01-10 23:49:47	Forget it. Reminds me my final year high school English teacher & how he "encouraged" me to learn. I don't "learn" by swallowing my own crap
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-10 23:43:58	Is actually expressing yourself some kind of betrayal? What do you guys think?

16253011	patientanon	2011-01-10 23:37:02	@shiv379 @YogaChicky Well any tea I can tolerate? I seem to be able to now. And simple foods? But yes, tea is fine now.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-10 23:35:59	@PocketPennies @shiv379 @YogaChicky Ah, another tea lover! Oh... @alphabetania where are you? There are more of out here of course! #twittea

16253011	patientanon	2011-01-10 03:34:17	@spectrumdweller Yeah, I like the second. And exposed brick is kind of mandatory for me (well a true wish for wherever I'd like to live.)
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-10 03:28:26	@spectrumdweller Thanks about the art prose in last post.

16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 06:24:47	@zinfrared Yes you love your 'za. I'm trying broth and crackers atm. Trying.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 06:24:10	@bipolar_foodie Yeah. Bastard.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 06:17:27	"I Love Pain!" Everybody say it with me now! Come on y'all! "I Looooove Pain!" Yeah, I knew you could do it! Everybody raise your hands!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 05:40:09	@bipolar_foodie a lot of people off. So if we want to talk meds and heads, do it elsewhere.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 05:39:35	@bipolar_foodie more. Also the conversation can be taken off Twitter because I hate 140 chars. and long assed convos between people can piss
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 05:38:27	@bipolar_foodie Page and I'm kinda thinkin' WTF with the meds and huh. And your moods changing so much and so fast. But let me read a bit
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 05:37:26	@bipolar_foodie Okay. Yes I forgot I bought some Arrowroot's and they can be good for uncooperative tummies. I was just reading your About
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 05:31:04	@bipolar_foodie Huh. How did you find me again? Through my blog or through Twitter?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 05:19:39	@bipolar_foodie a few walls myself. I'm sure I have a few small fractures that have never healed in my hand!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 05:18:51	@bipolar_foodie Okay Crazy Sam. PA try and be good. *passes you some Arrowroot Cookies she forgot she bought* Not to mention I've twatted a
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 05:07:40	@bipolar_foodie And have you read so much of my whingy, rambly whiny drivel. I think I've pondered taking my blog down four times now?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 05:06:14	@bipolar_foodie And you're not a dick. My turn to calm you down.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 05:03:45	@bipolar_foodie With my redonculous gastro crap I can't count how many times I've been on the BRAT diet! I have consumme too. Works for BRAT
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 05:02:40	@bipolar_foodie I'm just reading up on you now on your blog. I know nothing about you so I must learn! I was thinking of maybe some crackers
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 04:55:51	@bipolar_foodie Sorry you're still feeling all fucked up too still. What a fix we're both in these days, eh?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 04:54:01	@bipolar_foodie May go back to laying down? Food would probably be good idea but I can't handle it. Shower nice too but too sick there too.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 04:52:26	@bipolar_foodie Just online now and got your comment. Responded but as you probably know I do to everyone. Had to go lay down as sick!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-08 00:40:46	OMG. Why should I be surprised dropping the "Fucking Depakene" wouldn't make me sick as hell. Was working on another post but dying now! Bye
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 23:35:44	@bipolar_foodie ok no problem.

16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 10:09:46	If there was ever a time to TRY and do this the right way, I can't think of a better one than now.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 10:06:04	Oh I know exactly what I need. To not fall into that trap again and not let my head get the better of me. This time it's going to work.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 10:00:32	Not happiness. No. Ephemeral and hard to sustain? Which is not inherently bad. But I need something different now. Right now.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 09:41:33	I just changed my Twitter Profile. Because, well...I'm not happy. And I can't change much right now. So there you go. I could change that.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 09:07:28	@bipolar_foodie Fuck you mood swings! Fuck you Depakene! nini x
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 09:06:16	@bipolar_foodie Hehe. Yes. And would NEVER pull any of that crazy weirdness GAH! intentionally! Even in minute forms! AHHHHH!!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 09:03:57	@bipolar_foodie need reminders that this type of thing isn't really my fault as well. Thanks again and go to bed if you need to x
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 09:03:05	@bipolar_foodie Thanks hun. I am the Queen of Guilt though! That's even on my blog. I can also give myself the boots like no other. I also
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 08:58:08	@bipolar_foodie when it does go. I'll see how I'm feeling tomorrow? I just can't believe it. I'm shocked and ugh. Even all day today...BAD.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 08:53:46	@bipolar_foodie when it will all disappear. Probably not too long I guess. Let's hope? And let's also hope no more havoc and destruction
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 08:52:16	@bipolar_foodie it's such a complicated drug, my other ACs, my already screwy metabolism that could have played a role? So I have no clue
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 08:51:11	@bipolar_foodie I know I'm steady state now after two weeks but I'm too damn upset to even bother looking up clearance and what not. Plus
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 08:49:49	@bipolar_foodie Thanks I appreciate the "Non-Asshole PA" part. I'm just so upset by all the havoc and damage it's caused. Not just to me?

16253011	patientanon	2011-01-07 03:11:27	Goodbye Depakene: http://wp.me/p3M8c-1gR
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-06 23:08:06	Anyway never mind. I'm gonna say something wrong again.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-06 23:06:46	It's gotten so bad it's fucking up everything. *crying* People won't talk to me. I'm too "crazy." I hurt people. Upset them.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-06 23:03:32	I have called Neuro. I have explained things to his receptionist a bit. The gravity of it all. I should get a call. Must get off this drug.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-06 04:08:03	The Worst? Who Cares? Did She?: http://wp.me/p3M8c-1gM
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 22:27:15	@spectrumdweller Thanks. Glad you found that entertaining. I had to find humour in it all somewhere, somehow!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 08:59:28	Oh, Dear x2: http://wp.me/p3M8c-1gH
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 07:12:25	@bipolar_foodie LOL Ah you crack me up!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 06:45:42	@bipolar_foodie trials with it vs. placebo where we can mess around with our "volunteers." muahahahahaha
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 06:44:50	@bipolar_foodie Ah yes. And hopefully if I can get any part of my brain back I'll be getting on my end of the bargain. I look forward to our
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 06:43:30	@bipolar_foodie That's awesome too. Yes I have relationships like that w/ all of my docs. They also don't care if I swear during appts. too
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 06:28:58	@bipolar_foodie for my epilepsy & Bipolar. It's just this new issue. Keep trying? Christ, I'll have a hysterectomy if that's what it takes?!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 06:26:56	@bipolar_foodie We collaborate on everything as he knows that I'm Dr. PA! I can speak to him on medical levels. ACs are good as they work
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 06:10:55	@bipolar_foodie line and if you cross it, not good. Weigh the pros and cons and so far all I'm seeing are cons.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 06:09:42	@bipolar_foodie And I think the definite worst is now the seizure onset. It does crazy stuff with my Lamictal but still. Sometimes there's a
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 06:07:44	@bipolar_foodie I mean if there was some improvement in anything, some ray of sunshine then okay but so far nothing has improved. Just worse
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 06:05:13	@bipolar_foodie entire list I don't think they'll all go away if we do drop the dose down.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 06:04:10	@bipolar_foodie taking it for a serious problem already. So it's like THAT didn't work! Unless he suggests some tinkering but with this
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 06:02:39	@bipolar_foodie Thanks. I just wrote up all my notes (so far.) I'll adjust them if anything else happens. This really sucks too because I'm
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 05:41:42	@bipolar_foodie Thanks for subscribing. Don't say I didn't warn you!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 05:30:26	@bipolar_foodie Thanks. I'll change the bookmark then. Yes, WP is much better.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 04:51:44	@bipolar_foodie Yep. My old Neuro gave me that for nausea w/ my migraines and didn't do squat.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 04:31:28	@bipolar_foodie OTC anti-nauseant. Dimenhydrinate? That's the generic name. At least in Canada.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 04:27:20	OMFG. Looking at my "notes" of how sick Depakene is making me and one day I wrote "Gastric Headache."
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 04:20:25	@bipolar_foodie Well I can tolerate it today but now it's Gravol time. It doesn't help that much sometimes though. Even still give it a shot
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 04:02:41	@bipolar_foodie At least I can tolerate my tea today! *heads to make cuppa and NOT fall*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 04:01:05	@bipolar_foodie Thanks. Will prob make blog post. This is bad. Another seizure earlier today? Don't think I can explain it as otherwise.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 03:40:29	@bipolar_foodie No worries. Yes I'm going to call his office as that's what I was told. He'd be back tomorrow.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 03:23:18	@bipolar_foodie Yes. That was the original plan anyway. He and I have talked a few times when I've gotten really messed up over the phone.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 03:12:07	@bipolar_foodie Also again don't piss about with your meds w/o medical supervision! I always preach that so no way! Dr. PA listen to self!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 03:11:08	@bipolar_foodie the shape I'm in and what it does to me. Not like going off for a day might make too much difference. Idk. But yeah. Hear me
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 03:10:04	@bipolar_foodie Can't remember if I wrote this to you but was thinking of pulling it last night. But today I thought no. Let him hear me in
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-04 03:08:52	@bipolar_foodie Yeah. More stuff just happened right now. My Neuro's really good. Doubt I'll have to see him! Can't leave house! Phone call.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 23:01:56	Oh got email from fellow inpatient while I was there a while back. Cool. She's still there. It's from "Chica" if you read any of the posts.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 23:00:10	@bipolar_foodie HA! Not awake yet! You get long rambly answer...
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 22:59:39	@bipolar_foodie but it is NOT a good sign and obviously is a serious problem. Thus, it's gotten THAT far already? Pull the med?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 22:58:22	@bipolar_foodie an intolerance problem. NEVER before has anything extreme like this happened. An Anticonvulsant causing a seizure. They can
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 22:56:59	@bipolar_foodie state yet. But should be. Then thinking if it's already screwed me over this much, lower dose? Now I'm kind of thinking it's
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 22:55:21	@bipolar_foodie Steady state means it's in me...round and round. Not good if things aren't changing or getting worse? Or worse if not steady
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 22:54:07	@bipolar_foodie have taken my meds (and am feeling like shite right off the hop) I'm thinking I've probably reached a steady state level.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 22:52:58	@bipolar_foodie Thanks hon. I went off into bad mood land later before bed and was doing some REALLY ridiculous stuff! Now that I'm up and
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 05:46:55	Fuck You Depakene!: http://wp.me/p3M8c-1gF
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 03:45:05	Screw it. *clicks send* I'm too tired.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 03:38:51	I'm trying to write it with music going too. My brain can't deal with both at the same time. *dies*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 03:37:25	OMG. Trying to email my mental mother in this state. HA! Oh, well.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-03 03:35:20	@CorinaBecker Yep you've got the spelling right. I just didn't "read right" based upon my Tweet from last night. I'm so out of it anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 23:01:58	@CorinaBecker What the travelling or the Depakene? I don't mind the travel via transit. The Depakene? I'm minding that a lot right now.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 10:18:02	You Want Me to Do What?: http://wp.me/p3M8c-1gx
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 07:53:40	@blissfulblues Yep. I just put my iPod on and ignore the world though!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 07:29:03	@blissfulblues Yes it has helped. Three are quite a fair distance for travel but worth it?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 07:20:31	@blissfulblues Oh I know. Took me forever to find good docs and am so lucky now.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 07:14:42	@blissfulblues *nods* My GP has done same on v. important occasions.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 07:10:18	@blissfulblues do that! This may be a LONG conversation but bet your arse I'll be prepared for it!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 07:09:36	@blissfulblues TY again. Oh Non-Arsey Neuro rocks! When I've been really ill before we just talk about it all over the phone! Not many docs
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 07:02:24	@blissfulblues Oh, yes. Absolutely. There are a constellation of things that are happening. Tuesday cannot arrive soon enough. *hug back*
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 06:59:03	Speaking of upset tummies the upstairs tenant is going to buy me more gingerale tomorrow. How sweet. Literally. Heh.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 06:55:43	@blissfulblues Tummy can't take it. Some days it's not so bad and I can get some food into me but most days not at all.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 06:03:03	@blissfulblues Thanks. Although, no food today. Or at least not yet! Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 05:44:10	@blissfulblues Well, a bit more energy today so I'm using every bit of it. I have no clue how I'll be tomorrow or even later on today~
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 05:41:08	@blissfulblues Oh, thank you! I feel much better now. Unless one of my lab measurements is off. LOL
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 05:21:43	@blissfulblues Thanks again *hugs* This post (slow to write) is again going be a real snoozer! Lots of med talk! Ppl will be "Shut Up PA!"
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 05:05:02	@blissfulblues Thx. Kinda useless IMO but ER so? Knew they'd do bloods but I'm pretty "oh really?" about them & doc'. Therefore blog post!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 04:53:47	@blissfulblues reviewing my labs for a blog post and kinda laughing for sure there.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 04:53:06	@blissfulblues Oh. Egad. I've been going severely nuts on taking new Depakene and can't reach my Neuro. On holiday? Went to hosp. and now
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 04:51:39	@bipolar_foodie No worries. Have it bookmarked now.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 04:50:53	@zinfrared Ah, probably just standard practice. One of a ticked box. I could have started begging to go to NICU for no reason?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 04:46:18	LMAO! They tested to see if I was pregnant! No chance of that being gay! Too busy to ask I s'pose!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 04:42:21	@bipolar_foodie God moving so slow taking me HOURS just to write down points for it! Can't even type I'm so screwy! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 04:41:24	@bipolar_foodie it to you though. Send me the link to your blog if you want also?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 04:40:59	@bipolar_foodie Cool. Everything I post on my blog shows up here or you can subscribe or whatever. I will send
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 04:32:13	@bipolar_foodie Oh, it's the wonderful Depakene still! I'm working on a post now but "READERS BEWARE: Heavy PA Geeky Med. Contact Ahead!"
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 04:17:06	Where am I? Just like my pen. Who out there has me? Gimme me back! Or, well, just keep me then. I don't care anymore.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 02:29:20	It's now become the bed/office/closet/pharmacy again! I knew it wouldn't take long...
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 02:27:20	Where's my pen? Okay, whoever's got it out there? Gimme it back!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 02:25:15	@Splinteredones Ah, naps are good things. Go hug and cuddle your pillow then!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 02:23:30	@Splinteredones LOL What are you up to?
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 02:22:33	@Splinteredones Hi hi. Nice to meet you.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-02 02:18:41	@Splinteredones Hi you don't know me & I just started following you so Happy Early Birthday. I forget everyone's birthday so good I saw this
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 23:58:17	Trying to have breakfast was NOT a good idea.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 23:29:12	@Canageek ok
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 23:27:38	@Canageek I normally would have but the Depa is killing me. I hate being awake b/c I'm so sick. Took it (and Valium) early evening.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 23:16:03	@readheadgirl Not sure what my name is doing there on that that but thanks. As always.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 23:14:21	@maialideth @mmmumma @alphabetania @dokkou @singing_moose @tuuli1 / Thanks! A top follower! Yay!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 23:13:43	@Canageek Sounds like would have been good to listen to but was trying to sleep!
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 03:40:09	OMG. How pathetic when you don't have enough energy to blip redonculous songs. Oh, Non-Arsey Neuro! On holiday! Drat.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 03:31:15	For @YogaChicky with LOTS of water! ♫ http://blip.fm/~108f0x
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 03:19:19	listening to "The Bee Gees - Tragedy" ♫ http://blip.fm/~108ek5
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 03:12:50	I hereby blame every song I blip on the fact that starting Depakene has completely melted my brain. Regular reminders to occur.

16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 00:56:13	@YogaChicky Makes total sense. I basically got it anyway. You needed water.
16253011	patientanon	2011-01-01 00:55:30	@YogaChicky Tried to write on baby MacBook while waiting in ER last night. So exhausted gave up after 3 sentences OMG. *dies*

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 02:14:33	@bipolar_foodie time. What scares me is that we won't be able to get it under control or make it stop! Or something!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 02:13:47	@bipolar_foodie It's not so much scary when it happens in the immediate as with this exact thing I know what to expect. It's the same every

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 01:48:08	@bipolar_foodie Sorry about the physical but if the mental is good at least better as the two aren't buggered! No about work as this seizure
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 01:45:40	Goddammit! "Roughly" within date rang! Only on new med for five days! Let's just see what happens? Like it would just "magically" go away!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 01:36:00	@Canageek Glad to hear. I'm idk. Pick a card, any card? Most imminent (sorta?) is this Typical Absence SE jazz but another "imminent" too!

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 01:25:29	Oh boy. Time to look into this however I may not glean much information. I am just beginning the med change but I know some things.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 01:21:26	@Canageek Hey you *hugs* How are you?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 01:20:31	Well now. I think we may have brought the Typical Absence Status Epilepticus out to play for a bit. Would explain some current behaviour.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 01:06:44	@bipolar_foodie OMG. I'm so out of it. Didn't tell you drug. 500mg of what? Depakene/Valproic Acid. Another Anticonvulsant.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 01:02:14	@bipolar_foodie happens so often to kill me. I'm sick for basically 12 days out of every month.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 01:01:23	@bipolar_foodie Absence Status Epilepticus. It's killing me as it's so debilitating. I finally figured out that's what it was and why it
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 01:00:19	@bipolar_foodie crash in Jan. too! My meds are all the same still except now we are adding 500mg to start(?) to get rid of the Typical
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:59:11	@bipolar_foodie Thanks. This year was pretty bad. Today Boxing Day so is it over now? I hope? I am online now at least. I hope you don't
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:57:03	Do I need Wonder Cane's brother? What's going on? Felt better yesterday. Am I having an "olfactory seizure in Denmark?"
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:47:42	Let's try more tea now that I have taken more Gravol. #medchangesareawesome
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:45:16	@spectrumdweller I'm starting to get more gooey as I just had to take a Gravol...lord.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:44:31	@spectrumdweller Oh, hey. Not to worry. If I get pooped or whatever, I'll just sign off. No worries.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:43:41	Oh come on Twitter. Don't break on me again
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:42:51	@spectrumdweller Yeah, Idk. Aspie stuff tossed in? I can't say. Our bodies and heads are mysteries enough, let alone in combination!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:41:46	@spectrumdweller Well that's exactly what happens when I get sick. Infections, seizure crap, all of it!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:41:10	@spectrumdweller Well that on top of other things may do it
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:40:24	@spectrumdweller Sometimes a build up of stress and other things (hormones and exhaustion etc...) can bring infections on. Then you crash.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:39:23	@spectrumdweller Also, i can get depressed?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:39:10	@spectrumdweller being sick as a person. I get frustrated. Very b/c my ADD drives me nuts. Too sick to "do" anything and too tired to focus.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:38:17	@spectrumdweller Huh. Well know you have med issues and the Seroquel didn't help? No one likes being sick so idk about how "you" react to
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:35:19	@spectrumdweller Well no bike for sure. X-mas triggers at all? I mean apart from Depa I've been staying (trying) away from a lot per that.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-27 00:30:43	@spectrumdweller Whoa! Are you just starting to take Depakene like me?! I've been on it since Wednesday. How about you?

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-26 23:09:45	Shit. I thought I was feeling better yesterday. I'm back to not being able to even drink my tea? Sure am doing a good job of spilling it tho
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-26 23:08:00	Oh yes. I forgot to say. That last one had the music.

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 03:32:55	Okay whoever contacted me on mobile do it again. I wasn't near it and it doesn't show a "Missed" anything. ARGH!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 01:28:43	@zinfrared As figured not open anyway. Thought I'd better call as if I kept searching would take so long I'd have 2 seconds to get there!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 01:22:32	@zinfrared Oops. I'm getting repetitive in my writing again! Definite sign I am not awake and quite "here" at the moment!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 01:21:03	@zinfrared times when I was an adult I was too scared to answer it as an adult. It just freaked me out!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 01:20:22	@zinfrared I know. I had what I call "phone-o-phopbia" as a kid. I wouldn't make calls at all as a kid! It frightened me to death! Also at
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 00:52:34	@zinfrared found GPS coordinates! Still can't find hours of operation! I'm just too arsed to call.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 00:51:58	@zinfrared Morning. Gotta go make some tea. Can you believe that? Trying to find hours for a shop online (not herculean task?) But actually
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 00:51:10	I obviously need (more) tea now. GPS coordinates online for a shop but no hours listed! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 00:48:48	Oh bloody hell! I can find the GPS coordinates for the damn shop online but I can't find its hours of operation? WTF? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 00:46:43	Really. Is it so, tremendously difficult to find the hours of operation of a shop online, without having to call them? I guess so!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 00:36:44	Looks like a quiet day on the online front. Ugh. Thank gods. I need it. *tips over*
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-13 00:29:52	I just woke up and I feel like I have a Twitter hangover.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 14:24:36	WHOO HOO! Backup almost done!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 14:22:56	@zinfrared Guy I can't count the number of times I've slept in my clothes! Not even factoring in the Bipolar Benders. Clothes make no diff.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 14:17:55	Should I bother getting into my pyjamas tonight or just sleep in my clothes?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 14:00:14	*prepares to enter severe hibernation mode*
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 13:59:19	tomorrow is NOT going to be a good day. oh wait. it's already tomorrow. you see! i was right! HA!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 13:57:25	oh, sorry. that was rather rude. pardon me. it's been a somewhat interesting day and evening. i won't ask for any latitude, however.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 13:55:56	okay backup are we done yet? i'd like to be able to go barf now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 13:49:55	And that last blip? David Sylvian rocks.

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 13:26:49	I'm back. Did anyone miss me? No. Of course not. I certainly didn't miss me.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 10:30:36	@zinfrared No kidding.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 10:29:30	@zinfrared SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 10:28:52	@zinfrared Okay NP. We just haven't talked in ages, you and I!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 10:27:56	@zinfrared be an ass or anything but would still love it.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 10:27:39	@zinfrared LOL It was great in hosp. as they had some access I may not have on their LAN. Oh, are you still gonna send me that book? Not to
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 10:26:33	@blissfulblues Yes. Funny. After all that fresh air I needed to get out some more!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 10:23:15	@zinfrared Glad you like. A lot of discussion. Anime character...read all of my thread?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 10:22:39	@blissfulblues Thanks. Will do. Just needed to get out after all of that work.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 10:21:49	Was also mid-blog post before raking those lovely leaves. May get that up too? Or tomorrow? We shall see.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 10:20:53	Battery Dying! Code Red! Code Red! Evacuate! Evacuate! Should I go off the radar I'll just be walking home. Be back online when I get there.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:52:33	@peejrarr Cool. Thanks. Will try and remember!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:52:05	@spectrumdweller Not stupid! We all should be happy! Please!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:35:46	@peejrarr Excellent. I'm always on the hunt for recommendations etc. for anime manga or anything geeky period? *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:29:40	@catatonickid @svasti108 @MettaYogaIL Part guru part goldfish. Huh. I'm part goo goo part goal miss.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:27:55	@spectrumdweller Cool. And #LOFNOTC was okay to begin with but after a while it just skyrocketed for me! OMG. PANTS OFF is a "rule" too. LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:25:59	@svasti108 @MettaYogaIL @catatonickid LOL I do have Iyengar's book. Fucking amazing. At least I think so.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:22:21	And it's not even #LOFNOTC when I DO get so overloaded! PANTS OFF!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:21:30	@spectrumdweller Well I really hope you do! And I meant to say that before but my head was kind of all over with so much Twitter talk! Duh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:18:58	@svasti108 @catatonickid @MettaYogaIL Considering you guys are all gurus and that.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:17:59	@svasti108 @catatonickid @MettaYogaIL Hey does it count that I was doing some asanas before raking the leaves?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:16:51	@peejrarr Well I won't give you a spoiler but yes it has a lot of episodes. Still worth it in my opinion.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:15:52	@CorinaBecker Agreed. So another vote for me keeping L as my Twitter avatar!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:13:56	@catatonickid Well, gonna cost the earth for me LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:13:32	@patientanon It is the same company that the one from hospital I used. I looked at others but they were crap. Going to be expensive but...?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:11:38	If anyone wants a good weighted blankie I recommend the company Salt of the Earth. That is where I am buying mine. Great pattern too! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:10:48	I have no money but now I want my new avatar on a hoodie. But I did find my weighted blankie that I must buy that I used in hospital. WOW!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:09:35	@peejrarr I haven't seen the manga but I strongly recommend the anime. Good.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 09:08:34	@blissfulblues Yep. I think so. *nods*
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:59:16	I need a break. No atm. Apart from a "life break." *wanders off*
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:58:37	@peejrarr Hey you! thanks. How goes? Do you like L? I have no clue if you like anime but methinks from last convo?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:57:58	Fuck it. L is staying for now. Decision made. Faye is on my blog. Some kind of even balance or something. Hell I have no balance anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:57:09	Oh, but L is just so cooooooooollllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:56:50	@blissfulblues give a rat's ass in the end.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:56:36	@blissfulblues Thank you. I agree. So one vote for L. Shit, I may need to put this up on my blog? Though that might not matter. No one may
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:55:08	Faye's not on the Spectrum... Although she rocks and is female like PA. L is a guy unlike PA but has Spectrum stuff going on like PA...
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:54:07	So, should I keep L? Crap. I'm SO tempted now... Harrumph!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:53:34	@EnigmaAnonymous Yes it's good.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:53:24	@spectrumdweller Yes, L is very cool and totally Spectrum considerable if you know Death Note
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:52:52	@blissfulblues Ditto to you but I know you know your anime!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:52:38	@EnigmaAnonymous W00t! Way to go girl!!! I am SO impressed!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:51:32	HE SO TOTALLY ROCKS!!!!!!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:50:50	And...does anyone know who that is???????????
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:50:37	Okay how does this look?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:44:36	@spectrumdweller Sorry, stuck on Twitter here. *runs to Google for image*
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:44:14	@CorinaBecker Indeed! Totally re: the Ed on the Spectrum thing. I was so the same.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:43:43	@spectrumdweller Huh? PA=Dumb. Fuck, your fast. Uhhhhh.....
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:43:13	@spectrumdweller LMAO! Again, I'm so spazzy I wouldn't even need alcohol!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:42:44	@spectrumdweller Although I'm so spazzy, I'll probably "lose" Faye!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:42:18	@spectrumdweller Fair enough. Let me go a huntin'?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:41:56	@CorinaBecker him so much I sort of lost some interest. I'm one of those sentimental types. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:41:24	@CorinaBecker Nah, loved this guy from the start. He's way cool and the series is okay too? Although when this character died since I loved
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:40:27	@spectrumdweller anime circles and other debated as on the Spectrum. I could tell from first episode in manner and such. Love him.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:39:26	@spectrumdweller No way! If and only IF I do it need to find good pic. Another anime character. WANT shirt. Cafe Press? LOVE character. In
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:35:47	I'm SO tempted to change my avatar BUT I LOVE FAYE!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:33:47	@spectrumdweller LOL I know. How long have we been going on about the whole RENT thing! Too much. I still love it though.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:32:06	Yes, I know. I'm going nuts with the K&D Sessions...

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:27:47	@spectrumdweller Let's just see as I don't want to get my hopes up. But would be so good if I could get it under control. And no you're not
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:27:12	@spectrumdweller that so...? Finding a pattern for any of my seizure stuff is HUGE as never before. So fingers...not crossed. No hopes.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 08:26:28	@spectrumdweller I think I've found a pattern for it. My cycle so that leads into the Catamenial territory. One of my meds is front line for

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 02:05:38	@bipolar_foodie Sorry about the meltdown but glad you're feeling better. Great about work being sorted! And yes hope for more calm? HA!

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 01:59:12	Well @AspiePenguin I totally understand. But since it was done you must have made some money! What about that? Do you still have it?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 01:55:54	So @AspiePenguin I wanted to ask you something. I was out shopping and I found you on an Advent Calendar. Yes! Pictures of you with snowmen!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 01:52:59	@suzsibs Plus we have had issues with overseas communication so they may have not gotten what I sent!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 01:50:33	@suzsibs I know. Just sort of kidding and a reflex worry. This person is v. nice. I am also kind of worried that they are not doing so well.

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-12 00:55:54	Was it something I said? Why do I get so nervous when in regular contact with someone and they stop emailing me?

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 09:30:40	@bipolar_foodie even if it is, it's a bad thing. I know it happens to me ALL the time. I hope they will be decent and understanding though.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 09:29:53	@bipolar_foodie *crosses fingers for you* I hope it will be okay. Sometimes fear gets the best of us and I'm not saying that's the case or

16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 09:15:43	@bipolar_foodie job who am I to question their creds? Others are sliding scale but since I'm not working, gee? How much $? Five cents?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 09:15:02	@bipolar_foodie have to pay for. I may have to wait a long time but I don't care! The freebies are all GPs but still if they can do a good
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 09:14:07	@bipolar_foodie Hey, that was good. Or better? Or something? One thing I did manage to obtain here was a list of therapists that I may not
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 09:09:04	@bipolar_foodie my brain exploding in such a very undignified manner. I need to teach it better manners.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 09:08:20	@bipolar_foodie Insomnia indeed. I'm kind of the reverse right now. Totally exhausted and completely barfy. Probably still recovering from
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:53:34	@bipolar_foodie Indeed. I think they canned it as if it was happening, would have been over by now. Whew! I barely escaped more madness!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:37:24	@YogaChicky You are SO right. Definitely with me!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:37:07	@bipolar_foodie I'd never tell you (or anyone!) to fuck off! They don't have formal discharge times so can go whenever? Or stay? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:36:28	@CorinaBecker via WP referrers and was WTF? Good luck with CAT and got your e. just too screwy to reply?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:35:42	@CorinaBecker As I just wrote there it's kinda funky but you can register/contact them and add your blog? I just found myself there ages ago
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:33:13	Oh, okay. It's due to traffic? Well that's some big HA HA CHORTLE CHORTLE!!! My blahg is stupid! There are journos on the damn site! Okay...
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:21:47	@CorinaBecker Huh what?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:21:32	@bipolar_foodie breakfast today. I don't even want to speak to anyone here but I am managing to engage a bit now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:20:56	@bipolar_foodie been left for discussion until tomorrow as I just about bit my nurses head off this morning and I didn't even get up for
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:20:19	@bipolar_foodie Not sure as head just clearing from Ultradian nightmare. Ambivalent. I know I need rest (duh!) but rest here, home? It's
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:18:54	Man, still trying to figure out how the hell I got on this site that "promotes" blogs from Canada. Scooped? But some heavy hitters. WTF?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:15:04	@bipolar_foodie Well good for you then! Cheers!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:08:49	@bipolar_foodie Exactly. Have done Karaoke before. When in uni years ago, did a B52s version of Love Shack with some guys and we won awards!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:05:09	@bipolar_foodie She's cool. It's just kinda weird. She complimented me on how I wrote about her so nicely. Eep! OMG.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:02:07	@bipolar_foodie Actually, the screen must have gone blank. I think I got the lyrics backwards.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 08:01:27	@bipolar_foodie Okay. *ahem* "...summer lovin' had me a blast...summer lovin' happened so fast..." There, how was that?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 07:58:56	@bipolar_foodie the first hit! So there goes some anonymity there! She's cool but rather a shocking email to read! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 07:58:09	@bipolar_foodie Right now I have to email J.'s sister who Google'd soemthing I told her about (just head stuff) and my own blog came up as
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 07:57:13	@bipolar_foodie Well if I ever do Karaoke I'll do my best to provide you with some "evidence." And no. Not coming back on Monday nights!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 07:50:26	@bipolar_foodie Good question. Not sure. May need to come back for outpatient treatment. Just to make sure I stay completely unbalanced yes?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 07:49:13	@bipolar_foodie LOL I can sing but no way am I sitting in with screaming out of tune Karaoke Krazies!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 07:43:11	@bipolar_foodie Oh, it was brutal the first Monday night I was here. They didn't even shut the room's doors. Thought I was going to die!
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 07:36:53	Currently sitting in (other) Common Room getting ready to put headphones on. It's Karaoke Night again! Unless they've cancelled it. Please?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 07:34:55	@YogaChicky Thanks. Well, they say it's never too late? Plus I love to learn anything! Everything! Just have a hard time in that area, hey?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:43:27	@YogaChicky Kidding you. xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:43:03	@YogaChicky I am a hopeless case. I will never learn. #PAsucks LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:42:09	@YogaChicky OMG the irony. I just put myself down in trying to be nice to myself for putting myself down. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:41:27	@YogaChicky Yes funny, huh? Thank you as well, hun. I know I'm not being so kind to myself. I stink when I'm like that. *nods*
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:40:01	@TheSpindleshay the wall. Should be fun. Plus being here gave me loads of time to boost some published journal articles?
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:39:15	@TheSpindleshay content and other and she just did now (both versions--before and after.) For my reading pleasure. Totally obscure and off
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:38:08	@TheSpindleshay Actually she works as a translator in Paris and I was bugging her to send me this woman's PhD dissertation. Long story due
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:35:24	@TheSpindleshay *nods* She's totally cool so it's not a problem. Just to read that email just now was... O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:34:40	*PA go lay down now after REALLY BIG surprise!* LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:33:10	@TheSpindleshay whole deal later.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:32:52	@TheSpindleshay I won't tell him his sister now has access! I'm not talking to him now anyway though. *rolls eyes* I'll tell his sis' the
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:32:07	@TheSpindleshay Well after I went all spazzy over the weekend! Still, I get ya. J. got all pissy about reading it and I said NOBODY does.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:30:23	@TheSpindleshay it now! Well, I guess one person I know IRL has access now! *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:29:40	@TheSpindleshay I know. Too much, huh! Irony is when I started my blog I gave friends the url and NOBODY read it. So I said no one can read
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:27:59	@TheSpindleshay I think I need to lay down now MUCH more than before LMAO
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:27:17	@TheSpindleshay It was okay. Kinda? She said she admired my honesty and thanked me for the kind words I said about her! ACK Oh, dear.
16253011	patientanon	2010-12-07 05:25:07	OMG! Was talking to J.'s sister about some head stuff. She Google'd it and first hit was my blog! There goes some MASSIVE anonymity! O.o

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-29 21:32:06	I gotta figure SOMETHING out but I don't know HOW to figure it out! WILL SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!!! Sorry. I'm stressed. Even still.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-29 21:28:47	I get to pay my rent today! I'm going to be homeless just like J.! That is NOT funny AT ALL! Just looking at numbers or lack thereof. *sigh*

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-25 21:23:23	@alphabetania Well I am having my morning #twittea as I type before I have to dash out and meet J. and his sister. Important day today!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-25 20:47:19	@alphabetania I think that was #twittea we were talking about? You wrote this a day ago and I just read it. Yes?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-24 05:02:46	@spectrumdweller with his own mental health and other problems. They're his.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-24 05:02:22	@spectrumdweller That just doesn't make any sense. He's where he is now and must face his own issues. Neither his sister, me, we can't deal
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-24 05:01:28	@spectrumdweller along "within" the system himself, there is less room for anyone he knows personally to do what? Replace the professionals?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-24 05:00:50	@spectrumdweller Even if my life was just grand and I was having no problems it would pretty much be the same deal. Now that he is further
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-24 05:00:12	@spectrumdweller understand that. I do know I have gone as far I have in terms of "working the system" and ensuring his needs have been met.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-24 04:59:27	@spectrumdweller really only can do so much and after that, you must let the professionals take over. A lot of friends and family do not
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-24 04:58:48	@spectrumdweller or anything (me for him.) It's like they say for anyone who is sick (either physical or mental.) Friends and family members
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-24 04:58:02	@spectrumdweller Hi just popped online for a bit but will probably have to disappear at any moment. I don't think it's so much a trade off
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-23 22:47:30	@AspieTeacher Kinda? Although re: J's sister have learned it's more fun to go out totally bonkers with someone else rather than being alone!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-23 22:46:08	@AspieTeacher I'm already taking script Prevacid for GERD. Actually had GERD attack in middle of last night and night before. Stress? OMG.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-23 22:42:03	@AspieTeacher Oh yes, all of this "immediate mega stress" will be gone in a week. I'm not sure if you read my last blog post.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-23 22:41:19	@AspieTeacher but I haven't taken Benadryl in years!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-23 22:40:58	@AspieTeacher Super (well not they're hives!) Just never had except a viral exanthema over entire body years ago. Benadryl took care of that
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-23 22:38:16	@AspieTeacher Okay thanks. I'll just monitor and again could be stress of this situation now. I think it could be as I now have a cold sore!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-23 22:37:28	@AspieTeacher Yes. Although I had written something and then put your Twitter name in the middle to ask. Maybe it looked "hidden?"
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-23 22:24:53	@aspietech Don't know if u saw but asked u how you deal w/ hives. Several days Benadryl now & a bit better but stress making them stubborn?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-23 22:19:15	@alphabetania Absolutely! I always forget the #twittea hashtag but that's probably because I haven't had my tea yet and I'm so out of it!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-23 22:10:31	A bit of a brief respite today but only for the morning and afternoon. Better get the tea flowing now. No rest for the advocates! *smirks*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-23 08:53:20	@readheadgirl Thx for the #FF Post written too! J.'s sis & I took "Day Off" today. I had JDP & she had stuff w/ friends in city. PA=bye bye.

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-22 21:22:26	@spectrumdweller to fixing my own life. I can't attend multiple appt.s for/with him all over the city etc... say, by end of next week.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-22 21:21:37	includes dealing with the professionals on his own. His sister is only here until next week, then back to Paris and then I have to back 24/7
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-22 21:20:39	@spectrumdweller him. We are there to help because we care for him but we can't literally be his voice. he has to help himself and that
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-22 21:19:30	@spectrumdweller Power of Attorney but he is not incapacitated! He's just in denial! He has to face the facts of where his life has brought
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-22 21:18:43	@spectrumdweller We do all the work so he just sits back and does nothing. Therefore he doesn't advocate for his own care. Sure I/we have
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-22 21:18:11	@spectrumdweller Yes, J.'s sister and I are really pulling it together for J. We're kind of frustrated though because double-edged sword.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 23:07:30	@maialideth Thanks again. Well only so much I can do for him. Me? Oh, my life not in the picture right now! Have to deal with my crap later!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 22:59:18	@maialideth *grins* He's helped me out at times too but couldn't with something like this. For example I wouldn't need Power of Attorney!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 22:47:56	@maialideth Thanks, babe. Well, what's a friend to do? I mean, he's going to end up homeless! I can't just waltz out the damn door on him!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 22:46:19	@alphabetania Thanks. I'll check the link later as I have to try and scootify myself out the door soon. I feel dizzy... *laughs slightly*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 22:44:12	@mmmumma Just saw a pic but Firefox said "No!" to what seems like a "play link?" A triangle?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 22:41:59	@maialideth about a half hour to meet with J. and his sister to coordinate a whole bunch of stuff as I have now gotten off phone w/ J. OMG!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 22:40:54	@maialideth combination of being exhausted but all keyed up, brain won't stop. There are so many things to do! In fact, I am leaving in
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 22:31:53	@maialideth This whole thing is a terrific nightmare! It wasn't late by the time I got home but I was completely exhausted. In fact, the
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 22:31:04	@maialideth Hi hon. Thanks. As you can see already wrote a bit there but wow. Yes sister good but we're NOWHERE near finished...god, what?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 22:28:50	@spectrumdweller weird feelings last night. Save for post but whenever I have time?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 22:28:28	@spectrumdweller bit harder as they are related so I have nothing to say there! She and I totally working in concert though. However I had
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 22:27:41	@spectrumdweller Thanks. J.'s sister and I get along SO well. We have not held back anything between each other. Even my own sitch! Just a
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 03:11:29	Okay kids gotta hit the road as J's sister's here from Paris! We're taking things to a new level now! Oh, boy!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 03:10:51	@spectrumdweller idk never been in here so i'll find out something?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 03:06:30	@spectrumdweller Mine will be Disability but I haven't had time to check it out yet due to current sitch. However, it's not much so trouble.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 02:56:16	@spectrumdweller Gotcha. I'd love to get under the table too seeing as I'm getting closer and closer to stoopid guvmunt assistance. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 02:55:30	@alphabetania @maialideth I'll probably have to grab mine to go. Or maybe not if you're fast enough!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 02:52:02	Okay. Flight has touched down. *estimates time to deplane, clear customs and hit baggage* Will not take Valium until I hit transit!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 02:33:06	@alphabetania Yep, love tea. Did you get my DM?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 02:26:17	@mmmumma Thanks. I have had some minor(?) end of day crashes. Although this entire thing may go on for a LONG time! Yes.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 02:23:33	@mmmumma Yeah, I'm trying but this is taking up all my time and crazy energy! Thought about doing my own stuff/work last night but no energy
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 02:18:39	@alphabetania Yes, again. I am not thinking because of all the J. stuff, having Power of Attorney and dealing.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 02:18:02	@mmmumma Yes. I know. Communication is hard. With that stuff I wrote? UGH! I'm just not clear in my head right now with all of the J. stuff.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 02:13:58	Just deleted all PTSD etc...Tweets. Not for public viewing. Too much going on and wrote impulsively. Not thinking. No more discussion. TY.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 02:04:53	@maialideth Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. Yet another of all my diagnoses.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 01:58:52	Just had shower (almost) forgot to rinse hair. #ADD #ADHD
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 01:39:23	@maialideth Hehehe. Love it!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 01:30:18	@maialideth Yep although I think I'm better at watching people play video games! Obscenely bad manual dexterity!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 01:19:36	@maialideth I don't know for "sure" but we followed each other on Twitter. I think we'd have to talk more to get into the nitty-gritty.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 01:13:32	@maialideth LOL Yes know that one? Kind of yep, we both have something in common! However I'm sure we both have MORE in common! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 01:11:59	@mmmumma Well you at least have an online friend with me? Or new friend? Or getting to know friend? We have just met so that's good?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 01:10:26	Oh my hives! @AspieTeacher I've never dealt w/ them before. One day on Benadryl so far. Maybe a tiny difference? How about things with you?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 01:00:17	@maialideth Sorry hon. I have slept with men as I came out in my early 20s and that and still did after (complicated) but just women now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 00:58:43	@mmmumma LOL. I have a very poor perception of my body. I go by what other people say about what I look like. "Supposedly" I'm attractive.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 00:57:11	@maialideth Yes I am gay. And good to know @mmmumma Still ROTFLMAO! Oh, I am so silly!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 00:43:31	@maialideth @mmmumma Well again, I'm pretty open so if you want to ask me anything go ahead. I won't take offense either.

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 00:40:43	@maialideth Well if it's on the end (someone to me) I get very confused or just don't pick up on it at all!) Usually the latter. No clue!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 00:12:32	Oh crap. J.'s sister's flight delayed from Paris. When's the new ETA? WTF with everything today? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 00:11:22	@mmmumma True enough! It's that this is going to be a HUGE day with all of this stuff. J.'s sister arriving from Paris today.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 00:10:25	@maialideth Well, maybe I should reconsider my whole flirting thing, too. Yeah. Oh, idk again! Maybe my I'm getting worse w/ communication!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 00:03:52	@mmmumma LOL if only I was looking for food! Trying to find brain. Then again, always trying to do that!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 00:03:26	@maialideth history anyway so ugh. Idk. Circumstantial maybe? *crosses eyes*

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-21 00:01:33	@maialideth Hmmm interesting but communication is so stupid though! I can be both erm... problems with assertiveness but can say blah, blah

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-20 23:49:45	@maialideth social cues and that, maybe not so much adhering to society's norms etc...
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-20 23:49:09	@maialideth things. We don't hold back. Maybe because so many of can be so damn blunt and we just barf out our words. Other things like
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-20 23:47:56	@maialideth Excellent. I don't like to make generalizations but I've met a lot of Aspie folks who do seem to be up front about a lot of
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-20 23:34:57	@maialideth Ah, I was just kidding. I mean, not that you have to of anything. Just that I'm pretty honest with people I get to know.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-20 22:46:56	Better get the tea going. Think I'm going to have to play "referee" re: J. and his sister. Family baggage and all. I'm tired. J.'s an arse!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-20 22:44:16	@maialideth *grins* No prob w/ anyone else into that, just not me. If you want to know anything else in "repertoire" just ask! I'm not shy.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-20 22:42:49	@spectrumdweller LOL. Why not find a jobe here? Are you talking visa stuff? I know prob. hard for me to get into US re: that?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-20 22:41:39	@zinfrared Remember my crazy auditory hallucination of the warped carnival music? Merry-Go-Round on Acid Music? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-20 22:40:55	@zinfrared Been too damn busy to research it! Only had one problem with pseudoephedrine once a few years back but had taken all my life.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-20 22:40:03	@zinfrared funky chem. work ends up becoming an anti-nauseant but I don't *think* nausea is a side effect of Benadryl's active ingredient.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-20 22:39:14	@zinfrared ingredient is precursor--Gravol just does funky stuff with it--more sedation) I think it makes me a bit nauseous. Gravol in the

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-18 00:57:54	Okay, being "next of kin" (even though J.'s sister is coming in from Paris) is a lot of work! *crosses eyes* I need more tea. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 23:23:51	@Canageek Pretty sure I'm post-“ick”tal© though. That will be pretty funky while trying to admit him. Ugh. he needs it. Won't go by self.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 23:22:47	@Canageek last night! And yes, his sister flying in from Paris on Wednesday. I guess that's it? Severely out of it so need tea now?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 23:22:09	@Canageek to hospital where I am going to stay with him until he is admitted. That can take forever. Hope I'm not post-“ick”tal© as I seized
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 23:21:20	@Canageek Yes, friend there now(ish?) to help him move/throw out stuff. Then some stuff coming to me for storage. Then friend drive J. and I
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 23:19:45	numbers so that is a good sign. I hope any "good signs" keep up. I'm wiped, Idk if I'm post-“ick”tal© yet or not. Will make fighting harder.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 23:18:23	hospital but I think he's coming around to see the light. I've convinced him and maybe his sister is backing me up. He's emailed us contact
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 23:17:38	Tired. Been up in the wee hours coordinating with Paris and just up an hour ago. J's sister flying in Wed. Long day/night(?) to drag J. into

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 00:54:08	I'm thinking of finding some random kids to go out with on Hallowe'en to get more food in my house. Is that a good idea?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 00:42:59	Oh boy. Long email finally finished and sent to my mother! Whew! *crosses eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 00:30:36	@mmmumma Okay. Ex-partner is/was chef and silicone gloves? Whoa. I deal with regular. Silicone would make me more clumsy ironically!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 00:19:41	@mmmumma *nods* I'd just have to buy them. I don't have anything suitable at all.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 00:16:15	@mmmumma LOL Paper Cups. If I tried they'd probably get set on fire! My oven is terrible. I have to watch everything like a hawk. BURN!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-17 00:10:02	@mmmumma I haven't made any muffins but yummy. Good idea. Although lost all of baking pans etc. after moving out from ex-partner's place.

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 22:08:29	Powdered Milk from the Food Bank is okay in tea. First test. Second test is to try as "actual milk?" I'll let you guys know.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 21:57:31	@mmmumma @maialideth I agree. You guys can either fight over me of flip a coin. Up to you.

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 21:18:22	@mmmumma Thanks to you as well. Perhaps you and @maialideth can just adopt me LOL! I'm really cute! I don't cause any problems! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 21:16:59	@buttonista I know. Made that joke before! Forget the IV tree version as well. Parenteral all the way! Portability!

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 21:03:06	Wow. Up earlier than I thought. Actually a lot earlier considering I went to bed exhausted and overtired so late. Bummer.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 20:58:21	@buttonista @TriniGirlBlue Ditto. I am the curious cat I always am too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 20:57:18	@maialideth I hyperfocus on productive things but there's the problem.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 20:56:52	@maialideth with the ADD I find it just passes me by. I don't have a proper schedule so I'll just fixate/hyperfocus and bye bye! Not bad if
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 20:56:02	@maialideth YW. My world is completely warped and twisted right now so I don't know one minute from the next. Time is pretty weird but also

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 20:42:42	@mmmumma I'm not sure what it makes me! Fluffy-Headed for sure. Hmmm...
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 20:41:57	@mmmumma No snow yet and not for quite a while. I do have fluff in my head. Does that count?

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 03:51:51	*heads to kitchen to ponder cookie making motivation measurement statistics*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 03:50:43	@Tigerbean *nods* I've run of sugary goodness, other sweets and that's bad per dietary needs. Might be more motivation right there!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 03:47:38	@SheikYurbouti Yes and a top too! All fancy as per sports with non-bacterial something or other? Wee PA won't stink or get all gross? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 03:46:02	@CorinaBecker Try big dept. stores. That's where I got these although wee PA had to go to the Jr. Boys Section LOL Still too large in waist!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 03:44:23	@SheikYurbouti No. These ones are fleece and totally awesome. Wee Ice Cube PA needs them every day of winter. Maybe prior? Dunno.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 03:43:12	@Tigerbean Indeedy. Just got home, still post-“ick”tal© (but eating!) Maybe with a bit of rest will get motivated to make them. Maybe. Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 03:41:58	*has now put on long underwear beneath clothes to wear INSIDE flat* (which is utterly ridiculous!)
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 03:35:12	@Tigerbean Oh, forgot to mention. Still haven't gotten around to making the stupid PB cookies. Maybe should now since my flat is freezing!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 03:33:57	Freezing in my flat. Not happy about that either. I need my long underwear OUTSIDE. I shouldn't need them INSIDE. Anyone agree?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-16 03:28:31	Brainfried, JDP today and way too much to do. Seriously out of it, still a bit sick, made my guy repeat himself all over I'm so out of it.

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-13 03:12:32	OMG! I banged my head getting out of Grocery Man's car buying Wonder Cane's brother! OWWW! post-“ick”tal© SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-13 01:11:02	@pianomaths Heh. Not too bad then. I love the smell of books. Old or new.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-13 00:21:32	Yay! Grocery Man is coming a bit later to help me get a cane. Wonder Cane all decorated with stickers not so appropriate for funerals. No.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 23:41:11	With the visitation tomorrow, the funeral Thursday, JDP on Friday, should I cancel JDP? Any suggestions? Idk.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 23:24:39	@buttonista of context, immediately write about the first thing I see, try and turn, twist things around a bit? Idk.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 23:23:44	@buttonista I know. Quite original too? I think pretty creative as well. I've done some writing like that. Maybe. Find something a bit out
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 23:12:04	@buttonista Check this out! The second by Karen Norberg blew me away! http://bit.ly/75VOsA
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 23:07:40	@buttonista Ok I'll take some pics of hot chocolate & chai latte too. Hehe. I've been coming up with some good Aspie literal jokes lately.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 23:05:42	@buttonista Lemme find link. OMG I just about died when I saw it!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 23:05:21	@buttonista Whoa! Now that surprised me! Almost jumped off my bed 3ft. in the air! Oh, have I got something for YOU! Not advent but artsy.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 23:01:26	@buttonista I can take a pic of me! or send you one I already have taken of me...
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 23:00:51	@buttonista Your favourite drink besides tea?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 23:00:22	@buttonista Oh, I can take a photo for you! A photo of something I drink tea from! *ducks* No, any kind of pic. I'm not a pro though!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 22:59:09	@buttonista Hey, that's cool! I don't care about chocolate that much anyway. Like I said, more about opening and being "surprised!"
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 22:58:24	@buttonista how about I make you a teacup with, gee, what should I put on it? Heh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 22:57:53	@buttonista Thanks hon. I can't do anything artsy-crafty! No manual dexterity! Hmmm...what could I "make" for you? Never tried pottery so
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 22:56:24	@buttonista Could be. What were in the non-choco?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 22:53:22	@buttonista Thought they all came w/ chocolate but then I never got one right? I just liked opening the wee doors and/or windows. I'm weird.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 22:49:36	@pianomaths Whoa. Bach's on the table? How's he looking? He's been gone for a long time. Who approved the exhumation? Sorry bad jokes.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 22:47:15	I think I have to go out on my own and buy another cane today. Well, no think. Need another. That will be a really hard challenge. Oh, dear.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-12 22:45:11	@buttonista I like Advent Calendars but have never gotten one. I should buy myself one this year. So there stupid Parental Units. Stinkers.

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-08 07:01:57	Laters.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-08 07:01:04	Oh well. Not much I can do I suppose. Realistically a seizure is a brain injury so recovery time is needed. Try harder tomorrow. #whocares
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-08 06:53:35	Wow. I can't believe how little I have accomplished today. Maybe it's alright considering it's my first day being able to walk and...? #fail
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-08 05:57:58	Back to the JDP!: http://wp.me/p3M8c-1bk
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-08 03:01:52	Okay. Wow. Just had some granola bars and an Ensure. Let's see what tummy has to say about that.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 23:45:13	Enough of this. I need some tea. What.Am.I.Doing.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 23:44:35	I must be post-ictal or drain bamaged or something. Writing semi-intimate email to my crazy mental untreated mother! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 23:29:32	Also vaguely heard something being tossed across the room and landing on the floor. It was my watch. Idk when that happened. Oy Gevalt!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 23:26:38	WTF? A nocturnal seizure? Second time Todd's paresis when reaching for water bottle in night? Picked up, all function lost, bottle on floor.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 23:21:12	@spectrumdweller No problemo!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 23:21:02	@SheikYurbouti Idk LOL I need some "Vertical Testing." Just got up a while ago and then got immersed in online stuff. Also see next Tweet!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 11:19:50	ok now i really have to go. zee gravol...shee ees ireeseesteeble...shee ess calling my name...bon soir...
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 11:17:45	@spectrumdweller Yes acuity is a real word and thus, you have proven excellent verbal acuity in citing it in your Tweet. Heh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 11:16:05	Okay nice to see everyone for a whole 20min! Time to throw sorry post-ictal butt to bed again. This is Day Three so over tomorrow? Uh, yeah?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 11:11:40	@SheikYurbouti Hey it's Bedridden. I DID speak too soon. Migraine and methinks a good dose of NCSE as post-ictal for3 days now. Jinx!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 11:00:58	At least I found a better stand alone app that would work on baby Acer.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 11:00:27	Well, isn't that just dandy. After all this screwing around, I think I'm going to have pass out. At least being post-ictal is only 72hrs
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 10:52:11	Okay so this works with baby Acer. TweetDeck still doesn't weird. Both use AIR. Oh, hi everyone.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 06:07:55	Stimmy, post-ictally nauseous, headachy, comorbidly screwy, what-the-hell-else-could-be-wrong-with-her PA is going to try and eat. Byee! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 05:59:59	Oh, here comes the rocking back and forth next! Stim! Stim! Stim!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 05:59:08	Oh I must be tired or something! I'm perseverating making these tiny little sounds. I've done this before so I know it's been "a day." Stim!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 05:10:30	@maialideth I just did follow! Just got home and online. Pooped.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 05:01:36	*kisses Wonder Cane too*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 05:01:07	Back from JDP. *kisses Gravol* At least I made it out there but transit on the way home was O.o Not as bad on the way there. Spinny SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-07 04:58:01	@maialideth Thanks for the mention!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 22:40:35	Oh no. Been up a few hours & still feeling a bit post-ictal. Gotta bring Wonder Cane. Gotta leave early. No Gravol 4 appt! Spacey enuf now!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 22:27:15	Off to JDP today. Better keep track of the time! LOL I think my last appt. to see anyone was with them 2.5 weeks ago! Oh, dear. PA=Hermit.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:48:03	ok time for meds and to put my sorry post-ictal butt back in bed! Have a good morning/afternoon/evening/night everyone!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:35:29	@zinfrared Sometimes you can get paradoxical effects or side effects that aren't really paradoxical by definition but just look like it.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:33:54	@zinfrared Hey my ADD meds didn't give me any problems so that's all that matters to me on the Stim/Bipolar issue!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:32:35	@zinfrared Yes is a stim so issue w/ Bipolar folks. Always fine with me before that one time so could have been cocktail then too or idk.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:27:40	@zinfrared It was totally trippy weird twisty carnival music or something! Merry go round on acid! O.o I don't hallucinate never have ever!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:25:12	@zinfrared Oh not good I'm ok w/ Gravol. I stay away from anything w/ pseudoephedrine as w/ Bipolar had tiny auditory hallucination once O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:21:26	@zinfrared Although I will say the degree of nausea is totally O.o SPAZ NAUSEA O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:15:36	@zinfrared It's ok. Well no ok! Always get nauseous w/ both migraines and when post-ictal. Both are VERY common issues.Always need Gravol!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:10:06	Should give my crazy post-ictal eyes a break & sign off? Time for next dose of Gravol? So out of it when did I last take it? Tummy says YES!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:04:42	@zinfrared just "discovered" so to speak. Nothing is for sure in a diagnostic sense, can't prove it but makes a lot of sense.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:03:43	@zinfrared free for two months except that one a week or so ago. That's a record since losing my job and all! Not counting NCSE as it was
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:02:19	@zinfrared Explained it all to Non-Arsey and he was totally on board. So, good thing we upped the Lamictal. Also, after doing been seizure
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 09:00:57	@zinfrared makes no sense! Later read NCSE! OMG. I never knew! So misunderstood, undiagnosed, docs don't even know! I fit criteria so well!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 08:59:36	@zinfrared overstimulation? I'd wake up post-ictal? It made no sense? Non-Arsey and I just said typical as my brain is so complicated and
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 08:58:25	@zinfrared I stumbled across NCSE (post on blog about it) Remember when I said brain was acting like seizure after migraine or Aspie
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 08:37:51	@YogaChicky True. Wish I could actually have them. Mega doses of Gravol all day hasn't been so bad though? At least then I don't care? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 08:31:07	@YogaChicky I just signed on so idk if there's something rowdy happening around here but reading what you wrote made me laugh. "Take a nap!"
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 08:14:08	There was almost(!) extreme panic earlier as I thought I had run out of Gravol! OMG!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-06 08:12:38	Taking a break from being sick (I wish) and back online. I'm post-“ick”tal© As I suspected some NCSE going on as well as the migraine.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-05 21:05:48	@alphabetania Well try not to work too hard then!

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 07:13:35	ok better go. all funny like.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 07:12:56	@zinfrared yeah idk.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 07:12:45	Something's kind of off. Not sure but I'm repeating my words when I type. Noticed that when maybe nervous. Don't know if means anything
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 07:10:28	Bless Valium. I don't get all weird and panicky when I go out. I don't understand that today. All dizzy and weird too. *sad face*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 07:08:39	I should probably like eat and go or something. It's been a very weird day.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 07:05:00	@zinfrared Sounds good to me!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 07:02:44	@zinfrared Oh, that reminds me. I need to delete that Follow.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 07:02:21	@zinfrared LOL I think I'd make them MILLIONS in a study with my head and I'd deserve serious compensation in return. HA!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 07:01:32	@zinfrared All it says is "We're Psychologists, we're going to try and prove what we want to say using a crappy model and an SSRI!" My post!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 07:00:41	@zinfrared mind in terms of brain chemistry and linked it to dopamine instead of serotonin as once thought! Bullshit as I wrote anyway
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 07:00:03	@zinfrared Trait Theory where it is applicable but I can't stand it and obviously Trait Theory! Funny too as one founding father changed his
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 06:59:28	@zinfrared not had a chance in a long time and find it fun! Some readers like it? True about the deprecated form in that one way except in
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 06:58:43	@zinfrared Yes you get my take on it? Roundabout and whatnot? Again just me having fun tearing apart material I find from my own pov. Have

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 05:11:42	@alphabetania Glad you made it there safe but kinda good and bad or weird? Nice place but a bit of another world? Still hope you enjoy.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 05:10:27	Yesterday, Cabin Fever. Today, Agoraphobia. Just had damn near panic attack going to pharmacy and back now. Huh? Valium! Stat! *winces*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 00:33:14	Ah who am I kidding? I'm verbose as all get out so the post may be a bit long and again, ripping apart the bogus IS so much fun! *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 00:27:30	I haven't had a chance to have some fun with that in a very long time. May not be long as so bogus but still a gas? *smirks*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-04 00:25:52	Oh.Dear.God. Just been checking my followers (update?) and found something unreal! To me anyway. More tea for post? Rip apart "study" a bit?

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 08:51:00	@zinfrared Have been published in minor form already. Just want to go for larger and different markets as well.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 08:50:34	@zinfrared it! Have always written! But sure, get published. Absolutely! If not, will never stop writing! NEVER!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 08:49:54	@zinfrared No seriously, poetry and other stuff "in the works" where the goal is to be published. I mean, love it just for the sake of doing
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 08:48:40	@zinfrared Hi hon. Oh, it's my personal. It's very rare that ANYONE sees it! I'll send you the final collection if it ever gets published!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 08:46:57	One must be very careful when editing with paper hanging out of mouth! Watch out for PAPER CUTS!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 08:33:05	Currently watching some idkwtf movie and working on poetry...kind an okay evening? Maybe? That's a bit of an idkwtf too? *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 08:31:35	@catatonickid *nods* I'm "all over the shop" with the whole thing, too. *groan* Sorry, just couldn't hold back there.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 08:30:33	@alphabetania Sounds excellent. I would LOVE to jump on a plane right now, I tell you.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 08:30:06	@VandWsMommy Ah that was just a bit or Twitter rhyming. I haven't done any in a long time so I tossed some up.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:54:27	I wish I had a filter, to see what's off kilter. But none can I find, for this restless mind!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:46:22	@alphabetania Well that's good at least. After the overload you might be able to relax in very good surroundings.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:34:07	I just lost THE GAME!!! http://bit.ly/amg9tR
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:32:02	@SheikYurbouti LMAO! Well different for sure as at least I'm not BEDRIDDEN this time! Shouldn't speak too soon. Watch disaster strike NOW!

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:29:11	@SheikYurbouti Oh no! You're sick! Please not again.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:27:04	@alphabetania Vacation?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:23:18	@moritherapy Oh yeah. I think mine takes every form known to man and then beyond to undiscovered ones.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:21:47	@alphabetania *smirk*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:19:15	@alphabetania Of course! I'm a walking paradox. Sometimes a crawling one too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:17:13	@TriniGirlBlue Oh no worries. Do you mean working through anything in particular?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:14:27	Damn I wish finished uni. And went on to do a Masters. And a Ph.D
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 05:00:54	@moritherapy Whoa. Bookmarked. Will need to check out later with less melted brain? But when is it not melted?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 04:58:18	@Canageek Thanks hon. Things will be what will be, I guess. I don't really have much choice in the matter, hey? Back with JDP and on my own.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 04:57:16	Well a few something or others. Not going do anything now and jeopardize a cover letter with a melted brain at the moment.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 04:47:07	@Canageek Oh, well. Erm...need food resources I guess you could say? Running out of money so have to do what have to do?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 04:42:41	I.Have.No.Job.Skills.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 04:32:59	Switch gears. I've seen enough stuff get trashed from my life already today, thank you!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 04:28:14	That is a dicey question for me period.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 04:27:15	Take a break, keep going or switch gears? This is a dicey question for someone with ADD.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 04:12:40	@TriniGirlBlue Good to hear. Again, fair to maudlin? Not sure if anything much has changed in 24 hours. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 04:11:59	@catatonickid Interesting. Took me a long time too? Idk. Maybe still. Although in Canada polite stereotype? People say faster than me!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 03:43:36	I swear...at least I'm trying...what a life. *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 03:39:33	Ruthlessly getting rid of SHIT in my flat!!!

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 02:29:31	@TeenagersWithAS Cool!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 01:37:25	Okay weather made decision. Not going out. Raining. Just have to get off computer to do stuff. Like that's never a problem. *huge eyeroll*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 01:15:17	Wait. I forgot about the Food Bank. Make that three days but uh...I mean maybe "relaxing out?"
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 01:13:51	Haven't been out in four days. A bit of cabin fever going on? Made list of stuff to do though. Argh. ...push, pull...push, pull...
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:34:59	@MindInFlux Oh, don't! I want to quit! Now? My friend P. and I were joking maybe not right now with all the stress in my life LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:32:39	I had some problems re: Mac and PC printing but not my fault! Too bad people had PCs!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:31:51	@spectrumdweller are some huge CEO. Keep bullets to a minimum. Obviously spell check! Uh, don't let information roll over to second page.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:30:13	@spectrumdweller Oh keep name and phone on second page in case they get separated, never staple them, keep to minimum two pages unless you
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:28:50	@spectrumdweller converted one based upon school recently so I think I have one of two now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:28:13	@spectrumdweller Sell yourself as in really boast achievements. Can't remember what type is mine, functional etc. would have to look up but
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:27:11	@spectrumdweller don't think mine is particularly stellar based upon certain things. Basics are 12-14pt. only certain fonts don't use jargon
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:26:02	@spectrumdweller LOL Mine is rather? Idk. There is so much confusion about what looks good, how-to's. Dependent upon history, skils etc. I
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:21:52	@gggallery My immediate thought of happiest art moment was skydiving. The most indelible mark of art on myself.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:10:41	Damn! Since tenant moved out contacted idiot landlord to try and get as would be cheaper. Already rented to someone else. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:09:25	@spectrumdweller I should take your lead and apply for some jobs today. Good for you.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-03 00:08:18	@TriniGirlBlue Missed you as I went offline so never got a chance to hear how you are doing. So?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 23:37:02	@moritherapy Okay. Damn e. finally sent!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 23:00:29	@buttonista Cheers, hun! Although that is my favourite bagel of ever! I thank my Jewish ex-gf for that one!

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 22:35:04	@moritherapy I'm all crazy. On Twitter, on someone's blog, on my own. Lord.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 22:34:04	@moritherapy I need tea though (as you know I drink vats?) so it'll take a bit. I haven't even had any and oh my the time! Been up for ages!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 22:31:56	@moritherapy okay via e.

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 22:12:30	@MrsCupidStunt ...Cha Cha Cha... Sorry, feel free to slap me.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 22:10:59	@TeenagersWithAS Just thought I'd say hi and welcome to Twitter. Thanks for the follow. Check out my blog if you want but it's crazy!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 22:01:25	I just received a Follow from "TWA." For a moment I thought Howard Hughes had risen from the dead and was now on Twitter.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 21:07:25	@spectrumdweller Awww...I never know what to say to people when my posts make them cry. I guess it just affects them somehow so thanks?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 20:59:05	@buttonista *wee morning wake up smile* Could I have cream cheese, lox and capers, too? The only way to go! xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 05:28:25	I'm being a total idiot. I should go eat. I meant to do that when I got up but...yeah. I got too absorbed in waiting for nothing to change.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 05:21:48	@TriniGirlBlue Ok well safe driving!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 05:13:43	@TriniGirlBlue So how are you hun?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 05:13:27	@TriniGirlBlue Oh! You're at a bank? I thought you were meeting someone famous as you sounded so excited. I guess banking is fun there? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 05:10:21	@TriniGirlBlue Fair to maudlin. Trying to read you and figure out what you're doing. In line for something? Maybe shouldn't bug you now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 05:07:38	@TriniGirlBlue Hey.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 05:06:28	Is Twitter really quiet today or is just my imagination? Scratch that. I don't want to think I'm imagining things. #imtooscaredtobeparanoid
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 05:01:11	@spectrumdweller nothing and go into complete recovery mode. I've been doing that a lot lately so maybe I can hang out with you in spirit?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 05:00:08	@spectrumdweller brutality like this just whacks us so hard sometimes that is all we can do. Take whatever time to do something, anything
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 04:58:10	@spectrumdweller and relax (I know easier said than done) and just take care of you. Just try and fuzz out and recover from this. When
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 04:55:58	@spectrumdweller Oh, wow. I just read all of your Tweets. Idk the history of the job etc. but I am SO sorry for your day and all of it! Try
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 03:54:14	Ah, nice long hot shower. Laundry? Maybe I've enough of water for now. Except to drink it. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 03:06:06	Goodbyes can still be difficult even if you don't always know the people that well.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 03:02:46	I think we understood each other a bit well. From my understanding he'd suffered some brain injuries.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 03:01:08	There is some sadness now that he's gone. We didn't talk much but got on well. I gave him a hug and a kiss goodbye. Tenant left today.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 02:56:35	Ugh. I need a break. I can't even believe what time it is. Holy.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-02 02:23:12	@MarcyRubin Thanks for the #FF I had to mess and republish so the last link via Twitter is dead and gone. This one up is the fixed.

16253011	patientanon	2010-10-01 05:58:29	Crap, Emergency Preparedness! <hushed voice in background: "Don't Panic PA.."> I gotta start contacting people? *winces*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-01 05:57:00	*entire body tenses up with stress*
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-01 05:56:17	Could this day have become any more bizarre? Wait. Not over yet. What's the date? Oh, man! No, if it happens not on same day! Trash! Boxes!
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-01 05:52:04	@YogaChicky @catatonickid Oops. Sorry. Was trying to go for comedic value. You know. Dogs always biting postmen? Going "Postal?" Okay. Bad.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-01 03:55:56	@YogaChicky @catatonickid Postman Terminates Sadistic Dog
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-01 03:42:38	I seriously cannot remember when I last felt so tired (and wasn't sick.) I know why though. If I wasn't so tired I'd write a post? Tomorrow?
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-01 02:01:12	RT @catatonickid : Punk Teens Stab Desks @patientanon @YogaChicky ;) / Well done. Again, I'm up to challenge, just slow (to write) today.
16253011	patientanon	2010-10-01 01:49:27	@YogaChicky @catatonickid Pretty Tiring Stupid Dung *rolls eyes* Don't worry. Can do much better! Just not been online.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 07:09:15	Ok gotta go. Feeling all blah and blech and stuff.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 07:08:41	@YogaChicky @catatonickid No seriously. Drank the most obnoxiously expensive Cognac and tasted like Turpentine.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 07:07:38	*unpause*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:59:27	*PA sets self on pause*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:58:56	@OneWriter ok. you rest case i rest head *clunk*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:58:16	@YogaChicky @catatonickid Ouch! Evil flashback? Turpentine makes me think of drinking Cognac.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:57:12	@YogaChicky @catatonickid Well Maybe not SUPER EPIC FAIL OF THE UNIVERSE DUE TO MEMORY completely. I was out. May just take the 'morrow?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:55:57	@OneWriter fucked back then
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:55:48	@OneWriter about that so we can glean. At least he was honest so we can get somewhat(?) of an accurate picture. Not to mention medicine was
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:55:05	@OneWriter produced awesome stuff that HE loved as his work but afterward he did go through a lot of pain and illness--yet he still wrote
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:54:09	@OneWriter Dostoyevsky was a v. interesting and sad but wow artist and case of...we can only look in hindsight. He LOVED his seizures and
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:52:42	Uh oh. Speaking of SUPER EPIC FAIL OF THE UNIVERSE DUE TO MEMORY acronyms for @YogaChicky and uh yeah @catatonickid too?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:50:48	@OneWriter PFFFFFFFTTTTTT!!!!! I'm SUPER EPIC FAIL OF THE UNIVERSE because I can't even remember what day it is! So there!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:49:00	@OneWriter Oh please! Do you think I have every book memorized on my bookshelves? Pfft. Stop it.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:47:48	@OneWriter Now I can make a joke about me being "The Idiot" re: Dostoyevsky because he and I had epilepsy! so I'M an idiot! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:46:05	@OneWriter No! You're not an idiot! I was TRYING very hard to MAKE you guess I was Roquentin by reading Sartre's Nausea!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:43:43	@OneWriter *laughs* Yes they are my real feet and that is my steth. Yes, Dr PA has a steth and a BP Cuff. Of course! I took the pic recently
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:40:43	@OneWriter You have to scroll way down because of Widgets and Real Estate but look beside Dr. PAs feet LOL Under "Bless My Stims!"
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:38:38	@OneWriter That's okay. Monsieur Antoine Roquentin! I'm kind of thinking it's NOT something I should be reading right now how much I AM him!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:36:00	@OneWriter Then if you can see my blog, you will see what I am reading now and thus, who I now am...Antoine...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:35:07	@OneWriter Yes but my protagonist. Who have I become? The character of the novel I am reading. Indeed!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:33:30	@OneWriter ...the texture of the stone when I picked it up...all of the sudden...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:31:50	@OneWriter Any idea? No cheating my looking on my blog. and I know you can't read your e. but I always put my current read on my blog.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:31:00	@OneWriter nowhere. I am both well and sick. However ultimately, I am "Nauseated."
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:30:05	@OneWriter Yes I know. I mentioned here earlier that I AM becoming the protagonist of the novel that I am reading now! I am both here and
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:26:34	@OneWriter You see? Two "even's" Most imcommunicable and well at least got that out? Strange word.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:25:36	@OneWriter Thanks altho don't think I could even write it even at this point.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:24:57	@OneWriter LOL Oh dear. V. tired though. Funny. Did eat and stuff. Shopped. Idk?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:22:07	@OneWriter Just kidding. Oh my day. all it was.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:21:44	@OneWriter Minutiae.Minutiae.Minutiae.Minutiae.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:18:42	Minutiae.Minutiae.Minutiae.Minutiae.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:17:42	@OneWriter Heh. V. tired. Weird w/ J. But was tired from when I got up. He lives further from me and why am I typing this minutiae? Tired.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:10:19	Why am I so tired? Ah, right! I was supposed to be relaxing today!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:05:00	@Tigerbean Yes. PB cookies are great. Unfortunately my time has run out for baking but I did shop and pick up cookies nonetheless.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:04:08	@OneWriter Yes. Eating (when I can or give a good attempt) would be fun. People watching. Also fun.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:03:00	@catatonickid I put on iPod when in backyard. Sure. Why is construction work tracking me like I have a GPS?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-30 06:01:58	@catatonickid Just home. Still going. Also everywhere I was out today. At least guy nice when I am in backyard and says want me to stop?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 23:45:10	@Tigerbean Oh, I just thought I'd follow up re: the message. It was from the JDP. I didn't want to leave you hanging or anything. LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 23:44:22	@EnigmaAnonymous *more hugs back*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 23:39:59	@EnigmaAnonymous YW. Hugs back. You're not bad in any way.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 23:39:28	@Aliquant LOL Well that's okay too then. I think "blaming" it all on my meds is a bit too much of an excuse as well. I'm dumb as well. Yeah.

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:36:35	@YogaChicky kick in more time but let's see...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:36:23	@YogaChicky LOL. Well, not LOL at cruel trick. Your acronym is good. I just woke up about 45min. ago so I think I need tea and Concerta to
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:35:16	@YogaChicky Well, no. Breaking up with anyone could be a trigger. I'm minimizing cutting. That's not good.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:34:45	@YogaChicky Although I do remember date of first cutting. On Valentine's Day after being dumped by someone! Cue: Violins.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:34:01	@YogaChicky came up with an new acronym/name. I can't keep track of dates really with all my diagnoses! Every day would be an anniversary!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:33:15	@YogaChicky *nods* PTSD...I'm going to come up with a new acronym for that one. I did for the Atypicals the for first time I tried them, or
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:31:09	@YogaChicky to understand I feel as you have to live it. I know we all feel that way but I just feel PTSD is brutal
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:30:20	@YogaChicky Yes hun. Kudos for speaking up as well. It encourages others out there and does give them hope. PTSD is one of the harder ones
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:28:54	@EnigmaAnonymous NO! You are not a mistake and a failure. No! No! No! xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:28:21	@YogaChicky Oh hun! Was not up/online yet so reading all of this about 5yrs made me SO happy! *huge crazy rolling all over yoga mat hugs* xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:18:46	*waiting for nausea to pass before making cuppa* I AM becoming the protagonist of my current read! I knew it all along!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 21:13:15	@OneWriter Thanks. a) I can't sleep during the day unless in REALLY rough shape and b) seeing J. for lunch to day. Le sigh...

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 20:57:06	Neighbour contractor hammering again too loudly in the morning. I am awake after not much and really bad sleep. Feel like poo.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 20:55:35	@spectrumdweller spin. Food Banks, where do I live, gov't peanut money...prob why my head exploded over last few days. Like whoa explosion.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 20:54:43	@spectrumdweller is between now and OMFG it's right now! Never had to wade through gov't assistance for disabled it's just making my head
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 20:53:38	@spectrumdweller Thanks. I know you've had it rough for a while too. So far not "dire" or idk crap! That's the problem. Idk where the line
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 07:00:09	Should.Eat. Should.Move. Should.Sign.Off. Bye.Bye.I.Guess. *closes eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 06:58:19	Now probably best to not think about being homeless (and tomorrow looking at any other "stuff.") Or try. You have at least "tried" today.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 06:56:28	Ok you are not going to be homeless in 24 hours so probably be best to stop looking at "homeless stuff." At least you looked. More tomorrow?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 04:51:50	Ha Ha! Ratings? Sorry Everyone!: http://wp.me/p3M8c-1aA

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:58:03	@catatonickid Good. Giggling is always important despite whatever condition we are in from the neck up! xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:55:33	@catatonickid I didn't even say "Neuro Plasticity!" Maybe I already have too much neuro plasticity. My issue completely. *nods* QED!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:54:13	@catatonickid Oh proof of uber-duhness. That would qualify as cognitive infrastructure. Right...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:53:25	@catatonickid holiding out for entire brain plasticity. Nice organic approach to "mend ourselves" but I'll be dead long before that concept!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:52:42	@catatonickid Good idea but with our semi-functioning brains may have a problem. Can't get past first draft of plan? *smirk* I'm still
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:48:02	@catatonickid Ditto! Always head above water, quicksand, uh, anything above...thoughts just derailed (again.)
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:43:17	@catatonickid Oops. not "backfire" Fire back. Brain not fully functional yet. Or ever...?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:42:28	@catatonickid would stump me with some good ones! I'd have to go running to look them up! I'd backfire from a pretty good reference I have.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:41:41	@catatonickid Yes still tend to use lots of idioms from the UK tho not sure if that much of my readership is still there. Way back they
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:37:56	@catatonickid Someone before told me who was Scots that "pants" mean "bullshit" as in: "Oh, that's just pants!" Pants really called trousers
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:32:40	@catatonickid I know sounds naughty but was for comfort! I swear! But there is the "rule" of "PANTS OFF!" for #LOFNOTC hehe
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:31:43	@catatonickid That happened again recently. I just took the damn "hot pants" off! Working on computer with no pants!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-29 00:30:54	@catatonickid LOL. I did take them off for sleep and so far my bladder is okay? Reminded me of the "hot pants" using baby MacBook before.

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-24 20:40:53	@SpiritOfAutism I knew the movie of course and it was a free download from the movie's website. I just had to go hunting for the tracks.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-24 20:40:10	@SpiritOfAutism That's funny. Something similar happened to me when I downloaded a soundtrack to a movie. All in Korean Characters O.o

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-23 22:04:37	@SpiritOfAutism basically scan and look for the songs even if burned. Sometimes it can't and will just list numbered tracks.

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-23 21:22:49	@SpiritOfAutism Are they burned songs? From the soundtrack presumably? Dumb question I know but yes?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-23 00:49:26	@SpiritOfAutism I could be totally wrong on that. I have no clue atm. So many songs.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-23 00:40:56	@SpiritOfAutism I should just get the full OST! Kanno's work is bloody award winning anyway and Bebop's known for it anyway!

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-22 22:29:02	I just realized why I was choking on my clothes. Typical Aspie? Put outer layer on backwards! *rolls eyes* #asperger 's #autism #sensory
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-22 22:19:54	I have now carefully opened my "Big Pharma Tea" from China. It looks like birdseed. It smells like ginger, cinnamon and chicken.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-22 22:11:34	@gggallery Upon reading your question my new goal is to try & give up all prior goals for personal gain. However, we all "gain" something!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-22 22:04:42	My "Big Pharma Tea" from China also makes a type called "Special Gunpowder China Green Tea - Temple of Heaven Brand." Just me or kinda...?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-22 21:36:12	Just put on fleece top with shirt underneath. Now feel like I'm choking to death! Change clothes? #asperger 's #autism #sensory

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-22 06:14:42	yes i knew today was going to be a very hard day but how much can you prepare yourself for "very hard?"
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-22 06:09:07	@YogaChicky plus the rest of the day just went on and on to deal with the history of it all. it's no wonder i finally came home and went pow

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-22 04:43:00	Isn't it so funny. Well not. You focus on what you must do and then when the walls come down, no more focus, PTSD silently awaits...bang!

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-18 04:47:25	Okay. Let the Gravol Festivities begin! My flat is very small and I lost my water bottle walking around. It took me quite a while to find it
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-18 03:24:18	@readheadgirl Thanks for the #FF
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-18 01:27:05	Another List of "Brain Blogs!": http://wp.me/p3M8c-19K
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 22:55:27	@berrioed TY I try to be as funny as I can.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 22:55:10	PA=Sneezy Dwarf! But PA always=Dopey Dwarf!!! I think PA=All Dwarfs...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 22:52:02	I have no clue how much I have sneezed in the last day. At least 50 times. That may not sound huge but I never sneeze. I'm not stopping too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 08:32:39	I have PTSD. So is it funny or not that the button on my remote control to go back to the last channel is called "Flashback?" #ptsd #irony
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 08:16:50	@MindInFlux Oh I could but I never do that! I always impulsively fly by the seat of my pants! And get into trouble! So in even asking? Good?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 08:13:23	What kind of post could I write where I wouldn't get into trouble considering my altered state. Because I really could get into trouble!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 08:10:28	I want to write a blog post but I don't think that would be wise right now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 08:08:59	@OneWriter Thanks and yes have a good night, sleeps dreams etc...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 08:08:36	Goodbye dear Spaz you SPAZ O.o! Love, PA SPAZ O.o *trashes Spaz*

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 08:03:12	I'm not usually this out of it on Gravol and Valium. It's because I'm so sick. I'm already out of it so this is a new level of out of it.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 08:01:58	Wow. I just realized I've been wearing a ball cap for about 45min. I didn't think I even had anything on my head LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 08:00:23	@asdquefty I think SPAZ O.o PA may have to say goodby to her SPAZ O.o Spaz! *frowns* Ah, shitty app. anyway. Just a good name!

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 07:56:41	@YogaChicky Ta hon. Relieved at least that they brought me the OTC stuff that I need more except that one refill!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 07:53:42	Spaz is being totally SPAZZY!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 07:37:41	@asdquefty Cool again!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 07:32:06	@OneWriter LOL... just no Beach Boys in the background. Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 07:31:20	@OneWriter HAHA. Spaz is being Spazzy again. Had to update Air. Harrumph. Not this again.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 07:27:13	Oh my. I am quite medicated. I almost spilled water all over my mobile. Oops. We're riding the Gravol/Valium Wave right now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 07:22:20	W00t! BIG bag of meds! It's like Christmas for the mentally ill!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 07:10:40	@readheadgirl Loved what you screamed at Twitter by the way. About it's face. Haaaahhh...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 07:08:42	I'm back and appropriately using this app.! SPAZ O.o You see, the app. even says it for me!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 05:28:29	@Aliquant No worries hon. I always try to be of service! Whenever! Wherever!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 05:22:52	@Aliquant Okie. Just checking. I'm not that tech savvy anyway but thought I'd offer.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 05:20:07	@serialinsomniac Have a good night and hope you can gt some sleep! x
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 05:16:42	@Aliquant Are you still having trouble? Do you need any help? I can try?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 05:08:47	@Aliquant May I make a suggestion just based upon my usage of memory sticks? They are preformatted with their own software. Nothing needed?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 05:07:49	@readheadgirl I was going to say I didn't even need to click the link to know that. Well, I will say it.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 05:00:23	@hidama Well hang on. No pr0n crap
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 04:59:34	@hidama That's a good question. I Google everything!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 04:51:18	Okay, cool @AspiePenguin The pharmacy delivery guy would take one look at you and definitely be O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 04:41:07	HAHAHA! @AspiePenguin Thanks for druggin' me up at least dude! I can't wait until the pharmacy delivers the goods so you can gimme more!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 04:29:24	*takes Gravol immediately knowing more is on the way!!!*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 04:28:41	*bows down to pharmacy for delivering everything I need and billing me later*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 04:03:33	@OneWriter ok don't worry
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 04:03:09	@OneWriter sorry i meant clear foods in that you can basically see through them but still have to be careful of acid content like fruits
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 04:01:28	@OneWriter no nothing that isn't clear except BRAT banansas rice applesause toast clear can be jam just clear solids
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:59:33	@OneWriter or just clear duh
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:59:19	@OneWriter Don't have much else that's clear fluids either but do have rice that's part of acronym.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:58:09	@OneWriter Was thinking or some toast and jam. Because of years of tummy troubles been on BRAT diet more times than you can count!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:44:18	@OneWriter Yes if they don't I'll call them back.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:30:36	@OneWriter Well, Iculd call Grocery Man. Granted my pharacy is wicked. I'm just waiting for a call as they're doing pharmacist shift change.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:25:42	@OneWriter later or maybe write a cheque. holy shit.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:25:25	@OneWriter cough medicine, Gravol, okay for oain meds I think? Will check. No money though as haven't been to bank. I'm always there so pay
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:24:34	@OneWriter Not so much. Waiting for my pharmacy to call. I need a script anyway but going to ask for some OTC stuff as getting sicker. Need
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:16:06	Is this godawful thing airborne through the vents? All three of us tenants are coughing and WTF? Now all stuffy head and barfy. OMG.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:07:12	*prays pharmacy will send list of goods I can't even pay for and run me a tab*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:05:40	*prays pharmacy will send list of goods soon*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 03:02:16	*dies*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 00:05:30	SWAG: Bacronym meaning possibly Stuff We All Get or Souvenirs, Wearables, and Gifts.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-17 00:00:34	@OneWriter SWAG has been driving me nuts for years. Oh, FINALLY something on that thar intarweb! Here we go! It could mean a few things.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:47:52	@OneWriter soft fabric frisbee! it has a more firm edge and flies like crazy.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:42:35	@OneWriter I have this neat piece of SWAG from work (btw does anyone know what that means or where the expression came from?) that's this
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:37:47	@OneWriter Non-injurious objects when no one in room and no injury to self? Ok. However injury to anyone=self-harm. Or other-harm. Not good.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:36:20	@OneWriter I still don't recommend hitting firm and dangerous objects with your hand to release emotional tension. That is self-harm.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:34:57	@OneWriter Like punched a brick wall. Massive swelling and huge healing time for that one. Probably some broken bones there. Ahem.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:34:13	@OneWriter few tiny bones over time but not enough to do serious damage.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:33:51	@OneWriter Well in confession (mayb not! on my blog? see not thinking...duh) I have punched walls myself out of self-harm. Probably broken a
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:32:43	@OneWriter Well, for therapy punching pillows? Or primal scream? Latter makes me laugh!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:32:00	@OneWriter Sorry can't think not "regularly." I mean throwing things overall. I see it as not a nice thing to do.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:31:24	@OneWriter Well any "throwy toys" are okay but I don't like throwing regularly as I see it as kind of violent. *shrug*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:29:49	@OneWriter for any belly fun. I do have some toys I could play with? Maybe some stimming that wouldn't require too much energy LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:29:02	@OneWriter in stim (ADD meds) but in terms of Aspie stimming? Too tired to stim! That is very sad. I don't throw things. No one is with me
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:28:02	@OneWriter LOL I never know how I feel (regardless of sickness) until I've been awake for a while. Valium decision later. I meant my meds as
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:25:01	@OneWriter Oh, and the Buckley's has one of the worst websites known to the Internet! It is from Canada (this I knew) and says in US but idk
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:23:52	@spectrumdweller Was that your dream? All that you wrote there?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:19:52	@OneWriter my pants? I don't like to whine as I'm not one of those "babies" when I'm sick. No. It's just I don't know what to do with myself
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:19:02	@OneWriter can't "do" anything. Reading is out, writing is DEFINITELY out. Even movies?! Maybe take a Valium to get rid of extreme ants in
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:18:07	@OneWriter can't concentrate (get's out of control like I'm not even on my stims) so I'm restless as hell. I just go out of my mind as I
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:16:30	@OneWriter Yeah we'll see where my head goes. I'm insane when I'm sick as I'm so tired (good body fighting infection) but I can't sleep. I
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:01:31	@OneWriter Should make tea now. Eating has been a challenge due to being sick. Finally some stuff yesterday but not sure if it made me worse
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 23:00:20	@OneWriter know stuff from my sister so it's hard. Just sort of waiting for good ol' PTSD Pandora's Box to open? I don't worry. I know enuf.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:59:21	@OneWriter Yeah. Non-bio dad is well beyond ding-a-ling! LOL OMG. Stupid fucker! I can only remember things as an adult/teen/sorta too. Only
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:57:49	@OneWriter my commenters can say whatever too. I don't censor anyone!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:57:17	@OneWriter post about me so ppl can say whatever? Hell ppl can comment and say WFT? PA you're a ding-a-ling! I don't care! I say what I want
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:56:25	@OneWriter Haha not "debate" just discussion of ideas and thoughts. More because I don't always make myself clear on my blog? Also pesonal
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:53:17	@OneWriter Can't remember where it's sold *runs to website*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:52:58	@OneWriter Too long for Twitter of course but i could tell you via email *rolls eyes*

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:51:47	@OneWriter Your blog comment (my response) is really crazy. I need tea as it's all over. You and I are kind of debating LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:50:58	@OneWriter Not literal crap but burning and minty from menthol and camphor and maybe just a weird strong element from the bicarbs and carbs?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:49:57	@OneWriter since stopped talking to non-bio dad. He is evil in things he has done. To sister and I and even more ppl (suspected from my part
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:49:06	@OneWriter Well A VERY FEW ppl are ok on non-bio dad's side but rest are mean hypocritical assholes. Don't talk to them. Haven't in 3.5yrs
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:48:12	@OneWriter like crud to post people but works AWESOME!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:47:55	@OneWriter people HATING the taste! Here are the ingredients: potassium bicarb, ammonium carb, menthol camphor. So no sugary crap. Tastes
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:46:25	@OneWriter Buckley's is a cough medicine. Guess it's not sold where you are. Has basically natural or raw chemical ingredients and known for

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:43:49	@OneWriter Oh you know my sense of humour is so twisted. I had a cousin (well I still have her as a cousin!) that I liked (well she's still
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:38:43	@OneWriter Well, I'm totally dying of Ebola or something so inside atm. If better would try to get out as NEED BUCKLEY'S!!! Other stuff too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 22:35:55	@OneWriter Hey, just replying to you comment in my semi-awake state. The Squddles are waging massive battle in the rain today.

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 01:08:33	@pianomaths Good stuff! Mine's just trying to be helpful with job jazz but doesn't understand.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 00:58:58	@pianomaths Sounds like we are trying to both teach our Mommies things they no very little about?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 00:55:51	*explaining possible example of Health Informatics and EMR Management to Mommy*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-16 00:44:12	@maialideth HA! Exactly. My pitching arm is terrible so I had to resort the mail. Wetty bubble wrap.

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-15 23:24:24	Why is it I make just one bit of progress in my life then contract an evil virus the next day? Woke up on death's door yesterday.

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-14 04:48:49	I need a break. When did I last take one? I should shut up. The last three Tweets are mine.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-14 04:47:41	You did good today PA. You really did. *laughs and attempts to pat self on back*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-14 04:46:56	Okay. Fair enough. "Whatever" wasn't built in a day. I just need it be! *sighs*

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-13 22:52:58	Another day, another who knows what. Guess I'd better get the tea going to find out.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-13 22:11:31	@OneWriter LOL Well I feel sorry about the rest of my life... j/k. Maybe.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-13 22:06:59	@OneWriter Oh the phisihing? I just got up a bit ago. I'm all stupid and duh. It's okay. Quite funny, really.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-13 22:05:47	@OneWriter Sorry about what? Or should I say what part of my life? *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-13 21:58:02	Got a response to job application yesterday! W00t! It was a stupid phishing scam! Yay.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-13 21:55:51	@EnigmaAnonymous OH! You are NOTHING to put up with! And how funny your Google hit found me! Guess my blog does well in the SEO dept. LOL xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-13 00:05:21	@OneWriter at least it may not take too long maybe to end it again with all of my med costs. Deductible decided by program.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-13 00:04:08	@OneWriter can't even do anything in the meantime as my med costs are outrageous. I do have a monthly deductible from the program but
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-13 00:03:09	@OneWriter would be a problem. Idk if it's only for those of us completely unemployed or if you can still work to some degree. If not I
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-13 00:01:57	@OneWriter *nods* I had/have been thinking of something now temp./contract but need to check my stoopid guvmunt drug coverage to see if that
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 23:53:12	@BlueHaredGalPal Sounds awesome. I hope all goes well. Be crossing fingers for you.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 23:52:22	@OneWriter Like said, tried to accomplish too much. Just exhausted now. Will see how I feel a bit later. Jobs got me down too more I looked.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 23:46:53	@BlueHaredGalPal What's your audition?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 23:46:24	@OneWriter Hope the writing goes well. I did some last too (or tried) emailed family (kinda tough there) job stuff. Pushed too hard now whoa
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 23:10:36	I either have an eyelash in my eye or an axe.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 23:05:30	@TheSpindleshay Thanks. I was thinking about it earlier and thought I should tell her anyway. I knew nothing since the meds but the last?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 23:02:33	When emailing my sister yesterday realized my last seizure was mid-July and have had none since upping the Lamictal a month ago! Holy moly.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 22:57:00	I fear I pushed myself too hard yesterday. What a state by the end of the night! Perhaps should rest some today but still need to move ahead
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 22:34:59	@CalliCoop LOL! Well, out of everything only the Gravol made me "WHEEEE". Valium only for anxiety (just calm) and Seroquel for sleep!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 22:32:39	@CorinaBecker @asdquefty That can happen too. Similar to my med redundancy but that's bad as well! No one needs more meds than necessary!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 22:31:13	@asdquefty Fair enough. I was "Anti-AP" for a long time but now I NEED my Seroquel.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 12:16:49	@spectrumdweller gotcha
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 12:16:39	@asdquefty Well idk about antipsychotics for TBIs but hey?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 12:15:57	@CorinaBecker @asdquefty Was on that years ago but stopped as not strong enough over years to battle my insomnia

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 12:12:06	@asdquefty Clon is just as good as the atypicsls. it;s cool.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 12:11:23	Okay every pill taken I have at my disposal to hopefully make me feel like I am not a paralysed crustacean at the bottom of the sea tomorrow
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 12:09:58	@spectrumdweller No, no! Not at all! Depends upon how much vacation time?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 12:05:32	*pondres* I'm actually a wreck all over. Psych, head, tummy...heads off for Gravol, too. Man, could I suck any more? Well, yes. I could!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 12:04:26	@asdquefty *nods*

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 11:53:05	Fear not, it is impossible for me to overdose on my horseloads of Valium in my flat. Even if I remain nevertheless deplorable in all eyes.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 11:50:28	I have also escalated a prn dosage of Valium to a new level of deplorable. Love me or hate me. That is your choice. *takes one more Valium*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 11:45:17	Yes back on. So it would seem. No it would "seem!" I am here. Redundancy is deplorable. I am deplorable. More Valium taken also deplorable!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 11:37:43	@OneWriter Oh hi waves from very afar I guess?

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 00:26:17	It was something about that dream I had that I can't remember this morning. That kick started it all off. Can't do anything about that.

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 00:19:49	@alphabetania No worries. I do know how to do it, just need to get around to doing it. Translation: Get bloody motivated!

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 00:15:09	@spectrumdweller Yep. On the count of three? 1...2...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 00:14:42	This is going to be "one of those days..." It's already started off that way from the second I woke up. *nods* Nothing's gonna go right.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-12 00:13:29	@alphabetania If you ever get your act together about making a video, one step further and actually come tidy my house? Heh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-11 23:48:14	@spectrumdweller Sure! I'm already at the precipice!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-11 22:57:21	@spectrumdweller Thanks hon. I literally just started last night in a fit of sheer terror and panic. I don't know if I can hang on.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-11 10:34:11	Okay, there go PAs eyes, there goes PA! Lots more to go bonkers over tomorrow...*sighs*

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-10 01:50:05	@asdquefty Biphentin for dumb reason so I had to go back on Concerta.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-10 01:49:48	@asdquefty 10mg increments. He didn't want to go concerta 36mg up to 54mg as dumb jump. Not even. Just stoopid guvmunt plan doesn't cover
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-10 01:48:55	@asdquefty Just joke about Concerta because I'm being so slow when I get up. Also dosages range. We also went with Biphentin as ranges were

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-06 01:33:15	@OneWriter Yeah need more caffeine. I'm totally out of it. Have another from cousin way outstanding too but he's a cool cat.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-06 01:10:56	Crap. Should email my mother back today before she thinks I've topped myself and calls Emerg. Services. No. She did before. Bad Scene.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-06 01:09:54	@Tigerbean Yes. My team is pretty good though. Took me years to find them although Merlin #2's been acting weird lately? Idk.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-06 00:58:20	@MelissaMashburn Hi, nice to meet you too!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-06 00:21:54	@CorinaBecker New Zealand
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-06 00:18:00	The wee one next door gonna have craziest accent. Can already hear! Mom def. from UK but dad still so quiet! My odds still say he's from NZ!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 23:28:11	@OneWriter LOL Yeah.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 23:10:00	@OneWriter Thanks. I'd never call anyone a bitch in real life! Well, maybe but they'd have to do something really horrible and mean I'd say.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 23:06:17	@OneWriter @BlueHaredGalPal Oh, no! Was our "posse" and Gay Male Queen" stereotype of being so bitchy. But not all of them so fey. Just joke
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 23:01:44	@OneWriter I always laugh as been told an okay dancer but then said if I ever saw myself in mirror would never dance again! Too horrified!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 23:00:40	@BlueHaredGalPal Ok. We were funny. True bitchy Queens. All addicted, then SO BORING never going back. Then couple weeks later oh! oh! BACK!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:58:55	Oh dear lord. Now I'm having problems manipulating my mouse. Maybe I should just bo back to bed and stare at my ceiling for a while.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:57:21	@BlueHaredGalPal Hey, what deserved my lol? Being tired, not being able to type, not being able to log in or gay clubbing? Or all?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:56:22	@OneWriter too but they were straight so I guess the Fag Hags? I always went out though, they weren't as regular in attendence.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:55:50	@OneWriter Hey listen. With my gay male posse, if I was straight I would have been the biggest Fag Hag going! Some other girls came with us
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:52:41	@OneWriter I like to sit back and people watch--for everything, not just dancing. fascinating and fun.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:52:19	@OneWriter But if my lovely lady (if I had one HA!) would like to dance then I most certainly would indulge her. Oh, yes!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:51:42	@OneWriter I don't dance anymore. So much gay clubbing years ago. Might I add, bay men are SO much better (and more fun) that women LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:50:46	OMG. I can't even find where to log in to my own blog! Going to be BAD day ahead... Want to take sleep made right now. All over again.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:47:26	@OneWriter Also tired for sure ans typos aboud.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:47:13	@OneWriter See so out of it I just sent you that as a bloody DM! *crosses eyes* Sorry no dancing...oh, dear god now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:46:41	@OneWriter Just got up. Rough night. Up and down until 0300hrs? Took Valium at 0330hrs to try and squeeze a bit more sleep out of morning.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:41:09	RT @asdquefty : @patientanon Return To The Heart ♫ http://bit.ly/9qLWcW / I know you love that one I put up. Me too. Makes my heart melt. OX
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:39:27	@Tigerbean Indeed. I don't think I can get rid of mine. Certainly not the ADD and the Asperger's. Developmental Disorders so born with them!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 22:38:10	@asdquefty @MelissaMashburn Oh, hello. Nice to meet you as I was mentioned here.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 08:11:38	Tummy Treason and Meal Malfeasance: http://wp.me/p3M8c-199
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 06:24:19	@readheadgirl Yep! The two things that you'll never see a writer without!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 06:21:39	@readheadgirl thanks hon. maybe not so bad as all writers need the tools! plus all writers need editors? ha! i'm a good editor too though!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 06:20:37	@readheadgirl Oh yeah, I've certainly had enough head injuries for a lifetime too!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 06:19:47	@readheadgirl mean how to spell. ARGH! I question whether my epilepsy has affected my memory at times. Like I said has my brain melted?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 06:19:03	@readheadgirl meds also do a number on me as Anticonvulsants make you outright stoopid. It's a sad thing for a writer to forget what words
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 06:18:23	@readheadgirl *nods* Well I know for me one big this was the ADD hitting me full on in my teens. It still has a gross impact to this day. My
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 06:12:29	@readheadgirl Although I think I prob. understood the Shakespeare better as a kid than now that my brain's melted so much over the years!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 06:11:11	@readheadgirl Can you say Aspie or what?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 06:10:58	@readheadgirl I never was into fairy tales but I've been a non-fic reader my entire life. Went on to Shakespeare and uni. texts by 10yrs old
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 06:07:10	@readheadgirl Yes! That and Dictionary! My two favourite books as a child! Still are? When I was may 6yrs old would sit and read Dictionary!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:58:06	*reaches for thesaurus out of sheer boredom much less creativity*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:54:30	Crap. Today it's gone from summer to fall overnight! Lucky I didn't get a migraine. Oops. Maybe I shouldn't have typed that.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:50:41	@OneWriter That's cool. A lot of places where I live are very laid back plus I don't care who I talk to about being mental so all good.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:45:27	@OneWriter have problems with the Dyscalculia so the servers are cool if I stand there forever or they even help me. YW for e.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:44:41	@OneWriter Yes having people with you that can help with the math is always good. Granted, with folks in my neighbourhood they all know I
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:27:12	@pianomaths Oh, please. If you REALLY knew my problems with impulse control? Re-opening a link in a browser is nuttin'!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:26:22	@MindInFlux Thanks for the RT!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:23:56	@pianomaths Indeed. The blogger who originally sent it to me I think has totally left the blogosphere too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:23:10	Loses all impulse control and re-opens http://bit.ly/2yVUUD in tab... I can't help it!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:21:30	@shiv379 it running all the time at work (when still working) Folks in my dept. were WHAA?!?! WHOO!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:20:45	@shiv379 I know. I had it running for a long time and finally forced myself to close the tab. I fighting not to open it again! Used to have
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:19:31	@MindInFlux Hey, it's not "limited" to Aspie/Spectrum" enjoyment (or loathing) but if they find it a good Stim just curious. But yes cool.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:17:42	@shiv379 Thanks for the RT. It is the AWESOMENESS isn't it?!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:17:02	@OneWriter Hey my Dyscalculia is so bad I have extreme difficulties filling out my restaurant bills!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:13:44	@pianomaths Cool. One comment so far! I leapt so far in the air with Absolute Aspie Joy when it was sent to years ago!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:08:55	Okay, you'll love it or hate it? Aspie and Spectrum folks? Give me your Stim Votes: http://bit.ly/2yVUUD
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:06:25	OH! Speaking of "Perpetual!" I totally forgot the AWESOMENESS! Sent to me on my blog AGES ago! STIM FEST! http://bit.ly/2yVUUD
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 05:01:39	@OneWriter Ah, forget it. I'm in a perpetual time warp anyway. It could be Saturday EVERY DAY for all I know!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 04:59:50	@OneWriter Wait. My Dyscalculia is REALLY bad but if we both flew BACK to another continent from where we both are we'd lose a day?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 04:58:42	@OneWriter *nods* Not so dizzy anymore. Sure. We could go see a flick. Who's flying where? It won't be Saturday after that though.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 04:53:58	I should get around to writing a bloody blog post. Been a while. Well, I've been sick. Starting to get better. Idk. LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 04:52:00	@OneWriter Ah, no everything is fine. Walked in with huge list and just a few things owing (like some pills of full refill) so all good.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 04:47:09	Oh, it's Saturday today. I thought it was Sunday. SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 04:45:59	@OneWriter Huh? Confused. I got all the scripts filled except some still owing as not all in stock.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 04:42:44	@OneWriter Yes I'm feeling a bit better. no gravol yet? Also no choice about pharmacy as out of Seroquel. No Seroquel? No sleep.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 04:34:57	@asdquefty Sure enough. The last one I went to was awesome as well but had to leave due to convenience as well.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 04:14:23	@Tigerbean Absolutely! I'm so disordered the list is pretty unbelievable. Well, just so many diagnoses. Not sure if crazier than most.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 04:13:10	@CorinaBecker @asdquefty That's cool. A good way to kill time.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 04:12:48	@asdquefty I know Thistle! Exact brought me a kilt pin when I asked when he came to visit. A really nice one with a thistle on it!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 03:59:18	@asdquefty Dr. Plaid! Classic! Love it!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 03:58:58	@asdquefty *nods* and as per your DM I'm on eight meds in total. And yes, I have a very hard time remembering them all LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 03:56:36	@CorinaBecker Yep. That's cool.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 03:56:22	@asdquefty @CorinaBecker I've also called in before and had them deliver if I've been sick though. And okay, drop off pick up later LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 03:55:42	@asdquefty @CorinaBecker For convenience as mine is close by I just pop in and wait. Though I can be really dumb run out and have to go NOW!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 03:48:57	@CorinaBecker Heh. Well my pharmacy is ace. I'm such a regular there too! You call me a "med fly" not a "bar fly!"
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 03:37:29	Back from pharmacy! Refilled EVERY med but Concerta. So, seven refills. Took poor guy 20 min. Yes, I take a lot of meds. I'm crazy.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-05 00:01:47	Okay up and moving about. If I can make it to the pharmacy and back all good. Well no choice. Out of Seroquel! Wonder Cane's coming with me!

16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 04:08:34	listening to "Mary Black - No Frontiers" ♫ http://blip.fm/~vpnlh
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 04:08:01	@OneWriter yes although i don't do that nearly enough
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 04:04:29	@OneWriter was thinking of blip? way to amuse myself? when sick just laying around makes me frustrated but limited concentration does too!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 03:58:38	i don't think i can write in this altered state that is more a perpendicular universe...that keeps turning into a rotating trapezoid.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 02:46:10	@OneWriter thanks. still have that one dose of seroquel so just have to deal with it tomorrow
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 02:25:16	some gravol induced writing or editing? wait let's see if i can get my head out this vise. advil... this is completely redonculous.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 01:38:09	ok let's take the gravol and see if that helps! yeah right! think i'd better stay home. oh my goodness.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 01:28:40	@OneWriter Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 01:26:23	What's happening? I wasn't this bad when I got up. I even had cereal.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 01:03:32	Actually one night left of Seroquel. May save me? Plus pouring rain out. PA pass out? But need stuff from store! Pharmacy open late but idk
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 00:49:24	@Canageek See, things not so bad when sitting still but when I get up it's all crazy.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 00:48:19	@Canageek Ugh. I hope so. Wonder Cane? Could call and have delivered but just realized need to pick up something else from another place.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-04 00:41:00	Oh crap I gotta go to the pharmacy to fill scripts. Everything still spinny and nauseous. Can't take Gravol yet as then I'll be paralysed.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:58:21	@YogaChicky LOL Gravol doing pretty good job. For some reason really good job right now. Now entirely sure why...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:56:14	@YogaChicky Fanks! (not a typo always said) Btw haven't googled self in ages! Kind of weird what I'm finding!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:49:28	@YogaChicky Yes but you can at least still understad it. good enough!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:48:51	@YogaChicky Okay WAY out of it! Bad spelling and grammar LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:48:28	@YogaChicky But either way don't make sense? Oh yes, maybe something else too that acid chaine/ read last comment here: http://bit.ly/aiFhyT
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:47:22	@YogaChicky Oh the chemistry thing? Oh yeas! I am all over it with Google now. Could be really bad typo of amino acid chain or a supplement!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:45:13	@YogaChicky Huh? Sorry missed something. Spelling error I made? I can't see because of the Gravol right now haha
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:43:44	@YogaChicky At times? Well at least I know I got out one time so guess I'll have to keep thinking of that. Just so stupid when you do start!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:42:18	@YogaChicky LOL! Funny about Google but it only goes back so far? Then if you click on me takes ppl to my Twitter page where all i gone!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:36:44	@YogaChicky to do job stuff on Tuesday! Then this struck me down yesterday when I was planning 2 do more! Got the gumption than knocked down
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:35:27	@YogaChicky Thanks! This is just some weird viral "thing" I think. More frustrating than usual as I FINALLY got over my fear of heading out
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:03:42	@YogaChicky Now already sick and brain dead and trying to read chemistry for blog comment. Problem. Can't tell what guy is saying as typo?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:02:44	@YogaChicky However, that IS part of the post! Too much time to kill today so will be very tired.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 20:02:11	@YogaChicky LOL! Again, too late now! Although, I do have in mind a bit of a "rant against body" blog post for today. We'll see. Up so early
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:54:46	I am sick though and tummy not happy. I'm not self-medicating!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:54:01	Ugh. Gravol makes you dehydrated and your mouth dry! I am such a Gravol Addict. You guys are going to see me on "Intervention" one day.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:52:48	@YogaChicky Everything stupid, bitchy sounding and ridiculous I said on Twitter last night! *pokes tongue out* Oh should delete this. Rude.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:49:18	@YogaChicky @catatonickid Well, your choice? Can't tell you guys what to do, how to feel, monitor your brains...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:48:25	@YogaChicky Too late! Deletions done! I have broken my "Prime Directive" my blog and Twitter. Pfft. Like my words need to be immortalized?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:44:22	@catatonickid @YogaChicky Thanks hon but I don't (always?) like me come as you are. (I do?)
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:39:13	@YogaChicky Thanks. I think I'll go to my web acct. and have a bit of delete fest now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:37:45	@OneWriter I'm very open on my blog and enjoy feedback from anyone if they have any questions about anything! Why not? I love it!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:36:55	@OneWriter Wow. Thanks for the email! I have no problem talking about my cutting etc... at all. Sure.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:35:24	@YogaChicky Oh I envy those with more "dignity" online. You know I do. I act like a petulant child enough on my blog. You know that too!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:28:25	Oh an email from my mother! This shouls be interesting. I should probably read it later...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:27:25	@asdquefty LOL Well if so then no. Drinking like cough syrup or some thing.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 19:26:31	@YogaChicky I'm still alive. Embarrased this morning, but alive.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 09:58:49	@OneWriter No, being bitchy on Twitter is one thing I am loathe to do. Tired? Yes I guess. Idk. Doesn't matter as meds pretty much knock out
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 09:46:14	@asdquefty ...Think!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 09:45:57	@asdquefty Actually the bed/office/closet/pharmacy is in rather a state of rubble too. Rubble Rubble Everywhere And No Goddamn Way To Think.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 09:44:14	@asdquefty Can't say. Still sitting here staring at all the rubble (that would be inward at the rubble in my own head...)
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 09:40:29	VICTORY IS MINE!!! Well...sort of... *shrugs* Good 'nuff.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 07:39:55	@OneWriter Heh. I am SO not giving up.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 07:28:30	@OneWriter knock yourself out
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 07:26:27	@OneWriter Heh. Prob is same files fixed one codec and other can't do
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 07:16:24	@OneWriter Ditto but I'm stuck with half finished. Technology sucks.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 07:01:13	@OneWriter Ah, once I get into something I can REALLY get into it...christ.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 06:58:58	Only someone this obssessed and with this much ADD hyperfocus *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 06:57:43	Okay let's try this again!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 06:56:20	Goddamn fucking codecs!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 06:47:57	@OneWriter Anyway hardly brain catastrophe neighbourhood so screw it. LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 06:47:22	@OneWriter Yep. I can never sleep during day and unfortunately my brain can wander into both good and BAD neighbourhoods. Whatev.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 06:39:31	@OneWriter Seems so. Was working but not on something anticipated. Then brain went. Now mundane paperwork. Must wait for iPod to charge.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 06:34:08	@OneWriter Thanks. No more tea. Maybe some gravol or something. Bloody gravol addict. And my mind back. Veered off into some direction.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 06:23:35	@OneWriter I have no clue why I'm back. Not much of clue of much. Except I think I need some Advil.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 06:19:25	Wow. I should be resting or should have been. So much for that. Signed off and meant to...why am I back and not resting? Lord.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 00:30:11	@FroggyPrinceMom You're welcome hon.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 00:29:57	*dizzyingly braves walk to kitchen to make another cuppa* *remembers bike in skinny hallway to try not hit and avoid serious injury*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 00:25:31	@FroggyPrinceMom Too bad we didn't live next door or well, somewhere closer. I'd be happy to help wee FP being on the Spectrum myself.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 00:04:20	@alphabetania Oh why thank you. So are you! Did I do anything special to warrant this Tweet? *scratches head*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 00:03:39	@FroggyPrinceMom well and you do too!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 00:03:32	@FroggyPrinceMom Whoa! Coming down from rush and then maybe going back up into another? Get prepared for a roller coaster? I hope he does
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-02 00:02:33	@OneWriter Thanks it's prob not evil & just a passing thing. Irony is maybe picked up yesterday w/ job stuff in this field? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 23:39:58	@FroggyPrinceMom Thanks how are you doing and my wee nephew the beautiful FP?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 23:16:18	@OneWriter Sore throat and just stupid crap. Tired...better set to making my first cuppa.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 23:15:50	@OneWriter LOL! Just barely. Well, I'm vertical but I knew there was one more (at least?) reason I kept trying to stay asleep. A bit sick?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 23:08:00	OH YEAH! I can NEVER hold back when I get those WEIRD unknown Tweets that I KNOW are pr0n sites but I just HAVE to click the links ANYWAY!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 23:05:38	@BlueHaredGalPal Hi nice to meet you. I'm always interested in diff. anime, manga and graphic novels to read. Feel free to toss any at me!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 23:00:11	@FroggyPrinceMom I woke up just a while ago, totally exhausted with a sore throat...just when I was finally getting my shit together (jobs)
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 22:59:21	@shiv379 @spectrumdweller Yes we are the sexy!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:45:45	Exhaustion has struck. Later folks.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:44:51	@OneWriter LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:37:06	*heads off to kitchen to make pasta* Carbs=Good
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:35:55	@OneWriter And yes, food is tough with gastro issues and has been extra tough today while running around all crazy re: job jazz
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:35:07	@OneWriter Yes. No talk of loser. I had this thing going for ages as a hashtag I made up and people I knew got so mad. Just a joke #PAsucks
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:33:55	@OneWriter Oh, here comes the punchiness! I don't even know what to say or how to talk now. Brain go bye bye! Glad you like my music though!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:32:05	I'm starting to reach that stage where I get a little punchy. I'm acting like total loser (no talk about regular behaviour) Tired? Food?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:28:36	@OneWriter You give me too much credit! You're smarter than you think! I think we're all smarter than we think! Minus the real dumbasses LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:15:34	@spectrumdweller I know. Or should say I DON'T know. Would have to dig into the archives...
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:14:45	@OneWriter Yep! s'all good! We'll have lots of fun playing bouncy brain word badminton kick start broken WTF's and more! Bring it on!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:11:35	@spectrumdweller LMAO! Hey, at least it wasn't a BLOG MEME! Can you cut me some slack for that?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:11:00	@spectrumdweller WHEE!!! Another Tweet Lover! I AM a slut.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 07:04:43	@OneWriter Cool. I'm also dumb as a stump too so you'll be pullin' the wool over my eyes frequently. Or not. My eyes will be closed anyway.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:58:09	@OneWriter LOL Told you my sense of humour was a lot of things even stupid? Also, I'm sneaky! Can maybe surprise people with info beforehand
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:55:39	@benpolar your contacts after all!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:55:28	@benpolar a simple program that picks up basic searches like that in a string. Pure dumbness. Not that you don't like the people! They are
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:54:27	@benpolar Based upon the ones in my list they seem to be the most recent folks I've been in contact with. That's usually how they work. Just
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:52:52	@OneWriter Let me guess. One in red shirt. No, I can tell from the link to that one blip. I think?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:49:44	@OneWriter I'm just chillin' on my bed/office/closet/pharmacy with baby MacBook. That "term" is from my blog.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:48:18	@benpolar Oh, that you're my lover? Well, we did kind of "end up in bed" the other day. ROTFLMAO!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:46:15	@OneWriter Idk. What do you look like?
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:43:47	Listening to blip.fm while still having classical radio station on. SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:41:52	@OneWriter Oh yeah...like I'm just THAT hot you know! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:40:23	@OneWriter Not bad. Replied to comment via blog. Actually found two more on foot walking back so need to hit those as well. Tired though.
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:39:26	@OneWriter I had eight lovers so the Tweet was too long to list them all plus the link to the Tweet Lovers app.! Twitter Slut PA!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:34:13	How weird is that Tweet Lovers thing? LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:32:54	My Tweet Lovers: @OneWriter @alphabetania @asdquefty @FroggyPrinceMom @CorinaBecker @shiv379 @benpolar See yours @http://bit.ly/bN5cUW
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 06:30:49	This close to passing out *places thumb and index finger less than 1cm apart*
16253011	patientanon	2010-09-01 00:54:07	Well at Least the Resumes are Done: http://wp.me/p3M8c-193
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 21:58:02	@asdquefty LOL Titrated to 300mg Lamictal from 200mg and now at 200mg Seroquel from 150mg. My brain decided to get ugly. Maybe still is? Idk
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 07:21:18	You just said the wrong thing @AspiePenguin you shit lickin'...
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 07:17:33	Look who's here! It's @AspiePenguin ! He's probably going to just throw me in bed again! Pfft. What he should do is write my fucking speech!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 07:15:45	@asdquefty Thanks hon. You too. Been a while since we talked. I have been on my blog but was pretty wiped from the 2 week Lamictal titration
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 07:06:03	Wow. Retardex just spilled water all over herself! SPAZ O.o #PAsucks
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 07:04:04	Well I guess Retardex should take a Valium to try and get the ants out of her pants! Not another negative term for myself. Another joke here
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 06:57:36	@asdquefty O.o.O O.o.O SPAZ SOS. OX(_) I'm an arse. What time is now? Has the clock struck "I can't stand myself anymore?"
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 06:55:42	@asdquefty or more of major stress that interrupted me going to "promote" my stupid self to these clinics and goddamn it I HAVE to go out!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 06:54:56	@asdquefty Oh yeah? Huh? Well nothing 100% The Tribe is just a message board/fora. Not a pain in the butt bot! I am fuh-reakin'! Had a week
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 06:52:18	@asdquefty I wonder if the AspieTribe bot will pick up my profanity laden Tweet about Aspie SPAZ O.o cold calls!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 06:49:31	@asdquefty LMAO! You sound like me. My ADD kicks me so hard in the arse! I get so engrossed in something and then pfft. There goes that!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 06:48:05	@asdquefty is hiring? And just opened a new clinic downtown? *shaking* As per last Tweet...oh, if I scored a job? *fall over SPAZ O.o*
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 06:47:07	@asdquefty clinic and one place I found where was going to fucking cold call SPAZ O.o SPAZ O.o Can't deal fucking Aspie SPAZ O.o nightmare
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 06:45:56	@asdquefty No worries. Cool about radio. I've just been being my spazzy self too. However, just about fell off bed! Already so spazzy about
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 06:30:25	And try not to throw up in the meantime.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 06:29:47	Could it really happen? Oh dear. To good to be true? No. Just don't think about it. Close the browser tab immediately!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 05:52:24	I have to stop making excuses. I'm the only one that can help me!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 05:42:50	@Tigerbean It's okay if something like that makes you cry. We're all human. We have emotions. Hard to deal with at times but again it's ok?
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 05:40:24	Yep. There you have it. It's not really me "just having one of those days."
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 05:39:23	I think I may be so useless and discombobulated because I need to garner a lot of strength and courage to face serious stuff I just HAVE to.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 05:36:32	@Canageek Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 05:18:24	@Canageek Gotcha. Heh. It is hard for Dr. PA to keep track of all the meds everyone's on. She needs a better filing system LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 05:13:08	@Canageek Taking what? I'm guessing your stims?
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 05:05:00	@alphabetania Thank you again. I'm not sure what to say about that either but maybe people see that coming out on my blog? I am empathetic.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 05:04:03	@alphabetania because I'm an Aspie med geek and also I have a boatload of them that really do affect my life so much.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 05:03:30	@alphabetania Oh! Not so pleasant that! I have been told by a few people that I do focus on my diagnoses too much. Idk what that means tho
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 05:00:36	@alphabetania Indeed. Actually I have a post that's kind of along those lines somewhere on my blog. Prompted by what someone told me as well
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:59:03	@alphabetania Every part of my body IS an unloved orphan abandoned after a war! ROTFLMAO! Told you my sense of humour was warped!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:57:22	I could try and write a blog post but boy would it reek to high heaven with my crazy state of mind right now!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:56:00	@alphabetania Thanks. For the "compliment." *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:54:31	@alphabetania Oh dear! Never been very good at seeing any "beauty" in myself and only now learning to take compliments "graciously?"
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:53:31	@alphabetania Also nothing negative about my self-deprecation my blog. I just have a very, very warped and twisted sense of humour!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:51:58	@alphabetania Oh, please don't worry about the SPAZ O.o thing. That's a long running joke between @asdquefty and I. Not negative just funny.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:50:18	@floridlymad Thanks I appreciate that. Again, if you guys could see me now! Even though I have been awake for hours and hours...
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:49:05	OMG! I just dropped my mouse about five times trying to pick up! What applications did I launch as well my throwing it all over? SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:38:03	SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:37:44	Someone tell me what to do. I am well beyond apathy and uselessness. I need help. Even if I am truly useless and helpless.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:34:22	I'm a lot of fun when I wake up in the morning. You guys would laugh and laugh! If I had enough smarts I'd actually LOOK like a zombie.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-31 04:33:13	This is one of my absolute worst days in terms of concentration, being in a time warp. I know it's bad if I can't remember taking my meds...
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 23:40:35	@spectrumdweller @benpolar Also staying away from any sharp objects until at least more tea since I almost sliced off a finger with scissors
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 23:39:35	@spectrumdweller @benpolar Sounds like a fuzzed out day! Right now I'm just fiddling with my blogroll (again) trying to see who's missing...
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 23:19:34	@benpolar So hopefully some good sleeps and sweet dreams hon. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 23:19:08	@benpolar LOL Well sleep is good. We all need it. A lot more than people think. More accidents caused my insomnia that drinking and driving?
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 23:15:50	@benpolar Idk WTF. We're all quiet and this woman has been too! Oh well. Maybe you can have a nap? I can't sleep during the day so I'm up!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 23:09:02	@benpolar my ceiling. Who plays music so loud at that time in the morning?! *curls up under warm duvet with benpolar*
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 23:07:59	@benpolar Cutie. Well I am tired. Someone is looking after upstairs tenant's place and I woke up so early to thumping bass pounding through
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 23:04:09	@benpolar Whoa! Are we together in bed now? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 22:55:15	@benpolar Me too. I don't feel like doing anything either. Let's do nothing together. But would that mean we're then doing something? Huh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 22:32:11	SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 22:18:46	OMG! Cutting up some old junk with scissors and just about took off middle finger! Cut's not too bad? Going to be one of those days *sighs*

16253011	patientanon	2010-08-30 00:14:32	Haven't heard back from friend P. in two weeks when he left me VM. Called back. Nothing. We met in hospital. Worried!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-29 22:57:30	@julia99 Just got around to watching now. Yes awesome. Period prior and then Big Bands lots of fun. Should go download now before I forget!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-29 22:51:48	@OneWriter has to be warm rain though. Remember, I'm from Canada! We get "cold rain" that eventually turns into snow!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-29 22:51:13	@OneWriter It's the little things that should make us happy that get overlooked so much. Walking (or dancing?) in the rain is awesome. It

16253011	patientanon	2010-08-29 06:09:35	@OneWriter There's also "Earworm" that is more of an idiom where you can't get a song out of your head. Colloquialism but well used.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-29 06:07:49	@OneWriter Thanks. Eargasm. You know, pseudo-medical term. Pleasure from inserting something in your ear like Q-Tip? LOL Thanks about taste.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-29 06:06:12	@julia99 You know it. So fantastic! I just died over it when I first heard it. So hilarious and the art of it? The period too! Bewitching.

16253011	patientanon	2010-08-29 03:56:49	Okay just came out of bathroom and stranger played "Name That Artist" with me to a song that was playing. It was Roy Orbison.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-29 02:04:28	Could I be more stupid? The answer is no. Both my DNA and RNA nucleotides do differ from all humans and spell STUPID as an acronym.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 21:34:25	Oh yeah? You got a problem with that? Well Weebles wobble but they don't fall down! *PA waking up on dorkier side bed*
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 04:13:33	@alphabetania And then there are the ones that I just can't remember at all and I wake up crying. Uh huh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 04:11:45	@alphabetania Although most of them seem to be on the negative side. Some bizarre/huh? Some happy. Hard to say.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 04:08:38	@alphabetania I rarely remember my dreams. Right now I'm tossing every dream regardless into the book just to see if anything makes sense.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 03:55:30	Oh! Need to document the charming nightmares I had in my "Charming Nightmare Journal." Let's do that! I LOVE nightmares!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 03:54:00	Okay, the "Official Gravol Torpor" has set in. Now what to do...
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 03:52:00	The landlord is here. I often wonder what he thinks of me living in ADD Hell (or just All My Diagnoses Hell.) He's so dumb doubt he notices.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 03:21:12	@OneWriter Thanks. The "Squddles Saga" is/was loads of fun. Or not. That huge piece of tree bark? OWWWW!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 03:17:11	@spectrumdweller YW as always. As per comments you've had it rough for too long.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 03:15:54	@OneWriter Yeah seriously. Pills just popped. Now debating writing on it. Was continually taking for med titration and some of writing good!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 03:14:35	@shiv379 Hey *nauseous falls over attempt to hug* LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 03:09:29	@OneWriter Okay. Gotcha.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 02:57:03	Why am I torturing myself? Just take the damn Gravol! I am REALLY an idiot with myself at times. I need someone to keep me in line. Lord.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 02:48:33	Where is my idiot landlord? Said he'd be here at certain time or "a bit" later. *sighs* Idiot too weak a word to describe him.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 02:45:18	@spectrumdweller Sorry you feel blech.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-28 02:44:10	@OneWriter You okay there?

16253011	patientanon	2010-08-27 23:19:10	@OneWriter True. Thankfully, I've only hit the first two (so far...?) LOL Just kidding. I won't complete the list from there.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-27 23:06:23	@OneWriter I"Crazy" isn't a bad thing. Not at all so take it as a compliment. Although there is bad crazy. Get you into trouble crazy.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-27 22:55:31	@OneWriter You are crazy! Please stop the compliments! I'm turning bright red at my keyboard! Also I am NOTHING compared to Suzanne Farrell!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-27 22:36:55	Can such beauty truly exist? I finally saw her. With tears welling up in my eyes. Breath almost taken away. Unbelievable. Suzanne Farrell.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-27 22:32:37	@OneWriter Thanks for the #FollowFriday See if I can get something/anything up? Bit of a migraine last night so not sure I am just now! Whoo
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:56:34	@OneWriter Okay thanks again or "no thank you again." LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:46:40	@OneWriter Thank you so much again. It is true that I am very open. I won't argue with you there.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:45:49	Great. Get motivated to eat and food is frozen. I have a dietician why?
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:36:19	@OneWriter *grins again* Well I don't think it's courage so much. A lot of people say that but I think it's just "me." Also bust stigma!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:34:19	Okay now what's not "right" is to "write!" I need a distraction for a bit?
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:32:09	@OneWriter *laughing* Indeed a real happenin' place is my brain. Frustrating too at times. Very. Still what can I do? Just keep doing?
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:30:15	@OneWriter Again thank you so much. That really means a lot. It does. *tiny grin*
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:29:04	Wow! Holy Rain! Where did that come from! Gee, there's something witty! I'm writing about it raining.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:27:19	@OneWriter Also maybe witty and quick when my brain isn't falling apart...
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:26:11	@OneWriter no offense as I haven't been reading anyone! Lately my blog has been a pit of whiny self-indulgent misery! Blech. Still thank you
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:25:06	@OneWriter Oh dear my blog! Thanks but terribly embarrassed about that thing! I think it's such crap! I should check out yours but no please
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:20:03	@OneWriter Thank you. I try to be funny and yes, I have an extreme passion for wordplay (both groaners and non-groaners.) Reader's Choice.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:15:25	@OneWriter I'm sorry. Could you repeat that once again? I'm not sure if I heard you "right?" *groan*
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:11:36	@OneWriter Sure. I mean we could get into all sorts of philosophical and other debates re: time and space etc... until our own time expired!
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:06:59	@OneWriter *nods* Sometimes I may know what's right however. I think I have had flashes if "inrightfulness." Yes.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:05:22	@OneWriter Thanks. It just came into my head then out of my fingers. Like writing! I don't think I ever know what's right really though.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 06:01:13	@OneWriter @readheadgirl Not to mention, I am literally "writing" "right" now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-26 05:59:35	@OneWriter Thank you as well for the RT! It seems I may be attracting the literary folks on Twitter at the moment? *laughing*

16253011	patientanon	2010-08-15 04:21:36	Oh, and it's not really self-medication with the Gravol. Tummy is upset somewhat. Bearable but..? So writing on Gravol or not?
16253011	patientanon	2010-08-15 04:18:39	I'm going to try and do some writing now. Who thinks I should do it under the influence of Gravol like last night. Valium already taken!

16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:50:05	@asdquefty you down but it doesn't. "Paradoxical Reaction."
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:49:47	@asdquefty Stims can work in the opposite direction for impulse control, actually. Like a side effect where you think the med should calm
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:48:41	@asdquefty I could see that being a HUGE trigger. I still haven't figured out all of my PTSD stuff but can you ever? *hugs* @woundedgenius
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:24:12	@asdquefty Yes, I've always said you can get "addicted" to anything. Not just booze, drugs, anything!
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:23:33	@asdquefty @woundedgenius Drinking can bring out all sorts of things when we're nutcases. Trust me. Self-medication history for 2o years...
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:22:34	@asdquefty even crazier, actually SPEEDS up in their drinking!
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:22:15	@asdquefty switch. Others feel they've had enough but the alcoholic either doesn't know when to stop because of the lack of that switch OR
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:21:36	@asdquefty Well fine for some but research has shown that the alcoholic's brain is different than the non-'s. It lacks a so-called "off"
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:20:24	@asdquefty @woundedgenius drinkers. However, can they ultimately remain so? Toughie.
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:19:48	@asdquefty @woundedgenius I can definitely see that angle. It's a tough one. Some people can beat the cycle of addiction and exist as social
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:18:41	@woundedgenius very hard for me. Not confirmed but genetic component. My self-medication history goes back 20 damn years. Hard to break that
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:17:56	@woundedgenius That's interesting. And just wow! I think that takes (or would take) a lot to do. My family is riddled with alcoholism so
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:16:35	@woundedgenius just a tiny amount every once in a while as it is! Makes no sense!
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:16:06	@woundedgenius that I'm going out getting wasted! I was just better off not drinking period. Plus waste of money I don't have even if it's
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:15:22	@woundedgenius build up of stress? Idk. So I did fall off the wagon and NOT HAPPY about that! Now, I want to get back on that wagon. Not
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:14:37	@woundedgenius It didn't seem like a trigger "big enough" that would make me want to drink as I'd had bigger ones! Maybe just an overall
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:13:49	@woundedgenius I had quit drinking a while back but for some stupid reason I started again with a trigger that...I couldn't figure out why?
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:06:54	@woundedgenius I never did much anyway! Alcohol was my "drug of choice."
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:06:32	@woundedgenius I've done just a couple in my Bipolar crazy days but now with all else and my psych meds they would really screw me up! Also
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-08 00:05:47	@woundedgenius No worries, hon. So you quit smoking? I'm bad and still do but will quit one day. I'll be polite & not ask about street drugs

16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 23:53:18	@woundedgenius NEVER do drugs! LOL I could take another Concerta but that would KILL my brain as I take 36mg. 72mg! OMG! Jut kidding folks!
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 23:52:21	@woundedgenius I don't drink pop except for gingerale for my tummy when up set. Cocaine would just act as a stim for my ADD brain but would

16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:42:12	@asdquefty Fuck I'm tired there is NO SUCH THING AS A TRIGGER for seizures!!! Just A LOWERING OF THRESHOLD!!! I had to make that clear.

16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:38:40	@asdquefty you are having seizures. Dr. PA is not a REAL M.D. but in her "opinion" go see a Neuro.
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:38:12	@asdquefty However, be prepared for a possible argument to be taken off your stims! A possible argument, They can lower threshold...IF you
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:37:07	@asdquefty Go get a referral to Neuro. Also no one ever has a clue if they're having absence seizures LOL

16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:31:34	@asdquefty things have happened?
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:31:26	@asdquefty How long do the symptoms last? is there any pain involved? Are there any other things going on? Have you had periods where other
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:28:05	@asdquefty You have a history with bad headaches too. However you also have other things w/ your bean so would that make you diff. from bro?
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:25:54	@asdquefty as I had a seizure day before my sleep deprived EEG but no dice so like I said, unreliable! I had one mega TBI that i remember
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:24:34	@asdquefty tonic-clonic I've had one but not so rare? Everyone is different. Yes can find some things inter ictal and I was hoping for that
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:23:13	@asdquefty w/ you for life. Gelastic SP are rare but I've had three, Atonics not so rare, Reflex? Freaky but so many types, kind of rare.
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:20:36	motor probs. Also not strange to have SP w/o CPS! Lord I had only SPS all my life! SPs can exist only on their own & not even occur as an
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 02:19:06	@asdquefty Hate to disappoint you w/ your seizure research but SPs aren't most unusual to rare. Also can have impaired consciousness w/ SP &
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 01:51:40	@asdquefty Now for you. We on the Spectrum can be so sensitive to SO many things! So I can't say for sure. The heat may well be bothering u!
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 01:51:03	@asdquefty meltdown I can feel post-"ick"tal afterward! Too much misfiring and my brain "thinks" it's having a seizure when it's not! Lord.
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 01:50:12	@asdquefty nailed! BIG TIME! Also, don't know if you read my post but my brain is getting more messed up! If I have a migraine or an Aspie
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 01:49:28	@asdquefty Crazy, fast weather change only thing I can peg for my migraines. We just had massive heatwave overnight with humidity and I got
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 01:48:05	@asdquefty in my teen years so seasonal changes screwed me up there! Still all wonky with icy feet and hands and still screwy with temps.
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 01:47:15	@asdquefty Ironically they were like that in the summer too! I was always sick with infections too, allergies whatev. As I grew older SAD in
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 01:46:32	@asdquefty heatstroke every summer. Throwing up fevers the whole shebang. I also can't deal with the cold. My hands and feet were like ice.
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-07 01:45:33	@asdquefty I just poking around I can only find anecdotal.Other Aspies saying they are sensitive to heat. Now when I was wee I would get

16253011	patientanon	2010-07-05 09:07:15	Yeah, like I knew that wasn't going to happen. Soon as I said "marketing" up comes Twitter follows! Actually, weird who's on that feed too!
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-05 08:58:44	I'm getting referrals from this huge site. Tres bizzarro. Cdn. marketing company that must have some mega aggregation feed or something.
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-05 08:34:17	BWAH-HAH-HAH!!! Just like I wrote earlier! I almost emailed the wrong person about the wrong thing! Maybe I shouldn't try more work SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-07-05 08:31:32	I asked the guy about it too! Oh, never mind! BAH! *runs around trying to find rest of head*

16253011	patientanon	2010-07-05 02:48:15	I'd better be careful and not start sending wrong emails to the wrong people from the wrong accounts! Post my resume on Twitter! SPAZ O.o

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 06:41:29	Fuck this shit. I'm outta here. Is a thank you too much to expect? Ah, right. Don't expect anything! Then you'll never be disappointed!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 06:05:32	Okay forget that last Tweet. It's stupid. There are so many ridiculous font names. I'm stupid...and sooooo green. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 05:54:21	HA! I just read the funniest font name. Probably not amusing to you graphics folks out there but: "I crashed into Gothic" Fine. I'm tired.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 05:04:06	Whoops! Maybe I should take a break. Tripped and almost had an intimate encounter with a wall. *laughing*

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 04:51:49	If I was smarter when I started this whole research business I am currently doing, I would have written some important information down.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 04:49:39	@sillyjon This is nucking futs! I'm working again...too much? My eyes are swimming... Should I rest now? You tell me LOL OMG I suck.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 03:37:03	@dorfird @Canageek Ontario is quite stable. Seismic activity does occur and can all around the world however it just isn't detected really.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 03:09:33	@SheikYurbouti 10 seconds of my bed hitting 4.5 on the Richter as I'm "Bedridden" again. Uh, yeah. "Construction" will do that!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 03:07:32	@SheikYurbouti Well they ARE doing construction outside and the downstairs tenant also needs work done but I'm so stupid! My flat going nuts
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 03:04:32	@SheikYurbouti LMAO! I know. And at first I thought someone was doing "construction?" More like "destruction?" Demolishing a building? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 03:01:11	@benpolar Then you have to factor in east and west coast geography? And I'm not a meteorologist!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 03:00:04	@benpolar However, we don't get them that often!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:58:57	@benpolar Our tornados can knock down trees, take out power lines but rarely do damage to buildings. Well maybe someone's shed! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:56:17	Actually just thinking. Good thing I was on my bed for the earthquake. Might have fallen down and bonked my bean! Oooohhh. Not good.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:42:13	@aspieteach I think the only damage was to me regarding my massive startle response, actually! GAH!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:39:42	@aspieteach Thanks for Tweeting and caring about us though hon' xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:39:20	@aspieteach As per the news everyone seems just fine. We're cool cats up here! LOL! I think everyone is okay in the parts of the US too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:36:46	Just sent txt to my friend J. who was on the road on his Scooter to see if he was alright! He said he didn't feel a thing! WTF? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:29:18	Okay I'm going to fix a cuppa and go outside. If I don't come back, we've had an aftershock and I've fallen down and hit my head. Kidding!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:27:25	@archkittens Yes, once I got to the company it seemed definitely clear as to what it was. I was on the right track!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:26:19	@archkittens Ah, okay. Thanks for that. I had to Google it anyway! *laughing* I had an idea it was a "part" for something though!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:24:58	Oh dear. Terrible irony! I just saw on the news that a woman was watching a TV show about earthquakes when the earthquake hit! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:23:12	@benpolar seems pretty significant though I think. I remember waking up and feeling one when I was a little kid but never again.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:22:32	@benpolar It's pretty rare. Well, we're a HUGE country so maybe something really small somewhere? However, we can get small tornados? This
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:12:15	The whole goddamn house shook! Aftershocks? *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:10:32	Gee, and I thought my day was going to be boring! *rolls eyes* Sorry, NOT funny! 5.5 is right in the middle of the Richter.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:05:56	@TheSpindleshay They're saying Philadelphia and Ohio has been hit in the US plus a possible second one? #earthquake
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 02:01:15	Earthquake 5.5 on Richter between Ontario and Quebec border. #earthquake
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 01:59:36	@TheSpindleshay It's all across Ontario and northern US actually. Not just Toronto.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 01:55:28	@TheSpindleshay Yep
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 01:52:20	I have Richter Scale stress in my life already. I don't need the building falling on me. Well...that might be good. End of me=End of stress!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 01:50:40	Uh...maybe I should go outside and see if there is construction going on or we had some kind of seismic anomaly. WTF? My heart is racing O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 01:47:29	@benpolar Anyway, in the immediate, I'm still sick and gross with this infection but beyond that? Going crazy with typical "life stuff" blah
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 01:46:05	@benpolar flat downstairs. Either that or we just had an earthquake! MY entire flat just started shaking like crazy! *shivers*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 01:45:23	@benpolar Whoops! Sorry, that was "Startle Response Typing!" Not directed at you! I think(?) they're doing some kind of construction in the
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 01:43:46	@benpolar Meh. HOLY FUCK!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 01:19:12	@bipolarette @benpolar That's good to hear.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-24 01:18:29	@sillyjon True but I get antsy "resting" too much! Being sick makes me frustrated and depressed! But did get to a point where I had to stop!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 06:57:10	And now, with much anticipation of having a date with my pillow, I bid you all adieu...
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 06:53:25	Oh, come on pharmacy delivery! I want to lay down! Huh. How odd. While typing this they called to say on their way. More serendipity please!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 05:30:37	@readheadgirl No doubt.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 05:23:54	@benpolar @bipolarette Glad to hear you're both sort of ok? Yeah? *nods*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 05:22:28	@readheadgirl I was thinking the cat went right on you. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 05:19:59	@Tigerbean Ah, that explains it. Well, if not around so much miss you too!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 04:51:03	@Tigerbean Miss you and love you? I get the last and love you too but the miss you? Are you okay? Don't need to miss me? Know where I am!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 04:49:17	@thebipolarmom And yes just for short periods on and off so you don't do damage to affected areas. No more than 10 minutes, say.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 04:47:59	@thebipolarmom applied to the skin. Does that help?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 04:47:32	@thebipolarmom old I've kept and used for SO many head injuries! However, whatever you use, there must be cloth covering it when directly
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 04:46:31	@thebipolarmom Applying something warm (heating pad or hot water bottle) or cold (bag of ice?) I have a bag of frozen vegetables that is SO
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 04:45:09	@archkittens Your image? Is it a test for us to try & figure it out or do you not know? Sorry being Aspie literal. Either way computer part?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 04:32:20	@thebipolarmom if it's a TMJ problem or not but clenching is a significant culprit for that.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 04:31:39	@thebipolarmom hot cold therapy (my choice, I did cold) for maybe 20-30 minutes a few times daily. Maybe 10 min. each side. So don't know
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 04:30:16	@thebipolarmom ago but I fell under a "rare category" (only me! surprise!) and it made things worse. So referred to periodontist and he said
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 04:29:22	@thebipolarmom Have you talked to a dentist about getting a bite splint/plate. I had one years ago for my TMJ. Had to get another not long
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 04:27:34	@readheadgirl Are you kidding me? I crack myself up all the time! I find myself the most ridiculous "thing" on the planet!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 03:52:25	Screw it! I'm taking the Gravol! Maybe a Valium as I'm fucked up (when am I not?) If I fall flat on my face when the pharmacy guy comes ok.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 03:35:46	@sillyjon Thanks. Trying to work to avoid thinking about how disgusting I feel. Nope! Also don't want to pass out as delivery not here yet.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-23 01:55:53	Huh. I might be getting some free Ensure courtesy of my Dietician and Abbott. If so, thanks Abbott. Finally some payback from Big Pharma LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-22 22:47:40	*goes to get Ensure even though tummy is dying from virus*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-22 22:46:28	W00t! My already awesome pharmacy is delivering my meds that I need today & ordering my Ensure (also delivered) that I need to drink daily!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-22 22:37:35	Oy. Sicker than I thought. Went to rest and try to read yesterday afternoon. Woke up at bedtime. Took night meds and went back to sleep O.o

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-21 01:29:16	@asdquefty Impressive. First time I've ever heard of that!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-20 23:27:31	@benpolar You're welcome as always sweetie. You know I love you even though we haven't talked in a long time. Still, that'll never change xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-20 23:25:52	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid @TriniGirlBlue Awesome Aspie vid. but last part abt parenting made me cry. I think u guys can figure why?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-20 23:20:10	@asdquefty No an ER/Walk-In would never make ANY med changes period to a patient. They'd tell you to see your regular doc.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:53:54	@benpolar In fact, I'm there right now. Not for doing it on Twitter, though.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:52:41	@benpolar just want to...god...do whatever but please know that I feel like crap when I go on a tear as well. *hugs again*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:51:43	@benpolar *hugs* I haven't read anything or talked to you in so long hon. I feel the same way and ppl always tell me it's ok. I know you
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:50:45	Okay folks...best be on my way...take care of your lovely selves.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:48:24	@AuRtist Okay, wicked bot could be gone (doubtful) sleeping or just being too random *shrugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:45:59	Man, that is SO wicked! Totally awesome and WICKED! W00t!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:45:27	@AuRtist Pr0n bots...WAY too many of those that seem to have disappeared. Maybe Twitter has improved there. Let's see if I can get wicked.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:44:22	@AuRtist I can't remember some of the bots that have gotten me. I know there's the wicked bot Hmmm...
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:42:35	@AuRtist Yeah, it's the Aspie Tribe bot. Aspie Tribe is a discussion board.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:39:50	@alphabetania And yeah, hugs too as I see you're going through some...stuff. Man, too much fucking STUFF!!! *frowns*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:37:57	@alphabetania I would but I'm afraid the goldfish would die by me taking it out of the water to do it!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:30:11	@AuRtist Okay got it. I think I need to go though. Not feeling so shit hot at the mo. As you can probably tell. LOL Don't worry no buses.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:26:55	@AuRtist Oh another e.? I responded to the last. I'll try and get to it before I "catch my bus."
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:25:33	@AuRtist Okay, Okay I'll come to where you live and jump under a bus THERE! Then you won't miss me so much? You'll get 2 see me before I go?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:24:25	@AuRtist I'm more of a fuck up overall in life than I ever realized to begin with. Which sucks to know but I guess is good in the long run.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:23:37	@AuRtist Fair enough w/ the decrease. Just some docs are stupid. Nah, don't worry about placating. It's all good. If anything, made me learn
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:17:52	@AuRtist Yes you mentioned the lowering of the dosage. Maybe it's too much to fast as we all know that's a silly one and needs slow titrate.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:16:40	@AuRtist I mean, it's not like we're sooooooooo good at fucking social to begin with. *rolls eyes* And life is stupid and messy anyway.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:15:53	@AuRtist reason I want that goddamn bus!!! Where is it!!! *checks watch* Well you've always got choice to opt out of the BBQ. It is Aspie
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:14:45	@AuRtist Well, I'm always honest about my meltdowns but I fucked up as a result of this one and I am NONE to happy about that! Another
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:08:00	@AuRtist still trying 2 manage & do work that needs 2 get done. I do have dishes. And the bus? That was to throw myself UNDER it not RIDE it
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:05:58	@AuRtist just that lately I've been losing my head all over the place, fucking up left right and centre, having the damn Aspie meltdown
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 05:04:27	@AuRtist That's my whole dietician's strategy: just eat small stuff throughout the day, no problems with actually the foods I'm eating. It's
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 04:43:00	@AuRtist been a few days. I'm not joking. That's pretty bad. Idk. Maybe I can find something...something to do after this email...
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 04:41:10	@AuRtist I'm just responding to an email. I think after that, I'm going to run outside and catch that bus...? Heh. I should maybe eat. It's
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 04:19:05	@AuRtist Just LOADS of fun to sit there going WTF for all those years and then start questioning the WTF too?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 04:17:32	@AuRtist I've been in denial about 2 many things & it's a lot to handle all at once. Processing years of how you've perceived your own life!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 04:16:05	@AuRtist Ah, my Tweet about having my fill of "insight!" No, that's all about me baby! Learning things about my life personally. Realizing
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 04:14:28	@AuRtist What? Sorry for what? You didn't do anything! And you're welcome of course! xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 03:48:43	I enjoy gaining insight into my life, I really do but I think I've had just about my fill right now. Let's stop "insighting." Mmm'kay?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 03:45:57	I really don't think I can become any more delusional at this point. Unless I start becoming delusional about my delusions? *crosses eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 03:43:49	Excuse me while I go catch the next passing bus! Not going anywhere! Well, except UNDER IT! Another point in favour that I am selfish. YAY!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 02:22:52	@Tigerbean Cool.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-19 00:41:55	@Tigerbean HA! I'm very bad. Quite perverse. Oh please. Quite doesn't even come close. *grabs wet towel spins it around and snaps it at you*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 23:46:23	@Tigerbean Playing hide and seek in the sheets? Sorry...just couldn't let that one go! *ducks*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 23:44:56	@Tigerbean Yes, of course dorky/geeky/nerdy people are the coolest! That goes without saying but no, should be shouted from the rooftops!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 22:43:41	@Tigerbean Yes, I'm a dork. But I think you've figured that out by now?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 22:43:03	@Tigerbean Idk yet. Only on first tea. How about you? I was also going to say you typed <2 does that only mean you love me 2/3 as much? LOL

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:58:47	@aspieteach that I've had all my life (that I can remember.) Anything else I'm missing? *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:58:18	@aspieteach have all of my meds listed and for dates taken, side effects they caused and reasons prescribed. I have my list of Aspie traits
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:57:44	@aspieteach I gave up Mood Charting by the time I hit Ultradian because the tiny boxes were ridiculous for how fast my moods would change. I
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:56:48	@aspieteach history? Oh yeah! This is Dr. PA we're talking about! I should email you my "Seizure Dossier!"
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:55:56	@aspieteach That sounds like a great doc. It's taken me YEARS to finally get a team that is just ace. Me? Keep a journal of my medical
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:38:08	@aspieteach Cool. Thanks for the offer.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:31:45	@AuRtist Must respond to your e. before I forget!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:31:24	@aspieteach Maybe even when really young! I just never remembered and my memory is so obliterated from trauma.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:30:34	@aspieteach I look back (or have) and realized I've been Dr. PA pretty much all my life and never knew it from things I've written down!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:29:43	@aspieteach the Head of Neurology at Harvard and he said I think so? Can't remember if he was at Beth Is. though. Yes Dr. PA still back then
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:28:50	@aspieteach Effexor that was not only making insane b/c of the Bipolar but I would wake up in urine soaked sheets. Nocturnals? So I emailed
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-18 00:28:06	@aspieteach LOL! Want to hear something funny on that point? Years ago when I was trying to figure out WTF as I was on the highest dose of

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-17 22:41:51	@myautisticson kind of ironic that it happened after that huh? But thank you again for coming back and checking in on me. That means so much
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-17 22:40:46	@myautisticson Thanks hon. You're so sweet. No, we were just having a good talk about me being an Aspie and your son on the Spectrum. Just
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-17 09:50:40	These Posts are Always Sooo Much Fun...: http://wp.me/p3M8c-12Y
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-17 03:27:27	Okay, I think I can leave @shiv379 alone now. I'm done? Back to what I was doing before. I even got sidetracked from @shiv379 before too!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-17 03:25:32	I am completely without focus. I was just starting to do one thing and now I'm all over @shiv379 and I can't stop.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-17 02:56:11	I go blind so often when I seize anyway! One extreme to another! "Blinding" sunlight or "Blinding" seizures! Good lord.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-17 02:54:55	Perhaps I should contact Non-Arsey Neuro and see what they have on offer for photosensitivity lens options. There are several. Might work?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-17 02:53:18	I think my eyes are becoming more sensitive to light. My regular glasses that shade on their own don't seem enough. Could go back 2 contacts
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-17 02:18:25	Coming up in my blog post anyway but worth asking here if you don't read it: anyone ever had Aspie meltdown so bad impaired bodily function?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-17 02:06:08	@myautisticson I'm in Canada & I fear I need to clean up my blog a bit (if I can clean up my head.) After all the talk HUGE meltdown. Irony?

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 14:00:47	@myautisticson That's cool. It's just THAT a Specturm! Like other mental illnesses and Developmental Disorders. Manifest in different ways.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:59:38	@myautisticson but not with my ex-gf. Only want to play with me at the play ground, grab my hand and go running.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:58:59	@myautisticson he and I? Wow. Some funny verbal, only me taking him to the bathroom, quiet non-verbal w/ movies where only he'd cuddle a bit
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:57:40	@myautisticson But you know Aspie kids and Aspie adults are kin. They totally relate. My ex-gf have friends witha son on the Spectrum and
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:56:10	@myautisticson Awww...that plugs into me and I just want to hug him if he is okay with social and sensory.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:52:39	@myautisticson But yes, your son is/was...whatever...like me.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:52:17	@myautisticson be there! I don't care how loony my partner is! If we can manage that, all good!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:51:22	@myautisticson I totally agree with what you say about being open and understanding in relationships, acceptance, communication! It has to
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:50:00	Now, I can cry a bit. Yes I can cry.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:49:38	@myautisticson it's okay to feel. But it was so much too much then. I was less than saran or cling wrap. I cried and cried and then quit.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:48:08	@myautisticson I was so empathic as a kid I could fee a stranger's pain. It huft so much so as I grew older I shut down. Now, I've learned
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:46:34	@spectrumdweller You see more in me do you not? Or no? RENT! Or I'm sorry if that is not appropriate or funny. I feel like a total idiot.

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:07:41	@myautisticson it does come with such complications. However, I still wouldn't "change" being an Aspie. It is who I am. The only downsides
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:06:19	@myautisticson And yes, we could go one and on how Aspies see the world so differently. Or at least adult Aspies. It's a gift. But sometimes
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:02:32	@myautisticson mean to? Gee, does that sound like empathy to you? A bit of guilt, yeah. But it's not selfish...because selfish ppl? Guilt?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 13:01:16	@myautisticson Sure, I feel stupid but really, it's more...gee, I KNOW what it feels like for someone to "manipulate" you. Even if I didn't
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 12:57:38	@myautisticson Why do you think I've been sitting here getting tearful about what I think I've done to someone tonight! Is that NOT empathy?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 12:56:01	@myautisticson empathy! That is not true at all! Bollocks to that!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 12:55:32	@myautisticson can also be SO acutely sensitive! People don't "get" that! Pisses me off about the whole thing that Aspies aren't capable of
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-16 12:54:25	@myautisticson Another thing I'd like to say about Aspies is that people think we get all the social wrong anc sure, we do mess up but we

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-15 22:55:59	Apparently gmail is too ashamed to admit it sleeps in its clothes for days on end as it won't let me log in. Come out of the closet gmail!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-15 22:51:47	How many people sleep in their clothes (all of them) for days, have never admitted it before but will here now? I admit it because I'm nuts.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-15 08:34:36	I think I'd better go try and rest now. Yes. Try and dig out all the little pieces of shrapnel stuck in me... *twitch twitch*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-15 08:33:05	Well when you think about it, is there EVER a good time to trigger your own PTSD? No. Not so much. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-15 08:31:39	Whoops! Shouldn't have read that! *brain implodes* As always...my time is impeccable for PTSD'ing myself! *takes sweeping bow to the crowd*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-15 08:08:55	@readheadgirl LOL *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-15 07:49:43	@Canageek Tired. As per usual. *rolls eyes* Busy too. Ugh. Which is good in "Try to focus yet keep your head from exploding way?" *big hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-15 07:42:09	@readheadgirl Hmmm...ok...I've never known how to interpret that word in my life a lot of the time...*laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-15 07:38:03	@asdquefty Yes my GP asked me if I wanted to see the one she works with since my body is such a gastro nightmare so I said sure.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-15 07:13:01	I think I need to go to bed now. I still haven't eaten a thing. Has anyone ever had their Dietician inflict severe bodily injury upon them?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-15 07:10:56	I don't think I've ever made messier notes of stuff I have to do in my life! Trying to decipher the list is more frightening than the work!

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-14 23:18:44	@spectrumdweller LOL! Form some kind of Twitter Mafia or something. Or the Twitter Angles? Cleaner? Nice berets and jackets too?
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-14 09:20:28	Despite his game, a coward, so I may have nothing to lose even by speaking freely here. The women need to know that they may be in danger.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-14 09:17:33	@Canageek I may end up paying dearly for it but I will do so for the price I have already paid! I have decided to confront this menace.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-14 09:15:44	@Canageek Thanks hon. Again at risk of my own reputation I need a dangerous man to leave women alone in this arena and the entire Internet!
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-14 09:09:25	I shall say no more at this point. People will read this, you will leave me alone and any fellow female readers are free to contact me.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-14 09:07:12	You are already forcing my hand by going public and making a fool of myself, but I will risk my own reputation for the safety of others.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-14 09:05:13	You will see that as a challenge but even a fool sees it as a joke. Do not force my hand.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-14 09:03:08	No one will ever take away from me such as I've not already taken away from myself. I remain already defeated, thus unworthy of conquering.

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-13 10:37:53	Yes, I know. Why am I back online. I'm supposed to be relaxing. I have now realized that since signing on I have made a poor decision. Bye!

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-01 03:36:38	Water Time Check: 2.5 hours since I "stole some" before the killed it. This is ridiculous. Only enough left for one small tea. Not.Good.
16253011	patientanon	2010-06-01 03:31:44	@catatonickid @buttonista @shiv379 AH! Even more fun! The warning labels! Prime Darwin Award Candidates? Did someone actually DO that?

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-01 01:03:47	I wonder if they'd notice if I turned the water on just a teensy bit to fill my kettle. This really is torture. Concerta alone won't do it.

16253011	patientanon	2010-06-01 00:40:18	Just up now can't use water. That means I can't have my tea. That means I should just go back 2 bed but can't sleep. No clue when water back

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-24 22:40:30	If you want to read about Todd's paresis & why I probably had a nocturnal seizure spilling water all over myself: http://bit.ly/a0gO7L
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-24 22:32:47	@Canageek Yes I am SPAZ O.o And I saw your comment about that too. May be a bit slow w/ blog. Have another long one so slow to read that.

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-24 22:24:24	@Canageek Thanks. My meds even though they are so good for sleep would never make me lose all control of my arm and drop a water bottle!
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-24 22:23:22	People w/ epilepsy! Get yourself a cane for when you're post-ictal! I just did and it's been a godsend! #epilepsy #seizures
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-24 22:20:01	Shit! Noctural Seizure? Todd's paresis? Dropped water bottle in night & spilled it all over me & bed! Also feel way sicker than yesterday!

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-23 02:21:52	@YogaChicky Good to hear there's nothing "wrong" with a little confusion. You are speaking to the perpetually if not continually confused!
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 20:19:57	@Canageek Yes it's true. The hashtag is now officially DEAD.
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 20:19:28	@catatonickid Gee, didn't know Xena was part part of your "repertoire."

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 20:11:41	@TriniGirlBlue I could take a pic lol
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 20:11:31	@catatonickid I'm pretty slow. #PAsucks
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 09:00:14	That said, "bangy brain" is calling it a night. #PAsucks
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:59:31	Actually rather appropriate. The banging of the hammer is beating in time with the banging in my brain...
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:57:18	You have GOT to be kidding! Repairs outside on the front porch THIS late at night?! OFFS!
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:52:32	@Canageek Bump! Set! and Spike!
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:41:55	@Canageek Honey YOU can call it whatever you like? Or IT whatever you like? I just know what I do in bed (or wherever...)
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:39:52	@YogaChicky Also that whole chocolate raft thing sounds really sexy too! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:38:59	@Canageek BWAH-HAH-HAH!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:38:38	@YogaChicky Funny you should mention chocolate. Weird gastro Sx? I'm craving/eating truckloads. Like daily? The whole malabsorption angle?
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:37:28	@YogaChicky I'm tired of faking it too you know? I'm so confused. Even here! God everywhere. I can't tell what's me, who's me, who're they?
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:32:11	@YogaChicky I know. We all remember that we get past all episodes but in the midst so hard to remember that. I feel like I'm drowning.
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:29:18	@TriniGirlBlue I have a really cute one, a soft suede? Black and yellow too! Pretty!
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:28:49	@TriniGirlBlue Writing is odd. Sometimes you can get things out when you're messed in the head, sometimes not. I did write a poem other day?
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:27:57	I truly am crazy. Even when depressed I can still think and go on about sex @catatonickid @shiv379

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:24:17	@TriniGirlBlue That's it! Actually, a nice flogger? I'm not really into hard corporal.
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:23:33	@TriniGirlBlue Thanks love. I'm trying but god. Every once in a while I get this stab of depression. I mean it hurts!
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:21:46	@TriniGirlBlue Harder?
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:21:38	What this all boils down to is that I probably need to sign off bloody Twitter! #PAsucks
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:20:41	@TriniGirlBlue Seriously, Trying to inject humour into my life and all I'm doing is looking like an idiot. Seriously! #PAsucks

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:18:43	@TriniGirlBlue I'm just being a grand arse.
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:18:10	@TriniGirlBlue I'm sorry for saying I suck. Now I feel bad #PAsucks LOL

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 08:08:49	@YogaChicky Hash insanity. You know my sense of humour. Totally self-deprecating. I have another hash I need to put to use actually. A game?

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 07:35:26	@spectrumdweller Hope you're doing ok btw. Our paths haven't crossed in a long time.
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 07:34:29	@spectrumdweller Thanks hon. But yanno... I do have a pretty strong sucky side. Also, I'm being an idiot with this. "Auto Suck?" #PAsucks
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 07:31:46	This might be more stupid than my blog entries. Well, maybe not. #PAsucks

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-22 07:19:33	@YogaChicky I'll do my best but I can't make any promises. I don't break promises to other people though, only myself! Same thing? #PAsucks

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-17 23:25:16	@Canageek Thanks *hugs* Yes things have been great for 6mos. still, this sucks. Can't control epilepsy tho and never a "good" time to seize.
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-17 23:23:29	@eternalamour when it's really bad I know trying to cope is just so much harder. I hope you feel better soon too. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-17 23:22:34	@eternalamour good but it still sucks mega. I hope you feel better soon too. Cycling is NOT fun at all even if well controlled. But when

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-17 23:16:43	@eternalamour I had a seizure the other night so in recovery. Also before that a Bipolar cycling episode? But the seizure is what's shot me!
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-17 23:14:20	@my13thsadday I see someone else is not feeling so well. I'm going to make another cuppa too. And go outside. Let's have it together. *hugs*

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-17 23:10:00	@eternalamour No! No shooting u in the head. My head is shooting itself in the head & I can't stop that. So I'm stopping your head shooting!

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-11 23:28:55	Christ, what a great way to start my day! I think I'm going to be sick now. Between this and waking up from nightmares two nights running.
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-11 23:27:40	@Canageek I think it's obvious that he & I don't speak anymore. Haven't in 4yrs. Still, a death 1yr. ago? Or hell, even any attempt to talk?
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-11 23:25:39	@Canageek Thanks. Welcome to non-bio dad's side of family! Aren't they great? Now I can just imagine what kind of portrait he's drawn of me
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-11 23:24:27	God I sound like a character from Shakespeare but it's true. Someone died. They knew I loved this person & their wife. They didn't tell me.
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-11 23:21:40	I am beyond crying now. Now I am incensed! I must then be thoroughly banished. If they will not tell of someone's DEATH? Even if distant?

16253011	patientanon	2010-04-02 07:22:20	@Canageek We'll see what they are and how they read?
16253011	patientanon	2010-04-02 07:15:35	W00t! Just found out I won TWO AWESOME BOOKS from another blogger who was holding a contest! About Autism! Brightened my day. Needed that.

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-30 10:52:56	But need to be on watch now that there are signs. Probably just a case of multiple factors. No doubt! Uber-Stress!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-30 10:51:53	either way, I've been drooling like a rabid dog so I need to do some seizure management. I haven't seized in a long time so that is good.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-30 10:51:03	Nini everyone. Getting late. Whether wine or stress or just plain ol' life may have lowered my seizure threshold (not the alcohol-bollocks)
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-30 10:49:07	They say "Don't Drink and Drive." I'll do them one better. "Don't Drink and Think." It skews everything. It messes up what really is "real."

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-30 05:04:00	@buttonista LOL! Pretty kitty! I didn't know you had coasters as well. That kind of "works" for me as I have a serious "matching" thing.

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-30 04:36:58	@buttonista Well I always did theatre until my stage fright bit me in the ass in later teen years so I know that stuff and I'm a total geek!

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 03:23:28	@thinkshrink Oh, thank you so much! That really means a lot! Sometimes I think my blog is such a load of crap! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 03:21:26	@asdquefty Yeah, thanks so much for sending and I remember you mentioned it before.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 02:44:52	@EnigmaAnonymous messed up (some consonants too) brain can still comprehend what you are writing. Funny neuro trivia.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 02:44:00	@EnigmaAnonymous Ah. Well in good company today? I suppose it doesn't matter too much. Actually, if consants in right order and vowels...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 02:27:08	@asdquefty recoverable elsewhere.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 02:26:55	@asdquefty so many idiots out there I hadn't backed it up! I wanted to kill myself for some personal things but recovered most that were

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 02:05:45	@asdquefty OMG another typo there! I'm going to stop counting!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 02:05:17	@asdquefty That would be "learn" w/ computers. Typos about today! I'm going to make another cuppa right now. Definitely needed.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 02:04:38	@asdquefty Also, that is how I lean w/ computers? Maybe? I just hack away @things til I "get it right?" Or anything else remotely technical
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 02:03:18	@asdquefty Hey, we both have similar "brain functionality" in that way. I do it in a medical testing/research way. Do the tests and trials?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 02:01:39	Would you then like a post-orgasm BP along with that? For a "trial" it may take me at least a BIT of time? ROTFLMAO
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 02:00:33	@asdquefty LMAO! I'll see what I can do about that for you. Resting BP then sexual fantasizing BP? At a certain point, then take the stats?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 01:58:36	@asdquefty sorry, nix that. That sounds too vague as I'm not awake yet. I meant anything that gets you aroused would affect "pulse rate."
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 01:57:49	@asdquefty Oh and btw, anything that gets you cranked would do more heart rate stuff but maybe not BP? Can't recall specifics.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-21 01:55:45	@asdquefty Oh, just a thought. Try cafepress. They will let u design anything u want I think? Never used them though but heard good things?

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-19 21:58:19	@shiv379 Thanks hun. No I didn't I haven't had much online time! Why don't you email me. Probably easier to communicate that way. xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-19 21:50:52	*cough cough* OMG! I just about choked on my tea and spit it out all over baby MacBook! Going to be one of those days... *tries to laugh*

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-19 21:48:55	Maybe it will be a "Tea and Valium Breakfast" for school today! We haven't started just yet. Obviously! I'm on Twitter with baby MacBook!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-19 21:47:19	@serial_insomnia @serial_insomnia I just feel like I've been a total arse within the last 12-24 hours or so and been as my sign says Fuck Up
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-19 21:43:59	@serial_insomnia Thanks sweetie. The hormonal jazz does go away eventually but not so comforting at the time. Same with a Bipolar episode?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-19 21:22:53	Extra fun for women with mood disorders: hormonal cycles? Feel like wearing big sign around neck that says "Fuck Up"
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-19 05:08:39	I just had the best take away burger from a Chinese Restaurant. Which then begs the question...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-19 05:06:34	PA the "TA" just bought a Sphyg.! Will bring to class with Steth. Instructor had ex-students steal a bunch or her stuff! *frowns* Not nice!

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-18 07:17:08	Things May Be A Bit Quiet Around Here...: http://wp.me/p3M8c-Z1
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-18 06:46:49	@VandWsMommy LOL! Just about to put up blog post about more insanity. I am now teaching? I am to come up with tomorrow's Lesson Plan! OMG.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-17 06:47:51	I need more laptops on my Bed/Office/Closet/Pharmacy. I don't quite look like NORAD yet.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-17 06:27:35	I'm sorry if I'm sounding odd on Twitter. I'm having thought processes I can't explain. I may be in some kind of heavy Aspie Mode.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-17 06:13:01	*debating when to start working again after responding to email*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-17 06:11:44	@Canageek Thanks for the Bye.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-17 06:11:37	@VandWsMommy I think I actually DID mean "Goodbye." Lordy.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-17 06:11:07	@FroggyPrinceMom Goodbye. Hello. Hello. Goodbye. What am I even typing here?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-17 06:08:50	@raphaelmalikian LOL @CRYPTOCOCCUS bolting and head exploding. I'm so exhausted right now, I'd just let it come and get me.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-17 04:43:37	Maybe six hours of broken sleep? More work due tomorrow. Any chance of success in this world? Do NOT miss deadlines.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-16 09:58:07	Goodbye.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-16 09:43:11	Oh these questions from this chapter...you've GOT to be kidding! So...just when am I going to get to bed tonight? *rolls eyes*

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-16 07:56:49	@EnigmaAnonymous Still, need to do the damn reading as well. Will print this off and take a five minute break? *rolls eyes*

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-16 07:45:10	@EnigmaAnonymous Oh I'm half way there! *shakes head* Almost done computer application work, now need to read 30 pages and do exercises.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-16 07:40:44	*tightens noose around neck*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-16 06:24:27	Couldn't afford Netbook but it's saving my ass! Been rebuilding my db for hrs but can print & manage assignment! Only part way through tho?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-16 03:46:28	Interesting...in a "Screw You Anti-Vaccer's!!!" kind of way... http://bit.ly/9yHQAG #autism #aspergers
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-16 03:33:52	Plus another 30 page Chapter and work for it! May have saved some data on mini USB I brought in but I don't think so...need to check still.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-16 03:31:40	@Acrimonia LOL! Indeed. Way too much running through my peanut head right now. *crosses eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-16 03:30:56	School owner nuked majority of my files on computer while trying 2 get things 2 print. Good I got s/w put on my machine @home? Due 2tmrw!

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-16 03:26:46	Busier than a one armed paper hanger who's deaf, blind, mute...and also has all of my diagnoses.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 07:03:24	"My eyes are glazing over like they never have before..." (to the tune of The Battle Hymn of the Republic while shakily holding textbook.)
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 07:01:06	@EpilepsyCures LOL Loves ya right back!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 05:44:33	Does anyone else experience near euphoria from cleaning out their Inbox?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 05:25:50	@asdquefty I have no clue but there are SO many other s/w platforms in the field. This is just for study purpose. They are all similar?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 05:15:23	@asdquefty Not to mention just got it installed so I need to build up my db all over again to even begin. Tedious Maximus.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 05:12:43	@asdquefty Oh you would be bored to TEARS with it! VERY simple db but ugly as sin due to a ba-jillion different codes and user precision!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 05:10:48	@Canageek Thanks. I think I may have screwed my crazy Aspie head on a bit tighter since this morning! *hug*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 05:08:49	Alright ONE less chapter down on Medical Billing! On to the next? I still have to start tinkering with the software just downloaded! *groan*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 03:55:25	@raphaelmalikian No! I am VERY precise about my scrubs! They MUST be from actual hospitals!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 03:54:56	@shiv379 Hmmm...should I take your word for that or be complimented that I'm the first? *ponders*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 03:43:25	Seriously losing my concentration but is it my own fault? @shiv379
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 02:14:00	@EpilepsyCures LOL! Me? Stable? I love your sense of humour! I always have, dear! *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:58:40	@333AutismNews about something too. I hope you are okay *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:58:16	@333AutismNews Really. I'd never heard of such a thing. People are strange. Who cares about Followers! I don't! I see you got a bit upset
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:55:08	@333AutismNews Wot? People sending you DMs about getting Follows? Do you mean you following them personally? Or how to get more? Sounds odd?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:51:31	And the next question of the day: When do I start tackling the mountain of work I have to do? *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:37:44	Why does this one seem to ring some bells? Huh. ♫ http://blip.fm/~musls
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:21:51	@shiv379 Will DM. And if anyone else wants to know I can DM you as well.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:21:18	@shiv379 I shouldn't type it here or bloody hell! I'll get nailed with so many dirty Follows and they've stayed away for a while. Amazing!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:20:14	@shiv379 LOL! Scary thought that! This thing is plastic but still pretty scary too! I got the most hilarious search term on my blog ages ago
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:19:13	@asdquefty Coolness.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:15:10	@asdquefty Yes bright displays in darkened spaces get to me after a while too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:14:18	@asdquefty Very cool. I don't think I could ever use one with my ADD reading issues. Also I LOVE the touch, feel and smell of real books!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:12:26	@asdquefty Awesome Possum! Score!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:10:01	@asdquefty Gotcha on the math. Also I know you are a total geek dahling! Awesome pressie though? Better than some godawful sweater? Socks?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:08:21	@wayoutosphere Thanks for that. It takes me back to my younger days of being a wee Goth!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 01:07:03	There's a crushed baby bottle that somehow got into my backyard. It looks like a giant used condom.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 00:57:52	@raphaelmalikian I should get YOU to send me some scrubs for my serious "Scrubs Fetish." Not kidding, there. It's really bad. Really. LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 00:56:44	They ordered scrubs for school. Same for all. Group settled on royal to dark blue? *shrugs* Colour I don't have! No patterns thanks! Barf!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 00:53:58	@shiv379 LOL! Thanks hun! I always say, tickle my feet and I'm yours forever!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 00:38:27	listening to "The Mission UK - Wasteland" ♫ http://blip.fm/~muoq2
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 00:30:17	@shiv379 Thanks Bear. Although I can't stand being tickled! Except for me feet! I love that! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 00:28:09	@asdquefty Is it the ADD hyperfocus? Not sure if you enjoy math? I think you said it causes you great agony, actually.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 00:20:23	@shiv379 Thanks hun. *cuddles* But won't you play with bouncy Tigger-girly too? *stares with big brown eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 00:09:51	@asdquefty Interesting to note. Well good that you are aware of it!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 00:04:38	@asdquefty Hang in there. I can't even figure where the hell I am! I got enough sleep but that's not the issue at all! I could sleep all day
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 00:03:13	@EpilepsyCures Sure will hon' I seem to be, well, not sure but a bit more stable *knocks head as if wood* Good to hear about your hair! xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-15 00:01:39	Happy Aspie DST Weekend! Woke up crying! I'm all stimmy and crazy! Why the time changes affect so many of us is beyond me!

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-13 23:32:57	@BearTwinsMom I know! I had to take TWO of my Valium the other day! I don't know what was wrong with me! In school, the regular deal...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-13 23:30:47	@BearTwinsMom Maybe that's what's wrong with me and why @AspiePenguin is talking about! I've been bonkers for days now! Starting early?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-13 23:29:59	@BearTwinsMom Oh, I hear you! I've been dreading the Daylight Savings Time change! I'm going to go all crazy in the head!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-13 23:11:38	@EpilepsyCures Thanks for the mention hon. You just reminded me, had a couple of seizures that I need to document in my notes! I forgot! xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-13 23:11:00	@chloelowewew11 Thanks for the mention!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-13 23:10:39	@raphaelmalikian Sorry wasn't around for my exam. What's the punishment? Truant officer? F as a mark? Erm...something else?

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-12 09:06:14	Had blood drawn today. Am now experiencing "heinous veinous painous." Yes, that is a proper medical term.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-12 08:11:24	@YogaChicky Why do you think I like it so much? *raises eyebrows*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-12 08:08:14	@serial_insomnia You're welcome sweetie. xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-12 08:07:49	@YogaChicky I know! I've always had an affinity for Pluto! It's so wee and tiny and cute. I feel bad for it too. So far away and lonely!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-12 07:55:57	@serial_insomnia Oh hon'! *hugs* Not good...sorries...

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-10 07:54:31	Alright, time for some self-care. Yes, you read that right! Or as much self-care as I can do with myself. I'm spinning my wheels. Stupid.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-10 06:57:38	OMG. I'd dusted. I want to engage in the "Triad Cuddle Pretzel Flop" right now. @shiv379 @catatonickid

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-08 08:35:27	Crap. Just got home. I guess that means I have to work now? *sighs*

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-08 04:15:12	I seem to have slipped into some bizarre hybrid of speaking that makes me sound like I am from both England and Oz. I am truly odd.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-08 04:11:47	@shiv379 Cutie! LOL! Well it's quite well stocked now if you're still hungry! Come on over!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-08 01:34:10	Oh dear! Must remember to put on pants when Grocery Man comes to pick me up! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-08 01:29:38	Almost like spring outside! Having belated birthday brunch with P. too. Shaping up to be a good day?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-08 01:16:50	Seriously, though. I have so little food you could probably hear the wind blowing though my cupboards. Need to buy entire grocery store.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-08 01:15:28	Grocery shopping today! I think I will need to buy the entire store! The larder is "Bear!" @shiv379
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-08 01:04:10	@shiv379 Thanks hun. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 08:59:24	Alright, time for some serious nose-book-burying. Only 70 pages!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 08:38:46	I fail to understand why things that shouldn't bother me at all do quite a bit at times. Because I am human? Doesn't mean I have to like it.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 08:02:04	Hmmm...I need to do some schoolwork. I see. Or maybe I don't see. *shakes head* Redirect focus? Oh, PA you silly girl!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 07:58:37	@dorfird Thanks hon. *hug*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 07:52:58	@Canageek Thanks. I think I'm okay...I think? *thinks thinks thinks*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 07:50:09	@Canageek A PTSD Bell goes off in my head and then it's, "PA! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! What did you just do?!?!?!"
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 07:49:15	@Canageek will come out with something that makes a lot of sense! Then some time later it comes back to bite me in the ass when I clue in.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 07:48:27	@Canageek LOL. Long story. Family stuff (surprise?) Actually if I don't fall apart it's rather amusing. It works like this. My logical mind
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 07:41:23	OMG! My mentalness never ceases to amaze me! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 07:22:59	Let me think...let me think... Of course I'm going to think! *laughing* Maybe not so bad? Or at all? *ponders*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 07:19:02	Shit.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 07:18:37	Uh oh...did I just take my own brain in a stupid PTSD direction again? *head desk bang* Bugger! Oh, well. Can't change my life...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 05:36:09	pharmacological expert (hardly!) but it also could have a lot to do with our own bodies plus other meds we are on!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 05:35:32	@asdquefty Hard to say, I'd think. You never know. Even individual drugs within the same class can be "different." I don't profess to be a

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 05:28:12	@asdquefty LMAO! Now there's a nice warning!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 05:22:23	@asdquefty worked before but all it did was make me feel sick and no fix for my back! Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 05:21:59	@asdquefty That's too bad. Reminds me of when I was laid up last summer w/ my back thrown and I took Myoflex. Bad reaction as it had always
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 03:42:39	@asdquefty Just my last blip.fm It's one of those poppy dance type songs that's kind of funny. Earworm. Makes you want to bounce around.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 03:41:15	@Canageek LOL I've been told I'm alright but I swear if I ever looked in a mirror while dancing I'd NEVER dance again!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 03:18:06	*dances around like a total spaz* O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 03:16:19	listening to "Information Society - Peace & Love, Inc." ♫ http://blip.fm/~mbzwj
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 02:52:23	@Canageek Hey it's okay! More than!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 02:47:22	@Canageek I'm SO glad I still have him! 30-40 years old now! I still have my first baby blank too! Awesome!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 02:46:18	@Canageek Thanks. I did sleep with "Teddy" not long ago when I was going through a rough time you know? PTSD stuff. Have him for comfort.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 02:44:39	@catatonickid @shiv379 Oh, okay! I get it now! Thanks! Yes, I look like a wee one. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-07 02:43:59	@Canageek Awww...well, I do have some animals & actually have "Teddy." My first stuffed animal given to me when I was a baby. He's a bear!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 11:20:50	Okay, I think I just might be at the point where I can settle down enough to rest? Meddy and beddy? Ni ni all.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 11:18:39	@benpolar you were to have more? Time to go see the doc!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 11:18:21	@benpolar They can come in all sorts of different types so hard to say. If this is an isolated incident then maybe just a bad headache. If
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 10:22:52	@aspieteach Glad to be of assistance, darling! Know that Dr. PA is always on call! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 10:15:31	@aspieteach Okay. Neurological differences between unilateral and bilateral. I have more "rare" migraines where no hemispherical dominance.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 10:11:57	@aspieteach Smelling odd things. I can relate. My olfactory seizures. However, I've never noted anything via single hemispheric dominance!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 10:09:31	@benpolar Oh, I'm scrolling and reading you! Yes that does ring true as a possible sign of a migraine. Have you ever had one/them before?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 10:08:02	@benpolar Hey I hear you! I try and solve everyone else's "issues" that then mess up my "issues!"
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 10:07:07	@benpolar *hugs* I hope you feel better soon and the pain goes away. *places cool cloth on your forehead*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:44:58	Wow @AspieTribe is really nailing my ASSpie ass today! W00t! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:42:29	@FroggyPrinceMom I've pulled that one as a real groaner on my blog before. It's a pitiful stab at my love of word play, I must confess.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:31:57	@FroggyPrinceMom Thanks for the RT This ASSpie has a good sense of humour!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:31:21	@spectrumdweller Yes, for sure. Anytime you want. Whatever you wish! It would be good to hear from you too?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:29:31	@FroggyPrinceMom that business) however, when I traced it all the way back to childhood to present, it is V. clear that I am an Aspie!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:28:54	@FroggyPrinceMom Well thing is, I wouldn't likely get a Dx. as I would be perceived as too "High Functioning" (loathe that, made a post abt
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:25:39	@FroggyPrinceMom Oh, I know. It's all good. you're not an ass. There's some Aspie bluntness for you! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:24:49	@FroggyPrinceMom Yes, 'tis true. Wow. I really AM in Aspie Literal Mode talking to you now LOL! Everything I am interpreting... Holy Cats!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:21:22	@FroggyPrinceMom Okay, sorry about that. I didn't understand what you were asking to be honest. I went all Aspie literal, really.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:20:48	@FroggyPrinceMom Yes. I am also uber-analytical (to a fault!) and can be v. logical (or not!) I have sometimes strange thinking processes.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:18:35	@FroggyPrinceMom But thanks about it being impressive? and I don't know if I answered your question? Maybe the Aspie narrowed focus?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:16:42	@FroggyPrinceMom to this day I still don't understand my own blog! I know I never will!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:16:19	@FroggyPrinceMom much about it as psych/neuro IS my narrowed focus of interest! Aha! Also being anonymous I do go into personal things but
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:15:22	@FroggyPrinceMom the ADD hyperfocus and Aspie narrowed focus of interest but downside is comorbids fuck me up. Too much going on. I talk so
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:14:30	@FroggyPrinceMom but oh no! Ppl can gain more insight via my blog. Some of my mentalness does give me an edge w/ all of the comorbids like
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:13:22	@FroggyPrinceMom personal. Thus ppl can relate poss. via my experiences. But more things are there. I may appear "high functioning" @times
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:12:18	@FroggyPrinceMom Ok this may be a long answer. Ppl know me as PA & via my blog? Not so much Twitter? My blog is primarily psych. & V. V.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:07:40	@FroggyPrinceMom psych and mental stuff so much?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:07:28	@FroggyPrinceMom LOL! Good question! What issues do I NOT have. Seriously though. Idk what you mean. Do you mean because I blab on about my
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:05:06	@FroggyPrinceMom "Aspie Inside Out Underwear!" Guilty as charged.*hangs head*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 09:01:13	@FroggyPrinceMom *nods* Hell, I still have "issues" dressing myself at times and I'm an adult! LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:59:51	@padmeamidala Sleep with something of his for comfort?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:58:37	@FroggyPrinceMom For sure and that only makes sense. Each case, child, physican...all different! Again, you're already way ahead of the game
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:57:36	@FroggyPrinceMom Yes it can be tough to get the kids in and out of regular clothes! Forget anything like costumes that are more complicated!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:55:52	@FroggyPrinceMom Well, you're educated enough! So many parents have no clue.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:50:27	@FroggyPrinceMom you know what is best for him.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:50:14	@FroggyPrinceMom Not to worry about "costuming!" I also won't get into my feelings about kids and meds here, not enough space. But I know
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:48:28	@chloelowewew11 Sorry you're not well. Hello new baby! I'm not always that great at names but...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:45:11	@FroggyPrinceMom Well if more troubles then certainly, no more complications.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:44:22	@FroggyPrinceMom Yep, the poetic works as well!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:44:05	@FroggyPrinceMom I agree. Kids and meds...how old is he? Young, right? Kids and meds...oh, dear! A real, bloody hot potato issue, there!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:43:04	@FroggyPrinceMom LOL! I was just thinking we'd be funny together as two spazzy "kids." And the costumes...playing dress up is awesome!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:39:15	@Canageek *giggles*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:38:10	@Canageek Thanks hon. *snuggles*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:34:48	@FroggyPrinceMom Awww. I will be sure to give wee FP much more attention then! *grins* I can adopt him as a "baby test tube?"
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:32:48	@FroggyPrinceMom *pats FP on head*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:31:48	@Canageek Indeed. Don't want a repeater of the absolute TORTURE of last weekend. *shudders* Hell, more than shudders!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:28:25	@BearTwinsMom Hey there. Solo is good? You can get some rest?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:17:10	@Canageek My mood is okay though! That's good! LOL! *shakes exhausted head*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:16:23	@Canageek I think I'll pop a Valium and some Gravol to ease my tummy upset-ness. That might be a good idea. Restless and sicky feeling.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:15:26	@Canageek Thanks love. I haven't made myself (or have anything make myself) this tired in I don't know how long! I'll be alright though.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:13:54	@BurlyQEinstein Hehe! I remember that song!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:13:27	@BurlyQEinstein Yes hun. *hugs tight* We will!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:12:58	@Canageek though because I am so tired I feel physically ill.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:12:32	@Canageek BEYOND overtired right now. So far past exhaustion that I can not rest. So just stay up until a suitable time to crash. It's bad
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:11:33	@Canageek Well I'd never sleep for the rest of my life if I didn't have my Seroquel! Fine, exxageration but you know my insomnia! I'm just
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:04:04	@BurlyQEinstein I have faith in you and remember our "pact?" To stay strong? Let's still stick to that, okay?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:02:47	@raphaelmalikian I absolutely agree with you. When I blog re: medicine I try to include as many citations as I can. Otherwise ppl can e. me.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:00:37	@BurlyQEinstein *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 08:00:07	@Canageek I should probably try watching some mind numbing television or something? sighs* It's like I'm on a countdown to meddy time!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 07:57:32	@Canageek xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 07:57:10	@BurlyQEinstein You ARE truly awesome. I told you that when we first met and I started reading your blog! *grins and hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 07:56:16	@Canageek Hey, I told you (and everyone else reading!) Left to my own "devices...?" *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 07:54:26	@Canageek Hi *hugs* School's knocked the stuffing out of me this week! Had a lie down, read, played about... LOL! No rest for the wicked?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 07:46:39	@Canageek I just signed back on. Apparently I'm too tired to rest! Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 06:06:27	Okay! Sleep Deprivation wins! Time to flop! Laters...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 06:02:02	@FroggyPrinceMom Well he was really a grad student/TA or whatever but still, teaching the class? Or something? Years ago but so funny!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:59:37	@FroggyPrinceMom Hey, I had a prof ask me out on a "date" but as a crazy Aspie I didn't get the social cues! Then I told him I was gay duh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:56:10	@FroggyPrinceMom For sure. You're only doing yourself a disservice if you don't make the best of it.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:50:34	@FroggyPrinceMom her motivated. We're in a cycle. also we get along famously personally as well.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:50:03	@FroggyPrinceMom she sees it and is v. v. good. She wants her students to learn and get us jobs! So when she has a motivated student it gets
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:49:21	@FroggyPrinceMom For this one I think it's combined. also my Instructor loves me LOL! Kind of embarrassing to write that but I'm keen and
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:47:01	@FroggyPrinceMom freak at all! It's just that I work very hard no matter what I do so it matters how it is reflected upon me.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:46:15	@FroggyPrinceMom *nods again* I was a bit better if your marks came from your own work but if from group as a whole? ARGH. I'm not a control
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:41:41	@FroggyPrinceMom *nods* I don't do well in group projects at all!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:38:56	@FroggyPrinceMom Exactly! It's been a real mess as the other girls just have NO clue! Both the Instructor and I have been going bonkers!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:38:15	@spectrumdweller Oh hey. Hi. We haven't talked much. What's up? e. me if you want to chat? Going off meds? Ooh. That makes me worry!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:36:37	@333AutismNews novels as pressies? I have no money but a little treat? only $40 so not too much?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:36:05	@333AutismNews Yay Stephy! Ah, whatev. about my birthday *shrug* Really busy with school stuff yesterday! Although bought myself two graphic
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:35:11	@FroggyPrinceMom No, nothing special. Unless you call going out of your mind trying to manage a group assignment with dummies "special."
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:30:26	@shiv379 I was so tired I thought I was going to heave in class today! So I'm having upset tummy too? Just different?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:29:39	@FroggyPrinceMom Awww...thanks sweetie! You're awesome! *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:28:11	@shiv379 I think I may need a lie down now! Last night was MEGA sleep deprivation! So glad it's Friday. Deal with homework later!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:27:01	@333AutismNews LOL! Thanks for the #FF and more birthday mentions and shenanigans! Don't think I can post today. Too exhausted!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:26:11	@shiv379 Yeah. What a drag, love. I hope you feel better soon. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:25:24	@shamefreeloser My email is on my blog but either way patientanonymous (at) gmail (dot) com feel free to e. me.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 05:00:24	@shamefreeloser but also Adium app. that works with all chat apps.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 04:59:58	@shamefreeloser Yes, the old "Would you like some cheese with your...?" I don't have Yahoo as a personal. Just my gmail and an MSN, Skype
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 04:56:50	@shiv379 Aw, poor dearie. Why don't you have a wee lie down? I know the pain! Anything to help with it or settle the tum in the house?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 04:51:55	@EnigmaAnonymous Sure! Come on up and live here! I think we're awesome! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 04:48:55	@shiv379 Sorry your not feeling well from that huns! *hugs* Gentle ones! But you'll still have to eat again!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 04:44:44	@readheadgirl Lucky you! I've just been writing about how I want sex now LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 04:43:28	I need to come up with some blog fodder too. Things have been kind of quiet around PAs pad but I have been pretty helter skelter...? Hmmm...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 04:19:00	@melankolyme NP. Again, I have no ego to shatter. I suppose you will have to wait until you get home, then? I will have to wait until never?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 04:08:37	@melankolyme LMAO! Hey! Is that an offer? If so, that's #1! If not, I'll try not to let it shatter my ego that I don't actually have anyway.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 04:01:15	@mama_kass Thanks. Well, as you know, I always tell it like it is! Today, I guess I'm just really telling it! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 04:00:17	@Canageek Not a problem. I actually winked at this really cute girl on transit on the way home from school. ROTFLMAO! Yes, I need sex.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 03:59:06	@mama_kass *smirks* Yes, I'm feeling rather blunt today. Among other things, apparently?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 03:58:29	@catatonickid @YogaChicky @shiv379 Wee bub? I think I missed this entire conversation or thread or something...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 03:57:54	@BurlyQEinstein Yes, sometimes my memory works too? I think? I can't always remember when it does. *groan*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 03:56:55	@Acrimonia Good luck, indeed! I don't necessarily expect to get lucky. Wishful thinking...?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 03:55:23	@Canageek LMAO! Thanks for that. Again, see if anyone wants me? *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 03:54:16	@Acrimonia That's okay. I don't know if anyone can? We'll see if I get any takers!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-06 03:50:19	I could really do with some sex right now. O.o No. Serously. LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 13:09:50	@asdquefty Oh wow! Holy birthday love! *PA sits stunned* OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX OX And can't 4get ( ) LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 13:04:36	@asdquefty *claps* You have such a nice voice! *laughing* Thanks hon! xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 12:26:29	@BurlyQEinstein Really? OMG! I thought it was kind of a lark or idk, forgotten but idk what to say now! *blushes* Birthday pressie? ACK!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 12:24:01	@BurlyQEinstein Absolutely! Graphic Novels, Manga...whatever! I still want my drawing from you too! *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 12:21:03	@BurlyQEinstein Thanks hon. It's "almost" over but whatev. We can celebrate around the world! All time zones applicable! xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 12:16:18	What a freakin' birthday, huh? More like a "deathday." I did splurge and buy myself a couple of graphic novels as pressies though *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 12:13:44	Ah, let's go for broke and be like a "real medical student!" I'll work on the chapter homework now and get even less sleep! *laughs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 11:41:16	*swallows handful of Advil for pounding headache*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 11:32:08	I am cursed with more sleep deprivation...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 11:29:44	OMG! OMG! OMG! One of the girls from class just called me to make more changes to our assignment! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 09:51:00	@hidama She's taking so many steps herself to get me where I need to be as I'm willing to do extra work so we're total partners in this
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 09:49:56	@hidama studying is what I love. I'm a med geek. Hello! She knows that and we get on personally too. She's also really motivated herself.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 09:47:52	@hidama It's not that it's dull. I love what I'm studying I'm just exhausted! And my Instructor loves me LOL Not to boast but what I'm
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 09:36:40	@hidama Good to hear you're doing well though!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 09:36:18	@hidama go through the motions and toss out answers in class. We'll see how far I can go and if I pass out. Idk. Fading fast?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 09:35:26	@hidama Thanks. I deviated from my normal of taking notes & just read. There are exercises to do so taking a break? I may skip them and just
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 09:29:41	@hidama How are you?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 09:28:41	@hidama I think so? Maybe? Just tried to get through 30 pages of my textbook for tomorrow and am v. v. sleep deprived. Brain=Mush... Wahh...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 09:23:04	*gurgle* *bbbbbb* *twitch twitch* *stares* O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 07:41:27	Three pages out of 30 done... *falls over*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 07:08:28	*goes to make cuppa in hope of waking up some* Afraid sleep deprivation kicking in now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 07:02:26	So much work to do... But.Just.Want.To.Sleep. Right.Now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 06:10:03	LMAO! Reading email from sister. She met "a certain playwright" (i.e. not some hack) who became rather stalkerish! OMG! Good goss though!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 06:02:05	@aspieteach Oh forgot to say, along with my choco chip, I have some carrot walnut ones too. I feel like the former though.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 06:01:23	@aspieteach Thanks!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 05:59:06	That's it! I need something nice to drink and a chocolate chip muffin! *stamps feet*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 05:58:13	@Canageek And it's not about my work. I'm all done! through! Clean as a whistle! Do you think I want to lollygag with this business?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 05:57:28	@Canageek Thanks hon. I swear, though! WTF? I come home and see a question from the Instructor in response to what I sent her earlier today?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 05:49:34	Not to boast, but am I and the Instructor the only two that have working brain cells in our class? The other group didn't even finish!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 05:48:08	Still going back and forth with the Instructor re: our assignment! I just came home to an email from her re: the other girls' work! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 05:34:07	@EnigmaAnonymous Thanks hon. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 05:33:55	@BurlyQEinstein YW hon. I know going out helps me A LOT w/ eating. It really does. Ppl told me it would, I didn't believe it but true *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 01:57:43	@333AutismNews I like you pesty and bratty. We are of similar ilk!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 01:57:04	@BurlyQEinstein Good for you! Another person who is going to eat--like me who has problems trying to eat? *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 01:55:11	@333AutismNews LOL Sure! I'm so hungry right now too! You are making me seriously die for cake... I'm buying cake on the way home dammit!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 01:53:25	@Canageek No kidding! I haven't been in school for several years, as well. It's been really weird to try and get my head into that space.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 01:50:18	@333AutismNews Although, I wouldn't ever turn down a piece of cake! Maybe I'll jut buy some cake on the way home, birthday or not LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 01:49:20	@333AutismNews No, I don't have any birthday plans. I'm not into my birthday really. *shrug*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 01:48:34	New Pretty Textbook=Mega Frackin' Work Tonight! I have to read an entire chapter. WHEE! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 01:46:42	I found out my bloods aren't fasting after all! I've been starving myself for nothing! I can not wait for lunch! Leaving soon for food!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 01:45:49	@333AutismNews Yes we were talking about that last night!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 01:43:31	@333AutismNews Thanks for remembering hon. *toots silly PA birthday horn*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 00:51:06	OFFS! The other girls didn't give me all of their information yesterday/last night!!! Have they even GONE to school???
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-05 00:27:26	Ooooh! Pretty, shiny, new textbook! *drools*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 23:07:01	OMG! This is hilarious! I'm getting my bloods done today and my orders are going to be used as an example for class! I offered. SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 23:05:51	@asdquefty Virginia Woolf is/was a writer. She drowned herself by filling up the pockets etc. of her dress with huge rocks!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 22:57:22	@asdquefty scrubs pockets with heavy rocks and try to pull a fairly decent Virginia Woolf? LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 22:56:35	@asdquefty the jokes I've been making. For example she has a pool and I said that if things get worse here I'll come over, fill up my...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 22:55:43	@asdquefty class and she called it back in front of everyone! We've also been emailing back and forth and she's been killing herself at...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 22:54:46	@asdquefty I'm not too worried about the assignment or anything w/ the Instructor. She knows I'm a med geek. I even called myself that in...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 22:53:49	@Acrimonia LOL Good to hear I'm not alone in my eating habits there!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 20:49:32	@shiv379 I'm the same age as I was before I turned another year over! Duh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 20:49:08	@shiv379 Funny thing is, I just about forget my own birthday every year! I do! Now after today I'll also be going around for months saying
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 20:48:23	@shiv379 Yes in your time zone! Hehe! That's okay. Again the fact that you remember is just so awfully sweet. Love you hun. *huggles*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 20:47:22	@YogaChicky Yes, can seems a problem! Thankfully last night it wasn't that, just some weird thing w/ email! I didn't get it when sent before
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 20:46:03	@asdquefty Good night and good morning! Online as had a wee worry about assignment! Want to add something quickly! Eep!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 12:26:29	Alright ni ni all.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 12:24:49	@MarcyRubin Yes try to relax hon and let's hope for sleep *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 12:24:14	Whew! All done now! Guess it's time for meddy and beddy...looks like I might get more sleep than last night?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 12:22:32	@Canageek Yeah. Well we'll see what the tests yield. Again could still be the same as before which wasn't a real medical Dx. *shrug*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 12:04:04	@Canageek If it's malabsorption, could be Crohn's that is just a bitch. Celiac? OMG! Nightmare! Gluten free and gluten is everywhere!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 12:03:23	@Canageek Yep, I have a wee bit of time so I'll see. Crap, I should try and sleep too? *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 12:03:00	@Canageek looking curiously like malabsorption. That could mean a couple of things but we need to do another scope beyond the bloods too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 12:02:26	@Canageek Thanks. It's one of those...good that they find a problem but bad that they find a...? May be just more of the last but kind of
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 12:00:57	@Canageek things like my anemia and other internal medicine functioning jazz.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 12:00:19	@Canageek It's not exactly a CBC/full panel but just about. For my gastro stuff so I have to show levels that would represent me low for
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:59:14	My personal work contribution is bigger than the entire group assignment itself! MED GEEK SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:42:39	@333AutismNews Yeah, that's something significant then.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:42:07	@Canageek LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:41:36	@asdquefty I just had apple portions with peanut butter. Yes, people I know it sounds strange but it's really good!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:40:56	@Canageek a short time left before water only!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:40:41	@Canageek Thanks smarty pants! I'm running around trying to do this and that and I'm like...what's fast that I can grab because I only have
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:39:31	I only fixed ONE of her errors...I am done! Whew! What else can I eat before I can't eat anymore? LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:36:44	@333AutismNews Yep. Although first trimester bleeding isn't that "rare" a thing. Only significant re: amount of blood and other factors.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:24:44	Should be ok. You just might feel a bit zoned or whatev. if muscle relaxant? Hey enjoy the ride!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:24:15	@EnigmaAnonymous Sorry forgot *hugs* as I'm getting too wingy over here!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:23:36	@EnigmaAnonymous Thanks. As it turns out, not too much info so should be done soon? I'm the one with all the info! Med Geek! SPAZ O.o LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:22:03	@benpolar YW hon. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:21:45	@asdquefty Yikes! Sorry to hear about the painies! Hope the meds work it out?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:21:14	okay! massive tech glitch! she sent me her stuff at bloody 1900hrs!!! Oh well, time to get cracking! and eating i have 2 start fasting!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:20:12	@333AutismNews Interesting. Thing is, with my mother, she lost a lot of of blood, then was examined and wee PA was still there!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:19:25	@asdquefty Yes, join the panic parade! I think I'm screwed as it's getting late here and still nothing! W.T.F. to the power of a mil.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 11:06:03	@YogaChicky I will never do FB! All of the bullies from my childhood and teen years (and adult?!) will find me... *whimpers*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:56:48	@YogaChicky Oh, I can send you some pics if you want hon. Tit for tat, though! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:56:13	Maybe I should grab some chow. I need to do fasting bloods tomorrow. That will kill some time LOL Sure, all of 10 minutes?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:55:17	@EnigmaAnonymous LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:54:10	@EnigmaAnonymous Nope! Have to be in class first thing in the morning and it's due tomorrow! See my problem?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:53:33	@Canageek Sure. The manual says "Don't Panic" and the answer is NOT 42!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:52:53	@MarcyRubin Awww...good for you, hon. *more big hugs* Good to cry and let it out as well.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:51:23	@EnigmaAnonymous her, I emailed her...I dunno what to dooooo...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:51:03	@EnigmaAnonymous Well there's nothing I can do! I'm just waiting staring at my Inbox! Fuck, take a Valium? How long do I stay up? I called
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:49:31	@immithemad Well that's good you seem to be alright with an AC? I looooooooove my ACs! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:48:35	Let's take a vote. When do I start to panic over my group assignment? Now?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:47:30	@MarcyRubin Well know I care about you! That's for sure. xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:47:09	@333AutismNews You're funny. Didn't know you had a twin though. Supposedly I "had" one as mother miscarried during first trimester.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:46:06	@333AutismNews Okay. NOT funny. I just read that last tweet as you HAD cancer. yes, I am very tired...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:45:16	@333AutismNews Yeah that can happen sometimes. Weird monthly celebration overload.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:44:36	@FroggyPrinceMom @333AutismNews LOL! The world is seriously too small sometimes...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:44:06	more medically related stuff. Like some of the things we are going to learn in clinic and things we could even take in school on our own?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:42:05	@MarcyRubin Oh! I'm so sorry! *big hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:40:41	@immithemad Uh, yeah. Sounds like you might have a bit of a problem with the APs. Although studies show efficacy same as older ones.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:38:20	@333AutismNews That's funny. Over my lifetime I think I've met four or five people who've had the same birthday! Very odd!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:36:08	@333AutismNews Hey Steph is a Pisces like me! Mine is tomorrow.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:34:33	@Canageek Oh gawd! I don't think anyone or anything can help me with my chem! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:33:52	@immithemad Yes they can come with some that are unfavourable. Back a bit when I was on Zyprexa I gained some weight but boy I need that now
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:31:05	@Canageek Well, that is a bit funky. My chem. is BAD! Really, that is to be taken as a "relative" for reading a report but you need an idea?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:29:19	@Canageek Yeah! Of course I'd want to meet up again! Just let me know when you're coming. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:28:35	Well! My "personal" work is lovely! Did you know that the typical serum levels of ALP are 3.5-5.5 g/dL? Actually, I went a bit overboard...
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:24:58	@benpolar Okay hon. That makes me feel better. I worry about you, of course! *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:24:19	@immithemad The whole laptop throwing fantasy thing is sort of a mental stress reliever. I'd never throw baby MacBook anywhere!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:23:01	@immithemad Atypical Antipsychotics. Just the name of the newer generations of the class.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:22:25	I'll stop bitching now
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:21:58	Well, I'd planned on bringing baby MacBook to class anyway tomorrow but I may have to now for sure! WOMAN!!! WHERE ARE YOU??? *frowns*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:18:47	@benpolar I'm not kicking you when you're down. You know I love ya but not taking your meds will just make you feel worse. Take them for me?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:17:29	@EnigmaAnonymous I know. I prefer group assignments where you're marked individually even though you still work as a group.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:16:18	@benpolar *doles out spankings* Get your silly arse med compliant! RIGHT NOW! I'm not kidding.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:13:35	*begins having massive laptop throwing fantasies*

16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:12:38	@EnigmaAnonymous I've done the other girl's along with mine so great but did this girl pass out? Fall asleep? This will not go over well!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:11:48	@EnigmaAnonymous If it's not handed in all together it's going to count. Our separate work is going to be taken into consideration but 'geez
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:11:10	@EnigmaAnonymous I don't do well w/ group work at all either! Things got settled in class so okay but WTF about sending me the stuff? ARGH!
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:09:32	@immithemad Yes the Seroquel is ace. My insomnia has progressed over the years where I need to be knocked out with a sledgehammer. APs okay?
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:07:17	I'm getting more and more twitchy staring at my Inbox! Tick, tock...tick, tock... SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:05:20	@immithemad Yes, sometimes. Actually, shouldn't complain as my Seroquel is great! I was just up VERY late last night working on this already
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:03:45	@YogaChicky Those last two can attest to how young I do look as well. They've seen me! *winks* @shiv379 @catatonickid
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 10:01:57	I've seen her notes too! They're long as she's trying to pack a bunch of shit in! Trying to be smart and that's good but I need sleep? No.
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 09:59:53	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid Yes, just like our New Year's Eve Extravaganza! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 09:59:13	Am I going to be up all night waiting for this woman's portion of the assignment?! It's due tomorrow!!! *crosses eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-03-04 09:56:22	OMG. Group Assignments are fab! I said I'd type up everything and one girl hasn't sent me her stuff yet!!! I called and emailed!!! O.o

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 10:37:01	The school stuff. My PTSD. Why I'm so out of it. I'm dissociating. Trigger. All the fighting, the ostracism, me "the smart kid." That too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 09:12:53	@Canageek I know! So did J. & I but when we looked at what he bought we got a surprise! 0.5% won't hurt me either but this is totally safe!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 08:55:33	I'm drinking beer right now! W00t! Well...sort of? I'm not being bad! Beck's 0.0% Now that's a SERIOUS W00t because PA doesn't drink!!!

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 08:33:51	At least you guys are seeing how quickly I move as an Ultradiam Cycler? Depressed in morning and early aft. Euphoric hypomania later in day?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 08:32:49	Still cycling! On way over to J.'s Hello Grandiosity! *PA shakes hand with entire Universe* LOL Mind racing so much I feel like I'm on drugs

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 04:30:38	@FroggyPrinceMom True enough.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 04:17:20	OMG. I need to get moving but I.Don't.Care.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 04:16:54	@FroggyPrinceMom I'd like to think I am too but I don't know...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 04:06:17	@FroggyPrinceMom Hey any writing anyone does is good. if you're a writer just scratching whatever down is fab. like exercising your muscles
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:59:04	@FroggyPrinceMom Well usually when someone out to get you the story is long and the length of your play doesn't matter just that you did it
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:56:33	@FroggyPrinceMom That's cool. I'd LOVE to write a screenplay one day. That I've never done.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:34:19	@FroggyPrinceMom learning disabled. Well shit! I'm dragging myself into the poor house after being unemployed and I am crazy and well?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:33:37	@FroggyPrinceMom OFFS! People are stupid (gee understatement?) I'm applying for all of these scholarships now that make me look crazy and/or
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:32:12	@FroggyPrinceMom I avoided that in uni. course by taking position of directing & producing. Same as in high school as student gov. position
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:31:13	@FroggyPrinceMom I did lots even from when young but now have stage fright. Love acting so want to get over that so much.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:27:30	@FroggyPrinceMom Failed w/ every attempt as too mental to do it. Went bonkers every time.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:27:05	@FroggyPrinceMom no writing but I don't need that! *cough cough* I got most of my mandatories done in 1st year too but no BA. Still haven't
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:26:10	@FroggyPrinceMom LOL parties. Well me as an Aspie holy shit w/ the small talk. I had one mandatory fine arts so drama for me of course...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:09:00	@FroggyPrinceMom Yeah. Somethings you just can't be bothered w/ unless required.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:07:00	@FroggyPrinceMom That's cool. Good conversationlist at parties ha.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:06:30	@FroggyPrinceMom Sure we all have our "things" but I was so misguided & no support. Plus ADD and all over. As kid wanted to be archaelogist
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 03:00:36	@asdquefty NP. Take your time.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 02:57:20	@asdquefty Okay will do. Can you send me an e. to remind me though. I'll forget via these messages!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 02:44:29	@FroggyPrinceMom I studied arts too. I find it v. intriguing that now later I am into sciences--at least human bodily sciences? Still.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 02:43:25	@FroggyPrinceMom Yes. A woman I used to work with who had some degree involving it said she just treated chem. like recipes! I was...?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 02:39:42	@FroggyPrinceMom Was thinking that chem is a lot like math. Maybe why I have problems with it.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 02:38:53	Have to go to J.'s today. Don't want to. Warned him I'm in Bipolar Hell. He said yeah you were pretty tightly wound Thursday. Bing! Trigger!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 02:37:17	@FroggyPrinceMom I did in high school and for uni Anatomy and Physiology. The Krebs Cycle still gives me nightmares in my sleep.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 02:22:08	@FroggyPrinceMom Yeah. Chem. was always a bugger for me in school. Still is. Well, nix math totally w/ the Dyscalculia.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:40:23	@buttonista I had one but he died a few years ago. People have said to get another but it was too traumatic. Thought about it but I can't.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:37:19	@buttonista Heh. Yes, you're the Crazy Cat Lady! I'm just plain old "Crazy." Can't argue the last point though?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:35:50	Yeah, maybe this might improve my mood. I could go for this. ♫ http://blip.fm/~luc60
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:31:58	@buttonista Well one thing to have a cute inside joke but then there's overkill, right?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:28:14	@buttonista Love it. And don't you go mad when people do that with gifts? I guess I'm lucky in that way. No one really gives me gifts? Haha.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:23:10	@buttonista *giggles* You are one funny girl. I struggle to find pictures of me where I'm not looking the same. Photogenically unoriginal.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:20:19	@asdquefty Actually, speaking of Spock, people have come to that side of me asking for advice! "Okay Spock. Tell me what to do here..."
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:19:21	@buttonista I like your avatar. You look like me (well not really like ME) but like me with a cuppa permanently attached to my face.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:18:10	@asdquefty Is there any other kind of logical way to be? Why do you think my alter ego is Spock?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:16:47	@Acrimonia Fanks. I do like to be logical.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:14:06	@Acrimonia Thanks. Go away full lacrimal glands! BAH! Just old baggage about wanting to appear and be "strong." Yes. *nods* Can't "fail." xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:12:17	@asdquefty Thanks hon. OXOXOX ( ) Can''t forget the wee horns! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:11:30	@buttonista Someone needs a nap? Or severeral? Or a very long one? At first I thought, soft object? Then it got worse? Lord.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:10:17	@Acrimonia Even when bitchy I'm logical? Or when crazy I'm logical? Idk. Still not thinking straight but even what I said there was logical?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:09:16	@catatonickid I don't know or think so. Just got up and am now in depression phase? Yesterday & last night was v. ugly. All I can say?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:07:18	@FroggyPrinceMom Yes, I need a "bubble check." Interestingly enough after our exchange got a chem. prof. follow. Good as am bad at chem.!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:05:51	@EnigmaAnonymous Thanks, *hugs back*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:05:39	Even on my blog it embarrasses me. But I suppose my blog may be another story. Damn.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:05:07	They have the strength to not throw their fits for public display as I don't IRL so should not do it here. I don't like to be seen that way.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-28 00:04:20	Sorries again every1 4 last night. Not that there's anything wrong w/ blowing off steam here bt lots of ppl I know refrain & I should too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 09:06:56	@FroggyPrinceMom *bubbling chemistry tube*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 09:06:33	I think I'd better go now. Sorries everyone for acting like an uber-arse. Yay Bipolar? No yay PA. Sorries again if I upset anyone.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 09:04:03	@shiv379 No, I'll have to d/l it. Later. I guess. Thanks tho. Hun.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 09:02:34	@FroggyPrinceMom Sorry. Didn't mean to be snarky. Like @AspiePenguin said, I'm making a mess here. Loved what you called me though. xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:55:40	I guess I'll finish with this one now, says: "Ms. Fill In The Blank." ♫ http://blip.fm/~lsz89
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:50:36	@FroggyPrinceMom Well a BIPOLAR CYCLING piece of shit. Things are bad.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:49:19	@FroggyPrinceMom I'm a piece of shit.

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:24:40	Maybe I can find a really "lovely" song to play right now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:21:06	@buttonista *nods*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:20:56	@BurlyQEinstein I shoveled snow today. Thought that would help. Nothing is helping. Nothing will. It's Bipolar. You ride it out. Painfully.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:20:06	@benpolar Nope. A trigger. That's all it took And takes...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:19:27	@buttonista However, I AM having MASSIVE laptop throwing fantasies right now. Over and over and over again in my head!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:18:29	@buttonista *laughing* Thanks. I needed that visual. I don't hit things (or people!)
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:17:10	@BurlyQEinstein I can't even do that! My brain is moving so fast I've been doing this then dropping it, something else then complete halt...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:15:42	I don't even get like this! Mixed State AND a Dysphoric Mania at the same time? Now even THAT would be a first for me as an Ultradian Cycler
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:14:27	I should STFU. Log off. I am the Queen of Snarkiness right now. Holy shit. "Real Time Cycling on Twitter!"
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:13:14	@asdquefty Well get reast anyway. Does it matter what made you tired? You're still tired, right?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:12:48	@buttonista I was talking about shooting myself but good one.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:12:33	@BurlyQEinstein Thanks hun. xo Ultradian Tornado? Comes in like hell, tears everything to shreds but over fast? Fuck off Bipolar.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:10:57	Christ, I just put in a blody CD five minutes ago and I haven't hit "Play" yet! Anybody have a gun handy?

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:08:55	@asdquefty Thanks sorry you're tired. Get rest.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:08:39	@EnigmaAnonymous Well, I've been avoiding contact with everyone. Safer that way?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:08:04	Gee, I can't decide if this is the "Twitterverse" or the "Triggerverse!" You see? My head just ain't fucking right, kiddies! Go Ultradian!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:05:46	@shiv379 Thanks *cuddles*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:05:19	I may need to leave for the safety of the entire goddamn Twitter population it's fucking ugly. I may say some fucking ugly things!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 08:03:03	I'm back but may vanish again very soon. I'm cycling so fast I can barely keep up with myself. Not.Fucking.Pretty.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 03:19:11	Ugh. Signing off again! I am going mad!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 03:18:29	I can not remember the last time I have felt so utterly cranky. PA does not "do" cranky. Being so cranky is MAKING her cranky!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-27 03:16:57	Have managed to be moderately productive. Am now in moderately(?) better mood.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-26 22:51:07	Laters. Need to try and redirect all of this somewhere else.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-26 22:49:06	No school today. Instructor REALLY sick. Hope I'm not responsible! *sighs* More talk w/ School Dude on phone abt what a damn mess it all is.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-26 22:46:24	@EnigmaAnonymous Too complicated 2 explain. Descended in mood last night so took a Valium and then took frustrations out on Word document.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-26 04:18:43	Why am I laughing? Is it funny? Is it not? I don't know. *shakes head* Not a good day... *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-26 04:16:54	I am "Diplomatically" telling everyone to STFU!!! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-26 04:15:26	What @AspiePenguin says is true. Normally I would just sit back and avoid it all but I'm trying to help everyone get along. I need to learn!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-26 04:07:34	My diplomacy skills are getting a SERIOUS workout. Some girls in class need a SERIOUS attitude adjustment.

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 08:36:03	@FroggyPrinceMom Yeah? Well u know bubbling chemistry beaker me! I'll be right in there but even though it will be cool kind of intimidating
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 07:50:33	@gregvaneekhout LMAO! "minor surgery!" I love it! That sounds like a lot of days I actually have, really...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 07:48:31	@FroggyPrinceMom *giggles* Still sick. *shrugs* Apart from that pleased with school. Excited about Clinic Rotations but kind of scared too!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 07:29:35	@asdquefty LOL! I hope this program will! And if it does, since I'm so keen and can get what I want, yes I'll be Aspie Geek!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 07:26:26	Currently looking at more schooling even though I'm not finished with this program yet. Would have to wait until I found a job here! O.o

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 06:12:55	@TriniGirlBlue @buttonista WHEE!!!!!!!!!!!!! You're welcome sweetie! We were all thinking of each other!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 06:01:05	@FroggyPrinceMom Oh absolutely! With an open wound like that! Insanity not to cover it! For healing, pain and infection!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 05:59:57	@FroggyPrinceMom It may depend upon injury?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 05:59:47	@FroggyPrinceMom Yeah, initial pain at injury site, then immune response rushing in to repair and then maybe some pain later in healing?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 05:58:27	@FroggyPrinceMom That's good (at least!) Keep clean and dry, some antibiotic cream when bandaged to help healing. Bugger!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 05:56:40	@TriniGirlBlue @shiv379 @catatonickid @YogaChicky Groovy! You should have seen me when I opened my stuff LOL. TOTAL ASPIE SPAZ O.o

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 04:45:59	@aspieteach If so, yes! Lovely even if not the "real" thing. Even if not Varsity--still lovely!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-25 04:45:21	@aspieteach I'm not sure about "Varsity" but these are called "V-PEN?" Maybe that stands for Varsity? It doesn't say that on the package tho
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-24 09:47:38	@EnigmaAnonymous Yes. I should probably get off my computer. That would be a good start to the whole eating thing. Go to the kitchen?

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-23 05:45:55	@benpolar Still thanks hon. It's okay. When you have Epilepsy and the seizure types I do sometimes head injuries are just part of the deal.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-23 05:45:06	@benpolar Well the brick wall couldn't be avoided. I was seizing. The other? Well people are assholes and that can't be avoided either? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-23 05:41:04	@benpolar Or maybe it was the concussion some asshole gave me when I was seizing and they thought I was drunk or something! That was fun!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-23 05:40:13	@benpolar I'll exclude the tonic-clonic but I think my favourite was sliding down to the ground shaking uncontrollably & hitting brick wall!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-23 05:38:31	@benpolar Not when it's hard and it hurts. Not to mention I've had more head injuries in this year alone for my entire lifetime!

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-22 11:32:20	@EnigmaAnonymous *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-22 11:26:37	@EnigmaAnonymous Yeah, so do I...ranty blog post coming up.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-22 02:03:20	Did anyone see the movie Le Divorce? I know, it came out 2003. Quite a while back.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-22 01:28:38	@Canageek Ha. No problem. If you read my blog post you'll get a better idea of the whole issue and my concerns.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-22 01:27:14	@Canageek second antibiotic and what other one? Regardless, need another and oral route may not work overall, plus bad for my own resistance
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-22 01:26:11	@Canageek Did you read my post? Idk. Again this one should do it. More concerned with excreting one pill and malabsorption issue. This is
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-22 00:00:22	@333AutismNews Yeah so not all bad *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:56:03	@333AutismNews travel either. That may be another plus?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:55:48	@333AutismNews Oh no! Poor thing. I guess that just goes to show that she had a good time at least! Also good that maybe she's not afraid to
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:51:18	@333AutismNews Cool! I forgot to ask how was your trip? Awesome I'll bet.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:46:56	@333AutismNews Anyway how are you? I apparently sound a bit cranky LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:45:56	@EnigmaAnonymous YW hon.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:45:51	@333AutismNews is that the problem? not the bronchitis or the drugs? Now that is screwy and messy.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:44:46	@333AutismNews all in my post and even the possibilities of malabsorption? I fail 2 understand why I am not getting better. So is it my body
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:43:15	@333AutismNews Oh still and sick and crap. Like I expected anything else? Am going to have to go back and talk to them about everything..
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:42:06	@EnigmaAnonymous And I hope you feel better soon. Go away headache. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:41:33	@EnigmaAnonymous Oh go ahead and be sad! It's okay! We can feel whatever we want whenever. It just can be an "inconvenience" to us at times.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:39:35	Take meds now or rest? I've been up for three hours and am feeling quite zoned. Maybe a little bed flop? A triad pretzel cuddle flop? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:35:07	@Canageek *grins at being called silly one* Basically the same. Maybe a wee bit better but still coughing, runny nose, tired. I'm concerned.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 23:34:01	@shiv379 Exactly *hugs* Hugs are good anytime! They don't expire! Or if they do come with an expiry don't hug the person giving them! Bastad

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-21 03:50:32	Okay this Malabsorption stuff isn't looking so great. Making some notes to mail off to Gastro Man now. Not to mention shitting out my pill?

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 10:43:13	@melankolyme actually have better insight as to what is or may really be going on in our lives. We are just too close to ourselves.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 10:42:37	@melankolyme I hear you. People say the same thing to me as well and ditto. However we can't see outside ourselves so at times others do
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 10:38:26	@melankolyme I know. It happens to us all and I know you struggle with it all the time but you're still here!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 10:35:58	@melankolyme Oh you're welcome. I know it wears on your so much. You do still keep going though and there's a lot to be said for that!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 10:27:06	@melankolyme *hugs* Sorry if you're feeling low dear.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 10:23:56	@SheikYurbouti LOL Sounds like fun. Lasso our pillows? See who can ride the headboard the longest? Wait. Something sounds wrong there...

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 10:16:45	@FroggyPrinceMom Exactly! I don't care about age as I feel various "ages" all the time! I don't practise ageism either! Pfft.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 09:53:40	@eternalamour You're most welcome! Glad to be of such great help! However for a lot of other meds, please ask! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 09:42:14	@shiv379 YA! *huggles*

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 09:39:59	@shiv379 It's okay luvvie. Hazards of online communication & my Aspie literal brain. But I know you and you would tell me, right? I hope so!

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 09:10:08	@shiv379 Oh, no! Did you just see what went up there! I JUST LOST THE GAME!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 09:08:07	@VandWsMommy Rub-a-Dub-Dub No THANG in That Thar TUB... Okay, that was lame...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 09:01:54	@Canageek why it's so hard to get. Only through official website and a few hundred bucks! Not even eBay in full sets etc...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 09:01:20	@Canageek editing but this series was awesome in that even the English version stayed very true to the original. This is a Classic. That's
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 09:00:35	@Canageek I never watched the Japanese versions but yes, the absolute originals. I think the English versions went through a bit of minor
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 08:59:52	@shiv379 burned similar but sometimes things just "break" or you don't know if something's buggy?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 08:59:23	@shiv379 I can watch it on baby MacBook just not burn to DVD. I may need to convert the files to another format? Odd as just .avi and have
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 08:58:40	@FroggyPrinceMom It's really old! I'm going to toally date myself here but like I care! It ran in 1970-1980 and I just fell in love with it.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 08:55:15	@Canageek Like I said, not through direct channels like torrent sites. It was his specific stuff. I totally lucked out!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 08:54:09	@Canageek They're all done except the first season which is ticking along now! It's just this guy...I could go back and find the site?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 08:50:52	@Canageek Yes I saw that and started but I wanted the real deal. The fan one is called "Remastered" with two seasons. All fan-derived. Nope.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 08:49:19	@FroggyPrinceMom As per all of THAT rambling, Yamato in Japan and Star Blazers in English version.

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 07:25:19	@shiv379 No problem, sweets! I'm always here to offer a helping hand! *grins*

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 06:20:25	@333AutismNews I went to school w/ a boy who ate glue and paper sandwiches! He was one of my "chess buddies" when we were 12. Wee PA=Geek.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 06:17:23	Young PA eating all sorts of cat and dog food... SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 06:16:09	@333AutismNews *grin* I ate a dog cookie when I was a wee. "Milk-Bone." I also ate both wet and dry cat and dog food. Curious Aspie kid? HA!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 06:09:46	If anyone needs proof that I AM a cat, just ask @shiv379 and @catatonickid *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 06:08:09	@333AutismNews That's good you like cats because as I just said, I AM a cat.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 06:07:39	@EnigmaAnonymous @asdquefty Yes, cats rule. In fact, I AM a cat.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 05:53:18	@333AutismNews LOL! I love all animals but am actually a "cat person." And after my baby died a few years ago, I can't get another one. Nope

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 03:09:19	@EnigmaAnonymous I'm too sick and brain dead to actually "write" it now but maybe some notes? Deadlines for way ahead though so it's okay.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 03:07:46	@EnigmaAnonymous Oh good 4 u! Mine is one of those general types. How has it affected u & that but it makes sense as it's for several awards
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 03:02:40	Must work on scholarship application essay. What would prove to the world I am paragon of greatness who also has Epliepsy. *rolls eyes*

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-19 02:19:12	Still sick. If these antibiotics don't work I have no clue what I'm going to do. This is day three. Should be feeling @least something?

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-18 23:03:50	@Canageek Thanks hon. It was all terminology and the assignments were pretty easy so maybe it all was not that hard! But not to worry! xo

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-18 05:28:00	@benpolar Thanks hon. The t-c was back in Sept. and my first and only. Let's hope it stays that way! LOL Last official day of course today
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-18 05:17:05	@benpolar They are better for URIs but will still take some time to do the job. Hopefully a difference by tomorrow? Please?!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-18 05:16:22	@benpolar LOL! True enough! I WANT AN O2 TANK! Really. Had O2 from medics w/ t-c seizure. Nice! But now? Got new antibiotics but still blah.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-18 05:09:39	@benpolar Ohhhh!!! *blushing* That's so good to hear (that you're on the right track) but the rest? You're making me want to run and hide!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-18 05:03:54	@benpolar It's so good to hear you talking like that. *grins* *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-18 04:54:01	@LockupDoc Hey! You're most welcome. There was no place to leave a comment on Kev's site so definitely had to say something here!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 06:18:45	@bipolarxplorer First, I'd section myself and as for the rest re: my partner (if I had one), I'd both love them AND laugh at them, & me too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 06:13:37	@shiv379 And as far as food the whole notion of asking you was funny as you have no clue what I have! Heh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 06:12:56	@shiv379 the criss-crossing of the nerves from right to left. Hemispherical differences in terms of let works right and vice versa.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 06:11:58	@shiv379 yes the eyes are all kind of backwards and freaky like a mirror basically as light needs to bounce off retina? Also you will note
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 06:10:37	@LockupDoc Great post over at Kevin's. Major differences between DDs and Chronic Progressives and treatment needs to be tailored to suit.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 06:03:54	@shiv379 I'll toss something together and then toss myself into bed?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 06:03:33	@shiv379 HA! Don't have any. Really need to do a proper shop but Grocery Man came by over the weekend to drive me to get some essentials.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 05:58:21	@shiv379 *giggles* Well I can always benefit from a refresher! Absolutely!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 05:57:30	@shiv379 Oh got 87% on exam today too. *shrug* Maybe a bit better if not sick and more than one day to study but still NO EXCUSES!!! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 05:56:24	@shiv379 What should I have for dinner? I'm hungry but NO energy (obviously, sick, duh!) Don't want to cook. Too tired to open tin of soup?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 05:53:03	@shiv379 Yep! Hematocrit is test done in CBC (Complete Blood Count) to measure RBCs in size and number to check for all sorts of stuff.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 05:51:15	Why am I even on my computer and not lying down? Oh Dr. PA got one of her first two choices of antibiotics she wanted. She's on Biaxin now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-17 05:47:04	@shiv379 I can give you a silly substitute answer: hematocritophilia

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 20:45:06	Just pondering while having breakfast. I can think of lots of cool jobs but I can't do them. Maybe that's why I find them so cool. LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 20:38:11	@Canageek Thanks hon. I've studied and blah. Can still do some review before the exam but I'm so tired. Am just going to write it & walk out
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 20:23:57	Okay I'd better start getting ready. I can't wait to get this over so I can just come back home to my bed! Oh, and pick up new/better drugs!

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 10:39:06	@catatonickid Yeah going to bed should always be a win, right? Sure...?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 10:13:07	@chloelowewew11 I will, just as soon as I get the stuff in order for her letter. Since the class is ending I need her to do it now?

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 10:08:17	Yay for having Epilepsy! Now gimme some money for it! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 10:07:03	Oh, wait. Now "little notes." I need the Instructor to write me a "Glowing Letter" to maybe get a Scholarship for having Epilepsy!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 10:02:56	Yep! Goodbye Toner!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 09:29:54	@chloelowewew11 FUCK NO! Sorries. Profanity time! I'm bad off. I need another med. Either a "sledgehammer" or one better targeted for URIs.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 09:27:16	@chloelowewew11 I want: Zithro, Cipro, Biaxin or I suppose Keflex. Been on all? Cipro and Biaxin would probably be best. So says Dr. PA.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 09:25:31	@EnigmaAnonymous Thanks *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 09:25:23	@chloelowewew11 I have no choice! Final is tomorrow! Also, picking up new antibiotics as will be 5 days tomorrow and not working. Made list!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 09:23:33	@EnigmaAnonymous Thanks. This has taken me all day and ugh. I should go to bed to wake up early as I do not sleep well coughing so much now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 09:16:52	It has colours too! I marked myself too! I'm probably going to use up all of my toner too! OMG. Getting up to write this thing tomorrow=HELL
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 09:12:56	My 19 page .xls "Study Sheet" is done and I want to barf now. It has neat comments too like *shrug* and WHEE! and "blah...blah..." Printing.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 04:13:08	OMG! I for got my damn "mold pill." I have to eat something with it too. *resists temptation to whine*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 04:11:01	@EnigmaAnonymous It was worse for me with it. It's a feeling I just can't stand and then to be held down. No. It was bad and upsetting.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 04:07:43	listening to "SKYDIGGERS - I Will Give You Everything" ♫ http://blip.fm/~l1eht
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:54:58	Maybe it's time for a song! Oh, I shouldn't be on Twitter! I should be working but I have been for hours now! HALP! If only I could scream.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:52:58	Playing "Name That Term" is SO much fun! At least I'm not timing myself. How many more chapters to go? *sighs and coughs at same time*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:51:02	@benpolar Well, I don't think my blog is all this and that. More like whinging and tripe! Also, bear in mind it's been up for over 3 years?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:44:22	@benpolar Oh and I was going to add re: my Followers? My number is extremely small! I'm not that popular. Others have WAY more than me!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:32:29	@benpolar Actually. 200...? A number somewhere in there...I may have picked up someone through the "back door." Let me check? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:31:03	@benpolar Awww. You are so sweet *hugs* My Follows/ers? No. It all just "happened!" *shrugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:29:37	@EnigmaAnonymous LOL I had someone actually sit on me and tickle me! OMG! Wee PA was tortured!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:19:18	*pads off to make Earl Grey*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:18:35	Goddammit! I have to take another one of my "mold pills" now that aren't really doing shit except making my stomach hurt! Cursed bronchitis!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:17:02	@EnigmaAnonymous I DESPISE being tickled! Except my feet! I love having my feet tickled! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:16:05	@benpolar if so, you put me back together last night! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 03:15:46	@benpolar I'm busy trying to get my head to work but I just saw this. Me too. Looking forward to what? You won't break me though! Or well..
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 02:16:35	@shiv379 trying to save me money though. I can't fault him. He was really nice. I'm going back tomorrow w/ URI specific list.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 02:15:53	@shiv379 Thanks but better luck with antibiotics! Should have gone with something more well-targeted dammit! Guy was just being good and
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-16 02:09:32	Need new antibiotic. Currently making list of requests. This one ain't working. Also trying to study! Exam tomorrow!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 07:52:43	@Canageek LOL. I'm really not anti-VD...really. This is just a...well...I can say a few things about this song, I guess.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 07:48:58	listening to "Must I Be Bound - June Tabor - A Quiet Eye (1999)" ♫ http://blip.fm/~kznk0
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 07:41:13	All of this fucking VD music on the radio is killing me! And thought the bronchitis was doing me in! GRRRR!!!!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:57:34	@shiv379 No, I'd do it for you! And hey, I'm the one giving you my steth! LOL And well, you don't really take it "off" in the real world...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:49:10	@hidama Hey you. 101.3! Good one! Actually, normal now but just had a body heat blast. It's been up to 102 that I've measured so far.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:39:48	Okay time to check my temperature again or should I just take an accurate guess? *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:38:46	@shiv379 I won't keep you in that much suspense: auscultation is examining someone with a steth etc...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:38:04	@shiv379 Yes, auscultation could be quite sexy indeed? "Playing Doctor?" LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:37:24	@benpolar @shiv379 Thanks for repairing me first!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:37:01	@catatonickid *incorrigble hugs back*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:36:35	@shiv379 @benpolar *group hug*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:33:31	@benpolar @shiv379 Hugs ALWAYS work! No matter WHAT the boo boo is. *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:32:51	@shiv379 Hehe! Sure! If you're a good boy I'll let you put on a pair of my scrubs! I have a steth too so you can do some auscultation on me
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:30:05	@shiv379 Well no one was speaking up so I just decided to nab @benpolar but hey, if you're up for job, it's all yours! More my "staff!"
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:19:03	I "nominate" @benpolar as my NURSE!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:18:03	@shiv379 I know. Such fun!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:17:29	Okay, typing words in .xls spreadsheet attempting to do something that looks like studying for an exam. Where's my nurse! WHO'S my nurse?!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:16:06	@shiv379 Hey, combine the lips and the clothes and I'm five steps ahead! Christ, even sicker than hell and look at me when back online LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:13:16	@shiv379 It had more to do with lips.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:12:18	@shiv379 I could be...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:08:29	Have just woken up (yes so sick I CAN sleep during day as I CAN NOT ever!) Who wants to be Dr. PAs nurse? Any takers? Hmmm?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 06:07:34	@Shiv379 @catatonickid @YogaChicky ...unzip...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 04:03:36	@shiv379 I just wanted to get some ice cream (or frozen yog.) LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 04:02:54	@benpolar True, not fun. This has just come on heels of a virus, now I have bacterium. Let's hope it's not anti-bi resistant or I'll FREAK!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 04:01:37	Bye kids. I'm going to pass out. Way gone.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 04:01:17	Probably not a good idea to even TRY to study for my final exam when I can't tell what time it is? *goes to get frozen yoghurt for throat*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 03:56:54	@YogaChicky Yes, me too! Loved IT! *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 03:51:17	Here's to Moldy Bread! *raises tissue box*: http://wp.me/p3M8c-XF

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 01:06:53	@catatonickid @YogaChicky @shiv379 BTW, "All Region" now and "NO Boundaries!" M&M is AWESOME! OMG!!! Going to watch other later! YAY!

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 01:04:26	@shiv379 @asdquefty Breathing is so hard and paroxysms at times. Gave up on cough medicine DAYS ago! Should order O2...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 01:02:41	@shiv379 Thanks hon. I am on antibiotics now so seeing if they will work. I would realy like an O2 tank though! Again not joking! We'll see.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 01:01:38	@asdquefty Thanks hon but shit, we have our final exam on Tuesday! I need to study!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-15 00:57:17	@benpolar Hi hon. Just getting online after few days now. V. sick. Battling worst case of bronchitis in my life. Not exaggerating. V. V. ill
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-12 00:22:42	Gastro Man Is Awesome! I Am Not Awesome.: http://wp.me/p3M8c-XB
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-11 20:33:35	Norwalk is killing me. Home today but up early as body now "programmed" to wake. Have taken MORE Gravol. Clear fluids only tho toast yest.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-10 05:59:38	Yes, I am obsessed with scrubs. And other various types of "uniforms."
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-10 05:58:40	If Gastro Man 4gets 2 give me a pair of his scrubs, I'm going 2 give him Norwalk! The scrubs deal was made b4 & "Slut?" I'll do anything?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-10 05:52:51	Called Gastro Man to bring me some of his scrubs for my appt. w/ him tomorrow. "...Scrubs Slut...Scrubs Slut..." He better remember!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-10 05:42:23	@CalliCoop LOL Norwalk Virus. It's a narsty one. A biggie 2 as actually named & identified. Not "deadly" bt bad if immune system compromised
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-10 05:40:24	I just had chicken soup and my stomach is lurching. Chicken soup!!! Okay...clear fluids only...? You evil virus. Fucking Norwalk. Piss off!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-10 05:38:33	@catatonickid @shiv379 @YogaChicky *grins* Yes, I thought that outfit better, glad you approve, lovey.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-10 05:37:28	I believe I have Norwalk. THAT is what's wrong with me! Not (usually) deadly, however NOT nice! OMG. More work though. Bugger!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 05:49:06	@EnigmaAnonymous Nothing like irreversible hormonal damage. Yes, have a chat with your doc. methinks.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 05:48:34	@EnigmaAnonymous You should be fine though. Hormones in the pill now have pretty much been knocked down a lot and it won't do damage to you
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 05:47:42	@EnigmaAnonymous You should probably talk to your doctor as it may not be the right pill or dosage. Or may need more time. Still go see doc?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 05:46:58	@EnigmaAnonymous So on the pill for 3mos. and not regulating you to once every 12mos.? I think it should have had enough time to kick in.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 05:21:58	@asdquefty I thought so haha but remember I'm on my gravol and suffering from the term I made up!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 05:21:22	@EnigmaAnonymous or when you get your period is "bad" like heavy, cramps etc.. If so the pill can help with that
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 05:20:36	@EnigmaAnonymous *hugs* It should regulate it so it will happen monthly. Not "bad" that is what will happen. Also not sure if your cycles
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 05:19:05	@asdquefty My term in my post?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 05:06:56	@asdquefty formatting and questions too so again, everything has to be pretty precise. AND spelling perfect! My Dysgraphia is a problem!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 05:06:08	@asdquefty own notes I have to alter and what not due to things changed in class etc... She can change around other things on exams re:
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 05:05:18	@asdquefty Thanks *hugs* This course is entirely diff. as due to terminology everything has to be "exactly" as she wants it. Sometimes my
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-09 04:56:57	What the HELL is Wrong With Me?!: http://wp.me/p3M8c-Xy
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 09:02:59	@shiv379 Whatever you wish! Just not a clown suit?! OR!!! A Tigger tail and a top hat? Now we're talking? @catatonickid
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:57:02	@shiv379 So I get to wear the funny tails & tophat. I don't know if THAT's a great outfit but I'll let you guys decide if you want me in it.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:55:11	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid Just teasing! Hey, I started the whole thing!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:48:50	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid Sure, whatever you say. I like how you left me...(in?)conspicuously out of that.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:47:39	Oh, they keep changing things. I'm may be ahead of everyone else because I did things backwards. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:43:11	*reaches for books while laughing at Twitter*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:42:20	Oh, fuck me! Another study night out the damn window? Maybe I can pull off some multi-assing here???
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:41:04	@shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid Rules are made to be broken! Don't forget that "rule!"
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:40:31	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid I think you and I gave up pretending to look innocent a LONG time ago. If not, we're not fooling anyone.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:37:56	@YogaChicky @shiv379 Who? Moi? *passes @catatonickid black and white striped jersey and whistle*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:35:06	@shiv379 Missed this one. So you smack me TO work and I smack you to NOT work? Something tells me it will just lead to a big spanking fest!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:30:07	@asdquefty Could do but it's just too much pissing about! Easier to buy the All Region and not have to worry about converting originals!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:28:36	@asdquefty Ae you kidding me?! I am not touching ANYTHING on baby MacBook! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:28:02	@asdquefty a laptop as you could kill your whole machine! Regional re-jigs can't really be done?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:27:23	@asdquefty Nope J. and I were looking at firm, soft, all of that and dicking around with firm is potentially v. dangerous and esp. on
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:26:34	@asdquefty other "piece" of different rights as protected too. Can at least view the PAL 2 bt the Oz. is fucked. UK not so bad bt either way
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:25:29	@asdquefty is what I suspect is left over from AArcOS. That was PAL 2 4. PAL 2 runs on baby but has odd green bar along bottom so could be
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:24:24	@asdquefty change region drive. That at least (I thought) handled rights issue but no. Can not view in VLC or burned as all choppy and that
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:23:35	@asdquefty to extract properly to get past AArcOS had to change region drives back and forth to burn. But even to do extraction alone had to
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:22:45	@asdquefty Not the point re: VLC. DVDs needed to be extracted first, then burned to watch on player. Well, that was one thing but in order..
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:21:03	@catatonickid @YogaChicky @shiv379 Oh, did that come out wrong? *glances upward*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:19:52	@asdquefty Long, arduous story re: all we had to do that ties in w/ extractions etc... but even viewing have to change drives and ltd. #x's
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:17:08	Well finally home and obviously NOT doing any work...someone please make me work. Kick me, smack me, whatever it takes...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:15:41	@YogaChicky @catatonickid @shiv379 That's right! I'll be "All Region!" "Region Free Baby!" NO Boundaries! LOL! Send away! *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 08:12:43	@asdquefty Can but only limited number of times re: drive region changes and sure, blow MORE money on gadgets and gizmos! I wish!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 04:57:20	Oh dear god I should think about getting my sorry self home! Going to take about two hours and I need to do school work! Nuts, I tell you!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 04:53:06	@worstmark Not that sweet? Still don't have a job! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 04:50:46	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid So I guess that's the final verdict guys. I'm going to have to buy an All Region Player! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 04:49:27	After hours of work and getting "thhhiiisss" close? I'm buying an All Region DVD Player! I thought I had it but nope! I'm not even home yet!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 04:47:22	@sciencegoddess @AuRtist @Canageek Hey, thanks for the mention and hello.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-08 04:46:55	@Acrimonia Thanks! *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-07 01:42:00	@TriniGirlBlue Oh, my Trini IS blue! I'm thinkin' not so fair, do you? So, try to cheer with a rhyme, though this one's not worth a dime!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-07 01:32:01	@shiv379 But of course! Could Tigger-girly be anything but?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-07 01:31:28	@TriniGirlBlue Oh dear. Well extra hugs for all the way through and well, forever! LOL Maybe a rhyme might help? Let me think...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-07 01:30:28	Ok can I fit in some studying before I have 2 go out? I totally slacked last night & nothing. And the night before too. And nothing tonight!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-07 01:25:58	@TriniGirlBlue Sorries you're having a bad day. *hugs*

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-07 00:48:07	@blissseeker1 I want you to stop and try really hard to think about that. It is monumental that you are NOT drinking right now! You will get
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-07 00:46:57	@blissseeker1 out that alcohol gave me migraines (they never did before) I would still be doing it! You are being SO strong for holding back
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-07 00:46:20	@blissseeker1 *hugs back* I'm sorry you are feeling so bad. I know the struggle too. I have self-medicated for years and if I didn't find
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-06 12:04:43	@blissseeker1 *hugs* Tough stuff. I know it's so tempting and easy to reach for the bottle but it's good that you're not, right? Still hard.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-06 12:01:42	Okay as soon as this d/l is done, PA is gonna d/l! Or maybe crash altogether. I'm pooped. *makes some kind of face*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-06 11:55:32	@SheikYurbouti My school textbooks are all I can fit in to read! Ok a couple of pages of non-school stuff before I pass out in bed! #LOFNOTC
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-06 11:52:10	*waves to pals @#LOFNOTC * I'm really wiped so won't be around for the "festivities." Wanted to say hi, at least. "Hi."

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-06 05:35:31	@333AutismNews3 Thanks for the Mention to Follow. Will even try (emphasis on try!) to make a blog post today?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-06 05:34:01	@shiv379 @YogaChicky Okay...kinda figured but was being dumb.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 11:30:14	@benpolar Yes, probably sound. I'm tired too even though no longer post-ictal. Maybe should just rest and get "Humanoid Sleep."
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 11:26:02	@benpolar Well I'm a bit ahead of the game I think. Also I kind of have to sleep? LOL I'm alright for tomorrow's work so I could quit now?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 11:21:31	@benpolar Gotcha. So, what do you think? Should I bother doing ANY work tonight? So far I've managed to make a whole two pages of notes!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 11:11:38	@benpolar Actually I've been looking at my APIs and they've been fine. That's the funny thing. All looks normal on my end?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 11:03:36	@worstmark Thanks, I love it too. Just wander around aimlessly in circles with it on...do-de-do...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 10:53:02	@benpolar I know, my Tweets seem odd when I've been sending them so...? Idk. People may not be getting them?

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 10:24:24	@worstmark Yes! ARccOS is "narsty" as I have just found out! Although MacTheRipper does have workarounds for it, just not in my case here!

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 09:34:36	@FroggyPrinceMom I'm converting PAL DVDs I got as pressies as I don't have an All Region player.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 09:33:00	SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 09:31:02	Okay I think I can do this with ANOTHER extraction.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 09:25:29	@Acrimonia Indeed! I just whipped another one. I bought a lot of them!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 09:25:06	Okay clearly that wasn't the right solution...try another extraction? That was a no brainer though. Look for an alternative? Huh.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 08:27:46	*tosses another useless dvd across flat and runs to get another to re-try a burn* LMAO
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 07:52:30	@pianomaths Sweet dreams!

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 07:20:54	Okay, all sorts of errors but still had MTR open so they came from there! BWAH-HAH-HAH! Results revealed in a few moments...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 07:20:00	@shiv379 @YogaChicky We were talking about my LUST for fountain pens before. Birthday March 04! Just kidding! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 07:17:45	@shiv379 Granted am on MacBook so not SUPER drive but still, it's decent?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 07:17:09	@shiv379 to do with the conversion or the error or what? Taken an hour so seems strange? Anyway almost done so let's see?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 07:15:51	@shiv379 Not so much that. MacThe Ripper should have worked just fine. Also baby MacBook has a fine drive. Just don't know if it's something
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 07:01:41	@YogaChicky Crikey! I almost could have watched a two thirds of it by now LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 06:58:25	@YogaChicky This is the longest DVD burn I've ever done in my life! If it won't run I'm going to give it my own native AUDIO_TS for today?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 06:57:05	@pianomaths YW hon!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 06:06:38	Alright! Silence Everyone! The Burning Process is about to begin! HA!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 06:05:30	@pianomaths Yes I know you're sensitive that way. *passes along earplugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 06:04:46	@shiv379 @catatonickid @YogaChicky Indeed. More than one way to skin a DVD!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 06:04:16	@thespindleshay Well sometimes I'm "devil may care." Other times I'm shitting my pants!

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 06:02:37	Okay, I see...AUDIO_TS is dated August 2009 and not today! Is that the "Bad Sector?" Either way if missing you just create the empty file...
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 06:00:08	@YogaChicky @catatonickid @shiv379 Again, no worries! Will try everything & will buy something if have 2 *rolls eyes* Even if only new DVDs!

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 05:55:35	@pianomaths Okay that's what I thought. Well, okay thought maybe a death of someone you knew! Breathe! You'll do fine! *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-05 05:49:08	@pianomaths Funeral?! Are you okay? Everything alright???

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-02 04:58:23	At least the new chapter I have to read today/tonight is the Neuro Chapter? I might do alright with that one? *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-02 04:54:39	@alphabetania I think EVERY day should be "Happy Cartoon Character Day!" Then it would be my birthday every day? And I don't mean my avatar.

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-02 04:00:17	@FroggyPrinceMom Indeed. Just so funny how we can play with interpretation.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-02 03:57:20	@FroggyPrinceMom LMAO from one who often feels quite comfortable being non-verbal.

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 23:05:47	@woundedgenius Can I make a joke back about this? Maybe if the alter is sleeping? *runs away*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 23:01:45	I really don't feel like being awake right now. Losing all of my "new schedule" is...well, screwing up my new schedule! Bugger!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 23:00:40	@dorfird @Canageek Glad you guys had fun! As if you wouldn't! *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 22:56:50	@Aliquant I know, it's stuck in my head ever since I was a wee one. It's always ringing around inside my brain in a sing-song quality!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 22:54:10	@tendrel Great, nature's own roller coaster! Hang on tight!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 22:53:23	@asdquefty "...it's gotta be a loose fit, it has to be a loose fit..." Ok, that might' ve been a bit of a stretch 4 a response. Just woke up

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 05:16:33	@pianomaths How quickly can you get on a plane?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 05:13:58	@pianomaths ..out that the information I originally had was all wrong to begin with!!! I AM a disaster!!!

16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:50:48	@shiv379 @pianomaths *drools over thoughts of FOUNTAIN PENS*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:46:37	@pianomaths OMG! A perfect match! I can stim on your diary! W00t!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:45:37	@pianomaths @shiv379 Absolutely!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:43:03	@pianomaths LOL! Will you become my Personal Assistant? I really need one!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:35:51	@alphabetania Many have actually helped me in terms of "understanding" my behaviours!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:35:21	@alphabetania Sure, we could come up with all sorts of "behaviours" to label. Just the way people act. I have no problem with my "labels."
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:31:49	@alphabetania They both serve a purpose to a degree but are too stringent and the docs that use them (some) are idiots.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:30:40	@alphabetania Well in terms of "labelling" don't take on our "labels" and bust the stigma? Believe me, I'm not a fan of the DSM or ICD
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:29:05	@alphabetania Again, semantics! Some people call it Asperger's Syndrome or whatever.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:28:20	@alphabetania Semantics? To dx. is simply medical terminology.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:26:40	@alphabetania Well that is how the two are defined in terms of signs/symptoms from childhood. Defintely clear from the Spectrum!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:22:58	@alphabetania anything on the Autistic Spectrum. It means you don't just acquire either later in life.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:22:25	@alphabetania It's a Developmental Disorder because you have it from birth. That's what distinguishes it from a Mental Illness ditto w/
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:19:05	@alphabetania Oh, forgot to say, he's a Psych. too and his kids or a couple or something have ADHD too! Yay for Developmental Disorders!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 02:18:26	@alphabetania Yes there's also another Canadian Dr. who has ADHD, Gabor Mate.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:49:30	@alphabetania and Asperger's hard to differentiate for me so often.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:49:14	@alphabetania the Bipolar and Epilepsy threshold but I am fine. Plus I think my ADD will always be a challenge, plus so similar to both BP
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:48:27	@alphabetania Everyone's different and I had to fight SO hard to get on stims for years so I don't push things. Everyone always argued re:
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:46:06	@alphabetania Yep. Also Merlin #2 and I didn't want to push it because I am so wee. However, I had no side effects.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:44:27	@shiv379 *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:43:43	@alphabetania Extended release (of course...duh) 36mg.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:41:23	@alphabetania Yes, my cocktail is quite something. It's on my blog as one of my Pages. My ADD med is Concerta.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:40:36	Oh dear. Is @shiv379 getting me a bit silly? I DO know he just made me LOSE THE GAME!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:38:11	@shiv379 LUMOFO = Laugh Until My Ovaries Fall Out? Idk.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:34:46	@EnigmaAnonymous Thanks maybe I can if the stupid woman decides to ever call me back!!! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:33:33	@shiv379 I did and read it. I laughed at the pregnancy part. *rolls eyes* A bit backwards? However, the "Miracles of Science?"
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:31:21	@EnigmaAnonymous I was looking into some stuff here to help activities etc. but the woman never called me back! Will try for next session?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:29:03	@EnigmaAnonymous Used to do a fair bit of theatre up to uni. but then it hit.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:24:57	@EnigmaAnonymous Actually I desperately want 2 get over my stage fright. I love being on stage. Awesome performing in front of live audience
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:22:54	@shiv379 No! No depressed Bear!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:20:55	@EnigmaAnonymous Actually, I played the Court Jester during a Dinner Theatre performance. Until I now have my lovely stage fright. Blah.
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:19:46	@EnigmaAnonymous LMAO! You're funny. Actually, I'm such an idiot I could probably be the Court Jester!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:14:50	I don't want to fill out this paperwork. But I have to. The Queen of Procrastination's Crown is aglow!
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 01:08:17	@shiv379 LOL We sound like twins! Also laughing at Zim because of both d/l it said it was going to take almost a year last night! HA! xo
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 00:49:13	@shiv379 How are the studies hon? Or the non-studies since not IN school yet? And you in general?
16253011	patientanon	2010-02-01 00:32:06	New to me but maybe not to you: Crystal Castles ♫ http://blip.fm/~k3zxk
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 23:21:46	Might have weasled my way into getting an organization to "create" a scholarship for me! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 22:31:53	@EnigmaAnonymous Oh, don't be silly! No "inconvenience!" Do what you like! It's just funny to me!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 22:22:37	@alphabetania I try to read but the ADD is really bad so that is hard. I try to write when inspiration strikes. Sit and hide as I'm a hermit
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 22:20:50	@alphabetania I can be sick in bed physically and emotionally for usually 72 hours. It's icky.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 22:20:09	@alphabetania It depends on the seizure. If it's a mild SP I'll be okay but a really bad one (crazy falling down motor) or a CP or a t-c
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 22:15:46	@EnigmaAnonymous Your pic always makes me laugh as you're sideways and I have to pick up baby MacBook and turn it to look at you. SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 22:02:41	@alphabetania tonic-clonic and they always come with no warning. Drop, shake, all of that. Although I was told I had a CP b4 I had my t-c
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 22:01:30	@alphabetania around etc. I have had Atonics that come with no warning. You just drop and go unconscious for a few seconds. Then I had one
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 22:00:28	@alphabetania of my Complex Partials I have been unconscious and rememberd nothing but CPs are odd as you look wide awake and can be walking
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 21:59:41	@alphabetania ones where I'll be shaking all over. They "may" also lead to Complex Partials but never have for me--that I remember. With all
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 21:58:35	@alphabetania ..slightly altered in consciousness. They can lead to other types of Simple Partials but I will still be consious like Motor..
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 21:57:39	@alphabetania It depends upon the seizure. If I have a Simple Partial, I am conscious and awake so you can talk to me. I might only be..
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:46:40	@Canageek Oh, I haven't been quiet around here! I've been loud, rambunctious and completely obnoxious! *hangs head*
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:44:42	@Canageek I'm too what?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:43:24	I just realized I have no clue of what I just wrote down in my notes from that last chapter. *shakes head* Okay, let's move on...
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:38:31	@Giftedmum Yes, 'tis true.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:35:04	@Giftedmum Thanks but today I am leaving nothing but a trail of destruction behind me!!! *winces*
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:34:00	@alphabetania I can't remember when the Dysgraphia started. I can't help it but it's very frustrating.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:33:17	@FroggyPrinceMom Oh everyone fights everywhere. Humans are stupid.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:31:02	I need to take another Valium and STFU.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:20:55	@alphabetania Indeed. I won't even go to hosp. for a seizure unless physical injury. I have a neuro, I take meds. What point?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:20:08	@FroggyPrinceMom LOL Yes the monks can go crazy too. Knew girl who was Buddhist and she told me a lot about infighting of sects!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:19:25	@alphabetania ..the seizures. That may kill you but it's different. Even with structural problems w/ epilepsy itself good surgical outcomes.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:18:20	@alphabetania ...or if the originating cause is physiological, different. Say it is not epilepsy but you develop a tumor that then causes..
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:17:27	@alphabetania Seizures are only life threatening if you injure yourself seriously during one or are prolonged via something called SUDEP...
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:13:58	@FroggyPrinceMom you go a bit mental! I'll get my head straightened out and all else. Everything does eventually, right?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:12:57	@FroggyPrinceMom practise it but it does speak to me as a non-theistic philosophy with me being an Atheist. However, you can lose sight when
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:11:04	@FroggyPrinceMom Oh believe me! I've studied Buddhism for years now. I just fall off the path a lot. "Bad Buddhist PA!" Not that I actively
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:03:02	@alphabetania A lot of people are really scared of their seizures! Very. I'm just...well, part of my entire crazy makeup. What can I do?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 06:00:16	@alphabetania yes, understood
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:59:01	@alphabetania No, that's cool. I actually always pay strict attention to my seizure jazz anyway. Have to for keeping accounts anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:58:12	@FroggyPrinceMom I was just saying it's a permanent fixture!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:54:48	@alphabetania As you can tell, my seizures don't freak me out all that much?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:54:19	@alphabetania My strangest psychic Simple Partial manifestation was when I "felt" I was a form of AI. It was really cool! Like Data!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:53:09	@alphabetania LOL Now that's funny.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:52:46	@FroggyPrinceMom Feel guilty is ALWAYS at the top of my To Do List. Actually, born with it stamped on my forehead. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:46:52	@FroggyPrinceMom Thanks again. I just feel like I screwed up today and I hold myself to different standards than I do others. I know this 2.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:46:09	@alphabetania Micro/Macrosomatognosia at least in terms of your own body.

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:42:41	@FroggyPrinceMom Thanks. I just feel like it and I am beating myself up. Hard. I do this. Today I feel I deserve it.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:33:48	@FroggyPrinceMom Ah, let's all laugh!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Idiot PA.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:28:09	@alphabetania I can understand things like that. I have had some similar sorts with my Epilepsy but I discount that.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:27:25	@FroggyPrinceMom Oh go ahead and laugh. I'm ridiculous. I laugh at myself all the time. I'm just not amused with myself at all right now!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:26:34	@alphabetania Actually, I forgot. Did have sleep hypno. and one auditory due to pseudoephed. but not scary.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:21:04	@FroggyPrinceMom Indeed. Close, close. Now I'm just sitting here stunned. For fuck's sake!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:19:09	@alphabetania Yes, typing is much better. Hallucinations? Not so good? I've never had any though but from what I've heard, not fun.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:17:40	@FroggyPrinceMom Fair enough. I'm just feeling like I'm pretty ugly right now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:13:09	@FroggyPrinceMom Sometimes I never see it coming but I guess I do have an ugly side after all! Go figure!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:12:13	Alright, now this shitwhipe music really has to go.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:09:52	@FroggyPrinceMom Well sometimes mealy-mouthed mousey PA actually can be a stubborn little bitch.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:05:41	@FroggyPrinceMom Thanks, I'm going to beat this shit into submission, stubborn little wretch that I am.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 05:04:38	Ashes to ashes, dust to dust; if there's one thing for sure, it's my brain I can't trust!

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 02:18:32	@doc_rob Question as it's been ages 4 me. Used to be topics but is it now "open season?" Or chosen by the host? Blogborygmi looks diff. too.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 02:06:23	@doc_rob Hey, I'm still here! My blog is still here! Although I "wish" I was invisible a lot of the time! I'm looking at GR right now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 02:00:57	@tuuli1 Good to see you're not bitter or anything LOL
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 02:00:27	@doc_rob Wow, I haven't submitted anything to it (or checked it out!) in ages. Should put that on my ever growing "To Do List."

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 01:53:58	@Canageek Thank you. Not feeling so awesome at the moment.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-31 01:49:25	@EnigmaAnonymous @asdquefty That would be great. *group hug*

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 23:53:18	@asdquefty ..except for slightly elevated levels but that is only due to some slight heavy processing of my meds. Otherwise my liver rocks!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 23:52:36	@asdquefty a massive cocktail for the rest of my life. Also drank like a fish for years but at least have stopped now. My liver is fine..
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 23:52:00	@asdquefty I think you'll be fine unless you already have liver probs. look at me. On so many meds over so many years and will have to take
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 22:49:33	@asdquefty No! You shouldn't go off it I think! And clusters are bad!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 22:45:25	@asdquefty Well could have been dampening your emotions as ADs can do that.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 22:44:15	@EnigmaAnonymous @asdquefty That sounds really cool! Go for it! She's a total sweetheart and you are too! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 22:43:38	@asdquefty ..but I NEVER go looking! Things just "happen" sometimes. When you're not looking, right?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 22:43:08	@asdquefty OMG! I haven't been "looking" since...well, there was that "joke" ad I put up after hosp. #6 that actually reeled me one in!...
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 22:42:17	I guess I need tea now. Been up since way before this time.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 22:41:39	@asdquefty But OX to you as I know that love sure does stink a lot! Good grief. HA! "Grief" indeed. Unintentional pun, there. Good one, PA!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 22:40:07	@asdquefty ..the whole thing really is more "irony." No matter how hard I try, I just can't stop falling in love! I'm a hopeless romantic!!!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 22:39:24	@asdquefty Thanks hon. Just never had anything work but I've been saying I don't want another relationship for ages now! This isn't "news"..
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 22:33:52	Oh, about the blip so you understand. It looks like love is "pointless." Well, it can be (ha!) but no, pointless as I can't escape love!

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-30 06:59:30	Even though you said you never wanted to speak to me again, reading this makes me think about you so fondly. You'll never read this but...!

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-17 08:11:30	@TriniGirlBlue Wait a minute. I'm still screwed in the head but does quitting booze make me more "clearly" screwed in the head? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-17 08:07:42	@TriniGirlBlue Yes. Never was one for "illicit" drugs, booze is legal LOL but I only "thought" it helped. Uh, no. Much clearer now it's gone
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-17 08:01:08	@TriniGirlBlue Yes and they're not even illicit drugs (which PA would never do anyway!)
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-17 07:41:35	Maybe my Diazepam will inspire me to write some more bad poetry for @TriniGirlBlue LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-17 07:37:38	Although I do have my issues with Big Pharma I am now willing to bow at Roche Canada's feet. Merci pour le Diazepam. Bon soir.

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-17 07:24:05	Valium for dinner? Forget the soup? The thought (forget the sight!) of food is making me want to heave. Did manage Ensure earlier though.

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-17 07:03:13	@hidama Thank you. That made me smile. It took me a while to type this too as I'm still all messy. But good whale one.

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:59:55	Okay nini folks hopefully the tummy and heady will be all better tomorrow.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:49:31	@BurlyQEinstein *hugs* Good to hear you're going to talk to someone. I hope you feel better soon hon.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:46:24	@333AutismNews Ok? V. busy w/ personal life stuff. Crazy & scary but a lot done. Howev. GERD attack & migraine 2day! Not fair "compensation"
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:43:34	@tuuli1 Oh, not at all! I'm a total advocate! More complicated and more than one reason. Not saying here of course!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:39:45	@tuuli1 Sure, ppl may want to be anon. for many reasons so who knows. I have several that some know. When explained they make sense.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:31:24	@333AutismNews3 Uh, that would be "hello" not "hell." Yeah...
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:30:41	@333AutismNews3 hell and goodbye!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:30:12	@tuuli1 I am honest, very on my blog but anonymous. I have reasons (of course!) Although do know online folks personally and have met some.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:26:09	@tuuli1 My acronym: Patient Anonymous. My blog name etc...
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:23:20	@tuuli1 Actually, I might be better than I think. I'm PA so there's some "balance" there! AHA!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:20:05	@tuuli1 Thanks for the encouragement but that prospect scares me. And hey, don't we need variance? Some balance for all 26 letters?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:12:18	@aspieteach Glad you're feeling better!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:09:49	@tuuli1 LMAO! My ego is so pathetic, I'm so far down the line from a "Type A," I'm a "Type Q."
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:08:14	@CalliCoop Now that's another twist on the psychology of it all. "The CBT Blame Game." Wait, that's what you play when your therapist sucks.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 10:04:44	@tuuli1 Nope! Not always about any of us! That's the trick! In fact, more often than not, it's NOT even about us at all! We have BIG egos!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 09:54:22	Cognitive Distortion Lesson #1: It's not always about you.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 09:34:58	@shiv379 Ya go sleepies. Get resties hon.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 08:57:20	@asdquefty No same stash as had for while now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 08:56:08	@asdquefty Cool. Dunno why this Valium is in crazy high gear but whatev. who cares. Still pukey gross tho. Alas. Better later.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 08:54:28	@aspieteach Oh. Too bad. If caffeine doesn't cause migraines it can sometimes help w/ some ppl as it is a vasoconstrictor. Need 2 when hits.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 08:52:12	Whao! The Valium's working kids! Like never before! This is gooood! LOL! Yahoooieee!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 08:37:19	@aspieteach That stinks. No ibuprophen either as some have told me re: OTC that the Liquid Gels work for them? Can you drink caffeine?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 08:32:22	Valium probably won't do much for my stomach but it will make me nice and ...bbbb... triptan? Think it helped? Yes? *waves at stress* O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 06:45:32	Was I Out of My Mind and MAD!: http://wp.me/p3M8c-W6

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 02:43:48	Please nothing else. GERD enough, a migraine enough. Cease and Desist!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 02:41:48	@mama_kass Good stuff? Huh?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 02:40:54	Full Body Meltdown Alert: Migraine? Killer headache, would explain nausea, complete incoherence...triptan now taken... OMG. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 01:17:15	Oh, no. No Gravol, about a half a glass of gingerale. This is gonna be a rough day...

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 00:57:53	I think I've run out of Gravol (again...) This is not good. Bugger. *shakes stupid head* Fucking GERD!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-11 00:26:02	Aspie Penguin has me wearing my scarf and my Mentally Deranged Hat to try and keep me warm in my freezing flat. He's trying... *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-09 00:41:35	@Acrimonia Thanks for the re-twee. I'm Dr. Seuss worthy, am I? Merci.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 11:22:49	@SheikYurbouti Seriously though. Sorry you're bummed. And a day ruined...no fun, not fair.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 11:20:00	@SheikYurbouti 'Twas not I that bestow'th thy hex! ...I always need to look up the codes for the colours anyway... *shrug*
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 11:03:49	Where's my brain? Oh, it's under my mouse that was under my hat. That were both on my head.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 11:02:09	Oh, it's under my hat.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 11:00:55	Where's my mouse?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 10:52:23	@VandWsMommy LOL Well I can agree with you on that last one! Not an option for me anymore though.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 10:48:38	*wearing ball cap diagonally denoting mental state* O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 06:22:50	Well, hello forgotten short story. Let's play with you for a while.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 05:04:55	@EnigmaAnonymous Sure, feel free to email away! Not a problem at all.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 04:21:40	@EnigmaAnonymous They may feel odd, strange, scary but we are human beings and can not really escape our emotions despite any displeasure.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 04:19:28	@EnigmaAnonymous Feelings and emotions may exist apart from any said forms of mental illnesses and need not be qualified or quantified.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 04:18:20	@EnigmaAnonymous The same would still apply even if you are not depressed now or even at all. Plus, sometimes feelings are just feelings.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 04:07:16	@EnigmaAnonymous that just compounds all of this and makes things worse. So many of us feel this way but it is no reflection of you.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 04:06:39	@EnigmaAnonymous BAD and YOU are not WORTHLESS. The depression can make you feel that way. Also it is the isolation that we all can feel
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 04:05:45	@EnigmaAnonymous Those feelings are not weird. They are a part of depression that a very common. Everything you say. Except that YOU are not
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 03:55:02	@EnigmaAnonymous So if someone else actually wants you to feel the pain you have inside? That is not weird that is evil and mean!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 03:38:40	@EnigmaAnonymous No I know.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 03:37:17	@EnigmaAnonymous Yes, keep my mind busy by remotely controlling the radio, the television channels, people's iPods as they walk by...
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 03:36:14	@EnigmaAnonymous No, I'm not kidding. Maybe I'm somehow remotely controlling the radio via my Tweets? Or even scarier my thoughts?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 03:31:53	Okay, this is truly frightening. I just wrote about Yoda and then they started playing the Star Wars theme on the radio. What...the...?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 03:25:44	@Acrimonia I think it's the best we all can do. However, Yoda does rock!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 03:19:59	@Acrimonia Indeed but there is the added emphasis on TRY and direct my focus? LOL *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 03:15:39	@Acrimonia Yes. Well, I'm still low on my tea consumption so get on with that, then some thoughts about where to try and direct some focus?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 03:07:17	@EnigmaAnonymous Thanks. I need to focus on something, I think. Just not sure what yet, I guess.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 03:01:53	Slipping into combination of stress and ennui. What the HELL kind of combination does THAT make?! It doesn't feel like a good one... O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-08 01:07:22	@catatonickid *sleepy pounce* I just woke up not long ago and no tea sweetheart. Too much info. to answer you here so will e. xo

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 07:03:25	Okay signing off now. Feeling rather pooped and should eat. May be back later?
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 07:00:04	@FroggyPrinceMom Indeed! Committed! In whatever way!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 06:59:45	@FroggyPrinceMom I actually exceeded my 3 pints of tea and had 4 today! So far no chocolate yet but I have carrot cake outstanding in fridge

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 06:54:20	@FroggyPrinceMom My anorak has a really good hood with velcro that wraps around the bottom and doesn't make you foggy.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 06:52:49	@FroggyPrinceMom I was just saying I don't personally know anyone with the skill to make "stuff." Does that make sense? Idk. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 06:52:08	@FroggyPrinceMom @aspieteach I do not doubt your brain power at all. Rest assured there!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 06:51:28	@FroggyPrinceMom I never had any issue with contacts. Could still pop ones I have in right now.
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 06:50:56	@FroggyPrinceMom If you have fogged glasses you may as well just take them off! Can't see either way!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 06:50:05	@FroggyPrinceMom Yes I will but I still don't KNOW anyone personally to make it. May have to BEG online friends. Hence my Tweet LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 06:49:05	@FroggyPrinceMom Yes I just don't have anyone to play with. Kind of stupid to throw a snowball at yourself. Although...I am pretty stupid...

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 06:43:28	@FroggyPrinceMom I "see" or I don't? Can often have awful time visualizing things. Frustrating!
16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 06:41:29	@FroggyPrinceMom That sounds like my own project. Getting me outside into the damn snow with enough layers! LMAO!

16253011	patientanon	2010-01-06 06:37:37	@FroggyPrinceMom Well, a beaker is shaped in a certain way so tight fitting, not loose.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-31 06:12:31	@benpolar I understand. Sometimes I can get caught up too much in my sx. too. You make a great point about them being new for you too.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-31 05:55:31	@benpolar I think stimming can def. have benefits! Sometimes we just need to do it to relax and doesn't always mean we're in distress etc...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-31 04:25:41	@AuRtist @Canageek Hey good to see you. I knew you would be busy of course. Not sure about the sleep stuff...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-31 03:01:41	@spectrumdweller Oh, sorry for any difficulty caused there. I didn't know of that feature. Thanks for telling me about it.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-31 01:16:25	@Canageek Indeed! A possible version coming up of Wuthering Heights where Catherine comes back to wreak havoc as some Japanese Ghost but...

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-30 08:53:55	@Kazcita Thanks sweetie. Hugs back. Major setback.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-30 08:52:33	@SheikYurbouti I am hoping so...I am just on enough of my own roller coaster. I can't afford to buy someone else's ticket right now.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-30 08:51:17	@worstmark Thanks hon but ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-30 08:50:40	I think it may be safe to say this is my worst holiday season ever. And it's not even over yet! More things to address!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-30 08:38:57	Let's have a vote. Who thinks I'm a Selfish Bitch? I just got an email from someone who thinks so! And yes they are a "friend." I suck. BIG.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-29 23:40:16	@Canageek I know! I gave up fashion for functionality years ago! I wish I could look cool in winter but no more. *sad face*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-29 23:39:09	@Canageek I agree. Aspies may not give a toss in a lot of cases but I like to look good too! I also dress v. well at times for occasions.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-29 23:31:36	@Canageek Also wear whatever. I'm trying to look okay for inside attire but again fucking freezing! PA cold enough to begin with! *frowns*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-29 23:29:40	@Canageek Also don't worry about time or sked. I got up early so lots of time to get ready and make it via transit and all that.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-29 23:28:06	@Canageek Uh...whoops! not enough tea? Let me try that again! Don't worry about shave, hair! My outside attire not so fashionable as cold!..
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-29 23:26:50	@Canageek Ah, don't worry about shave, hair

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-29 22:17:29	@catatonickid *makes undecided physical retaliation* I'll send you an email, lovely. To say "Okay" on Twitter seems rather banal? Quite.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-28 07:41:02	@readheadgirl Oh, yes. I forgot. Massive sex Follows now as I was taking offers from people to buy me vibrators for Christmas.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-26 00:49:47	@spectrumdweller Thanks. I don't like the look and feel of ads and such on blogs. I think it detracts from the content. Just me though...

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 04:27:57	Okay this is ridiculous. *PA kicks self out door to run errands*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 04:17:35	@aspieteach It's all good (well meltdowns aren't!!!) I stim wherever and whenever now! I don't care. Watch me stim entire world! Whatever!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 04:16:05	@aspieteach LMAO! We are both procrastinating! No, if out I wouldn't be on my computer. I suck. GO OUT PA!!! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 04:14:55	@aspieteach Oh, no way! We DO have a lot in common! I would perseverate in my head as a little kid (and when older too.) Maybe I still do!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 04:13:41	@aspieteach Let me tell you I was quite a sight to behold! Both physical and verbal repetition all at once! Toes words, toes, words...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 04:12:22	@aspieteach LOL! Ah it's okay! Just call them typos! W/ my last meltdown I was perseverating (another form?) while toe walking all over!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 04:03:04	@aspieteach OMG, could I say "now" any more? Can the cold drive you to Palilalia?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 03:56:18	@aspieteach She's now into "Long Underwear Every Day Mode." Seriously. Layers, layers to go out now! Actually, prior to "now" doing it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 03:54:52	@aspieteach That's awesome about the dog! Can do with bunnies too. Wee PA can't deal with the cold. She's cold all the time herself!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 03:49:09	@aspieteach Depends upon situation. Today it's too cold, I'm lazy, natural procrastinator, natural "excuse maker?" LOL Must get script tho.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 03:41:04	So avoiding going out. Using my hair to dry as an excuse.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 01:13:13	@readheadgirl Thanks! Indeed it is so rare. I've been lucky enough to do a bit of lucid dreaming too which is also very cool!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 01:06:16	Actually I kind of "interpreted" my dream. Sort of. *laughing* Too much! Probably explains why I remembered that one! Clang! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 00:48:43	I hardly EVER remember my dreams but OMG! FTW? This morning? I became "temporarily famous" due to Keanu Reeves and an old sick dog. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 00:33:27	@shiv379 @catatonickid LOL! No, you can be "cuddly!" We'd all be "geeky." Or I can think of other names for us? Beyond all of our nics? HA!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-18 00:04:20	@catatonickid @shiv379 Thanks. Even still, I'm never innocent anyway. Sleepy, dopey or not. Shit, now I'm naming the Seven Dwarfs! "Doc" PA?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 23:59:45	@shiv379 You can tell by the typo! I missed the "w!" You see??? Oh, neither you nor @catatonickid are going to believe me anyway. Bah!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 23:58:06	@shiv379 OMG! I just realized how that sounded and honestly, I SWEAR, I do! THIS time I WAS being innocent! I'm really dumb when I wake up!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 23:54:50	@shiv379 I just oke up a bit ago and am a little chilly but together we can create some heat?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 23:51:56	Oh dear. How many songs can I REALLY stream on MP3 of the Moment. Normally do 3 but how do I decide from this CD? SO good! The saddest? Hmm.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 23:46:39	@TriniGirlBlue @shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid Okay.*surrenders to you and waves torn white flag* No biggie.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 09:11:03	@shiv379 @catatonickid @TriniGirlBlue @YogaChicky Right. Now you're trying to play all innocent like "that guy."

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 08:56:25	@YogaChicky @catatonickid @shiv379 @TriniGirlBlue Well I hardly think everyone will be sitting around playing board games 24/7!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 01:38:20	Well after being up for a mere 1.5 hours I feel like going back to bed. *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 01:30:41	@asdquefty Yes, love them! Not sure when your pressie will arrive. Can't predict shipping dates. Might be a week? Bit more? Idk.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 01:27:04	@asdquefty However...your turn...be on the lookout! Muahahahaha...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 01:25:43	@asdquefty I don't blog about pressies though. Well did once about packaging as I feel pressies are private to me *grins*

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-17 01:03:54	@asdquefty Thank you! SPAZ O.o LOL! Elf PA is now in the midst of seeking revenge!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 11:06:38	@asdquefty I'm looking at my blog now and thinking I just want to shut the fucker down! Garbage! Friday? What's gonna be so great that day?

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 09:49:47	@YogaChicky Not a problem...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 09:35:32	@YogaChicky Commented in both places...just said good and that. Nice.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 09:25:46	@shiv379 @YogaChicky Interesting concept.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 09:24:51	@YogaChicky @shiv379 Very cool. I don't have the memories to do that unless I "re-invented" myself but not sure that would be good.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 09:18:44	@shiv379 @YogaChicky No, that I have not done. Huh.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 09:12:30	@worstmark @BurlyQEinstein Thanks sweetie. And so are you! Totally lovely and wonderful!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 09:11:48	@BurlyQEinstein You got it babe!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 09:06:55	@BurlyQEinstein I am very patient (would like 2 think bt maybe sometimes ppl think I am not) bt we shld all treat others w/ respect/kindness
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 08:56:01	@BurlyQEinstein Well we all are entitled to feel. Dx. or not. No one corners the market on emotions right? *wink*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 08:55:06	@BurlyQEinstein Yes and even tho you can get things screwed up as an Aspie, fine but at times it's a double whammy as fallout can=meltdown.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 08:48:27	@BurlyQEinstein Thanks again. I was just so confused. Even w/ further explanation I didn't know how 2 interpret things. Maybe Aspie brain 2?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 08:41:44	@BurlyQEinstein Thanks hon' I appreciate that. It just hit harder as so few people actually know, it's long and v. scary then to hear that.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 08:38:24	@YogaChicky LOL! True enough. Write about the past, write about the future... Future Memories! Kind of like time travel!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 08:33:49	@YogaChicky Writing about is a lot of fun, talking too but can they both compare to really indulging? Next best things I suppose Appetizers?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 08:27:30	Now let's turn all of this into writing about some "indiscretions!!!" @YogaChicky LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 08:22:32	@YogaChicky I see. Well in case there's ANY confusion at all my "indiscretions" would only prove how much more honest I really am! Oh yes!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 08:12:53	@YogaChicky Are you saying that my so-called "indiscretions" have discredited me in the honesty department?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 08:04:43	If people choose not to take me at my word there is nothing I can do about it. I do not waste my time lying to people. Why the hell would I?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 07:54:18	@asdquefty As previously written it is clear. Intimate story told and not believed. Other Tweets deleted. I am not a loser. Their problem.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 07:35:01	signing off now
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 07:30:46	@shiv379 *too stunned to think of witty response*

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 06:51:33	@NataliaAntonova Definitely not a coincidence, my dear! Definitely not!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 06:36:33	@Canageek hi hi
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 06:36:13	@NataliaAntonova *spins you in chair and jumps around* *stops and stares at you for five seconds* *pokes you and says tag then runs away*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 06:31:46	@gomarwrites I'd hazard a guess if you were dating a plumber? Just make sure they have a nice ass if yanno...that business arises...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 06:28:24	Well! Interesting numbers! *PA pretends she really IS Donald Trump* Ah, it's only money... *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 06:22:59	@shiv379 'Tis. I highly recommend!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 06:14:43	@shiv379 And I'm not from the US. We Canadiennes call it Jam! *pokes tongue out*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 06:13:13	@aspieteach Actually didn't take me long to figure out what kind of migraine. I already knew! I'm just to tired to know I already knew LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 06:11:45	@shiv379 Actually, to be precise that is what I DID have! You are spying on me! I like PB and Banana too! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 06:09:13	@aspieteach Missed this one. Oh, nice! Now that would be a RARE one. I should look into that. V. tired right now but I'm a med geek...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 06:02:49	@shiv379 Hi honeybunch. I've been sticking with routine stuff. Did have PB last night! Are you spying on me LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 05:28:58	@asdquefty Cool.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 05:28:48	@readheadgirl Go you! I like to try and surprise people when gift giving if I can.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 05:27:56	I'm so tired but should eat. Tired but eating something. And something bland. Conundrum. Tired...eating something bland... My pillows? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 05:21:48	@readheadgirl Nothing like good surprise gifts!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 05:19:35	@aspieteach Yes interesting but a pain! Great I'm going blind in one eye! Any consolation my seizures have made me blind in both eyes! LOL

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 05:12:24	@asdquefty Yes study study! How are you?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 05:11:39	@FroggyPrinceMom True better ones now. I still have old contacts in package that I can haul out anytime. Just kept in saline.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 05:10:23	@aspieteach Yes. pressure?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:58:57	@FroggyPrinceMom @aspieteach Well done! Yes, those are the ones you need if your astigmatism is SO BAD!!! Again, mine was fine! Money grab?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:57:54	@FroggyPrinceMom LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:57:40	@FroggyPrinceMom I need a fairly sold frame as my Rx. is significant. Like 6.75 and 7.0 in either/or eye.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:56:41	@aspieteach @FroggyPrinceMom I can't think of a name but they told me only permanent due to astigmatism but they lied! I can wear disposable
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:54:27	@FroggyPrinceMom I avoid antibi's at all cost but if it's bacterial no choice. Duh.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:53:32	@FroggyPrinceMom Also I have MEGA light sensitivity so need the auto-tint jazz.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:53:08	@FroggyPrinceMom Well expensive glasses are worth the investment I think. You need to see! I've always paid good $ if I can't get a deal.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:51:39	@FroggyPrinceMom Oh shit! Exploding body parts from coughing! NOT GOOD. And that's an understatement!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:50:55	@FroggyPrinceMom Talk about unfair, huh? I'm okay with all antibi's except Sulfa Allergy/Reaction. No ugly yeast LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:50:21	@FroggyPrinceMom OMG! YOU are now my next Chemistry Experiment! LOL Bitch for some women to take antibi's when sick as then they get yeast.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:49:16	@FroggyPrinceMom SCARY! I wore (still can, just like my groovy specs) contacts for years but will never get laser. Your eyes are for life!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:48:11	@padmeamidala Hugs too. I've noticed a lot of people feeling crappy around here lately so big hugs to everyone!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:45:22	@FroggyPrinceMom Not good! I've had enough head injuries (this year alone!) and my glasses are golden! Saved me? Fucking seizures!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:41:15	@FroggyPrinceMom I know, yay me. My eye was swollen complete shut and OMG. I looked like I went a few rounds in a boxing ring! Dunno who won
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:40:07	@BearTwinsMom Alright. Well that would be surgery related. Still keep a very close eye on the oedema. It SHOULD resolve as you heal?

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:25:17	@BearTwinsMom Always remember that Dr. PA is NOT a doctor! Your oedema could be related to your lymphatic system. What happens is there is..

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 04:03:58	@FroggyPrinceMom LOL Indeed. They don't call me Dr. PA for no reason? Joke: Physician Heal Thyself. *smirk*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 03:59:12	@FroggyPrinceMom It's okay. It just meant a later night. If the Seroquel gets weird I just add a Valium to push it along.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-16 03:56:54	@alphabetania Sorry what do mean my meds or my tea?

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 09:57:19	@EnigmaAnonymous As last written my gastro probs from years ago are back so things are NOT good. But very funny. No, I am not eating dogs!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 09:53:08	Okay dinner. Sit, DO NOT roll over, play dead.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 09:24:08	@asdquefty Temporary. My GP is just on Mat. Leave. Not back yet.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 09:12:52	@asdquefty Just ate. Am SO ticked off. EVERYTHING wrong w/ me has now happened! Maybe that's why I am "at peace." Nothing left of me go! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 08:42:55	@asdquefty LOL! I had a ROUGH night at J.s as per post. OMG. Back to bland food today? Had cereal & ok. Should maybe try a little more now?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 08:36:06	@asdquefty I'm okay how are you? That statement about peace and not caring was just my own twisted logic. Not to worry! I care loads!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 08:27:56	Is it possible you've achieved a certain level of peace, in realizing that you just don't care anymore? O.o

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 06:13:45	@333AutismNews @shiv379 I flicked a pea up someone's nose across the dinner table once. PA had good aim? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 06:10:02	@333AutismNews I know but I still think it's stupid! I never ate batteries as a kid or anything! Pfft! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 05:51:32	You know kids toys are fucked these days when you now need a screwdriver to install batteries! *runs to get hopefully right Phillips*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 05:41:56	@alphabetania @anib Sure! The other is fie, too! I need my caffeine though!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-15 05:40:57	Why do they make packaging so difficult? I already bought you I'm not stealing you! Maybe it's just me but? No probably just me.*rolls eyes*

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 02:32:08	@FroggyPrinceMom Food or "Meals on Wheels" options?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 02:27:30	@Canageek Yes! Yes! I saw it and now I want to die even more! *crosses eyes again* LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 02:24:57	@Canageek You are so silly! Pulling a re-twee about my embarrassment! OMG... *crosses eyes*

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 02:10:58	@Canageek Ironically I have a doc. appt. on 23rd! So maybe afterward? After Xmas? And of course we can meet!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 02:09:19	@Canageek But no. I don't think I look anorexic! That's a bit harsh! Still, quite wee. Quite?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 02:07:50	@Canageek The table one was years ago. The other was just my face. Met three bloggers? Could ask their opinion? LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 02:06:56	@FroggyPrinceMom Bad weather, eh? Meals on Wheels!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 01:47:01	@Canageek Yes, I should probably go out. Maybe tea #3 wll help get me more motivated.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 01:46:16	@Canageek I like Faye being slutty! Also, I am really...well pretty skinny I guess from the Gastro Problems. I can't help that though.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 01:41:34	@Canageek However I will say thank you for just a touch older. Wee PA does look younger than she is! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 01:39:36	@Canageek Well Faye is an Anime Character. You are just going by my pics as well? I'm not even going near the "less slutty" part! LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 01:36:10	@FroggyPrinceMom No kidding, huh? Friend wants me to come over for dinner but weather is CRAP! Also, do I feel like?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 01:34:08	@Canageek Thank you, for my Anatomy lesson! I am quite familiar with my own body LOL Although, thank you v. much for finding my brain cells!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 01:30:52	Oh energy, brain cells, you elusive things! *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 01:22:46	@Canageek LMAO! My upper body is the fun half? Well, I think entire bodies are fun! Thanks for the compliment about my body though. ACK!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 01:16:46	@Canageek Oh, okay. That's what I thought with the pic. Yes you can see at least half of my body! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 00:48:04	@Canageek Huh?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 00:45:01	@asdquefty I don't think it's a stim, just maybe something new or my mood? Something that I find funny or something?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 00:44:19	@asdquefty Oh forgot to mention as only on tea #1 LOL Sometimes I just get into a groove of something I really like and play it over & over
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 00:43:19	@asdquefty Well music is music. Maybe just what you're into at the moment.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 00:35:37	@asdquefty I still laugh so hard at myself re: the TV Guide channel scrolling and it taking me YEARS to figure out I stim on that! SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-14 00:33:09	@asdquefty I was getting arm flappy not long ago. After appt. w/ Merlin #2 going home. And I told you about xmas lights in loud pub! O.o

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 23:21:52	@Canageek And don't worry, I'll keep myself in one piece! We will meet!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 23:21:24	@Canageek Yes you have my pics but only, oh wait...one has "part" of my body? Still? Alright, say whatever you want about my body then!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 07:04:16	I'm going to rest for a bit. Do some deep breathing or something. I promise I won't set myself on fire. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:51:54	@333AutismNews Yes it can be hard. i like opportunity to try new meds with more available time but not always possible.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:48:34	@alphabetania Nah! I don't hurt other people! I'm a masochist!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:45:44	@mama_kass Oh, and self immolation means setting yourself on fire, right? So forget effigy re: protest of self, just burn self!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:44:58	@333AutismNews Good to hear as long as she stays stable?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:44:36	@mama_kass Just joking because my stupid gastro issues are back and I feel like crap! So I said I was staging a protest re: my body/brain!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:40:14	@mama_kass You have a question?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:39:47	@alphabetania You didn't see the last one about self immolation? PA go KABOOM!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:38:44	@333AutismNews Thanks, hopefully by reinstating what I did with Gastro Man before I can get things back on track...well, as best as before.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:36:05	@333AutismNews Thanks for the hugs.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:35:29	@Canageek Thank you for saying my body is pretty and my brain wonderful. Oh, my! You haven't even seen my body! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:34:36	On second thought. Screw effigy. I'm just going to go self immolation and be done with it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:31:22	Hmmm...gingerale? I hate my brain. I hate my body. I'm going to stage a protest against both right now. Burn them in effigy?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:25:17	@Canageek Or maybe Cow Mouth? Like I said, it doesn't dissolve well in water. Big huge flakes and very dry. Like chewing cud! LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:21:22	@Canageek No worries. Can't decide if I should rest or not. I should clean my Horse Mouth though! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:19:52	I now have large chunks of fiber stuck all over my mouth. This shit doesn't dissolve well. Makes you feel like a horse when eating it. LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:13:29	@Canageek Thanks hon. I appreciate it.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:10:17	@Canageek Huge amounts of special bran. Can not be what you find in any cereal not even Psyllium that is "Super Bran!" Start off with...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:08:51	...this therapy I may get better faster. For now back is the pain, nausea and maybe lack of appetite. I guess I can explain therapy.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 06:07:50	@Canageek No gastro probs from several years ago. Really bad. Insane. Now back but at least not all symptoms so that may be good as with...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-13 05:27:54	@Canageek LOL Activated Charcoal is what the give you in hospital if you OD! BARF! No it's a natural solution. Too long to explain via Tweet

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-12 14:04:28	@worstmark I'm finding #LOFNOTC a bit too much really. When I started it was pretty tame but now? I can't keep up and it head blows up!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-12 14:01:53	I gotta settle my sorry ASSpie Ass down. Yikes! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-12 14:00:16	@worstmark Hey, how are you? Time zones can always apply for #LOFNOTC or anything else?

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-12 05:40:33	@EnigmaAnonymous Yes have had subscriptions to Symphony so I know it can vary. May have to go Functional over Fasionable!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-12 05:38:20	@asdquefty Well Classical so can vary but I prefer to be overdressed rather than underdressed when going out. Just don't want to FREEZE!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-12 05:34:41	@asdquefty Concert. No girly short skirts will FREEZE! Suit? Maybe bit more casual? I don't know! O.o

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 07:16:19	Well so far uploading this one's a no brainer if it doesn't make me burst out in tears first!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 07:04:47	And into the meadow, near quiet river, the last tree sought for your nimble limbs. Deft and swift, minus thought, hesitation. Fruit in hand!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 06:19:09	@333AutismNews Well, I'm a trashmouth or I can be. So if ever there was a time for me to let it fly, this certainly qualifies!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 06:08:02	@333AutismNews *goes non-verbal at keyboard reading that motherfucking shit*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 06:03:38	@BurlyQEinstein Absolutely! I hear you there, dahlin'!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 05:33:09	Fuck me. Speaking of ADD how difficult is it REALLY to listen to some tracks and add music to your library. SERIOUSLY, PA...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 05:30:39	@alphabetania Thought so! Not as stupid as I look! I am on extended release of that med for my ADD.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 05:25:20	@alphabetania Today it's more like I'm just not capable of anything and not even capable of doing nothing! Btw, what med? Sounds like a stim
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 05:22:30	@asdquefty Cheeky Wee should have pizza? I have one. See what tummy says later?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 05:21:07	@asdquefty I can barely do what I'm doing which is nothing. O.o

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:59:10	@catatonickid @shiv379 That's if you can keep an eye! You're going to be in the kitchen slaving away you know. Take up a lot of your time!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:51:04	@shiv379 @catatonickid Oh, if you could only get your eyes on those emails! But alas... Actually, neither of us need any "instructions."

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:19:34	@asdquefty Well you know all of my comorbidities so each and every one of my meds is necessary!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:18:43	@melankolyme existing meds if they find anything with VEEG as they will lower my ACs while I am there to try and get me to seize.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:18:05	@melankolyme FTW anyway about it all. I have Epilepsy so just deal with it or maybe it will get better when my life settles? Maybe tweak...

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:09:47	@333AutismNews You got it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:09:13	@melankolyme That specific benzo would never be psrescribed for anxiety of sleep. Not really! It's for Epilepsy.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:08:41	@melankolyme Anticonvulsants help me in three ways: Epilepsy, Bipolar and Migraine Prophylaxis! Also on specific benzo as adjunct 4 Epilepsy
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:07:15	@333AutismNews Man, you have it SO worse than me! However, in your parts ALWAYS worse! They don't give you that nickname for good reason!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:04:31	@melankolyme No known cause for Epilepsy. Had since I was kid. "Theory" for getting worse may be stress since job loss but so little known..
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:03:45	@melankolyme It is frustrating but idk. At this moment? No. Literally I don't know! *laughing* Head screwy. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 01:01:35	@melankolyme ..mostly having seizures that is stopping me? Then getting post-ictal afterward. Then that drags my mood down? Still trying.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-11 00:54:40	@333AutismNews I was watching news and like some parts of the U.S. Wha...? Although over years has been really crazy anyway.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 03:21:55	@MarcyRubin Thanks hon' good to know you're always around for anything!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 03:21:20	@catatonickid @shiv379 I don't even like salt anyway! Kinda icky! Always find a lot of resto food too salty!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 03:20:17	@catatonickid @shiv379 ...except ex-gf's mother? *refrains from making Jewish Mother Jokes*

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 03:16:29	@MarcyRubin Hey! I'm not alone! It's always good to not feel alone in the world even if it is only about salmon eating. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 03:12:32	@catatonickid Yes I understand. I can't do salmon anymore. Salmoned Out! Too much of it (odd I like lox though?) O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 03:11:32	@catatonickid @shiv379 Nice rhyme. Yes ex-gf used to tease me re: eating Jewish food and said I was more Jewish than other Jews LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 03:06:27	@catatonickid @shiv379 LMAO! Did you see my lox comment? *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 03:05:43	@catatonickid Can you do tuna? I find that a nice combination? But maybe too salty...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 02:46:11	@catatonickid Absolutely! It wasn't plain ol' cream cheese either! Vegetable style! I love cream cheese and lox too! YUM!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 02:32:00	@asdquefty am tired these days. So maybe a fast boost. I know how to get the "quick fix" so going to discuss that route.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 02:31:00	@asdquefty NO! Ferritin fell huge few years ago w/ Gastro Hell! Bottomed out! W/ supplementation perfect. Now numbers questionable but I...

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 01:08:28	Now I just have to find my Gastro's card for the Anaemia...where the hell is it? LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 01:06:35	If anyone cares about my lovely blood B12 low (knew it!) Iron a bit dodgy still (knew it!) Everything else okay (knew it!)
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 01:04:01	I love my GPs office! Discussed bloodwork right over the phone! Now I know EXACTLY what I have to do! And was pretty sure of results anyway.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 01:02:23	@thespindleshay LOL! Yes...profane, profane, profane.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 01:02:06	@catatonickid accident prone with everything I was doing re: chores so STOP! You might end up in the ER! Twas funny really tho. I'm okay?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 01:01:20	@catatonickid Thanks! I just think I'm having a spazzy day like yesterday. You would not believe what happened if you didn't read! Severely
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 00:47:49	@asdquefty Maybe I should have taken two of mine this morning? Duhhhh... ...bbbbbb... Just kidding. 72mg would fry my wee head!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 00:14:44	@333AutismNews Might be "Upcoming-Post-Related." No, really...some odd changes I've noticed since another change that has happened LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 00:13:54	@333AutismNews Heh. Something's wrong with me though. I might be having another "Day" like yesterday. Everything was all wonky LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 00:12:46	I'm so goddamn tired I don't even want to make my fucking tea. Whoa I sound cranky. I'm NOT a cranky person when I wake up-or ever? *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 00:10:39	@crpitt Rainbows, gay penguins, all sounds good to me!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 00:10:07	@SheikYurbouti Sounds like what I just wrote. We're in the same boat today.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-08 00:08:07	Another day. Yay. *rolls eyes* *laughs* O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 09:34:40	*suddenly feels pooped*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 09:26:03	listening to "REM - Harborcoat" ♫ http://blip.fm/~hem8s
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 09:06:12	@Canageek Thanks again. Well, all I can do is what I have always done. Rely upon another person's feedback. If they find me attractive okay!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:59:21	@Canageek Yes, thank you for complimenting me. However, beauty is in the eye of the beholder? I may not be attractive to all?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:58:19	@Canageek That's fine. You and Ada knock yourselves out!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:49:53	@Canageek I know but HOW many times have we done this? I have NO idea how attractive I am and how many attractive women I may attract! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:37:57	@Canageek Well, I don't know about that? If they find you attractive, then I guess you will! LMAO!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:36:35	@Canageek Hey, you do what YOU want but MY bedroom is my own Sacred Space! Muah-ha-ha...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:35:39	@shiv379 @YogaChicky *looks* Uh huh. Over...there... Okay. Sure. Well, thanks for your help anyway, guys!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:32:09	@shiv379 @YogaChicky Wait a sec' I thought I was in Oz. Am I back in Canada now? Or do you see me somewhere else? Where are you pointing?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:30:11	@YogaChicky Or maybe...THERE I am. you found me! Hey! Look how much I've travelled!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:28:58	@YogaChicky Hi hon'. Yes...here I am!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:28:31	@Canageek I know, but that was the fun of it. The whole show was crazy. You could have sex but have to be exhibitionist? It was clear.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:25:07	@Canageek Maxwell Smart! "The Cone of Silence" LMAO! I'm Agent 99 of course! Well, she was the only woman in the show anyway... *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:20:52	Been a weird day. On top of all else I have (more so than usual) lost all concept of time. I don't know where I am. Can anyone else find me?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:08:39	@codeman38 Hope you feel better soon.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 08:07:15	@Canageek Yes, of course. We wouldn't want to disturb the others and locks for privacy and blah, blah...all of that!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 07:56:53	@Canageek Are you kidding me? Of course we'd have Dungeon and...and... *laughing* Well, my bedroom would have... *smirks*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 07:55:08	@shiv379 LMAO! You're such a cutie!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 07:52:58	@shiv379 thank you Master...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 07:49:11	@shiv379 yes Master...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 07:38:57	@Canageek Yes, nice and sophisticated. Hmmm...wonder what else we could add. Depending upon who we invite, I'd better not say! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 07:31:20	@Canageek W00t! *does another happy dance* We can host a massive Twitter Party/Commune together! *thinks of curious & awesome possibilities*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 07:28:41	@BurlyQEinstein You know what though about the College of Prayer? Counterintuitive/productive? Gay marriage legal here! PA can marry!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 06:58:53	@Canageek W00t! *does happy dance* Awesome Possum because my flat sucks!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 06:51:52	I have to sit down. Literally. I'm on my knees bending over typing on baby MacBook. SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 06:36:10	Where the hell is my...? Oh yeah...right where it either shouldn't be or where I completely forgot that I remembered four days ago...ADD!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 05:43:53	I have been tasked! I love it when (some) people tell me what to do... *evil grin*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 05:18:11	@alphabetania No worries!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 05:18:01	@alphabetania Sounds like a plan to me! If I do end up in some "ceyloon" though, I'm not using their Ceyloon Spittoon!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 05:10:29	@alphabetania LOL! Or the crazy folks like me?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 05:09:13	@CalliCoop LOL! Couldn't help but check in on you with that. I wasn't sure as I get a little insecure at times...a little?! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 05:04:13	@Canageek Very cool. I considered it as a possible profession years ago but Photog. as a living is hard and competitive! I love it as hobby
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 04:58:20	@Canageek LOL! I could help you take the picture. No need to bother with your brother. I'm not a pro but I could teach you enough? *shrug*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 04:56:29	@Canageek Make sure you take the picture of me from the right angle or position. Shooting into the mirror will give you a flash bounce!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 04:53:26	@patientanon *looks in mirror and notes dorkiness beaming*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 04:49:29	@CalliCoop Hey! So do all the women on Twitter still want us? ROTFLMAO!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 04:46:19	Okay how about some nice Paul Desmond...ahhh...lovely!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 04:30:11	@YogaChicky Thanks! I'm glad you liked it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 04:02:24	@BurlyQEinstein *grins* I tossed out my Fet. Gear in anger years ago. Long stories about all of that! Too long for Twitter but better via e.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 03:53:55	Alright. What can I try and do around here that will NOT cause bodily injury? *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 03:41:51	@EnigmaAnonymous Yes, I amuse myself all the time. It's fun and I am truly beyond comprehension so it is very easy for me to do so.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 03:40:31	@BurlyQEinstein I know. HOT! I SO want to wear that right now! Gloves too! I have a pair of boots that might work well with it, also?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 03:38:00	@EnigmaAnonymous Good except being totally spazzy today LOL! Idk what's wrong with me! Oh well, I'm amusing myself!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 03:33:30	@BurlyQEinstein Oooh! Oooh! Nice corset! Me too! Can never have enough corsets!!! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 03:31:53	@BurlyQEinstein I know! What the...? *shakes head* And just to be safe, I made my current cuppa in a plastic travel mug LOL!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 02:52:28	@worstmark LOL! I try but sometimes it's redonculous! I do get all twisted up in them and yes look like a damn ghost in my sheets!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 02:50:41	@Canageek LOL! No! Make me a nice comfy hammock so I can be all swingy and stimmy! I fucking need it after breaking the dish! AHHH! SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 02:49:19	OMFG! NO MORE housekeeping today!!! Just broke dish while washing!!! Had to be VERY careful with sharp stuff afterward!!! SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 02:37:11	@Canageek LOL! Indeed. I get all tangled up in my sheets? I have to fold everything though. I have "Laundry Issues." Must be done right!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-07 02:35:28	I am WAY too small to fold bed linen.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 23:39:09	@shiv379 LOL! I can't. Once I'm up I'm up! Besides, the "Raccoon Look" is sexy!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 23:34:44	Well somebody woke up very early. That would be me! Yes, I have been up for two hours now! And I stayed up later than when I signed off.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 11:10:10	@asdquefty Thanks hon.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 11:10:01	@worstmark Thanks hon.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 11:08:20	Okay, I'm going to resty, I guessy...nini...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 11:07:04	@worstmark YAHHOOIEE!!! Typing that was weird. I'm trying to imagine saying that. It doesn't work. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 11:01:30	@worstmark Yep, you're part of the club!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 10:59:27	@worstmark No I know that you meant it was endaring to you but I meant when you said if it means "anything" - yes, you always mean something
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 10:57:33	@BurlyQEinstein Oh, dear! I hope you're doing alright! Glad you're awake now to get them back into your system!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 10:56:26	@asdquefty Well, you can't absorb every detail. I mean, you can't learn everything! No one can hon.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 10:55:43	@worstmark Everything you say means something, honey.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 10:54:39	@asdquefty Yes, it can be really hard when you're under pressure, deadlined and everything.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 10:53:54	@asdquefty Sorries hon. I know it's hard when you're really keen. Try as much as you can not to be too harsh on yourself. You are smart.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 10:52:28	@worstmark Thank you. Yes, my incorrigibility is one of my more endearing qualities? Okay. Maybe only to those also incorrigible? *ponders*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 10:49:06	@BurlyQEinstein *hugs* HA! I know. Ditto. I want to go out tomorrow for errands. Not far but forget today! Thank Zeus for good sleep meds!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 10:43:51	@BurlyQEinstein You need resty like me. We're both being bad and should get off our computers... I am incorrigible. This is not news.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 10:41:46	@asdquefty Yeah, sounds like you need some chill time. You never got back to me about me being disappointed and if in you, NEVER!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 09:47:48	@asdquefty What me disappointed in you?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 09:38:16	@asdquefty Yeah, didn't think so.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 09:34:14	@asdquefty Hang in hon. Still time to pick things up? And just one mark. You're smart.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 09:31:11	@benpolar @shiv379 Based upon context, perhaps but it may still be redundant. The act would be redundant but circumstances different?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 09:25:36	@benpolar @shiv379 I've never tried it either but I'll try anything! Note: Did not say "once" as that is grammatically incorrect? Redundant?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 09:15:24	@benpolar @shiv379 Interesting.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 09:04:03	@shiv379 Bag is fine--easier. I had a ball before but got lost in multiple moves somewhere along the way.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 08:58:08	@shiv379 Most of the "Breakfasts" are good: English, Irish...OMG, I'm a TEA FREAK so whatever?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 08:57:13	@shiv379 Could probably go with exclusion rather than inclusion? Used to drink Green but too much so kind of off it now. Idk? Try anything?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 08:49:50	@shiv379 @YogaChicky The Almighty Earl of Grey! *bows to The Earl*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 08:41:58	@shiv379 Thanks for the #ff
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 08:37:30	@shiv379 LMAO! I was thinking along the lines of seeing religious icons all over and "It's a SIGN!!!" Some Divine Prophecy or something...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 08:34:30	@thespindleshay Yes, yummy. Actually, I recommend chocolate chip pancakes for any meal! HA!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 08:29:26	@thespindleshay Hey what totally rocks is a fun breakfast for dinner. I recommend chocolate chip pancakes!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 08:24:07	@shiv379 I'm glad that you're grinning but I'll never forgive you for that visual...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 08:23:02	@benpolar Thanks for the #FF
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 08:04:52	@BurlyQEinstein Done deal. And I was trying to say (damn 140 chars!) I can maintain your maintenance levels? Yes, quite sure there.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 08:02:26	@BurlyQEinstein LOL! That's fine by me. I can be very affectionate (w/ the right person of course!) I have standards! *wink* I can keep up 2

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:57:47	@BurlyQEinstein Thanks for the Follow...looking forward to getting to know you better! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:57:07	@AliveinMe Don't worry honey! I'm not making much sense! post-ictal! Ding! ...bbbbb...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:55:29	@BurlyQEinstein Thanks hon'. This is crap! I mean, not like I haven't been post-ictal before but it's still not a flippin' party! #LOFNOTC
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:51:19	@BurlyQEinstein Well, kudos to you then! What a trooper! This is my second day of being post-ictal so debating a resty atm? #LOFNOTC
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:47:02	@worstmark @BurlyQEinstein Hey guys. At least I'm making an effort to show up for #LOFNOTC even if not reading. Head...hurting...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:45:38	@leighcunningham Go to bed now. Get off your computer and take a nap! *PA waves from Northern Hemisphere*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:44:26	@333AutismNews Yes, sounds like. Keep me posted but I know you will!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:43:03	I'm post-ictal though so my head can't handle #LOFNOTC tonight. At least not in gang form.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:41:52	@hidama You could go check out the gang at #LOFNOTC They're pretty cool. I'm one of them.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:38:55	@333AutismNews "definitive" reason for a plane flight lowering someone's threshold unless they have found some previous issue on their own.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:38:06	@333AutismNews Stress can be a factor w/ seizures altho she is younger and if not stressed & and kept calm with you? Idk. Can't see any...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:37:00	@333AutismNews Not necessarily? Re: the body and flying, atmospheric pressure so ears popping/pain. Some people have motion sickness...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:31:36	@333AutismNews Follow up with whatever happens, keep pushing with the docs no matter what and ADVOCATE like hell for her if need be!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:30:18	@333AutismNews Re: Stephy though, try not to "worry" but keep a watchful eye, hopefully you have good docs on the case, document EVERYTHING!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:28:47	@333AutismNews You still have to bear in mind that they are "possibles" but when you add them all up and look at me? Staggering. Frightening
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:27:18	@333AutismNews There are several noted comorbidities with the Spectrum and it reads like a laundry list of my brain and body!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:25:15	@333AutismNews might depend upon types of seizures any know reason for lowering her thresholds. Tough as well w/ possiblities of comorbidity
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:23:52	@333AutismNews but then they came back later in life. Bear in mind that is just me though. Epilepsy can and is different for everyone? Also
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:23:09	@333AutismNews Idk if I can answer that. Epilepsy is so hard. No known cause for me. Individual case for all? Mine stopped when I was a kid
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 07:07:51	@shiv379 Anything you can do? YOU CAN STOP MY SEIZURES!!! *laughing* No just be there as always *huggles back*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 06:55:53	@shiv379 Not particularly *rolls eyes* Well no literal eye rolling. Ow. Feeling post-ictal from the lovely phonic/Mozart seizure yest. morn.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 06:50:18	@readheadgirl You got that right!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 06:42:57	@readheadgirl I do write *cough cough* so I AM my own worst critic...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 06:41:57	@readheadgirl Just DM'ing. YW. Don't know how much of a "Literary Critic" I could be but more than happy to take a look? *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 06:34:23	RT @readheadgirl : Thx who already responded! RT if you're a blogger & want to review my poetry in a post, I'll send you a free ebook! DM me
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 06:18:52	@mama_kass *smirks*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 06:14:51	@mama_kass And then the question of asking for dessert out of order? First? I graduated from The School of Emily Post so definitely not!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 06:08:42	@mama_kass You funny crazy woman! Maybe you could just go with an appetizer? A salad?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 05:54:07	@asdquefty As with any taper slow and easy...very.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 05:47:06	@asdquefty Good luck with exam!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 05:46:46	@asdquefty That is to say if you are going to quit coffee altogether.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 05:46:23	@asdquefty You may have already built up enough of a tolerance then. Too much. Watch out for withdrawal. Can be bad as I went through it.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 05:42:26	@asdquefty Maybe not so much? Crosses blood brain barrier.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 05:41:56	@asdquefty Well there's the crash effect. Plus tolerance. How crash occurs w/ everyone. Just depends upon individual?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 05:40:03	@asdquefty No it was the phonic in the morning. Confirmed as went into post-ictal territory later in day? Hey, you're high flyin' w/ drinks
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-05 05:34:03	@asdquefty I was post-ictal yesterday (and still blech today) had to watch TV "sideways" as eyes buggy. O.o

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 11:51:05	Shit. I almost forgot about what I have to do tomorrow. I kind of wish I forgot. Or not. Or something. *winces*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 11:44:50	@myautisticson Yes, it is like a reduction to simplicity. Like some forms of pattern recognition at times too? Perhaps?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 11:43:55	@spectrumdweller Yw. That is very gracious of you! Fish are lovely creatures though. At least I like them! Some are really pretty. Tetras!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 11:41:47	@myautisticson I know. I was even so stimmy about it I was too stupid to realize I was so stimmy ROTFLMAO!!! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 11:39:41	@myautisticson You know how it just keeps rolling over the next shows on the next channels? LOL! I'm too much!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 11:38:47	@myautisticson Absolutely. Although I can visually stim on other things. I realized the other day I stim on the TV Guide Channel LOL!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 11:30:30	@myautisticson I'm right with your son on the lights! I would even say the same words?! HA!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 11:27:34	@spectrumdweller Actually, that would take talent. Weaving while wearing the SCUBA gear. You're gooood! I stand/sit/whatever corrected!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 11:23:35	@FroggyPrinceMom LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 11:23:25	@spectrumdweller I'm sorry! I didn't know you could skate!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 11:16:21	@spectrumdweller I don't know if those would satisfy your creative side. Unless you'd get into home decorating? Lots of black paint? *ducks*

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-03 00:53:41	@Canageek @hidama Thanks for the compliment sweetie. Let's hope things don't get out of control like last night. Probably my own fault-arse!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:55:12	@worstmark LOL I swear something happens to me with Twitter at times. It goes beyond "Social Networking Site Studies." I become an idiot.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:48:47	@worstmark I know. I was just being a dork and trying to BREAK the "Obnoxious Quotient" not simply reach it this time...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:46:55	@Canageek I wanted to do that too (TweetCloud) but wanted to see it first. Curious. Didn't want it to show up to the "world" before I saw it
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:44:41	RT @worstmark : @patientanon *tickles since you're lagging* / Now this I have never heard: "To tickle one's lag." Born of me wasting time.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:40:08	Okay so I'm still here...banter, banter, banter but again, thank you all who made me positively howl tonight!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:36:14	*laughing so hard* Sorry...email not Twitter although I will say hats off to all as it does take a lot to literally make me laugh out loud.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:33:36	@asdquefty Nighty-night hon'
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:33:10	@spectrumdweller Okay...well all I can hope for is that I'm not that "b'aaahhhd" then.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:30:48	Well time to put this crazy Aspie head to bed I guess folks! Laters...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:07:35	@spectrumdweller So am I still so ridiculously Aspie literal that I rank below a sheep?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:06:27	@worstmark *blushing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 12:03:47	@worstmark Thanks, I feel honoured that you feel... *laughing* How could you not be? You've always been so great to me since we first met.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:56:29	@worstmark Yeah I know you're teasing. Not to worry. You are amongst the trusted circle anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:56:03	@EnigmaAnonymous Get good sleeps! *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:55:06	@spectrumdweller Okay I see stuff but it was a muddled and I got confused with my Aspie brain! I thought you meant online gaming!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:52:53	@EnigmaAnonymous *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:52:45	@worstmark Not intentionally "teasing" being careful w/ my anonymity!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:49:43	@spectrumdweller *runs to check to see if you're fooling me or if my memory is*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:48:23	@CalliCoop LOL! I'm just nuts.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:48:00	@EnigmaAnonymous You're not obnoxious, hon'. At least you don't seem so to me! You seem very sweet and just a girl to squeeze to death!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:46:30	@worstmark Hey, you might get a pic. Christmas is coming... LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:44:09	Should I sign off Twitter now? Have I reached the "Obnoxiousness Quotient" yet?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:43:19	@worstmark And we've got a vote for me being "possibly hot" here!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:42:40	@Canageek Thank you for saying I am hot, honey. At least YOU have seen my pics? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:41:46	@CalliCoop ROTFLMAO! I am laughing so hard I can't type!!! Okay, now I can. Barely...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:40:19	@EnigmaAnonymous Yeah, one of the perils of being an Aspie? What the hell, though! Sometimes a stupid pain but carry on! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:39:16	@asdquefty *nods*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:38:33	@worstmark Thanks hon' I'm just being arsey. The misinterpretation was fucking funny though! I got really scared! Flattery scared? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:37:25	You operate under really dumb assumptions like you actually might be hot. SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:34:55	This is what happens when you have Asperger's and you think in terms of a highly literal manner. You do not interpret things correctly.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:33:00	SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:32:40	I.Am.A.Total.Asshole.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:31:57	I seem to have generated another online sex conversation & COMPLETELY misunderstood the person as saying a lot of women on Twitter wanted me
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 11:26:06	@spectrumdweller LMAO! I didn't get the invite (evite?) for the online sex. Sorries. Maybe you'd better resend it?
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 09:52:53	@Canageek Awww... *makes sad face* They'll be back though!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 09:47:01	@Canageek "...a nice flirt... *ahem* <insert correction> LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 09:39:11	@Canageek Only way to get over them is to go through them, right? *shrugs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 09:38:48	@Canageek Oh, honey! *big hugs* You are such a sweet love. Yes, sometimes things are hard but you (I) have to just go through them...
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 09:37:27	@Canageek Do the best you can for the test. New friend online? That's cool! Good about the studying too. Keep it up! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 09:34:29	@Canageek Idk. You read my blog so you know that. Roller coaster stuff there. Still trying to move ahead with my life. Same plans there? You

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 07:19:50	Alright dammit! Because I have no personal assistant I guess I am going to have to take drastic measures! I don't know what but...DRASTIC!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 07:16:36	@shiv379 @catatonickid Maybe they reconsidered and found my blog too naughty after all? Well, they're missing out! HA!
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 07:15:47	@catatonickid @shiv379 Never have. Just as a "Featured Blogger" on some larger med sites came w/ warning LOL. Some have dropped me since.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 07:12:39	@shiv379 @catatonickid They have the "Report as Mature" on WP and you have NO clue how many times I thought I'd get that one clicked on me!

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 06:56:02	I really should get off my computer and do something productive (not that you all aren't lovely people.) I just dick around too much.
16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 06:51:01	@asdquefty @aspieteach Re: drawing in English Class example w/ my comorbid ADD I was like that. No focus so just fiddled around.

16253011	patientanon	2009-12-02 06:31:16	@SheikYurbouti I don't pay attention 2 the world as I'd rather shut out people's endless prattle but it can be funny overhearing the odd bit

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-29 15:42:00	@alphabetania It can depend maybe? Some good with it or not? Some guys can't even grow facial hair too! Just little patches!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-29 15:40:03	@asdquefty Don't keep up w/ latest trends and that bull but dress for occasion. Can dress well of course. Bum, casual, suits, femme whatev.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-29 15:26:31	@asdquefty I think I'm going to vote for sleep forever. Yes, much less hassle.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-29 15:26:03	@asdquefty Good u can stay up intentionally w/ no need for sleep? Maybe I shouldn't have taken meds. Can't decide. Stay awake or sleep 4ever

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 11:41:18	@asdquefty I'm so stupid but whenever I hear that I see a bird sitting on a computer monitor or screen SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 11:29:55	Yeah maybe I should take my meds to try and tell my brain to STFU! It never listens to me though.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 11:22:48	I should probably take all my sleep meds and go to bed. Well not ALL of them... *rolls eyes* O.o

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 11:04:40	@asdquefty I can but may do nothing. I may already be on my roller coaster. If I just stay up, cool. I already hit the low so if no...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 11:02:29	@asdquefty That's exactly it! Valium works well to chill me out! Now I'm all wingy, flyin' and racing! See? What's wrong w/ the pic'?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 11:01:29	@wayoutosphere Yep, I can take lots of deep breaths and should. As an Ultradian Cycler, it's quite a roller coaster for me--or can be! Thx.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 11:00:27	@asdquefty No way, babe. I had a big depression trigger, took a Valium and now I'm WAY up and UBER hyper. Next we see where I go from here.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 10:56:51	Hard to type on a laptop when you're bouncing all over *laughing so hard* SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 10:56:01	I think I'm fucked. At least I may be able to recognize when I'm starting to cycle? Or doing it? Christ u people should see me bouncing! OMG
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 10:53:18	@asdquefty No worries. Can I re-prop you with my props? Sounds like we're falling over SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 10:52:13	Uh, I REALLY hope I'm not starting 2 cycle here. Don't need that right after damn seizure. I crashed hard earlier now speedy after a Valium!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 06:08:39	@EnigmaAnonymous ..plus this time I don't know if I seized. Nothing during day so I am thinking it was during night. Only "real" answer?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 06:07:37	@EnigmaAnonymous Thanks honey. *hugs* It's always such a huge relief. I never know if I'll get sick or not so just have to wake up and see..

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 04:47:19	@MarcyRubin You don't have to clean up your links or blogroll! I just had a lot of dead links and I don't like to send readers to "nothing."
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 04:46:35	@MarcyRubin Oh, yeah. There should be "no pressure" to blogging. There really shouldn't be but sometimes I really feel I should do it.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 04:45:45	@MarcyRubin No worries. You can RSS me, if you have a feed reader, that too or just pop by whenever. Can bookmark me too? Your choice?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 04:43:46	@MarcyRubin I was spending some time cleaning up my blogroll today too. That was way overdue and needed some attention--still does really.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 04:25:10	@asdquefty Moo! I still love baby MacBook! And why did I just make a sound like a cow? SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-28 04:24:08	@asdquefty For me I think the problem is if I don't stop one version before I start listening to another.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-27 06:14:04	Whoa! Who put that chair there! Whoops! I'm fine...I'm okay! SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-27 06:08:59	@333AutismNews Nah, it's okay. Just because I'm not feeling all that well doesn't mean my sense of humour goes down the drain?!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-27 06:06:07	@spectrumdweller Sounds good. Still feeling sick though. Can you steal a wheelchair from somewhere for me?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-27 06:03:31	Oh! And now the barking dog has joined the "chorus" of upstairs shite guitar playing and singing. H...e...l...p...

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-27 05:58:40	Okay now I have to decide regardless of black page, red devil, evil colour, text for my writing, is my head hurting too much? *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-27 05:51:04	Or... Make my page background black and my text red... Would that be better for my writing? Decisions...Decisions...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-27 05:49:23	Ah! Perfect! Change my page in Word so the background is black and my text is white! Maybe I should do that every time I write. It suits...

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-27 05:32:41	@333AutismNews Thx hon. A bit screwy as can't "confirm" seizure but all signs post-ictal so I am going with idea that it was a nocturnal one
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-27 05:31:18	@shiv379 Cool. Let me know what you bought. If too long for Twitter shoot me an e.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-27 05:28:55	@333AutismNews Hi. On the mend still I guess. I think I kid myself when I say I am post-ictal for 24-72hrs. No 3 days? A bit better tho.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-27 05:26:12	@catatonickid @shiv379 However, not to worry. I would never, EVER abandon you!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-26 00:39:55	@asdquefty Esactly. If it was an infection I would be feverish by now. Just since I last messaged you everythings coming back
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-26 00:27:44	@asdquefty Although one good thing? Watching cartoon channel and found awesome show? Need to try and find youtube maybe? Read about too?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-26 00:25:54	@asdquefty standard 72hrs could be infection but I have no fever etc... thus, epileptic activity?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-26 00:25:12	@asdquefty Hope your tummy okay *hugs* Yes Nocturnal seize looking right? Stress or sick? Too odd to bring on identical sx. If sick after...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-26 00:16:35	Going for tea now but I doubt it will do much? Maybe feeling better than yesterday but not to damn sure? Nocturnal seize looking possible?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-25 23:28:13	@Canageek where things will be today as I just woke up. I am always sick when post-ictal anywhere from 24-72 hours. I think still sick tho.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-25 23:27:06	@Canageek certain as I don't know 100% if I had a seizure but the signs all pointed toward posti-ctal. Moods got worse later too. Not sure..
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-25 23:26:16	@Canageek need to get things off our chests. Thank you for thinking of me though. I was indeed unwell and I think post-ictal? I am not...

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-25 00:13:46	@asdquefty Ugh. You know speaking of tummy and me and feeling? I suddenly feel all icky and nauseous out of it. Huh? Blech.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-24 23:44:02	Le sigh. Get motivated to do something and then put on a waiting list. Let's hope there's room for me!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-24 23:37:20	@asdquefty I'm fooky as I just woke up. I'm uber-fooky as I just made that word up! W00t! My Blip is Mega Fooky! Esp. the cat! Huh? Need tea

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-24 06:20:57	@Acrimonia I can't remember about Gadget and too lazy to open it up right now LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-24 06:20:38	@Acrimonia Yes the apps can all vary. I've found that I can't from Spaz. Or at least the Mac version maybe? I don't have a PC...

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-24 01:33:51	@aspieteach It's actually just an old family "recipe" that I pulled from memory last night. Chili isn't hard to make even without a recipe..
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-24 01:30:46	@asdquefty Oh, good 4 you! It was like yesterday when I managed 2 make my damn chili finally! I'm going 2 try & b productive again today 2?

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-22 09:58:16	@asdquefty Yes, some men deal better with razors, some better with electric. I use men's razors as disposables are crud esp. women's!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 10:16:16	@shiv379 Well, I'm still in the "negotiating with myself" stage LOL! Chucking whatever into the cart and then make final decisions?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 10:12:39	@shiv379 I can't, I can't! I am working through my last "category..." Then I shall stop!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 08:24:15	@asdquefty Thanks for Lanz but not helping! Not tellin' abt the site until I can show 'em off! Also, maybe the sleep deprivation's the prob?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 08:12:50	Am I on a bit of a (hypo)manic spending spree or am I just excited?!?!?! I really don't know... O.o

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 05:24:52	@shiv379 I just LOST THE GAME!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 05:21:26	@asdquefty Yes I just did and have baby MacBook up on my thighs/knees.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 05:20:46	@shiv379 I am tired from getting up so early for my EEG. But literally, sliding further down my bed? And looking around under my duvet?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 05:15:53	*slides down bed* ...bbbbbb...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 05:14:45	@EnigmaAnonymous You do sound a bit better? *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 05:06:35	@myautisticson Thanks for the FF
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 04:31:42	@Canageek I went for an interview etc... but they never followed up with me or got back to me so I volunteered somewhere else! Bah!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 04:31:03	@Canageek I know the kitties! Well, I love all animals but PA loves kitties best! Was going to volunteer at a shelter but the were dumb!...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 04:19:02	@Canageek I know. Terribly brutal. Animals love you unconditionally. Humans? Rare to find that quality!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 04:07:17	@Canageek Frackin' tired. Just put up post but I did a Twitlonger earlier. Although post is a bit "longer." Trying more tea to wake up? No.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 03:38:43	My (Very Early Morning) EEG: Ugh.  I’m still waiting for the Tea Faeries to alight upon my shoulders, with bless... http://bit.ly/5wc46p
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 02:32:18	@333AutismNews It was really traumatic with Mozart. He was fine all day and a few hours later I just "found" him under my bed. Bugger me.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 02:21:49	@333AutismNews LOL I'm a cat person. Love dogs but cat person. Howev. don't know if I can ever own another myself after my last baby died.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 02:11:19	@333AutismNews Yes, me=funny. I am not scared of what happened. S'ok. But yes, harder for kids to stay still!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 02:10:18	@asdquefty OMG! I did a TOTAL face plant into the glass! If there was a SPAZ O.o of The Year Award, what do you think? At least glasses ok!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 02:01:52	@asdquefty You are SO going to love what I did here: http://tl.gd/10h61 SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 02:00:58	@333AutismNews It's not up yet but just go here: http://tl.gd/10h61
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 01:50:32	@asdquefty You're welcome dearie. SPAZ O.o LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 01:49:54	@333AutismNews Thanks for Fuh-Fuh *rolls eyes* See my latest re: EEG. Minor head injury? *laughing uncontrollably* SPAZ O.o Can not believe.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 01:48:08	My (Very Early In The Morning) EEG: Well, what can I tell you. This! Let's just say the whole thing started off (cont) http://tl.gd/10h61
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 01:25:11	@spectrumdweller Per the EEG? This was just a normal one this morning (painfully early might I add.) No call about VEEG yet.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-21 01:11:38	@Canageek Hi made on time and okay. Just doing a Twitlonger as it's long! Should probably toss it up on blog too as idk what to write???
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:51:37	I shall see you all later after much caffeine post-EEG! *PA dashes off into the night with cape into the air*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:50:05	SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:50:00	Alrighty then! With all of this excitement watch my meds be spazzen and I'll be up later and need to add a Valium and thus get less sleep!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:47:34	@asdquefty Well, I know the route and it is early enough pre-rush hour? Again, early alarm and quick shower, toss on clothes and off!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:46:22	@Canageek Thanks. They told me the neuro area but I'm a SPAZ O.o so will probably get lost! I have set my alarm for a good time?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:45:40	@333AutismNews If no IV they will give her a benzo I suspect for sedation.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:44:44	Oh! Need hat! Nice looking gluey gummy hair after! They wash my face and ears. Raining today and tomorrow. Rain not enough to wash hair!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:35:28	And no pressure too, btw. They left me a message this morning saying if I was a whole 10min. late I couldn't get the EEG done! Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:33:52	Yeeseh! I gotta get some scripts renewed tomorrow too! WHEE!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:28:30	The end is nigh? My iPod is charged? Now meds and various other things I need to take care of...yay.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:27:21	@Canageek Been in hospital enough times. Old hat. *shrug*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:26:39	@Canageek LOL! I don't think Quantum would put me asleep. Just in some sort of stupour!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:26:00	@333AutismNews Well, sounds like they're going to sedate her using the IV? Depends what drug but an IV is a big deal? Drugs of some kind!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:24:13	@Canageek they like you tired for EEGs anyway. Even to sleep if you can but no way can I sleep for them! Forget that!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:23:39	@Canageek Thanks hon but I just have to walk like a block and then right to the door of hospital with transit. I'll just be tired but...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:19:16	@asdquefty Yes, be an out and proud Aspie and everything else! I am and you are right. If person won't accept, it's over anyway.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:16:38	@aspieteach Thanks. It will be neither painless nor useful! Well, doubtful about the latter. Hard to catch SO often and mine--zilch always.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:15:01	@shiv379 Have good sleeps. Was going to say I'll be joining you soon but that just leaves me as way too much of a target!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:10:04	@asdquefty No...it's my second regular EEG! Good grief. Oh, forget it!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:09:08	@asdquefty Yep will do. Again, boring same old routine and...wait. This is my third regular EEG! HA! "It's all a blur..." Again, boring...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:06:54	@Canageek Nah, I'm okay. Regular EEG. Had two and a Sleep Deprived. I'll just be tired and dopey. No tea and not going to take meds til done
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 11:00:03	Oh shit! Bed soon! Fucking stupid EEG. I am SO going to be a bag of shit tomorrow morning...LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 10:53:47	@aspieteach Yes it was!!! You party girl!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 10:47:25	@Canageek LOL(cats!) Well, I'm glad I bring out something good in you? Thank you. It's very good to be silly. I quite like it myself.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 10:44:14	@EnigmaAnonymous You are not a bad person and you are not a nuisance. It happens to us all. Trust me there! Yes we feel but are not bad.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 10:43:01	@EnigmaAnonymous We ALL make mistakes and mess up with communication! OMG! I may be doing it right now! *smacks forehead* It's okay *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 10:16:22	@Canageek You're a doll. Well, if you insist!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 10:16:00	@asdquefty Oh, hon.! Try not to be. Just maybe take it slow? Or see how it goes...hey, who knows? But have fun! Could turn out great!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 10:12:13	@Canageek Even still. I can not deal with me being rude!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 10:10:46	@Canageek Thanks. I just thought, rude, rude, rude! I was RUDE!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 10:05:39	I should delete that last thing I wrote.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 10:05:24	I'm really quiet actually. I don't get all screamy crazy or anything.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 09:51:28	@shiv379 Oh, wait! I have met three people in real life. Speak up if you either read or follow me and want to comment on my body??? LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 09:49:58	@shiv379 That's a really dumb question to ask the entire Twitter world! None of you have seen my entire body! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 09:48:17	@shiv379 Okay well it's small like the rest of me, I guess? I don't fucking know! Good grief! WTF do I look like??? OMG! Someone tell me!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 02:21:21	@shiv379 My ex-gf is/was a chef so I picked up some tricks along the way!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 02:20:01	@shiv379 Pasta can be tough. Get your own (good!) rolling machine and a recipe. Makes it easier to fold it. I've done it. At least folding!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 02:18:30	@shiv379 @crpitt I know. I had someone sit on me and tickle on me! TORTURE! WAHHH!!! I shall try to make you laugh always though.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 02:04:00	@shiv379 YUMMY! I totally love pumpkin and adding the pine nuts (not too many for me?) sounds like a nice touch.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 02:03:11	And now a Coffee Follower! I'm making another cuppa! I need it anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 02:01:19	OMG! Now a freaking tea bot I've gotten! Add that to the list!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 01:59:49	@Canageek Yes, tis true. I have to travel via public transit though that may take about an hour and also get up and shower for clean hair!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 01:50:51	@Canageek Could have slept longer but hospital called to remind me of my EEG tomorrow. OMG it is SO early in the morning. Shit.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 01:49:17	@mama_kass Reciprocal slapping?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 01:48:54	@Canageek No I drink loads of tea. I had to sleep in as so tired. OMG! Without my earplugs even! That is un"heard" of!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 00:49:36	@asdquefty I tried and did communicate that way bt Soc. Worker refused 2 talk w/ me like that! Told me to put it down & MADE me talk! Wait.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-20 00:48:07	@asdquefty Animals r smarter than humans. They pick up on people and us "special folk" even more so. I can explain offline as blog surprise

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-19 00:12:37	@asdquefty I can tell you the anatomy of how/why that felt good. I think I told you before?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-19 00:11:18	@Acrimonia Thans for re-twee. I always make that joke. Have for years. Should have seen me sleep as a kid! All over and messy. Crazy sleeper
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-19 00:10:19	@Acrimonia I'm odd w/ my clothing issues. I can feel the "icky" or I like 2 b all swaddled & held tight by them. Have a few Aspie paradoxes.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-19 00:04:46	*neck of turtleneck over face like mask feels good* Aspie Stim thing... SPAZ O.o Although Stimming good. Not spazzy.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 23:59:44	@benpolar Mood charting can be difficult. When I got to the Ultradian stage it was impossible. I have a really good chart I can email you?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 23:57:51	@Acrimonia New meddy. Gotcha. Keep hanging in and email me if you want to talk about it. Dr. PA always on duty! Makes house calls too LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 23:56:31	@asdquefty Hi honey. Just not enough sleep and bad sleep too? Fitful? Going to be a who knows what kind of day. Blargh.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 23:55:36	@asdquefty I'm the exact opposite! Can't get out of bed! Once I'm vertical I'm okay. Had arousal problems all my life *winks* No, sleep!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 23:53:54	@Acrimonia *hugs* Hi Hi. How are you? What's a' happenin'? Tea and Chopin going on over here.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 22:59:10	@333AutismNews Well, I am crazy but maybe (definitely) in a different way than Twitter is. It has more apps than I have dx's! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 22:56:38	@Canageek Oh, I'll have my tea in a bit. See if that brings me 'round. Probably help some? Just so tired. Didn't get enough/bad sleep Idk?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 22:50:39	@333AutismNews Twitter crazy. I have a love/hate relationship with it. Probably means I'm crazy? Both?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 22:49:55	OMG I feel ill. This is going to be an awful day.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 22:49:19	@Canageek Well true...ok. I still think it's dumb.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 22:48:48	Well now! I AM impressed w/ my latest Follower! Appears Twit generated bt I feel validated 4 my word play? *rolls eyes* Bear w/ me jst gt up
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 22:44:45	@Canageek Thanks. I do make my best attempts to always be silly. Actually I find I can be even when not attempting to do so! Even better!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 22:43:04	Dumb Twitter Question? How come when you log on to YOUrself on web version it TELLS YOU that it's YOU? Kind of obvious??? #sarcasm
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 22:39:32	@Canageek Pretty, huh? O.o Well, I guess I may not look that bad stumbling out of bed? Dunno. Tired tho. Didn't get enough sleep. Today? ???

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 13:21:35	@Canageek Stupid shit about women and their bodies and never being happy...oh, don't get me started!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 13:20:52	@Canageek All of my doctors get all flippy and are always on my case about me being sick and eating and gaining weight... *frowns*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 13:19:09	@Canageek Also I need to get bloods, whole panel but definitely to see if anaemia has come back. Keep forgetting ARGH!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 13:18:16	@Canageek Can't gain weight Hate saying and feel guilty about it as a lot of women would like to be small but not at this cost, I say back.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 13:16:46	@Canageek Thanks but my gastro system tells me different! Although, kicking booze, ace but good all around! That has helped some but...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 13:12:23	@Canageek arse over tits when I got so sick with the gastro problems. Never fully recovered and don't know if I will? *shrugs* Not dying tho

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 11:06:22	@Canageek @dorfird My flat kinda sucks but I must admit I DO have an awesome bed. What also sucks is that I am the only 1 that sleeps in it!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 10:43:42	@shiv379 Just sort of random mumbly garbage? My ACs make me "lose" my words, forget meanings and spellings. Quel drag as a writer but...?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 10:40:52	@shiv379 Example: I'l be talking and I'll say... "You know, It's like wh-w-wh-when you do something like that." You, dig?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 10:38:32	@shiv379 ...happens most when I am nervous/anxious or when I can't get things out of my head right LOL or mouth rather. Thought to mouth...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 10:35:41	@shiv379 Thanks. I strive to do my best! I'm trying to think of some times when I've been chugging along verbally. It's not uber stutter...

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 10:22:51	@shiv379 Hey, you sound you you're eating my style!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 09:52:35	@shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid You guys are funny. I need cat here as she can attest to my "brand" of humour. She knows it best!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 09:46:04	@shiv379 @catatonickid @YogaChicky Uh...hellooo? Have any of you seen my blog? Self-deprecation is pretty much one of its cornerstones!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 09:40:02	@shiv379 @catatonickid @YogaChicky Rhetorical? Because I'm an asshole? Just kidding! I'm only being stupid with myself. Self-deprecation...

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 09:14:43	@shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid Start pumping up! You're gonna need it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 09:07:49	@YogaChicky @shiv379 Help me become more flexible? Well, if I do pursue the Martial Arts thing (yes, want to) may need to be!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 09:05:08	@shiv379 WHEE! Everyone's getting all hopped up on Twitter tonight. and to think I was just going to shut down my computer and go to bed!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:56:09	@Canageek It would be too obvious for the public domain, I fear.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:51:31	@Canageek Thanks for the re-twee. That's a favourite expression of mine that I've used for years. Holds specified meaning.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:49:40	@asdquefty I just did get some food into me but more? *tries not to choke on PB shoved down throat*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:48:54	@Canageek I know. Me: Pure as the Driven Slush.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:48:28	@FroggyPrinceMom That's a drag. Get a new doc and push hard for some good heavy duty opiates! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:30:24	@FroggyPrinceMom @Canageek Okay...rockin' night here on Twitter too?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:29:52	@FroggyPrinceMom LOL! Good pain meds, crazy remotes, swingin' whip hair...sounds like a rockin' night!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:28:25	@Raznay Yes, Mistress...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:26:54	@Raznay *grins* Well...not eating...for a start... *feigns innocence*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:25:56	@Canageek Oh, my my! Well, hello! I guess I shall take THAT as a compliment!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:25:19	@FroggyPrinceMom Oh, what HAVEN'T I DONE?! This time, I was specifically referring to spankies because I am not eating!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:24:18	@FroggyPrinceMom Well, all of my "Oracles" told me to start with an Ensure and granola bars. Thankfully I have some leftover stuff to heat.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:22:59	@FroggyPrinceMom Oooh...sorry joints! Alright, let me know if you find my remote. Half of the buttons are missing and corroded batteries.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:21:46	Okay, I have to start giving MYSELF spankings! I am NOT being a very good girl! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:13:58	@YogaChicky @shiv379 Sure with your moniker! Like I could do shit compared to you!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:10:34	@shiv379 I try to be as flexible as I can...hang on a sec'. Can't quite get right leg over head.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 08:02:42	*tries to manage full on body movement to screw head on straight* GAH! *twitch* *twitch* O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:59:35	@Raznay *bursting* ROMBLMAO
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:58:40	@FroggyPrinceMom If/when you find your remote, "Oracle" maybe you'll stumble across mine? Also have consulted all things for food and erm...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:57:22	@Raznay Hi Beautiful! *big hugs and kisses* Grins too!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:37:35	@Canageek That's fantastic! GO YOU!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:35:25	@Canageek Well, maybe you should give yourself a bit of a break. Just relax.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:33:23	@Canageek Well, maybe the Pizza will help and be some "brain food" for you.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:31:42	@FroggyPrinceMom Yes, so there you go, there everyone goes...we now continue with regularly scheduled PA Programming...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:30:58	@FroggyPrinceMom Well, bloody hell! I sure hope not! It wouldn't make sense but anyway, it'll all get sorted. Everything does. Sheesh. Okay!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:28:17	@FroggyPrinceMom I'm okay though. The person is going through a really rough time so I'll shoulder it. I know they didn't mean it.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:25:28	@FroggyPrinceMom Oh, no! I'm sry! Maybe it IS bothering me more than I'm realizing! Or willing 2 let show?! Just sucks 2 get shit on period?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:15:04	@FroggyPrinceMom Sorries. Shouldn't have bothered mentioning. Nothing I can do about it. Out of my control. Got shit on, said my piece.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:11:52	@Canageek Nice typing...that would be "perhaps too."
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:10:29	@Canageek Well, I'll do my best. I'm feeling rather tired. Food (all this talk of) may help? Idk. Something niggling, perhaps twoo.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:09:00	@FroggyPrinceMom Yes. I went out and did a big shop a while ago as I have a friend with a car so that helps.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:06:01	Okay, maybe now I'm getting a wee bit hungry? All this talk of food as an incentive?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:05:24	@Acrimonia WHEE! Homemade bread even! Now THAT is yummy! Thank you!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 07:01:12	@shiv379 You're SUCH a God. I bow at your feet. *rolls eyes* Now go and fetch me *insert of object of choice* and enough gubbins!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 06:55:29	@shiv379 Although, I will say it did get really good reviews over here from what I read (Indie Scene.) I don't give a toss abt reviews tho.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 06:53:48	@shiv379 Will do.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 06:08:53	@FroggyPrinceMom No worries about the "Oracle," "Oracle." I have enough food. It's just the motivation and really, being tired, appetite etc
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 06:01:44	@FroggyPrinceMom Okay "Oracle." Tell me what the hell I can haul out of my kitchen for dinner!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 05:51:42	Ugh. Food might be the answer. Can someone come over and cook me something to eat? SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-18 05:50:43	@FroggyPrinceMom HAHAHA! I should check my DMs as I can't remember! Huh...?

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 22:14:48	@Canageek It seems I have ESCAPED THE METEORS! Yes, I am okay. Not a single Leonid fell on me. I woke up fully in tact. All good.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 13:50:11	@Canageek No bed bugs. Only Meteors but they're pretty far away. Although with my luck a Leonid might fall on my head! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 13:46:11	Awesome Possum! Didn't think I'd catch it, any of it but twinkly twinkly! Meteors! The Leonids tonight! W00t! Clear and dark enough here!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:48:13	@333AutismNews Thanks, hon *laughing* No, don't worry. I have no plans to shuffle off this mortal coil anytime soon. I'm not going anywhere!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:45:51	@333AutismNews That's why I always say my meds have saved my life. I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for them either!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:44:15	@333AutismNews I would have shot myself and died. I would have committed suicide. No, not lying. My untreated Bipolar would have done me in.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:42:26	@asdquefty Phenobarb. is really old school but yeah.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:42:07	@asdquefty stare for a bit and then pick up from where you left off. Trust me. With all the types of seizures I have!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:41:33	@asdquefty But not like that. Absence seizures are SO brief, you don't know...not like ADD at all! That's the dealio with absence. You just.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:40:30	@333AutismNews I don't have any firearms. Which is good because if I did, I wouldn't be here typing. I'd be dead. Long ago.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:39:29	@asdquefty Idk. I've only had opiods for surgery.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:39:02	@asdquefty distinguish absence from "daydreaming." I have done this in questioning myself as to mine when I fuzz out. I don't lose enuf.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:38:08	@asdquefty LOL! Well if you have absence, you'll never know! Someone will have to tell you. Or they MAY catch it on an EEG. But you can...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:36:56	Okay! Noise competition! Currently JUST baby MacBook and the upstairs tenant's home theatre system. Guess who's winning...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:35:14	@asdquefty That sounds like mega pain. Yikes. Makes me think of people having spinal taps.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:34:19	@asdquefty @Roseshouse Theoretically. Yes there is a link re: Epilepsy and Spectrum folks but let's not all start jumping out of our pants!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:33:01	@333AutismNews Indeed. Could you imagine if I showed up for my EEG with a nail in my forehead? How cool would that be??? W00t! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:31:47	@asdquefty Could have been for some other neuro test but not EEG. We have "nerves" that are all "neuro-testable." And ok for ASD EEG but ?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:29:32	@asdquefty Just wait for my bloody VEEG! That's gonna be a real riot! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:28:23	@asdquefty U would know if u had an EEG. You have a bunch of electrodes stuck to your head for about a half hour and you're stuck 2 a comp.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:26:36	@asdquefty Everyone's EEG should appear within normal ranges unless they have Epilepsy (again hard to catch) or some other head injury etc.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:24:19	@asdquefty Epileptiform... I can't freakin' type anymore... O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:23:36	@asdquefty Neuro & think it will show nothing. Never is it "pointless" for Epilepsy. Just v. hard to "catch" epileptoform activity at time.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:22:38	@asdquefty Because things got so out of control with the tonic-clonic we decided to do it anyway as it was prudent w/ the MRI but...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 11:19:15	Oh crap upon crap! My EEG is on Friday!!! EARLY in the morning!!! I'm going to have to nail a note to my forehead to remember!!! SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 10:28:33	@shiv379 Hugs!!! ...stupid mood crashy! Noooo! *hands you magic mood ladder*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 10:12:57	@catatonickid @YogaChicky @shiv379 Heh. Greetings...welcome to the foray? Or should I say fray.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 09:31:10	Holy List-Ness FTW. Kinda forgot aboot that stuuf.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 09:27:12	@mama_kass I Tweet Like a total SPAZ O.o (yes, you see that...and more) and I pick up a few and then none. I have no clue. I don't have lots
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 09:17:53	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid Yes. Altho. ours r the only 2 voices heard? Note: PA is not abt 2 become the slut of Oz! Just 1 city? HA!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 08:45:15	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid Thank you for your enthusiastic agreement? At least I am not alone in this area? *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 08:42:43	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid You think if I can get a vacation that includes getting fucked I'm going to turn THAT down? Are you mad?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 08:38:24	@YogaChicky @catatonickid @shiv379 ...seriously...I DO need a fucking vacation right now! I am this far...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 08:34:05	Right then, where are all of those papers underneath those other papers, beside the papers where I put yesterday's papers I got...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 08:25:21	@shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid Actually, just got a visual of wearing teacups as pasties? You'd be doing that though. Not the gals!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 08:21:27	@shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid Niiiiicccceee...all the words today has made me rather slow? PA no fun.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 08:15:39	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid Are we going to use proper china?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 08:05:58	@YogaChicky @catatonickid @shiv379 I'm hitting Canberra too! *laughing so hard*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 07:59:55	@YogaChicky @catatonickid @shiv379 I did!!! Bringing lots of tea too! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 07:52:12	I should write a blog post but omg...more writing...whee! I can't even think of a topic right now. *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 07:40:17	@YogaChicky LOL Philosophy is a gas!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 07:33:07	@YogaChicky ...as most times I have no clue what the hell I'm doing tomorrow--wait, I guess that does mean nothing is forever? Idk. HAHA!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 07:32:07	@YogaChicky Hehe. Well, I suppose nothing is forever...sort of? My dx's are for damn ever (until I die?) Tough for me to contemplate...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 07:20:27	Crap! Shutting down Word! Goodbye!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 06:58:34	@YogaChicky Hey, once (or more) a fool, always a fool?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 06:57:52	I should really stop. Can writing make you drunk? SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 06:46:47	@YogaChicky Also, this so-called, crap-ass writer's getting a headache. How long have I been engaging in this foolhardiness today? No clue.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 06:42:10	@YogaChicky Glad you get it then! *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 06:40:45	@Canageek Yeah, yeah...I'm sure you could. I'm not that tech. inclined and not afraid to say so! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 06:39:59	@YogaChicky Well "writers' *cough cough* are their own worst critics don't'cha know! I am laughing at my writing at least!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 06:38:47	@Canageek ya.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 06:32:19	@Canageek I do use FF.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 06:18:07	Man, is this stuff too sarcastic for a decent Publishing House (like it'll ever make it there!) Fuck, it reads like my blog! ROMBLMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 06:07:05	@asdquefty SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 05:35:04	W00t! Gotta love geeks on the Almighty T! Even if my band' isn't so hot, pretty durn' fastie!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 05:01:20	I can feel baby MacBook getting all hot on my lap *laughing* Go baby MacBook, go!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:59:57	@Canageek I had iTunes too but I closed that! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:58:25	@Canageek Oh, my blog is up too!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:57:59	@Canageek Ok open apps. Deck, Spaz, Twitter Web, Skype, gmail, Word, Transmission!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:56:06	@mama_kass Yes I did. My tummy wakes up much later than I do and with the copious amounts of tea that fills it up and then...time lost...!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:45:58	@aspieteach @asdquefty That is interesting. Caused me a lot of pain. Got v. sick and needed bite splints etc... Ugh.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:45:19	@mama_kass Ah...secret, secret! I'm anonymous, remember? Not sayin' (at least all over Twitter!) You can email me if you want?)
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:44:06	And speaking of...I TOTALLY forgot about "Thirst" by Chan Wook-Park! Currently happenin' w/ Trans.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:42:05	@Canageek Otherwise my speed is just fine for what I need.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:41:46	@Canageek Yes I'm sure you could. Granted I only have mid-priced DSL package? That's only for bandwidth and I'm not a download demon.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:39:51	Okay SPAZ O.o is going to take a wee break and go outside for some air... Not that she thinks it will help.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:37:09	@Canageek I can't. I'm using all of my apps! Or trying...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:36:44	@asdquefty It's just a variation on WTF? I am assuming?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:35:52	@mama_kass OMG! OMG! OMG! YES! What time is it? I just had "breakfast." I was starting to pass out while trying to edit. Lor-dee!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:34:08	I Have SO many apps. running and am doing SO many things right now I really have NO clue what is going on. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 04:33:08	Now where the hell was I? Considering the content of this and FTW, should change Twitter app. and send from this one? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 03:10:52	@mama_kass Thanks hon. xo
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 03:07:27	@mama_kass Yep. It may be an eight pint day of cuppas instead of my three of tea but I doubt that will even help. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 03:06:12	@AliveinMe I'm okay with all antibiotics except Sulfa. So far no other pharm reactions? Oh, Codeine. Bad for tummy! Ouch!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 03:04:58	@mama_kass Even better! Another typo! "or" not "of" Again...it's gonna be one of those days...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 03:04:06	@mama_kass Feel like as a writer of you feel like an "ass" to have Asperger's? I say yes to both! LOL! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 03:02:40	@AliveinMe Oh man! I'm not anti-health supplement but w/ my comorbidities? Some things I have found are total no no's! Need to check w/ doc!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 02:10:45	@FroggyPrinceMom I'm not bad, thanks. I need more tea as I'm still mucking about here & I should engage in some writing-like something. Feh
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 02:09:23	@FroggyPrinceMom Yes, I was going to toss COME in there too...well, now I have. *sticks TONGUE out at pr0n spam* HA!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 02:07:54	Are you satisfied now? Are we done? Have I give you what you wanted now? Man!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 02:06:15	Maybe it's because I type stim a lot? Like stimulation? Oh, forget it! SEX SEX SEX SUCK THIS FUCK THAT DIRTY COCK MOUTH AROUND LICK THIS OK?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 02:03:26	There, let's see if I can lure some of those guys out too!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 02:00:28	Not the remix I want, although I have this one too, but it will have to do! ♫ http://blip.fm/~gfjcb
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 01:53:57	@AliveinMe I had one and I got a few palpitations but could have been my stims? I think they tase like garbage anyway. I don't even like pop
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 01:41:58	@EpilepsyCures That song (LA) is awesome!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 01:41:21	@asdquefty Hmmm. Headaches are so crazy! My bruxism is back (did it ever leave?) so getting them from that. Ground teeth all my life-stress.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 01:26:51	@asdquefty Yes, they can be crap! I don't like. I remember doing shift work yrs. ago and I drank Jolt Cola. Just abt ripped my tummy in 1/2!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 01:21:51	@asdquefty Heh. Good luck with the energy drink. I hope it doesn't cause any "damage!"
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 01:21:18	@AliveinMe I think we do have something like that here. OMG! Your seizures give you migraine? And you have enough probs with the former!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 00:28:32	@asdquefty Maybe a bit psychological too as I had to fight for so long to get them so a bit of relief in that v. first script, so the happy
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 00:27:15	@asdquefty ...but it was like I could just see things clearly (hi how stims work--help you focus) and I even had a little bounce in my step.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 00:26:30	@asdquefty Could be but diff. for everyone. I know w/ my ADD even when I had my 1st taste of a stim I was SO happy! Not like a drug high...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 00:24:47	@asdquefty you only hyperfocus (for me ADD Inattentive Type) on what you find interesting--keen? Not everything.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 00:24:04	@asdquefty enough caffeine as I'm hyperfocusing totally but still too out of it to do a good job of my hyperfocussing LMAO! Also...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 00:23:22	@asdquefty I know! ADD hyperfocus withour caffeine. Because my brain is just that anomalous and redonculous! I took my stims but not...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 00:21:48	@AliveinMe Injections for what? Migraines or being post-ictal?!?!?!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 00:21:05	Okay, I'm already ADD hyperfocusing & making a huge mess before tea! PA STOP! Go have your tea! Oh dear. Going 2 be one of THOSE days is it?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 00:16:18	@Canageek Because I slept in them? LOL! No, I drink about three pints of tea in the morning? At least two! I love tea and need my caffeine!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 00:12:47	@Canageek Not to bed and yourself fellow nutjob? I need my tea though. I should get on that right now. Dozey-Pants PA.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-17 00:02:16	@AliveinMe Thank you. You are 2 sweetie. I am feeling better from the migraine. Only two days where post-ictal crud is always a surprise, eh
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 23:58:32	@AliveinMe Cool. No worries. Just thought it might appeal to you. xo

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 11:20:47	In case I wasn't clear, recovering from a migraine and been in bed reading online comics pretty much all day..."Crumbum!" ROMBLMAO!!!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 10:18:24	@Canageek Oh, another thought...flaccid or erect...sorry twitter ppl LMAO
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 10:17:26	@Canageek Why don't we say 4" in circumference? That's better?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 10:16:19	@Canageek I could make a joke about screwing a 2x4 but I guess I just did? Ah hell, I'll throw in some splinters too LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 09:53:11	@333AutismNews yep, wordplay is all good!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 09:49:53	@EnigmaAnonymous Hve a good night and try to hang in there hon'. *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 09:48:25	OH JEEEEZZZUUUUUSSSSS!!!! It's my pr0n night!!! Wait...that doesn't sound quite right does it...?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 09:45:59	@333AutismNews Ah, not so worried about it. Rather deal with it and have quality followers if below 200.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 09:42:45	@333AutismNews Interesting that. I throught it was because I'm an arse on Twitter LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 09:41:58	@Canageek Well I've seen enough pr0n and sometimes it's amazing/shocking/surprising/frightening/hilarious...what ppl can actuallyl do! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 09:40:23	@Canageek yes, viral is viral and your approximation is more or less bang on (haha bang) for length but diameter? no, i wouldn't say so
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 09:38:21	@Canageek Well, maybe I wasn't paying attention either or it's the fact that I'm on an app. 13" screen?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-16 09:36:16	@333AutismNews I get it all the time. Just keep blocking and reporting as spam. It's stupid.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 23:06:12	@333AutismNews Thaks, doll. It will go away. That is one good thing about the physical apects of my migraine/seizure stuff afterward.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 23:01:14	@333AutismNews ...I have no idea. Could be fine or not. Just have to wake up next day and see.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 22:39:21	@333AutismNews Thanks. Takes me 2 days to get over them anyway but this sedond day is v. v. bad. I also got v. v. bad sleep. Don't know why.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 22:37:28	@asdquefty See how long I'll be online as per photophobia altho may watch movie (darke one?) on baby MacBook on bed?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 22:35:35	@asdquefty Good. As you can see migraine still impairing my typin gskills! Serious. I feel soooo nauseous. Just got up took meds and Gravol.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 22:33:31	God(barfy) Morning! OMG. So nauseas even DREAMED I threw up. Migraines are such fun. Oh, joy.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:36:28	@huckleberrio Anytime sweetie.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:20:34	RT @Canageek : @patientanon *grin* Hehe She said I'm funny #happygeek / Well you ARE, darling!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:18:46	@Canageek One of my stupid problems is too that my prodrome has "shrunk!" I used to be able to feel them coming on but prodrome is migraine!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:17:28	@Canageek Yes, it can and I have a significant pain tolerance and I don't as some Aspies can attest. But not for Migraines? And you're funny
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:14:25	@Canageek Also my symptoms don't deceive me, light sensitivity, nausea, mood changes (maybe that from last night!)
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:12:09	@Canageek You know how many comorbidities I have! My brain is a mess and yet, I can find links to all of them to some degree! No I can! LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:11:20	@Canageek No, i have them often enough and also have now found on direct cause, alcohol. Also proposed link w/ epilepsy but v. weak there?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:10:18	@BipolarSpa Thanks hon. Indeed! Headache Massage! Sign me up! Did bike ride give me headache? Temperature oddities...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:07:51	@Canageek Hypothetical about genetics. Possible yet not proven. However strong throught about it.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:06:24	@Canageek ...like caffeine. Some can use it (vasoconstictor) to fend off migraine, others it is a trigger.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:05:39	@Canageek Also what you are talking about is the concept of vasodilation/constriction which can be paradoxical with migraineurs...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:04:06	@Canageek Well i stopped drinking anyway. My Triptans do a good job. If bad, I pop 2. Another reason why I tend to stay up a bit. Need more?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 11:02:10	@Canageek I knew it! Yes, and supposedly fast like a Triptan. What has always been said is w/in 20min. I have tried but never worked LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:58:44	@333AutismNews Thank you. Hugs back.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:58:29	@Canageek Hey, you know my sense of humour! Let it fly! I think I know what you're going to say anyway???
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:56:29	@Canageek Thanks sweetie. My life is so completely redonculous. *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:55:26	@333AutismNews Yes, kind of a let down after actually accomplishing some good work on myself today? Only me? *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:54:34	@Canageek Yep...should get some resty. Will try and let Triptan do some work first maybe? And the Gravol as just lying in pain sucks.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:51:25	@333AutismNews No I can't sleep without my meds, during day/eve anything unless deathly ill or something.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:50:32	"Migraine Denial" over! Triptans gotta get into you ASAP and the Advil I took a while ago didn't do squat. Bugger. Explains why I can't type
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:45:30	@huckleberrio Oh. *hugs* I'm sorry. Email me if you want to talk. Door's always open as should know!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:44:15	Uh oh...headachy and feeling sick. Currently in "Migraine Denial." This CAN NOT be happening. Not after I had such a productive day. No.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:30:13	@Canageek Yep. Just got it and replied. I'm a bit faster as you said you were on the phone. All good.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:25:01	@YogaChicky LOL! Left that part out. She was on the radio. CBC 2. And mid-20s I was. She was early 20s. Whatev! She's done v. well though!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:07:15	@333AutismNews Sure, I can see that.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 10:06:52	@Canageek Crap. "if" you mean Twitter. My typing is stuffed tonight.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-15 09:53:09	@333AutismNews ...electronic gadgets and toys when I go for VEEG as I will be a "prisoner" and need all entertainment I can get! Blargh!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 14:07:31	@Raznay Yes, I thought it was such a sweet thing to do. Such politeness on Twitter!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 14:06:40	@asdquefty *hands you cup of juice (_) *

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 10:54:48	@catatonickid I know. I can't even make a comparison between that form of insanity and some of my damn seizures! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 10:50:50	@catatonickid *rolls eyes* But still, blanks just get too damn frustrating after so long!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 10:49:56	@catatonickid You know? I HATE THE FUCKING BLANK! Ahem. LOL Really though. W/ 95% of no memory of childhood etc..Well, locked away 4 reason!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 10:31:53	@333AutismNews Oh, no! Of course not! Again, all comers welcome at PAs Pad! Just don't know if it's emergent and it is, I can't do much...

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 10:12:21	@333AutismNews I can agree w/ the handwriting issues. I have Dysgraphia.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 10:07:27	@catatonickid @shiv379 @YogaChicky Ah, just a wee bit of brain mush. Like that hasn't happened before? I think I'm back online now.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 08:45:56	@asdquefty @Raznay @EnigmaAnonymous @aspieteach Just great! Although promise to remove the blades first, okay?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 08:43:39	@asdquefty Nope, hon. I'm okay. Right now I'm just "Tangled Up" in writing another blog post.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 06:41:36	@asdquefty I do it all the time walking around. I was with J. today and was "reading" them to him when we were out! My penchant 4 words too?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 06:36:40	Does anyone else out there on the Spectrum play what I call the "License Plate Game?" Patterns w/ letters to make words. #autism #asperger 's

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 01:13:41	@mama_kass Glad you're feeling better. I was just getting over one a couple of days again. Nasty things they are! Grrr...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 01:05:55	@asdquefty LOL Time is irrelevant to me. Remember, I reside in the multiverse?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 01:05:04	@shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid Oh, & btw have song 2 stream been turned onto. Might make @least couple of u laugh? Love it! Will 2day.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 00:59:08	@YogaChicky I was bitchin' about needing some good Shaitsu last night. Are you skilled in the trade? All all screwed up! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 00:58:14	@shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid Oh, quite whining you! With all of this "so-called teasing" you're in your fucking glory! BAH!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-14 00:57:34	@shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid ...that thing with the towel... That's kind of vague and open to several interpretations don't you think?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:27:28	@333AutismNews Yes. You go ni ni too. Thanks.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:26:58	@333AutismNews That number, I just can not even fathom...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:25:50	Okay, I guess PA go ni ni. Taken meddy meds...laters...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:23:25	@333AutismNews I don't mind any RTs! Hell, I've even RT'd myself! HA!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:22:11	@333AutismNews LOL! Oh, the FUN of being on the damn Spectrum, huh? We're so prone to making bloody arses of ourselves! Unintentionally tho!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:20:05	@333AutismNews No problem. Yes, whatever you can do to just make it easier on yourself! If not for you than do it for me! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:18:28	@asdquefty I know that! It's a hypnotic but functions basically the same way as a benzo.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:07:17	@asdquefty Meds are meds and heads are heads. Diff. for all. Valium/benzos may not work for you but technically you're taking one now!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:06:03	@333AutismNews LMAO! Dr. PA is back on duty! *whips out prescription pad and pen*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:05:14	@333AutismNews That's a personal choice. You could just mention the folks on your own lists but hon' you're killing yourself w/ all of this!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:02:54	@asdquefty No, I don't remember that and JUST KIDDING EVERYONE ABOUT MAILING THE VALIUM!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:02:07	@asdquefty I can mail you some Valium! I have shitloads of it and more with my repeats! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 14:00:23	@asdquefty Bugger you GP! *PA sticks tongue out at your GP*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:59:39	@asdquefty Okay, so back to my original suggestion? Treat as prn! Groovy. Good man.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:58:26	@asdquefty Because if you do and you think you might need it that's fine as it's prn anyway, right?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:57:03	@asdquefty Or do you feel anxious and that you need one?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:56:34	@asdquefty Alright. well my suggestion would be to try without and then if a problem, pop one as it worked so well for you last night?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:54:33	@asdquefty Well do you think you will sleep alright without it? THAT is the question! Touche!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:52:48	@asdquefty Are you okay? That sounds more like your Mantra?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:52:06	You KNOW you're tired when you don't even feel like getting off your bed to take your sleep meds! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:49:32	I don't know what composer they are playing on the radio right now but gooood... *PA melts into bed*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:44:01	@333AutismNews I hear you. From the big lists I may a bit but they blow my concentration. Easier for me to do "smaller networking." LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:34:29	@worstmark Trying to sort something out for a person here but it didn't work as I thought it might.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:33:56	@worstmark Yes, it's a Twitter app called Twitlonger if you want to write more than what the other apps. have as only 140 chars. Cont'd
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:19:18	@mama_kass Oh, no! If you don't see this until tomorrow, I hope you got some sleep and feel better!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:18:21	@worstmark The more giggles the better!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:07:30	@Canageek You could recruit everyone and form your own Potato Army?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:06:03	@worstmark *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 13:02:28	@worstmark WHOO! Body Art! Never done that before! Always wanted to though!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:58:48	@worstmark *grins* A better (and safer) thought. Dispense with the knife and just draw on me!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:56:44	@worstmark Thanks honey. I know you'd never hurt me but you might be able to make me pretty with a nice Halloween carving!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:53:44	@Canageek Well, if you don't have a kitchen, a bathroom will work in a pinch!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:53:09	@asdquefty I know! I still need to TRY and maintain some balance now that I've started on the path? I so suck though. No impulse control!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:50:56	@worstmark OHHH! Will it hurt?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:48:35	Holy Cats! Look at the time! Wee PA going to turn into a pumpkin soon? *crosses eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:47:24	@asdquefty Yes there is such a thing as Internet Addiction. I've just come back online in 48hrs and look at me!!! SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:45:43	@Canageek LMAO! *has amazing image in head of Canageek marching around kitchen with trumpets playing saluting bag of potatoes on counter*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:43:48	@mama_kass Hey. I'm ok been on a break jst 2 take care of me IRL bt back now. I'm out of it w/ blogs 2! Not doing NaNo jst stuff on my own.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:25:06	@Canageek We all have our tastes.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:24:50	@mama_kass I've been keeping a bit or a watch on you since I've come back. Well done with the writing! I'm not as speedy but it's coming!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:22:48	@Canageek Well, I do love my potatoes! Yes. Onions good, or milder...shallot? How about leeks? Oh, great combo there! Potato and Leek Soup!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:14:41	@Canageek Hmmm...suddenly I have a craving for onion rings...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 12:02:28	@asdquefty Oh yes, slept last night. Just taking a poke at myself. Could be upstairs tenant who controls heat and she is away? Rather b hot!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 11:58:02	Oh, no! Please tell me I am NOT having nocturnal seizures w/ Circadian Thermoregulation post-ictal issues? Nah...I'm not feeling THAT sick!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 11:56:14	OMG! Here comes the hotness again! FTW? *laughing* Surely I can't be peri-menopausal! Although doing away with my period would be agreeable.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 11:40:03	@Raznay @asdquefty I'm all ears! Bitch away!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 11:32:45	@Raznay @asdquefty That's fine. We all need a good rant and moan from time to time. Good and healthy!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 11:28:53	@asdquefty @Raznay Quel drag. "Gotcha!" Here I can't complain tooo much. Have been fairly luck but have had some awful experiences!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 11:26:14	@asdquefty Again. Oy.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 11:25:32	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid I already am. *shrug*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 11:25:10	@Raznay @asdquefty BAH! I CARE! I was referring more to other medical stuff than psych.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 11:18:13	@333AutismNews Thanks for the #FF
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 11:17:04	@asdquefty Oy! I've had a catheter twice. OUCH! Other painful stuff? Don't think so...not while awake anyway LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 10:58:22	@asdquefty With me it depends. I prefer an IV in my hand for sure! More comfy for longer period too! Although, hurts to write when there!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 10:54:36	@asdquefty I find it all depends upon the nurse or phlebot. for bloods or IVs (or maybe my veins if they aren't co-operating!)
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 10:51:03	@asdquefty Acupuncture doesn't hurt at all hon'. The needles are so tiny! They almost look like little hairs! Can barely feel them! Really!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 10:39:50	@333AutismNews Funny u should mention the acupunc. During one Shiatsu, left hip wouldn't rotate & w/ 2 needles 4 a bit, went just like that!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 10:35:11	@333AutismNews ..do brief freebies just to give you a "sample" if you wish? Check out massage therapist/clinics?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 10:34:18	@333AutismNews You have to like a bit of pain for Shaitsu. You get bent and twisted a bit. Not like avg. massage therapy. Some places will..
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:56:19	@asdquefty SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:27:03	@Aliquant Good for you! Rebel against your lingerie! *laughing so hard*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:24:10	@Raznay You're welcome! *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:23:49	@Aliquant LMAO! Well, I must confess I have done it with underwear too (top and bottom!) and drove me nuts! Had to run to loo and fix them!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:20:27	@Raznay Honest to a fault must I be. Honest abt my opinion or honest abt being biased...ah, feck it! Two charges guilty! What's my sentence?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:15:00	@Raznay Absolutely gorge! Love it! Colour shading and its composition great!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:10:52	@Canageek *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:09:28	@Canageek Absolutely! I'll merely start with the Shiatsu as a "warm up" and then move on from there? *evil grin*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:06:49	@Aliquant I'm such a SPAZ O.o do you know how many times I've put various forms of apparel on inside out and backwards and...don't fret!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:05:13	@Canageek That I need my hip rotated by a pretty woman? Well THAT goes without saying!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:03:57	@asdquefty Yes I did. I was going to respond with something lame about going flatline. All I could think of as my brain was flatlining?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:02:58	@Aliquant Uh oh! Beware the Mulled Wine??? LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 09:01:32	@EnigmaAnonymous Have a good night sweetie.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 08:59:49	Does anyone do online Shaitsu? I feel all "out of alignment." My right hip needs a good rotation! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 08:16:42	@asdquefty Hey, doll. Can't make any promises! You might see either me or my name anywhere! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 08:08:45	@asdquefty Yes, Girl Anachronism is THE BEST! And thanks for UBER compliment re: me and a possible Amanda Palmer reference? *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 08:04:34	@asdquefty Thanks! It is one of my fave songs by The Cramps! Hysterical!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 08:03:22	RT @patientanon : Just found it and LOVE IT!!! ♫ http://bit.ly/41qxMB / And I'll probably stream it on my blog later as this is only a Tweet!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 08:01:48	Just found it and LOVE IT!!! ♫ http://blip.fm/~g9e4o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 07:54:35	Time to blip if they have or I'll stream it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 07:49:20	Oooh! Good song found! Good band? Try to get!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 07:36:48	@asdquefty *sucks on tomato then alternates to dill pickle in other hand*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 07:29:51	@shamefreeloser Oh, not feeling well? Sorry...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 07:27:49	@asdquefty @Raznay *raises hand to join food suckage club*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 06:49:30	@melankolyme Yes, the happy med-go-round!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:54:53	@aspieteach How do you feel about music? Some good tunes? Or just immersing yourself in a good movie to either distract, entertain or both?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:49:31	@melankolyme I gained on Zypreza too but I knew I'd only be on it for short term so I just cut it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:46:02	@shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid It's called either Global Warming or Group Consciousness or no...The Borg. Yes, the latter definitely!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:43:23	@YogaChicky @shiv379 @catatonickid ...yes, excuses, excuses...I'm full of those, don't you know... *feigns innocence*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:42:05	@nellgwynne @NataliaAntonova AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Let 'er rip!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:33:58	@asdquefty Ah! We're doing our Spaz Waltz again!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:25:13	@asdquefty Aww, sry and thx 4 calling me your fave SPAZ O.o bt have good SPAZ O.o movement of day (so far) spilled tea on self & choked!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:20:56	@Raznay @enigmaanonymous Indeed. I find distraction when all flippy-dippy so hard too, though! ACK!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:20:11	@asdquefty No, I made a typo so I did a quick delete and then wrote it up again.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:13:47	@asdquefty You're just wearing your invisible suit today!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:11:03	@Raznay @EnigmaAnonymous I can echo that even though I know it's hard to lock stress up in a box and toss it away! But yes, health first.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 05:09:10	@NataliaAntonova Getting into some Primal Scream? Or just Regular Scream? Either way, hope it works and you feel better.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 04:52:23	@Raznay You're welcome, love.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 04:34:52	@melankolyme Yep, the Z. in Symbyax could be it or even the Prozac in it as ADs can cause appetite increase too.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 04:33:52	@shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid Hmmm. Don't seem 2 have any nudie shots & wouldn't u no it? DSLR & Film 1 broken 2! Also MacBook cam!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 04:19:14	@melankolyme Oh yeah? Zyprexa knocked me out and also made me sooo hungry! Seroquel does a v. good job for sleep now but no hungries.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 04:10:23	@asdquefty Yes, it can vary. My Seroquel takes about an hour but when briefly on Zyprexa a lot faster!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 04:08:21	@asdquefty Well, again good. That's how sleep meds are supposed to work!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 04:07:54	@Canageek Funny. Well I must admit I can spend a long-ish, maybe amount of time in front of the mirror if I am wearing something to go out.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 04:06:36	@shiv379 @catatonickid @YogaChicky Gee, do you think you'll be missing out forever? Have you gone totally off your nut for good?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 04:04:42	@asdquefty Well I still think it's all good overall esp. since it was the first dose that you took. For sure.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 03:17:10	@asdquefty Well, that might be a wee bit of grogginess but hard to say. Overall, sounds good though.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 03:14:57	@asdquefty Hey! Awesome Possum! That's great! I'm good. I need another pint o' tea though. I've only had two so far! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 03:01:29	@Canageek LMAO! I don't bother to look at myself in the mirror. I find myself rather boring to look at actually.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 02:50:49	@asdquefty @Raznay Thanks sweetie Another great welcome back for me? I owe you for it I guess for the recommendation and then the follow?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 02:47:27	@Canageek No. I do not think at all you mind that image at all. I don't mind images of pretty women in PVC either! *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-13 02:46:02	@spaz Hi SPAZ O.o. You are the only Twitter app. that keeps tabs on me. You are so sweet. I am having tea and responding to you. Love, PA xo
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 16:26:57	@Raznay I know! What is it with this random hotness or something! Rampant! Now, it's almost like it's not random due to the "Rampantosity!"
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 16:21:24	@Raznay My turn to be of Serviceable Assistance, I see.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 16:17:25	@Raznay *laughing* So are you now "Class A" as well, darling?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 16:12:11	@Raznay Thank you but don't underestimate yourself. You've also got me chuckling quite a bit. Quite!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 16:02:24	@Raznay That's find because I got so lost I had nothing to offer back? I think we're ping ponging so much. That's the issue? Yes?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 15:48:02	@Raznay Whoops! You lost me! Wha...?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 15:42:10	@Raznay Whatever floats your boat, hon'! *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 15:38:45	@Raznay That's fine. Like I said, we are who we are! Most of the time I don't even know WHAT kind of SPAZ I am! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 15:28:01	@worstmark Sleep well, dearie.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 15:26:45	@Raznay SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:58:49	@worstmark I know, I said so many times that a night for every day of the week! Okay water, outside bathroom all of that jazz.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:56:12	@worstmark LMAO! And it isn't even NO PANTS!!! #LOFNOTC
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:54:28	I need to go outside and cool down! Some abnormal hotness is happening! I am actually doffing clothing. FTW? *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:31:04	@worstmark *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:27:53	@worstmark Awww...now I'm seriously feeling welcomed back by everyone. Thanks so much again, honey.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:25:52	@worstmark Oh, dear...you are such a love. *big hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:22:48	@worstmark Thanks for keeping me on your Coolness Radar Dude!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:21:28	@worstmark You know it! You're talking to one of the biggest Hepcats ever!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:18:13	@worstmark Actually, just had a thought. Now I'm getting this whole Kerouac/Beats business happening in my head *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:16:26	@worstmark I can relate to that! Sounds like my entire life! Around and around and around... I keep searching for the meaning but...nope!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:13:00	@worstmark LMAO! I love you! You never fail to crack me up! That's fab too. Start at the end of the story...or even the middle?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 14:10:44	@worstmark Indeed and best of luck! Just don't end up like Dennis Hopper all nuts and wake up in some gutter, okay? *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:55:12	@worstmark That's right. Best way to (re-)learn is to go to native speaking country and do immersion! Tough but possible? Perhaps?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:50:46	@worstmark U no, I'm Canadian, studied it 4 a few years in school & I have 2 Google it when I want 2 say things. I've lost it by not using!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:40:06	@worstmark Mon francais tres mal!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:35:23	@YogaChicky @catatonickid @shiv379 Well, 'tis a shorter flight but I don't think I'm so much in the running! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:32:39	@worstmark le snug! Classic! Merci.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:30:40	Oh there goes the upstairs tenant with her bloody surround sound...le sigh...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:28:45	@Canageek *laughing* I'm sorry. It was wide open and I just couldn't resist with that comment back to you.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:25:28	@YogaChicky @catatonickid @shiv379 Would me wearing Rubber help make amends? Just a suggestion...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:23:09	@catatonickid @YogaChicky @shiv379 Good thing you've got strong shoulders there wee, lass!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:21:22	@Canageek Did you say LEATHER??? *grins* Actually, PVC is much nicer, I think. Or Spandex...I've worn Rubber too but a trick doing that!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:19:39	@catatonickid @YogaChicky @shiv379 *sigh* Guilty as charged...again...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:07:08	@catatonickid @shiv379 @YogaChicky I don't know. How were you feeling during my absence? *casts upward glance*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 13:01:37	@Canageek Interesting. WOOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:59:21	@YogaChicky @catatonickid @shiv379 Hehe...just in a towel! I'm so damn cold all the time I could never be naked! Well, would need someone...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:58:16	@Raznay I know. We hold ourselves to the most impossible standards so often! I'll keep knocking you off your pedestal! *pokes you playfully*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:56:49	@Canageek Varies for me. Depends how "Aspie" I am at the time.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:52:19	@Canageek Indeed, tag issues, things bunching...all of that. A bane of Spectrum Existence
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:51:45	@Raznay That is fine. Nothing to fret over! Everything is just tickety-boo!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:49:05	@catatonickid @YogaChicky @shiv379 I'm comfortable with my body. I have no issue with being naked.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:48:36	@Raznay Well, my my! We need to work on all of the titles you have bestowed upon me! Hmmm... *laughing* We've got both genders! Okay...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:47:35	@shiv379 @YogaChicky @catatonickid Well, HELLO! *laughing so hard*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:47:04	@catatonickid @shiv379 @YogaChicky Yes, you only "half object!" Sorry...bad...tired...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:46:18	@Raznay Not to worry Grasshopper...you will prove to be a wonderful student I have no illusions...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:42:20	@catatonickid @shiv379 @YogaChicky Nice try. *resumes removing pants*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:41:03	I know it's not #LOFNOTC but THE PANTS ARE OFF! Well...for a bit. Until I put more comfortable ones on... *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:39:04	@Raznay Thought you might. Just off the cuff so not really very good but I have a severe penchant for word play.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:38:18	@catatonickid @YogaChicky @shiv379 *sighs* Do you think me as dumb as I look? I know...completely rhetorical...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:34:18	@catatonickid @YogaChicky @shiv379 Last I heard the menu was growing in epic proportions? How many courses now? *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:32:16	@Raznay That's quite alright! It can happen a lot? Toss in a few other things and you get a nice "Brain Stir Fry!"
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:30:51	@catatonickid @YogaChicky @shiv379 Did someone say tea?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:29:22	@Raznay Indeed! Or it can be likened to a roller coaster as well? Perhaps?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:26:46	@Raznay Ditto in that department! *feels capillaries about to burst*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:26:04	@Raznay Well, my ego's been smashed to bits, completely obliterated...have at it! If you're up for the task?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:23:20	@Raznay You rock my socks! Not to mention you are sending my non-existent ego through the...that doesn't work...no, you are CREATING my ego!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:16:07	@Raznay *giggles* Sure, if you want to but my Anatomy and Physiology knowledge tells me that my brain comes with the rest of me? *shrugs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 12:06:08	Duh. Forgot to update blog for Daylight Savings. Silly WP doesn't do it automagically!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 11:24:06	@333AutismNews Oh, totally ADD. I said 2 someone the other day that having ADD is just one lifelong, Easter Egg Hunt! And a frustrating one?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 11:22:06	@Raznay *grins*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 11:20:13	@Raznay *sniff sniff* Ooohh...you're right!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 11:19:40	@333AutismNews LMAO! You would not BELIEVE what I am capable of forgetting! It renders me INCAPABLE! I forget what I've forgotten!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 11:17:41	@catatonickid You're right. Bad guess on my part. Not the air. Gotta be something else then?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 11:11:33	@asdquefty Sleep tight sweets. xo
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 11:11:00	@Raznay You are most welcome. Wow, your hair is really soft too! *laughing so hard*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 11:07:09	@Raznay *strokes hair and tells inner voice to shhh*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 11:05:37	@333AutismNews HA! Could be my forgetful brain and maybe it was someone else I was talking to! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:50:55	@333AutismNews hugs back I thought we talked before when I wrote a rhyme here and you liked it. I then said all rhymes were free for you.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:47:28	@333AutismNews Yes, that was it. I told you before that I wouldn't charge you a penny for any rhymes that I wrote, correct?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:43:09	@333AutismNews There's another "free rhyme" for you.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:42:27	Watching the clock, passing its time. PA again, is making a rhyme. Trying nt 2 think oh her head, bt it's intrusive, screaming: "Go to Bed!"
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:35:50	@catatonickid Must be "something in the air...?" *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:34:59	@Raznay I have phone issues too. Keep things brief unless convos need to be long (long distance etc.) I just "think" to myself? Yes?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:13:47	@Raznay Possible. Do you dial your own number at home and if so, do you get a busy signal or a ring?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:11:19	@catatonickid How odd. I now feel somewhat shocked that you are shocked. Didn't rub a balloon to my head or anything. Weird.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:07:07	@Raznay Yes, it makes one feel less lonely in the world?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:06:29	@asdquefty Hey, it's just one other thing to add to the never ending list of SPAZdom!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:03:16	@catatonickid Suuuurrrreeee. I've heard that one before. *shakes head.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 10:01:06	@Raznay @asdquefty I just did the pathetic old standby of trying to DM myself. Do we all feel a bit brighter now?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:59:48	@Raznay I do my best and will continue to do so *bows*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:58:32	@asdquefty @Raznay ROTFLMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:55:40	@asdquefty U betcha! SPAZ O.o Uber. Aren't you glad to have me back in your presence though?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:54:52	@Raznay Tats ok I mayd alot of typos to.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:54:10	@Raznay Well, we all had to "start somewhere?" Just teasing! Everything is entirely subjective! We can swap lots you and I methinks!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:53:08	How on earth could I get "Double Spammed" via...oh, forget these stupid viral people! BAH!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:49:44	@Raznay ..falling more in love...! *laughing* ...anime, manga, graphic novels, I'm a total geek... I suck. O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:46:42	@EnigmaAnonymous I fucking mis-read that and didn't see "accidentally!" *PA nearly falls over* Good thing I'm on my BED!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:40:38	@asdquefty prn is cool too. Again, just give them a go. Don't know until you try!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:35:52	God, I love my bed. I can not say that enough times! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:34:50	@Raznay So you like weird things? Oh, we'll get along juuuusssstttt fine then!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:20:50	@Raznay Yes, me too...not only pretty but what a wonderful symbol! *huge eyeroll*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:16:24	@BipolarSpa Thanks sweetie. yes, working very hard to try and get my shit together.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:11:12	@Raznay W00t! Rainbows! *laughing and smirking*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:10:21	@asdquefty W/my benzos on/off for years! Just took when needed and stopped. No insomnia got worse over years w/ other things.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:08:26	@BipolarSpa Hi hon' I was taking some time to work on the real life me. I may still be a bit sporadic but I'm still here! "Me Work" ongoing.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:06:34	@Raznay Ooohhh...shiny objects! I "made" mine which is particularly suitable for me! Anime and medicine? Definitely!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:04:30	@asdquefty It did for a while as did my benzos until my insomnia got so bad I needed APs that I take now as you know.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 09:03:48	@Raznay *more blushing* Thank you again. Flattery will get you everywhere... *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:45:39	@asdquefty Yes 7.5 is the correct dose and what I was on. It's a hypnotic but works same as benzos basically. Almost totally, really.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:41:36	@Raznay Oh dear... *extreme blushing* To the nth degree! Thank you so much... *makes goofy face* O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:37:14	@Raznay *wink*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:36:58	@asdquefty Huh. Not so bad? Give them a whirl? I was on before so sure. See how they go.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:35:14	@worstmark Yes. At least I know w/ my migraines it's a guaranteed 2 day thing. W/ my seizures it's a "surprise" to find out when I wake up!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:32:06	@Raznay You're a sweetie. Let me open you up again and I'll get ya into me address bookie!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:30:04	@worstmark I'm feeling a bit poopy as Migraine Hangover Day but will be sound as a pound tomorrow. Thanks, love.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:26:26	@worstmark Lovely. Have a good eve and enjoy your chill time.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:25:41	@shiv379 I just LOST THE GAME!!! Dammit, that's what PA gets for "resurfacing..." Harrumph! / I know, I'm a brat! *winks*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:24:06	@worstmark Hi honey. How art thou?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:23:17	I just LOST THE GAME!!! Dammit, that's what PA gets for "resurfacing..." Harrumph!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:21:03	@Raznay *hugs* My email is on my blog so a good start there!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:17:45	@Raznay Well we'll just have to do our best then, won't we! Pull out all the stops! Every form of communication possible! Better?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:11:14	@Raznay It's alright. I know we can not forever be joined at the hip my darling... *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 08:03:04	@Raznay Yes, I did! Don't ever leave me! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 07:54:24	Oh all of you Followers you are making me dizzy! Am I not done with you yet? O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 07:47:11	@EnigmaAnonymous @raznay @asdquefty Not to worry! Maybe I'm a bit more "back" as at least I seem to be burning up Twitter now...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 07:33:18	@Raznay Thanks. Migraine Hangover Day so a wee bit photophobic. Have to "wee" as well LOL! And water, cigarette... *makes silly face*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 07:30:54	Going Batty since you asked me Little White Twitter SPAZ Box! That's what I am doing! Taking momentary break. My eyes! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 07:28:14	@Raznay Exactly! It was when I was on #LOFNOTC and I was Tweeting about a love affair gone sour. *wipes tears from eyes with tissue*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 07:27:02	@Raznay I don't pay attention anymore. Trust me. After dealing with Sploggers for so damn long? A fucking bot is nothing!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 07:25:48	@EnigmaAnonymous As per last Tweet bot Mentions as well.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 07:25:05	@Raznay i've only gotten bot Mentions. Like the wicked! one. Let's see if I can lure it back now LOL. So silly.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 07:23:42	@Raznay Yes, being facetious. That one was a sneaky as haven't seen yet? Get ones that don't appear in my Inbox so checking them now. BAH!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-12 07:17:09	@EnigmaAnonymous @raznay @asdquefty Yes. My "fault." Since I have been away, I have many follows to clean up and am doing now.

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-11 15:28:01	....yes kids...I guess with that last one, I am indeed back...someone take me to bed!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-11 15:27:06	Speaking of PA being a maniac, and saying hello, she's back...now she may have to say she's gone! Totally fried! Someone take her to bed!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-11 15:25:25	@FroggyPrinceMom Thank you. Always nice to have a fellow maniac welcome me back? Perhaps there shall be more? *smirks*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-11 15:20:29	I just came back from J.'s, tired, but have "captured" my "Sippy Cup!" Aspie/Spectrum Object Attachment Rocks! I Win! W00t!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-10 06:15:12	I Am Still Here and I Am Not: I figured that would be a suitable Post Title on the heels of the last? I don’t know... http://bit.ly/2MD8gv
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-08 06:41:52	I Am Still Here and I Am Alright: I am fine and I am merely taking a break from the “online me,” and paying some ... http://bit.ly/ycQNJ
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 04:29:54	I think maybe I should rest. Screwy, screwy... Laters.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 04:25:03	Got some writing done! Now I'm tired. Well, maybe I was before LOL! Idk. I'm confused. Perpetually? Yes. But today has been a Banner Day!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 04:21:16	@melankolyme HA! Sorry not laughing at you...at me! Not working so have to wait for nice toys! Don't really need either of those tho
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 04:14:16	@melankolyme Uh...it's uh...LMAO! Samsung something. I don't have the manual with me and it doesn't have the model on it! It's a T... LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 04:04:23	I love the "Reject" option on my new mobile! HA! I "Reject" you!!! I don't reject people in real life tho. I just got a wrong number now!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 03:43:03	@asdquefty As I mentioned, Thyroid could cause issues re: Depression so always a good thing to check, just to be sure. Can't hurt.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 03:39:02	@333AutismNews Thanks for the mention.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 03:38:48	@asdquefty Most excellent. Glad to hear some progress...finally?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 02:29:46	Feeling extremely "dysmotivated" but going to try and write. Things are very quiet in my world at the moment so a good time?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 02:09:14	@asdquefty SPAZ movement of the day (so far.) Shut cupboard door on finger while making tea SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 01:58:24	@asdquefty Oh, sweetie! You're having a rough day today! Sounds like the start of mine being Queen Bitch of the Universe! O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 01:54:53	@asdquefty The reason I would look so high functioning is that as an adult I learned some coping mechanisms but now, screw a lot of them!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 01:53:42	@asdquefty All that I wrote was like my SPAZ Thesis O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 01:52:01	@asdquefty I'd prob. never get Aspie as "too high functioning!" Bollocks! I wrote pages 2 spell it all out from child 2 present! Very clear!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 01:45:06	@asdquefty I know! It is SO fucked but that is... *PA tosses confetti in air* AHHH!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 01:42:05	@asdquefty I mean, wait. Similarities between Asperger's and HFA but still a lot of differences. OMG!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 01:41:26	@asdquefty I agree but again, b/c of the differences and the variances of HFA/Autism and confusion it generates so much! It's already a mess
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 01:39:31	@asdquefty HEY! That's MY trick! I also reply to myself! SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 01:37:10	@asdquefty Good luck!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 01:06:45	@Canageek Oh, I see. Well, Asperger's should be its own diagnosis. Definitely.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 01:05:57	@melankolyme Okay, that's fine.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 00:51:47	@melankolyme It's okay. Sometimes we all need a good cry. It's healthy to let it all out. Both emotionally and physically.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 00:51:04	@Acrimonia Yes, I chime in! Good luck and I hope it goes well!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 00:50:17	@Canageek It's not a subsidiary. It stands on it's own.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 00:31:46	@asdquefty Ok Honey, my Twitter Profile has been changed just for you! SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 00:25:20	@asdquefty That's good. The main goal is just to get you feeling better. You'll always be a spaz though. Hate 2 b bearer of bad news LOL O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 00:12:52	@tendrel Yes, and thank you then, very much for the reminder xo
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-04 00:10:09	@asdquefty That's a good idea! Would it upset the UK folks LOL! Not sure how many chars I have left. Let me see. O.o would be good too!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:58:43	Oh, gee! Another Follow! Let's see who this person is!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:56:41	@asdquefty LMAO! Did you see mine the other day where I got a follow from Arsenal FC? I do think about Follows but idk where that came from!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:45:11	@asdquefty AH! Thanks for the heads up! Couldn't have been better timing! I just got the Follow! Son of a bitch!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:40:55	@Canageek Eaxactly. Now you've got it! There are significant differences, for sure! But Asperger's & HFAs do share links & things in common
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:33:53	@melankolyme @asdquefty Yes, some people have no problems with discontinuation at all.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:31:53	@Canageek So was I and that can be tied to Hyperlexia and ONLY one difference. Not all is Black and White!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:31:10	@Canageek Wrong again! They are BOTH Developmental Disorders!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:29:00	@Canageek to keep repeating myself like I have Palilalia which is a common trait w/ both! There's an example right there!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:28:14	@Canageek Oh, please no! They do share same traits, Asperger's and Autism! Will someone please agree with me here! Good God! I'm not going..
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:26:53	@asdquefty enough Serotonin to get you through the bad parts and over the hump. Don't worry, keep lines of comm. up w/ docs. Fight w/ them!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:25:52	@asdquefty I had a really rough time on Effex. 2 Easy trick for discontin. Take a wee bit of Prozac. as it tricks your brain into having...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:24:44	@tendrel Thanks. True, nothing is permanent but hard to remember when you're going through it, right?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:21:13	@333AutismNews Thank you but I feel like am being a bitchy fool and this is not the place to air my frustrations so I am sorry everyone.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:20:22	@asdquefty No, you should never sit down and shut up with your doctors. I'm going to sit down and shut up now, however! I'm being an idiot.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:05:58	@shiv379 Sorry...I know...contagion...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:05:13	@333AutismNews Well after all that I wrote there, I think I sound like Queen Bitch of the Universe!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:00:47	@333AutismNews here and sounding like a not very nice person at all
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 23:00:29	@333AutismNews HFAs go non-verbal so wouldn't you really be HFA? No, I am an Aspie. No I am leaving for a bit after bitching way 2 much...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:59:36	@333AutismNews Then now, arguing that Aspies do not go non-verbal. I am an Aspie and I have gone non-verbal. Well, I have only read that...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:58:43	@333AutismNews First, being asked for advice, giving it and then no one listening to it or ignoring, refuting so why did you want my help...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:56:14	Tea break!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:56:00	Might be time for me to leave here. This is the same goddamn shit that happened last night! Arguing my points and ppl refuting me!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:55:00	@Canageek What was Autism trait going non-verbal? If so, Screw Attwood! Does he have Asperger's? How the fuck would he know???
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:53:01	@Canageek Totally stupid debate IMHO re: Autistic Spectrum & Asperger's re: Asperger's on Spectrum or not! I feel Asperger's ON the Spectrum
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:50:09	@Canageek That is why it is called a "Spectrum." Probably nowhere else is it apparent that something can manifest in so many different ways.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:49:35	@Canageek Thing is, Aspies and HFAs do share a lot in common but there are distinguishing differences too, even if they may appear slight...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:48:33	@Canageek There are all sorts of stims but yes, Aspies can go non-verbal! Absolutely!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:26:27	@Canageek The Game? Actually, I'm supposed to do this when I LOSE THE GAME!!! LOL! Tell someone... http://bit.ly/eEtAB
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:25:10	@Canageek that I put together from childhood to adulthod, it is very clear that I am an Aspie. Eg. no speech delay, things like that
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:24:03	@Canageek Oh no! Most docs wouldn't even give me an Aspie dx! I appear way to high functioning even for that! however with the info...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:21:00	I just lost THE GAME!!! Argh!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:10:48	@Canageek I guess I should feel flattered, then?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:10:37	@Canageek Already following me so they are reading this too! Now I sound like a big dork! HA! Well, I am! Already has thousands of followers
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:09:40	@Canageek Well this person is a writer so it's all good.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:05:56	To wit: I just got a Follow like that. *runs to Google*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:05:34	Do you ever get confused about a Follow and then think you should out of guilt? Like you don't know them but they might be famous?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 22:00:12	@Canageek Oh, Fuck me. Do NOT get me started on the DSM! See my blog for DSM rants!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 21:59:41	@Canageek Yes I have fairly strong OCD-type tendencies that can crop up when my Aspie biz. gets pushed further. Not mega OCD but a bit.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 21:58:33	@asdquefty Thanks. Just confused about it all but don't want to air laundry and such in public.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 21:58:06	Stupid hospital! Woke me up & interrupted my lovely dream! Even if my lovely dream didn't make a whole lot of sense! Still lovely! Harrumph!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 09:48:11	@tendrel That is she hopes she just averted a meltdown now!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 09:47:42	@tendrel No shit! Betwn time changes, full moons, sleep cycles off b/c of?, getting overstimulated, wee Aspie PA jst averted a meltdown now!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 08:50:33	@Canageek Sorry missed this in confusion. Trying to settle with a Valium at the moment. No idea *sighs* Trying to avoid meltdown sorry.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 08:26:22	Need smoke. Lord, I do this research all the time! *shakes head* Head that is about to blow up???
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 08:25:30	@Canageek Okay cool. never was much good at them but hey, whatever1
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 08:24:37	*twitch twitch* LOL SPAZ O.o

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 08:23:21	@Canageek Yeha, books and games are fun.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 08:23:07	@shiv379 Okay, thanks. I've starred this via web as I'm getting a bit crazed and overloaded at the moment but i'll settle in a bit.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 08:21:06	@asdquefty Okay, I think I've read enough! I was stupid & it was so long ago since I even touched it when I was mis-dx'd! Have to e. 2 much.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 08:14:30	@asdquefty Hang on, I'm getting to you. Like I said with this shit, it's murky waters but I have some answers for you already. Sit tight.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 07:58:17	@BipolarSpa You know, I never mastered that wonderful talent of spitting or belching either for that matter. Oh, well!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 07:54:45	@Canageek Yes, that is right my dear. You figured out the type of roles. Well done!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 07:54:04	Going a bit kooky right now. Brain "straddling the fence." Want to "do" something but lacking energy.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 07:45:25	@shiv379 Thanks, I've Bookmarked that as well and can also go back to main page and search etc...?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 07:43:47	@shiv379 That's a .exe and I'm on a Mac. Either way, I've Bookmarked the main page if I want to go back and have a peek later.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 07:40:58	@spectrumdweller Cool! Feel free to share!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 07:33:59	Not as "easy" as I thought! Well, I am shocked! Someone is surely asleep at the keyboard! ROTFLMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 07:31:20	@shiv379 No I haven't but I read stuff from the web.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 07:30:56	@Canageek Well, I'll tell you one thing, it doesn't have anything to do with gaming!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 07:18:48	Hmmm...not sure what "roles" would suit me... *waits for it...* Just too damn easy...
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 07:10:46	@Katreeeena @asdquefty Funny w/ diff. countries b/c a "doss cunt" would get ya in shite bein' a Canuck. Well, tha' las' word anyweh. LOL

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 06:44:30	@shiv379 Well, if I find "the culprit" I can just delete it from the external HD. I think? Me no techie but sounds like what you'd do?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 06:43:26	@spectrumdweller Thanks, hon. Indeed, alas. Why do I have a sudden urge to put a "k" and an "a" after "alas?" HA! Me silly.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 06:41:22	@shiv379 I need to do a back up of HD and then download some anti-vi as may have picked up bug from T? Comp. doing some weird stuff hope not

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 06:34:57	@shiv379 Also anything geeky, funny etc... has to be interesting of course. Not little kid crap. HA!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-03 06:34:19	@shiv379 grew up in hellhole where this wasn't available. Open to any suggestions. Mature themed of all three but not freakin' Hentai LOL

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:57:50	@asdquefty one of my LARGER issues is the stuff is not regulated like pharm. so you don't know what you are getting! May not be safe!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:51:19	@asdquefty *BIG SPAZZY HUGS* O.o LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:49:32	@asdquefty Then you crash. Kaboom! So you may need a wee bit to let the depressant effects wear off? And try not to be 2 hard on yourself 2!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:48:45	@asdquefty What can make it more of an issue is that it was a binge. If you drink regularly (like I did) you may not notice until you stop.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:46:37	@asdquefty That is alright though as it's only temporary. Just the depressant effect. Has lingered for a while for me at times.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:46:03	@asdquefty True enough, that can have a bit of a longer effect but steady state is ok as you take reg. more a problem of recovery from binge
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:44:43	@asdquefty Well, not brief but you know, a bit tired but good if anxiety in check.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:43:45	@asdquefty Well, if it's any form of poop out may need titration if not at full level? Also, any recent triggers to make this a brief spell?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:41:10	@asdquefty I see. Indeed the pain in the arse of waiting for docs, meds...bleh for sure. I hope you can get in soon.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:37:14	@asdquefty You okay? *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:36:55	@asdquefty Use? I was thinking of all of my dx's which I don't usually and it's like...wow! I have a lot! How screwed up is that
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:33:07	I don't usually think about it but now I am. FTW with me having all the dx's that I have??? That's (I'm?) pretty screwed up! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:27:30	@333AutismNews HA! Like what I said abt myself! Minor space of order but everything else is complete chaos! Damn comorbidities messing me up
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:22:51	@333AutismNews What's odd is that I'll do that but the rest of my apt. is a disaster! Ah, the fun of comorbidities... LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 10:20:05	@333AutismNews I'm happy with my cans though. They're all nicely aligned and stacked. Labels facing forward. Looking good! No, really!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:29:26	@333AutismNews Okay that's REALLY helpful information--well, you're her mom so it's not like I'm talking to her! OMG. SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:26:54	@333AutismNews How old is she?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:26:34	@MarcyRubin I don't doubt it. It's a tough issue as everything and everyone presents in a different way! Uber complicated!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:23:37	@333AutismNews Sure. Now it is for her head, right?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:23:06	@sandieb32 Yep. Wrote Post recently funny you should mention! Well, along the family lines! I have great docs also. http://bit.ly/3NbUUO

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:17:47	@333AutismNews Yes, have you talked to her about it, explain and talk her through it? I can tell you more about the process if you want.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:17:08	@sandieb321 Yes, as much support as possible if you can get it. Sad fact that a lot of us don't have family/friends!
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:13:49	@MarcyRubin Yes, I was trying 2 emphasize the pos. aspects of navigating the flags they use 4 Slalom & making your way around as hanging in.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:12:24	@MarcyRubin Well, that was my hardest part in answering your question since BP is so different for everyone.
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:11:45	@333AutismNews Yes, probably hard for kids, maybe better if parents there but might interfere w/ test results? I have had two MRIs
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:08:30	@MarcyRubin Not sure but Slalom Skiing? Lots of obstacles to overcome, navigate but if you can do it/make to finish you'll be okay?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:07:06	@MarcyRubin I'll just reply and not use hashtag as not appropriate. I was misdiagnosed for years & diagnosed myself! Thought of other sport?
16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 09:02:17	@sandieb321 @MarcyRubin Oh, absolutely! Establishing trust is so important and even more so when someone is already in a delicate state!

16253011	patientanon	2009-11-02 08:50:51	@MarcyRubin That's a pretty simple one to take away. The rest is more the speedy/out of control? Maybe too scary for new client!

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 03:59:22	@asdquefty Likesay, some of these Rx. NSAIDs have been on the market for ages and some new? Well, look at Naproxen? Still Rx.?
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 03:58:01	@asdquefty You see, that is why I asked as some ppl take NSAIDs long term for say arthritis? Hence, safety issue!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 03:57:08	@asdquefty No, not so re: Rx. NSAIDs. Can cause issue or not or FTW as I was given Ketorolac for gastro prob. and only for short term use!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 03:54:03	@asdquefty Sorry! *knocks on door again* Why do you take it? DM if it's personal. FTW with contradictory info here!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 03:44:46	@asdquefty Ok jst curious as I was wondering if going the Rx route would be overkill. If not taking regularly I would say yes. Back later...
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 03:40:40	@asdquefty In just thinking, how often do you actually take NSAIDs
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 03:35:39	@Acrimonia Thank you. Yes, I am very flattered to have been chosen to sit aside some great bloggers.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 03:22:39	@asdquefty I can check into OTC NSAIDS vs. either those or...well, possibly any others on Rx level?
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 03:18:34	OMG! MY RENT! Going to have to put on some "non-sick-person-clothes" and mail my cheque! Crap! Blah.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 02:39:44	@asdquefty Yes, go for some antacid or something like that. Should hopefully help? Don't know if milk helps but def. an antacid!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 02:38:21	Okay, way tired. I just replied to myself...again... SPAZ O.o
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 02:37:53	@asdquefty antibiotics plus a run of a PPI (proton pump inhibitor) like I am on. Generally clears up all cases (like 90% some way high #)
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-30 02:36:00	@asdquefty No, hon' Prob. just an upset tummy? Unless constant. Ulcers now caused by h. Pylori Treatment consists of course of 2 Cont'd

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-29 21:06:29	If I won award bt it was only an "Honorable Mention" would it be bad 2 put the badge on blog (if I can't add the text for Honorable Mention)

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-29 10:50:11	@asdquefty ROTFLMAO! I usually don't actually stutter when I seize. Well, not verbally. It's my body that's more stuttering, really!!! HA!

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-29 07:30:32	@Tulencenter LOL! No I haven't heard of any such movies either unless I pull a reverse "Kill Bill" on myself? *huge eyeroll*
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-29 07:29:06	@spectrumdweller Cool. You know in talking about all of this I have to laugh as my ACs make me klutzy so I might not do that well anyway!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-29 06:55:58	Speaking of conditioning my body, I should probably eat something *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-29 06:53:58	@spectrumdweller Fair enough. That makes definite sense! A good thing to look into in the mean time? *nods*

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-29 05:47:34	Pondering Martial Arts that I've wanted to do for years but no $$$!!! Would be a damn good investment though. Doesn't hurt to ask the cost?

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-29 02:38:06	And funny, More Object Attachment in Real Time: Drinking my "sick cocktail" same glass I always do! HA! How ironic!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-29 02:35:21	@asdquefty OMG! I HAD to have this one spoon as a kid! It was too much. It was "The Spoon Of All Spoons!" Bow down to "The Spoon!"

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-29 01:14:01	@333AutismNews Was going to say it's "alright" but when is abuse and trauma alright. Semantics? Still we all can come from a lot of bad crap

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 09:19:23	@333AutismNews I just spit that one out. Kind of a PA Word Barf LOL! Maybe a PA Hairball is better. Yes, that's much better. Rhyme ok tho...
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 09:16:25	@Canageek I just shot you that wee rhyme as I thought you might like it with the talk. But thank you about the sadness. I want to be happy!

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 09:09:28	@333AutismNews Yes, the best price is free. And speaking of...my rhymes for you are completely free of charge. Not a penny.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 09:07:58	Ugh. This sucks even more as I was thinking of layering up and going cycling. Yes! Motivation! I know! But noooo! I have to go and get sick!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 09:02:58	@333AutismNews Hey, why not! Give everything a shot! HA! I just made a rhyme there and didn't even realize it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 09:01:54	@Canageek You made you literally LOL with that!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:55:40	@Canageek vast majority of the time I have no damn clue! But thank you. You are a gem. xo
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:55:00	@Canageek it affects you in a lot of ways though. That is good. It gives me insight as to what on earth I am doing with it because the...
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:54:14	@Canageek *hugs* Well my blog is very honest & I don't know how it affects people at all really. I never have. I guess am seeing how...
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:50:13	@333AutismNews Yes, do some good shopping around before making a firm decision. That is always best if you can.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:49:18	@TakeMeAsIm I don't know. No. I won't balloon up!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:48:40	@asdquefty Yep. gingerale is fab and I drink it when my tummy can act up too. Hugs back.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:48:02	@Canageek Oh, hon. I always feel bad when people read about my seizures and it makes them feel bad. It's ok. It is part of Epilepsy at times
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:35:23	@Canageek Oh, also I am not sick from my seizure now. This is just some silly virus.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:34:47	@Canageek I can't get into what happens when I'm sick after a seizure here. Too much to say. All over my blog though in detail.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:31:45	@Canageek post-ictal means after a seizure event. Tea? I had lots earlier so I'll save yours for tomorrow! *wink*
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:30:48	@shiv379 The water's all good and safe here. The reason I drink my OJ and gingerale cocktail is too much citrus/OJ upsets wee PAs tummy!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:28:27	@Canageek Well, the irony is I'm supposed to have someone take me out shopping but I've been post-ictal for days and now I'm sick! Nuts!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:27:29	@Canageek *fellow turtle geek playfully snaps back*
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:25:45	@Canageek LOL! I know that! But fluids when you're sick? Sure, it's coming out of me but I must stay hydrated to flush this thing out!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:21:49	@333AutismNews That makes good sense if it's a possibility. Sure, take it for a test drive.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:19:40	I'm drinking so much liquid I feel like a water balloon some kid is about to launch out his bedroom window onto the neighbours passing below
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:17:34	@333AutismNews Well, if that is the case then sure you need to shell out the bucks if you need it. There are places to help u tech wise tho
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:10:50	@aspieteach OMG! I'm sick too. *passes you some hot chocolate I do have* I am drinking my own "cocktail" of OJ and gingerale right now LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-28 08:09:42	@333AutismNews You'd need the Blue to try it with I am thinking but I don't have so can't be sure? Me not so techie anyway.

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-27 09:48:02	@asdquefty Yes but I can't believe you missed the point on that one?
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-27 09:45:38	@asdquefty It's all good. I'm extremely repetitive anyway. Really I am. No, I am. You can trust me on that one. For sure. It's true. Honest!

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-25 04:03:13	@spectrumdweller I wouldn't use film but a Digital Camera. It's fast and you get immediate results. That way, I could do both.

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 08:07:09	@worstmark *gurgle* I think I still stuck in the Sahara Desert (that was from a blog post I made a while back.) Thirsty...
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 07:56:44	@Canageek Thanks for the hug lovey. Going for an "OMG! Shoot.Me.Now. Cigarette Break!" More water too. My eyeballs are getting dehydrated!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 07:54:33	@YogaChicky @TriniGirlBlue @shiv379 @catatonickid I couldn't agree with you more about defining "evil deeds." Much debate to be sure.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 07:53:32	@YogaChicky @shiv379 Well, thing is my idea is/was rather serious in nature. That said, significant thought and brain power?
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 07:52:11	OMG! Shoot.Me.Now. I'm getting to that "Danger Zone" of not being able to stand myself! You know that place!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 07:50:37	@catatonickid @shiv379 @TriniGirlBlue The entire world is naughty and evil! I can't figure out if that is good or bad! Well naughty=good!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 07:49:15	Ugh. To post or not to post? That is the question! @shiv379 @YogaChicky I've had an idea on my mind since I got up but whew!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 07:47:09	@TriniGirlBlue @shiv379 @catatonickid What is an evil deed? Now THAT is a rather broad question!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 07:44:11	@shiv379 Thanks, honey! I am glad to have the shiv379 "Seal of Approval!" *laughing*

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 07:31:42	@YogaChicky @shiv379 Was there a question asked? Huh? LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 07:18:54	@YogaChicky @shiv379 I was going to say same thing. You're dusted so not thinking clearly (but when do any of us think clearly?)
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-23 07:18:05	@catatonickid @shiv379 Oh, for sure! Have emailed pics to ppl before. But trust factor as problems in past. Also better looking ones of me!

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 10:08:23	@spectrumdweller I found it yeah, almost a cross between cleanliness and unreality? No depth? I don't know if that "cross" makes sense LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 09:55:48	@spectrumdweller ROTFLMAO! All of my relationships (or lack thereof) have been rather "erm...never mind." LOSER!!! LOSER!!! LOSER!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 09:54:20	@spectrumdweller LMAO! My ex. really liked it. I think I bought it for her. I found it boring. Our relationship was erm...never mind.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 09:32:29	@asdquefty O.o SPAZ This Tweet has no point other than to thoroughly demonstrate I am SO TOTALLY a SPAZ
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 09:20:48	@spectrumdweller Take care hon' *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 09:19:59	@asdquefty Medic-Alert has some outrageously priced stuff! Like $300+ watches LOL! I lust for watches but one with my dx's? LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 09:18:26	@asdquefty I can't recall how long mine took but I think their pretty good. *shrug*
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 08:37:48	@asdquefty Yes, you have to purchase the membership for Medic-Alert and then your product for engraving etc.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 08:37:16	@asdquefty Well I don't give a shit about scrubs or caps, any supply store can get you those but not bracelets and that
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 08:33:26	@asdquefty I mean, you can get other brands at pharmacies and such but not actual Medic-Alert! Bugger Me! That is totally bad!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 08:32:19	@asdquefty OMG! Medic-Alert products on ebay *gasp* Someone should fucking alert Medic-Alert! That sounds silly what I wrote but really!

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 08:17:40	@asdquefty LMAO! Amazing they COULD add everything that's going on with me to mine! It's hilarious! Plus member no. Telephone no. etc.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 08:16:55	@asdquefty Further for Medic-Alert go to their site for list of med stuff altho Asperger's not there? Still, I had it added to mine Cont'd
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 08:15:55	@asdquefty Oh, duh. Getting a bit punchy from a long day. The free Donor Plan for Medic Alert requires a doc fill out a form. Forgot that!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 08:13:37	@asdquefty Donor Plan. They have that for anyone who can't afford. Just basic stuff though. Nothing fancy.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 08:13:08	@asdquefty Well Medic-Alert has nothing to do w/ your docs you just buy them! Unless like me where I got mine for free via their Cont'd
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 08:03:14	@asdquefty I've totally done the Medic-Alert Bracelet Flash when I've been spazzy or a bit seizy or something.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 08:02:30	@asdquefty Well, you could get if you're enough of a SPAZ to warrant. Mine so far has been uber useful and helpful in situations already!

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 06:14:47	@TriniGirlBlue Well, I vary in age range on a day by day basis! Sometimes I'm an Octogenarian and sometimes I'm 4.

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 05:57:46	@TriniGirlBlue LOL! Thanks! So you can be another "survivor" with me. Any other "World End Wonders" who want to join, not a private party!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-22 05:54:09	You know what? When the world ends, even if I'm the only surviving human, it's alright! I find myself quite amusing in my own insanity.

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 09:26:11	@4ASNews I have no hard and fast rules about how anyone dresses! I can be a bum or dress "like a girl!" LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 09:19:20	@Canageek Well, perhaps it may just take some time to find an effective way to manage that anger.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 09:12:37	@4ASNews I am quite comfortable and more than happy to be a geek!

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 09:07:11	@Canageek Yes. Well, perhaps with some time and gentleness with yourself, you an learn a bit of control to step back and let that person be

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 09:02:58	@Canageek Yes, it is a struggle within one's own self. And it is even harder to step back from who we are because we are ourselves!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 09:01:31	@Canageek *hugs* Sometimes you may just have to step back and let people do their own thing even if you want to tell them things?

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:51:27	@Canageek *hugs* rest hon. You're okay. Always in my books!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:49:13	@4ASNews Change others' view on it? Tall order there as is Spectrum! Portrayed so much at lower end. No one looks at higher end focus there?
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:48:01	@spectrumdweller No, no. I'd give you the truth and we'd edit together etc. a full collaboration *grin*
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:47:24	@4ASNews They say it is suffering b/c they don't know what it is like and orgs. don't help they hinder. Mass-misconceptions media spins all!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:40:03	@4ASNews Being on the Spectrum IS NOT SUFFERING!!! Do not get me started...
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:38:57	@spectrumdweller Maybe you'll catch me have a seizure too? My migraines are pretty boring. *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:37:53	@asdquefty LMAO! Stim, stim, stim...Spaz, spaz...I've got J's cycling gloves on so I'm back to that style as per blog LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:36:58	@spectrumdweller Hey, you can film me as Aspie, all my dx's. I am one photog that doesn't actually mind being in front of the lens!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:30:54	@spectrumdweller Oh absolutely. We'd have to go so far out in the art dept. WAY out there.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:30:21	@asdquefty Stepped away for a bit. had to get under blanket freezing
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:29:54	@asdquefty it's a good resource
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:14:39	@asdquefty Half lives vary for every damn thing. Even benzos etc... I don't have my info here as not at home to give you examples.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:13:33	@asdquefty even with script/non-OTC/pharm meds to reach steady state.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:13:03	@asdquefty Again, you are talking basically peak plasma and roughly elimination but steady state I'd have to look into. Not that long Cont'd
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:12:15	@asdquefty you'll always have a stead state. What you are talking about is peak plasma levels.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:11:51	@asdquefty I'd have to look at how it's metabolized, half lives and all of that gabage etc... If you're still on anything period Cont'd
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:10:20	@asdquefty Again fair enough but you still know my stance?
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:07:19	@asdquefty Good boy.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:07:01	@asdquefty Fair enough but you don't want to "experiment" when you've got something big or high pressure going on. Not a good idea.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:05:45	Nothing like meeting someone and playing "Nutcase Poker!" Who's more messed up, you or them? LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 08:02:46	@asdquefty Could be. Don't push things. You know how I feel about titrations...slow and easy...nice and gentle...
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:49:14	@spectrumdweller I don't even know what the hell I'd be doing in our version of RENT? Something pretty damn arsey you can bet at least!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:46:07	@TakeMeAsIm @andsisyphus Between emails, other Tweets and still being stupid I missed this one. Yes, I like alternative.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:42:31	@spectrumdweller That sounds uber cool!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:41:24	@TakeMeAsIm As far as looks, I usually just send out pics and let ppl decide LOL! But only trusted ppl as did have problem in past.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:40:32	@spectrumdweller Yes, I would definitely like that environment. But others to live in too?
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:40:02	@TakeMeAsIm Hey, I never complain at getting guessed younger. I'm small too, good genes (except the mental!) so that helps?
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:39:23	@spectrumdweller Not at all...we'd get along juuuuusssstttt fine LOL! and I'd get that bike ride finally! Or lots of 'em!

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:25:47	@asdquefty Oh, that one. I thought maybe the "RENT" adaptation. Thanks!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:25:14	@andsisyphus @TakeMeAsIm 39 but I look really young for my age LOL! No, I usually get guessed late 20s early 30s.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:24:09	@andsisyphus Gotcha. Again, I'm good w/ anything other than what I crossed off my list. Some of my stuff might make people's ears bleed tho
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:22:16	@asdquefty Good one what? What did I do? I didn't reply to myself again. LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:20:53	@spectrumdweller Our own version of "RENT" Can you sing and dance?
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:19:34	@spectrumdweller Yes indeed. We'll turn it into some groovy, artsy, crazy, loft-like space and just go nuts together LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:17:29	@TakeMeAsIm @andsisyphus Well some things are out: Country Twang, Heavy Metal Thrash crap, Hip Hop crap...
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:15:42	@spectrumdweller To go through the hassle to get things sorted is not worth the effort
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:15:14	@TakeMeAsIm @andsisyphus I have vast and varied tastes in music!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:12:44	@andsisyphus Should know who I absolutely die for: The Tallis Scholars! *sighs* Major Sighs...

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 07:01:39	@andsisyphus This is true but it gets better and easier when you have someone to you help you...and vice versa.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 06:57:25	@andsisyphus *casts coy glance* *bats eyelashes*

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 06:09:19	@asdquefty He's a "Man Of The Cloth" too so I always feel like leaving all sorts of naughty things around my flat when he comes by LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 06:07:29	@asdquefty However, I will not argue that he is a ROYAL ASS anyway as I have blogged so much about THAT!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 06:04:58	@asdquefty Well he gave proper notice re: time and he does own the damn bldg. and it is to look at work that was done. He did pay for it...

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 01:12:18	Goodbye. I'll probably be back later when I'm not being such an idiot here and making such a mess of things! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 01:05:37	@BipolarSpa Absolutely. One thing I am NOT ashamed of is how loony I am! *laughing*

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 01:00:57	@BipolarSpa Thank you too for your encouragement. I am just feeling so incredibly stupid and like a total idiot today. *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:58:31	@Canageek I dropped the electrical cord of a kettle into the water while doing dishes and almost didn't notice before plugging it in!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:57:28	@wallaceaz Right, tell that to years of ingrained ugliness and several comorbidities that make me batshit crazy! However, thank you so much!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:53:54	@BearTwinsMom LMAO! I'm having a day of going complete arse over tits! I am a whirling dervish of epic stupidity!

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:50:43	Time for the Valium and hardest object I can find to hit my head with several times...
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:46:43	@BipolarSpa Oh, no! You RT'd that! *hangs head in shame and wants to run away now* Oh well I wrote it in the first place. I suck.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:45:08	@bldngnerd @canageek I wanna see the pic too lol | Well to be honest my pics are reserved for certain people. At least to a point.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:35:27	I need to shut my gob.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:34:47	Now the entire Twitter World can see just how insane I really am. I do not actually have an ego like that. I am actually rather shy. Oh dear
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:33:20	@Canageek LMAO! Did I send you my pictures? I can't recall. So far no complaint from anyone else online? I can't believe I just typed that.
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:32:05	@Canageek Yes. It's because I act silly here. Used to be a respectable blogger and in part Twitter has reduced that factor!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:28:10	Whoo! Still hot!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:27:17	Okay, gimme my fucking tea. Oops. Now I'm sounding a bit cranky. LOL! I'm a pussycat! Everyone knows that around here! *grin*

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:23:57	@andsisyphus Don't be silly! Why would you say you're of no help! You're fine, darling!
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:23:00	Ok. I've just about had it w/ the Twitter Follows I am getting but I guess that is life on Twitter. This is a very stupid thing 2 even write
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:21:46	@andsisyphus LOL! *sighs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-18 00:19:27	@Canageek Hugs are okay but again, something abut sleeping in a bed with a guy and being gay and all of this and the Asperger's said b4.

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-17 02:49:33	@andsisyphus Exactly. My surgeon was awesome & so were the nurses. Big diff. since I was technically a psych patient bt held on a surg ward

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-17 02:04:03	@andsisyphus Considering I *already* have Epilepsy, maybe it would have given me some kind of DIY fix? Easier than invasive surgery 4 VNS?
16253011	patientanon	2009-10-17 01:57:26	@andsisyphus Close! Making tea & washing dishes. Plug 4 kettle fell in water as I was just abt 2 start making tea! Eep! Almost didn't notice

16253011	patientanon	2009-10-06 03:18:29	@asdquefty That sucks. My GP didn't bat an eyelash when I said the word: Asperger's. We need docs who get us.

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 10:20:39	I may not stream a song every #TunefulTuesday bt wow. I think I'm going 2 make u nuts. I'll still stream when the mood hits bt I'll hash it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 10:10:31	Any 80s #TunefulTuesday fans? Of course! Musical Explosion! Jst 1 group that added to the alt. electro fringe, Cabaret Voltaire: Sensoria
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 10:09:32	#TunefulTuesday
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 10:01:08	#TunefulTuesday Btw, last was about trying to find loud stuff or something as I have to compete with a band, a battery, a beer, and iTunes!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 09:55:19	And if anybody cares, let me know and I'll give you a play by play. It still is #TunefulTuesday By my calendar, anyway. Shoot me a Twit.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 09:52:35	Ok for my remaining time here I have to find the loudest music I can find and crank it. *PA looks at Playlists*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 09:47:30	Well, shit. I am impressed. Have maintained signal but may not be able to hear my music. iTunes can not compete w/ a live band!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 09:46:18	testing...testing..1, 2, 3...
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 09:42:13	Piss me right the fuck off! A band. I have a signal. wifi. Now I have to move. If I lose it, goodbye! I love you all! Grrr..
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 09:40:42	@asdquefty *kisses better* From one klutz to another?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 09:28:24	@Canageek Really? I did not know your connection to me through @AuRtist She's a sweetie.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 09:26:23	@Canageek Not that I know of. Again, been a year so who the hell knows? We were always direct email and phone! Always in contact.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 09:25:04	@Canageek Still, thank you for paying attention to me? And what I write? That means lot.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 09:23:35	@Canageek Nope. it was a bye bye msg. as in no longer working here. Unreachable. Dead.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 09:20:08	@Canageek I was going to say that was damn quick! Do you have me on a Feed? RSS or other?! You were like, WHAM! xo

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-30 01:09:12	New post up now for #TuenfulTuesday http://bit.ly/3uftXm It will show up in the stream eventually but leaves no room for hashtag LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 09:04:45	@Canageek Good point. "Reality" is tough to pin down and highly debatable as a concept altogether. *laughing* We need more that 140 chars.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 09:03:19	@asdquefty That is the DUMBEST thing I have ever heard re: Winblows 7. Ok not the dumbest thing ever. Still, it's very high up on the list!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 08:58:55	@Canageek I was just being cute. Or trying? Then failing? ACK! Never had any guidance in "reality" growing up. I could dream of lots though.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 08:45:19	@asdquefty Re: Pic of software CD. Probably the lamer that wants to throw the Windows 7 Release Party!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 08:43:17	@asdquefty Ubuntu Karmic Party. You funny!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 08:42:07	@Canageek I'll be your assistant in your goal because my chemistry isn't so great. *grin*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 08:04:47	I may have stuck to my "typical" 48hr Ultradian Cycle as I'm possibly starting to come around? Let's hope. Try for early night. #bipolar
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 06:59:06	@asdquefty Yes, they are and dead easy to make.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 05:58:48	Eating chocolate chip pancakes. Need to raise blood sugar. Okay tummy. You've had your Gravol. Be good.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 05:07:17	@melankolyme nashmash! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 04:52:04	@melankolyme LOL! Who's counting. Making scratch marks? IIII and then a diagonal? I'm going to take some Gravol now. Barf.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 04:40:27	@melankolyme Maybe I should just go back to bed. Crikey! I won't sleep, though.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 04:38:34	@melankolyme I'm tired ,confused, depressed 2 Even my everlovin' tea is making me nauseous. NOT fair! I can't even type, work my mouse. Gah!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 04:35:12	@melankolyme Thanks. Good (or bad) to know I'm not alone. The Bipolar winds have hit me hard. Hopefully better tomorrow. Today is a bust.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 04:32:07	Don't think I can blog today. Not that daily dispatches r an imperative. Feeling like crud. Made some writing notes tho. That may be it. Ugh
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 03:07:03	@melankolyme Now THAT makes sense. The .orgs are self-hosted. Not the .coms! That's what I thought you meant! *PA still in crazy land*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 03:02:52	@melankolyme What I did was leave my Blogger blog up telling everyone they could find me @my WP blog where I am now. PA still up on Blogger
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 03:01:51	@melankolyme I'm confused. So current blog is on WP.com? WP automagically imports Blogger blogs so you don't need to keep both Cont'd.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 02:53:05	@melankolyme Oh. I may have already had u. What was the WP one, then? No need do duplicate! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-29 02:30:28	@melankolyme No clue u had a blog. Well, maybe b/c you jst said u created it? Sry, still recovering from my Bipolar flipout. Will blogroll u
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 14:48:19	My Caveat as always folks: I'm not a real M.D. Don't follow what I do or say. Don't fuck w/ your meds. Any questions abt them or else e. me.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 14:34:37	Oops. That would be: Dr. "PA"
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 14:34:16	Time for Dr. Pa to take over... *smirk*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 14:33:17	Time for another Valium apparently? It's b.i.d. prn but no time limit. b.i.d within what? 15 minutes? Bloody hell.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 14:29:36	FUCK THIS SHIT!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 14:22:41	If u don't know what a Dysphoric Mania is you r depressed as hell bt you're so wound up that u can b a danger to yourself. I'm ok jst HURTS!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 14:16:11	*PA screaming if she had a voice*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 14:13:43	Now we have the Ultradian Dysphoric Mania. NO! Dammit! Mixed States are awful too but this DM is BAD! Meds taken plus Valium too bt sleep?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 13:39:57	Ah! Chocolate Pancakes! Perfect for every occasion!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 13:24:56	Everything's on pause. But just for a minute. *laughing* OMG. Must.Go.To.Find.Food.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 13:22:12	@EnigmaAnonymous I'm glad you liked it. When I found it, perfect. Whoever put it together did a great job.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 05:34:47	LMAO literally. Had to put on my tights as jeans have massive hole in upper thigh! Peek-a-boo PA!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 05:18:40	@AuRtist I know! At least I managed 2 map it but it took a while to realize I was more than just "tired" yesterday. Ultradian Cycling's Fun!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 05:12:58	@asdquefty Plasma is almost completely water. It still carries a bit more stuff. You'd need to "centrifuge it" to make it 100%
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 05:06:20	OMG think I got it! Domino effect: Aspie social overload depression yest. kicked off Bipolar hypomania 2day Ultradian so fast now in middle!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 04:55:26	@zippitydlicious Thx, hon.' Yes, could have bounced off each other! Damn that distance, eh? A long trip for you but I'm not going anywhere!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 04:28:38	Maybe I should take a shower. Not that showers stop cycling *rolls eyes* You see? Bipolar is completely redonculous! Spaz, spaz, spaz...
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 04:26:03	Ok I want to write. How can I try & channel this Bipolar stupidity into that! *laughing* Now despite me being all giggly, this isn't funny!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 04:15:09	Might be cycling! Oh, Happy Day! Too much stress! *twitch* *twitch* Mind racing, feeling all loopy! Giggly as all hell but don't know why!

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-28 03:23:21	@asdquefty I'm a bit concerned. I was outside and my leg was going. Always thought that was ADD but have now figured Bipolar. Con'td

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-27 02:34:05	@asdquefty I have Twitter, character issues, also. I am far too verbose. As you will see, I am even using proper punctuation. Alas, my dear.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-27 02:30:51	@asdquefty Yay for the 'za! Pizza always good! I just had a brick of a brownie for breakfast. Well, part of it. It was a brick. LOL!

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-23 12:39:41	@BearTwinsMom Sorry to hear you're having sleep problems. I know the feeling of "dread" you can experience about avoiding bed re: issues.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-23 12:35:29	@mama_kass Just looking at your recent msgs. re: your pics LOL! You're funny, girl! Crap, I gotta go to bed. I'm starting to lose it.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-23 12:30:01	@mama_kass Does my post for MP3 of the Moment qualify 4 Tuneful Tuesday? Note: Did not add hash 4 self! I could stream a new one each week!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-23 12:17:49	@Canageek You see now I can do what I wanted to via Gadget (here I am) but b4 could not! Saved Search changes. Still can not on web. PA=Bed?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-23 11:06:11	@DraculasChild You nailed me with some Wilde. I didn't even get a notification you were following me. Seems appropriate? Cheers, PA.

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-23 07:46:06	Thinking about actually cooking and eating! No, you don't understand. That is monumental progress for the bedridden invalid! *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-23 07:42:35	@catatonickid *grin* Trying to keep a straight face with all of this. I was going more for David Lynch but you know I love him! #duststorm
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-23 07:39:30	@BPDINOKC Oh, dear! Bus Manglement! Not to be confused with Bus. Management? Sorry, terrible humour to make you laugh? Hope you're ok?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-23 07:25:37	@catatonickid If only it were a "special effect!" Not very "special" at all! Hopefully things will settle soon! #duststorm
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-23 07:19:14	@catatonickid Crap. Reminds me of Cokin Filters that are actually still around! Good grief! #duststorm

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:41:11	@asdquefty Anyway, take care hon'. I am going to go to bed as I must sleep. Irresponsible not to take care of myself. OX

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:34:14	@asdquefty Well, still in process, the files aren't all downloaded yet but when all is through and through we can chat about it.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:32:58	@asdquefty Never heard of that "Name" but many, many, years ago I think I bought a bottle or something when I stocked my own wee bar.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:30:50	@asdquefty The files are all individual avi. Oh fuck it! We should just e. about it or something! Good lord!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:29:30	@asdquefty Not familiar with VLC. Never heard of it.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:29:07	@asdquefty avi sound be a huge problem to something, really now. It's just a PC file. Just convert it something!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:28:17	@asdquefty Or someone out there may be able to help? In the world...?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:27:54	@asdquefty Thanks. I also found a Mac page re: another app. that I have and they had tonnes of links for stuff to convert to blah blah so?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:25:27	@asdquefty Busy boy.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:24:24	@asdquefty I kickin' some Torrent Anime. Granted it's avi and I'm on a Mac so...erm... Not sure how that's going to "play" out but...?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:23:21	@asdquefty Wha? Teach me Oh Guru? I have Leopard but it's not winter yet.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:21:12	@asdquefty OMG! What do I have to do tomorrow? There aren't enough characters here! I think that's why I don't want to go to bed!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:20:09	@asdquefty LMAO! DROPPOTSPAZ
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:19:36	@asdquefty Oh, and I made a pretty bad joke re: our Friday night gang about a new hash. Every night!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:18:46	@asdquefty True enough. I should probably hit the sack anyway. I have so much to do tomorrow. God knows how I'll do it but...? Sleep or no?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:13:15	@asdquefty I got it from my pal so no worries. *wink*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:12:26	@cm1165 Thanks, I appreciate that so much. It's just because of this damn seizure and I can't get better! It's fucked me up! *breathe*

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:09:25	It's like something or some things have been severed! Dammit! I can't get shit out! Creative shit out because my fucking brain won't work!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 13:07:02	Why I am being am arse on Twitter. I cannot write! My brain is not working! It is killing me that I can not write!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 12:48:12	This is either the fastest way to LOSE followers or to GAIN them. Yes. I am not normally this obnoxious. I blame my possible brain injury.

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 12:21:46	I could be REALLY annoying right now and Tweet every song I am listening to as it comes up. What do you think?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 12:19:52	PA needs help. But it ain't gonna happen. Not any time soon. Nope. But being an Aspie is all good. Just the cognitive impairment. Piss off!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-21 12:17:43	PAs in full on Aspie mode. Listening to iPod with the Senns WHILE working on baby MacBook. That means, not iTunes on baby MacBook. Get it?

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 12:00:09	@Aliquant Oooh! Pretty! I was just going to say, we'd make a good team. You, design. Me, content. LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 11:58:03	@Aliquant IE is bollocks and that is why it is such as pain! Because the per centage of users is so high! Frickin' everyone uses it! Idiots!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 11:56:19	@Aliquant Yes, IDWIMIE is Classic! It's total truth. Sounds like you're better off than me. I'm all words as I write so content is my game!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 11:54:03	@Aliquant Exacatly w/ viewing in all browsers everywhere! Even my simple dumbass code kept breaking every single refresh and change!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 11:52:33	@Aliquant Gotcha. I was buggered in course as they were all using PCs and I'm on a Mac! Anyway, I suck at design. I'm all content, baby!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 11:51:33	@Aliquant Oops. Missed part of the acronym but you get it. "Internet Explorer." Wee PA tired LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 11:49:24	@Aliquant It's ok you're all fixed. IDWIMIE: It Doesn't Work In Microsoft Explorer. A "Rule" in Design that makes IE a bitch.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 11:47:27	@Aliquant Ok. Do u use FF add ons for viewing etc. I took basic course & they said to. Don't know what u r using we did Dream. I suck tho!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 11:43:39	@Aliquant Cheers on that then. I can't remember dates but neither here nor there. Still, getting over things is always good. xo
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 11:42:13	@Aliquant Ah, I just saw your design message, that's why you are mad at Internet Exploder! I know bare bones XHTML (HA!) and IE is a bugger.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 11:39:36	@Aliquant To hell with Internet Exploder! Use Firefox!!!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-20 11:37:48	@Aliquant Interesting about the birthday remembrance. Well done?

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-19 12:10:30	@PGFShady You could be right! FF is "merely" a browser! I mean what are we? #LOFNOTC Without us FF would be nothing!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-19 12:07:26	@worstmark Aha! Well done with the avatar! I am impressed! Another anime fan. As per another #LOFNOTC feel free to send me recommendations.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-19 12:02:02	@worstmark Nighty night indeed. I think we #LOFNOTC crashed my browser. Just 'cause we rock so much. Even though FF is solid...

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-19 08:57:37	Well that was pointless. Maybe go for a walk? Got dressed. Out to kitchen. Stared around at nothing 4 abt 20 min. Back to Bed Rest! Ugh.

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-19 07:38:27	@asdquefty Idk. Maybe a "test" to see how I feel? Maybe being stir crazy an indication of getting better? No clue. Sometimes can be true.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-19 07:37:21	@asdquefty I've been out in my backyard having tea every day, been out w/ other ppl. Just me going out by myself. Wouldn't go far of course.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-19 07:28:36	@Canageek Awesome possum. Again, have a great time then.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-19 07:27:49	@asdquefty Girl & she plays crap music anyway lol. I'm jst going stir crazy. No, not strict stay in bed. Could go out if I feel ok? Idk.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-19 07:24:49	@Canageek W00t! Hope you have fun although I haven't been tracking this whole situation. *PA scratches head*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-19 07:19:47	Okay, I know I am supposed to stay in bed and NOT but this is torture! Help! Want.To.Leave.House.Now.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-19 07:18:21	OMG!!! Upstairs tenant! Turn OFF that Celine Dion!!! And it's some duet with some...GUY!!! (...apologies to any Celine Dion fans...)

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-18 11:33:35	You know, if I have to stay in bed non-stop for this bloody long? I can think of MUCH better reasons than being sick! Sorry, had to be said.

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-18 04:05:07	@Canageek I was just trying 2 b silly. Been a few years since I studied it as Con. Ed. when I was thinking of Nursing. Still, awful at it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-18 03:59:06	@Canageek I suck at Chemistry bt Hydrogen is kind of important. At least w/ a lot of things. Certainly w/in the molecules where it is found?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-18 02:00:43	@AuRtist Yes. Aubergine is much better than saying the boring alternative: Eggplant. You sound more sophisticated & you can also confuse ppl
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-18 01:58:13	@buttonista Cate Blanchett rocks! She could wear anything! *PA crosses eyes thinking of Cate*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-18 01:56:21	@AuRtist Eggplant? WTF? Just be cool and say: "Aubergine!"
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-18 01:51:48	@aspieteach LOL! Yes I have thought that way. But then I get tangential & think about that thought. Then I think how much I procrastinate 2!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-18 01:47:58	@Canageek Thanks sweetie! I am altruistic too. I want to "fix the entire world!!!"
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-18 01:47:10	@Canageek No rush. Whenever you have time.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 10:51:46	@Canageek *hugs back*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 10:50:35	@Canageek Sweet dreams. I am going to bed now too. Last temperature check for the day! *shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 10:10:07	@BearTwinsMom Thanks hon.'
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 10:07:19	@MarcyRubin Thanks. It would be another little something to add to my itty bitty bio./portfolio LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 10:02:45	@MarcyRubin Good abt that publishing opportunity. Maybe I can score a goal with that one too? Get it? Goal? I know, terrible pun 4 a writer.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 08:05:16	@Canageek I love it! Awesome panel! That put a smile on my tired wee face. Also, you're good lookin' I say go for the Man-scara! *smiles*

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:59:34	@Acrimonia I wear glasses that give me fab peripheral vision. I wonder how that will help me? With any of my dx's! I used 2 wear contacts 2
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:55:15	@BearTwinsMom Ah, yes along w/ the "model" & "researching" & general geekiness overall, toss it in a big salad bowl & you get: Aspie! W00t!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:51:44	@BearTwinsMom Thx 4 the compliment re: my "Researcher's Mind." I came up w/ a very basic model 2 demonstrate/prove my new symptoms actually.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:44:44	@BearTwinsMom A book's worth of questions? Surely, you jest. I have a book's worth of ANSWERS for my Neuro! *laughing so hard*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:43:42	@BearTwinsMom *hugs*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:41:33	@BearTwinsMom I fully plan 2 review a boatload of stuff w/ Neuro. You would not believe how much info I have 2 discuss with him! You know me
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:40:09	@BearTwinsMom W/ that, there are v. + outcomes w/ surgery but getting a bit ahead of things! So much more. I could talk your ear off!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:37:10	@BearTwinsMom I think a lesion is doubtful. hippocampal sclerosis is v. common w/ epilepsy so that is more an issue I would say. Cont'd
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:35:16	@MarcyRubin Thanks. *grin*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:34:40	@BearTwinsMom Not to mention still have VEEG coming up whenever but that may not capture a thing anyway! Both Neuro and I doubt it.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:33:41	@BearTwinsMom however, it's mentioned in the literature! I'm fine, sure. Still I think prudent for MRI anyway re: hippocampal sclerosis or ?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:31:34	@BearTwinsMom OMG. Me too. This is nuts though. If you read my blog and what I've researched, it's a mess! I'm not saying a lesion cont'd
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:29:16	@MarcyRubin "Thank you, thank you...you really like me!!!" *laughing* "But really...I couldn't have done it without you all..."
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:28:01	@BearTwinsMom My Neuro's orders are bed rest until Monday for assessment and that will be almost three weeks from the tonic-clonic itself.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:26:40	@BearTwinsMom LMAO! It's not so famous. Just me finding the post-"ick"tal energy to open a damn can of it and heat it up. Cont'd...
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:24:31	@MarcyRubin If only...I am all on my own. I could call the television?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:23:52	"Ladies and Gentlemen, she did it! PA MADE HER SOUP!!!" *...the crowd goes wild...*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:10:24	*PA takes deep breath in preparation to walk to kitchen to open can and heat up soup* ...pause...oh wait. I have to add crackers. *sigh* lol
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:07:27	@CalliCoop Good point. Like I said, how ridiculous? Energy to just open it? LOL! I have a microwave so that's a quick way to heat it up.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 07:05:56	@MarcyRubin Thanks for the soup. Oh, if only I could be (more) mobile! I wish! This seizure has really made a mess of me. Blah!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 06:58:16	Can someone come feed me, please? This is ridiculous. I'm trying to find the energy to open a can of soup. Why did you do this to me brain?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 05:40:27	Re: The neurology sex stuff that I mentioned, can't post link as it's a BMJ article. Everyone would have to sign up! Email me if you care.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 05:34:56	@NataliaAntonova I won't call you on your pun there re: writing sex scenes. Well, I kind of just did by writing this. *smirk*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 05:21:54	Wow! Coolness about brain damage, neurosurgery, epilepsy and sexual behaviour! W00t! I know, only me. A neurological pervert? *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 05:14:03	@NataliaAntonova Fab! I'll need to shop for the entire outfit and shoes. Haven't done formal in...? Ah, we'll work it out! *wink*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 05:09:38	@NataliaAntonova Screw the pumps! We'll both wear heels if it's formal wear? A nice set of heels will go much better w/ loud, crazy music?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 04:08:00	Ugh. If I wasn't so damn sick and cognitively impaired this would be the perfect time to write! Can't leave bed! Can't leave house! GRRR!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-17 04:01:28	@NataliaAntonova That sounds like a great "road trip!" *laughing* Would have loved to have joined you.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-16 09:11:56	@zippitydlicious Isn't that just how politics works, though? Or maybe I'm missing something? *smirk*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-16 08:22:48	@Canageek Thx, glad u liked. MP3 of the Moment has been my "baby" ever since I started bt now even better as blog pal lets me ftp up W00t!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-16 08:17:34	@Canageek Go to my blog and it's on the innermost right sidebar. Called MP3 of the Moment. Blue song w/ rollover. Click it and you're away.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-16 08:15:59	@Canageek I mean, the song isn't all sunshine and happiness (barf) but I don't think(?) it will depress you? Maybe get your toes tappin'?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-16 08:14:36	@Canageek It's uptempo. Has a good groove?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-16 08:14:13	@Canageek Yes? My MP3 as a distraction?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-16 08:13:35	@Canageek Go to my blog and listen to the new MP3 I just streamed? That might help for several minutes? Maybe? *hugs*

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-15 09:55:48	Ok, taken meds, right ones I think? Kidding! Must rest to repeat everything that happened today and hope it works out tomorrow. Please...?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-15 09:24:52	@Canageek Oh, no! It's alright! No 1 else can measure another's pain. True, we may feel ours less significant bt not really? Pain is pain.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-15 09:21:37	@mama_kass Yes, it is very tragic. And I don't need any special day to engage in profane speech. That may seem rather tragic as well.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-15 09:17:14	@Canageek You are hilarious. However, it is NOT a contest between whose misery is worst! WE ARE ALL IN PAIN!!! Says "Tsarina Seizurella!"
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-15 09:13:02	Why did I just apologize to the Twitter world that I said: "...that fucking sucks." I swear like crazy on my blog. I am seriously ill.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-15 09:10:34	@mama_kass Now that fucking sucks. I don't follow celebs but I really liked her. Oh, sorry. I swore.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-15 08:44:31	@Canageek I sure as hell hope not! Sick from tonic-clonic bt something VERY wrong. First t-c bt have been sick 4 abt 2 wks. See blog 4 more?
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-15 08:31:23	@Canageek Sounds fun to the invalid, housebound Patient Anonymous! Let me know what you buy!

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-02 04:29:28	@asdquefty That stinks! I had a good one up until I was fairly young and then went to this one guy and he was...idk, mediocre at best?

16253011	patientanon	2009-09-02 04:05:56	LMAO re: gmail! it's hanging after log in!!! Spoke too soon about me back online. *PA shakes head*
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-02 04:04:27	@AuRtist Well, gmail is good but I've had drops for no apparent reason at all. Nothing is perfect and humans built it so all the more so!
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-02 04:03:17	@AuRtist I'm back up now. 502 is just traffic overload.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-02 04:02:39	@AuRtist Don't worry. A 502 is just a server unavailable.
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-02 04:02:10	@AuRtist Nope. at first I thought it was DSL--which it was so reboot but then gmail started giving 502's after it stayed frozen/dropped
16253011	patientanon	2009-09-02 03:59:55	gmail is sucking with endless 502 errors...at least for me.

16253011	patientanon	2009-08-29 11:19:41	It's the downstairs tenant too. The upstairs tenant doesn't have a boyfriend. I think the guy downstairs has a girlfriend. That was weird.
16253011	patientanon	2009-08-29 11:18:15	I think it's sex. Not a seizure. And I think they're done...wait...they have music on too... *laughing* No! I'm not kidding!

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 08:45:41	@asdquefty Compelling? Overwhelming!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 08:19:18	@JNH77 Oh, I know allergies! Trust me! Even had to get shots as a kid. Sometimes not so bad now but...? Idk. Just have to wait for seasons.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 07:59:29	OMG. I just came home and feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone. And now I'm on Twitter? That is at least one definition of self-torture.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 07:56:25	@JNH77 Okay good. Well, not goood but at least not really, super bad!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 07:53:56	@JNH77 I tried to send a msg when remote but everything was sucking. Hope you're okay.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 07:52:40	@zippitydlicious Went to one, been in the scene. Lots of stories. Mostly partying as in Bipolar heyday but "personal" stuff too *gasp*
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 07:50:12	@archkittens What did you do to me? Do I need to check your blog???
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 07:49:43	@aspieteach I've had strobe during reg. EEG and hypervent. Take out food LOL! Did that at a psych stay once. Indeed. Buy some warm flannels.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 07:47:27	@BPDINOKC Nuts, eh? Although we had a bit of fun in the comments section when I posted about it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 06:57:00	La la la...battery vs. Twitter problems!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 06:18:29	@AnnyStrider I know & u r entitled 2 feel that way. I understand. We hate 2 hear, oh, will gt betr when we feel shit. Just b gentle w/ self.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 06:10:33	@aspieteach Indeed you feel all ACK! They lower your meds and get you flippy. I seriously doubt they'll get me to seize tho. Find nothing.

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 05:45:39	@aspieteach Still wrkng on my ADD so reading in small bits & books of interest, nothing 2 heavy. But will bring some. Stupid ADD too! Ha ha.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 05:41:39	@BPDINOKC My best search was how does a woman masturbate with a gourd? I have no clue how that made it into my search terms LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 05:39:27	@aspieteach Oh, I was going to say too when bring own clothes, not so much over your head stuff as it will mess with electrodes?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 05:37:31	@archkittens Now for a public flogging on Twitter! You are a bum! This Twitter Member wrote a post about me! *laughing so hard* So sweet tho
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 05:32:06	Twitter looks so quiet because I can't see anything LMAO. Well some is coming up?

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 05:24:37	@asdquefty @aspieteach MRIs suck because they are SO loud. They give you earplugs but make no diff. And they last for maybe 30-45 min.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 05:23:18	@aspieteach Nope, he said I could bring my laptop as I asked about Internet and he said he didn't know. So, yes...at least DVDs etc...
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 05:22:08	Oh, Twitter was fucked but now okay so I may be coming up. Shut down Firefox too for more power?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-12 05:20:40	I did some writing though? Maybe a blog post for later?

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-11 04:07:54	@zippitydlicious Groovy. I'm up for that, Post-ictal or not! Just keep bouncing our updates back and fourth online. Or screenplay?

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-11 03:57:41	Oh, and hi folks. Pretty screwy in head due to Post-ictal ick but I'm back after a coupla days. Moving at a snail's pace though. Of course.

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:36:35	Ok everyone. Battery dying so gotta go!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:36:08	@asdquefty You and I r treating Twitter as chat. People r going 2 hate us. But we lack social skills and r stupid so they may take pity ha?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:33:57	@asdquefty Yes, just a taste for what you are drinking. And shit...I was in the middle of another Tweet. You will laugh.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:29:48	@asdquefty Wha? The bevvies? No, a proper pour. You just have to enjoy the taste. Have the palate for it.

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:22:18	@asdquefty I'm neat, no ice. Beautifully pure as they both are, whisky and vodka. Enjoy them in their delicious simplicity yet complexity.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:18:46	What am I doing? Watching my battery and right now what is spinning is Junior Boys. Love 'em!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:15:34	@asdquefty I love whisky and my Vodka of choice is Stoli.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:14:38	@asdquefty You have to recall my "narrowed field of interest" though and I am a compulsive list maker as well. Yes, Dr. PA?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:12:47	@asdquefty I am a beer connoisseur. I love imported beer from other countries!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:07:12	@asdquefty I could send you the Word .doc that I gave to Merlin #1 that outlines everything that I could put together re: my "Aspie Profile"
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:04:38	Oh, bad typing there. It's not the beer, I swear! *wink*
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 13:03:57	@asdquefty Plus my other comorbidities so a few years ago after getting to know some other Aspies , all of my past, it all just hit & fit.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 12:59:31	@asdquefty There were there were a lot of things like that & more that I didn't get until adulthood because I didn't understand...cont'd...
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 12:47:03	@asdquefty Well it's a long story about my "Aspie Awakening!" Or even what led up to it. Impossible to Tweet about it!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 12:39:24	@asdquefty Well, banging my head w/ a metal pole when I was a kid & couldn't communicate was one thing that said: Spectrum? But we can talk.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 12:36:41	@unsuicide Excellent. I am not a professional but I volunteered at a Distress Centre so I know how important that work is.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 12:29:09	@BPDINOKC That is so fucking cool! Way to go you! Will you send it to me? I wrote a story for a paper recently about me having Epilepsy.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 12:25:10	@zippitydlicious Sry missed this w/ tech hell. Interesting concept. We c/sh/ould talk more? Idk. E. me if u want? I am new to dx bt know obv

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 12:11:25	@asdquefty That's kind of foreign speak to me but I've worked on PCs at work for years. Always wanted a "pretty" Mac though.

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 11:48:43	@asdquefty Yes, that's the thing. Leopard just sources the unsecured for me automagically and that is how I do it.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 11:39:28	@asdquefty Go for it. As far as it being quiet, it might be the "Mentally Deranged Weather" here too? LOL

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 10:51:03	W00t! My "cone" is at full bars! Do I dare try more or am I pushing things too far? Well, I am guilty of doing that. *PA hangs head*
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 10:47:20	This is positively ridiculous! If I keep staying here trying to get things to work I'm going to get positively shitfaced! *laughing so hard*
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 10:31:35	@emilymjarvis That's great. Also great is finally seeing you. I was wondering when I'd get the chance. *grin*
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 10:26:19	@archkittens Well right now for sure. And may have spoken too soon about blog? Trying to log in now...uh oh... *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 10:22:09	Okay, gmail is loading slooooowwwwlllllyyyy...maybe? I am so fixated and will not let go of some things!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 10:17:22	@zippitydlicious You got it! Just disappear and ignore it all. Sensory thing for me too. Overload.

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 10:14:11	@asdquefty W00t! Blog is up! This unsecured here is always a bit dodgy. Going to try to make a post bt still cant see just abt all of Deck!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 09:53:42	I'm here but connection is sooo slow & the Deck is FUBAR I can't see anything LMAO! No, nothing is here! My blog may come up someday? gmail?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:51:52	Okay folks, I'll try to get back online...and try to do so to keep applying for jobs (and to escape the upstairs tenant who is bugging me!)
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:50:56	@zippitydlicious Yeah, I hear you.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:49:02	Okay enough of the combo talk of impulsivity and pubs! Laters and I'll try to get online! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:47:46	@asdquefty Oh, you don't know but I Borg myself up with headphones and baby MacBook and shut out the world so it's okay. Ignore everyone.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:47:05	@asdquefty Depends. Several in area. Only 1 seems (barely) to give decent wifi (free) anymore. Maybe go there 2 try & stay online.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:44:35	@asdquefty Oh, I know. We all have our own way of being total spazzes. It's okay. Maybe I'm too uptight about the whole thing anyway?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:43:38	@asdquefty So undo all that business you did and get your ass back on the regular board and that, okay?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:42:24	@asdquefty I know, I need a fucking drink! LMAO! No, I seriously do! Might be time to head off to the pub soon...?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:41:38	@asdquefty And if you are happy, I'm glad you're happy! *grin*
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:40:52	@asdquefty That's fine, honey. I know. I do too so I understand. I just don't want you to have a flip out over this. It's okay, it's done xo
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:40:00	@zippitydlicious I'm a total instigator and a brat! However, some have told me that is endearing?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:38:56	@asdquefty Hey, hey...only do that if you want to, okay? It was just a little innocent thing. Just relax okay. xo
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:37:18	@zippitydlicious Interesting. Idk what's happening where I am. Jobs seem to (maybe?) popping up more however I think it's rather competition
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:35:25	@asdquefty And you're cute about the silly sex comment *rolls eyes* That is my stock response though.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:34:50	@asdquefty No, no! You don't have to shut up! It's just easy to get carried away and forget. Like I said, it's happened on some blogs.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:34:04	@asdquefty Thanks. It's happened twice before via blogs which is okay but please not the entire world of fucking Twitter! Jesus!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:30:41	@asdquefty Erm...can you delete that in anyway? Also are you on the timeline?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:29:28	@zippitydlicious To move anywhere I would still need to secure employment. Hi, how do I pay for things?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:28:58	@zippitydlicious Just teasing. PA terrible! I used 2 flirt a lot on my blog! I CAN NOT do it on Twitter LOL! PA no flirt these days anyway
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:25:19	@asdquefty I'm on my personal account as I'm trying to apply/look for jobs etc... so no. Sorry.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:20:56	@asdquefty There was a program I looked into w/ stoopid guvmunt but not as great as it seemed...nix!

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:15:57	@asdquefty I'd be clueless wherever I lived. Hell, I'm clueless here!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:14:50	@zippitydlicious Long social is draining. Structure is good for me. Sex? I've never had any complaints! So, I'm okay? *laughing so hard now*
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:12:30	@blueberrio Oh, I forgot to say thanks. Everyone is talking to me at once and in typical Aspie fashion I can't follow what's happening haha.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:11:18	@zippitydlicious Well, only my cover letter and resume. I didn't get a bounce or anything and they are looking for other positions.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:10:31	@aspieteach I'm kind of scared to leave my homeland...unless I know for damn sure there's something good on the other end!!!

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:05:05	@asdquefty You know, hard to get in and the pay is shite.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:04:41	Maybe I should just move away and teach ESL in some foreign country? Sure, for someone who has communication issues HAHA!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:02:08	@asdquefty I told you, I'm the human ice cube! I would die in the winter!!! Although my mentally deranged hat is nice and warm LMAO!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 08:00:33	@aspieteach ...then some strange behaviour and then took taxi home (I was alone on public transit.)
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 07:59:47	@aspieteach Well, date today? May have had CPS on March 30 but you lose consciousness so I can't tell 4 sure! A bit of a blackout then...
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 07:58:04	Of course I was stupid though & did wrong search and it's way too wide. Some jobs making me laugh though! Could never do them! Like a Baker?

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 07:48:58	@asdquefty Well I have to research for my "non-negotiables" so I need websites or at least addresses! I don't drive for one thing!

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 03:56:58	@BearTwinsMom Well, no doubt. I've been on some meds over the years when it's been intolerable, so bye bye!

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 03:34:24	I love the Twitter question: "What are you doing?" Indeed. Just what the hell AM I doing? Eternal question of my life!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 03:33:03	@BearTwinsMom Give them a ring and say what's up? Gimme my damn drugs! I'm a bloody, pill poppin' junkie! *laughing*

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 03:27:37	@aspieteach When you don't know how to choose between it or crying? Oh, bother... No you have to laugh. My life is too ridiculous not to.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 03:22:29	OMG WP is being ridiculous, too! This is a bad day. Nothing is working out! *laughing*
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 03:10:42	@aspieteach Not bad.. Some stoopid guvmunt cock ups first thing. Will be in blog post I guess
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 03:06:57	@blueberrio Indeed cancer does and glad you don't have. Hope someone else you know doesn't have too?

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 02:56:54	@SparklingAmber That's ok, I'm gay & get crushes on straight women. It's all good, fun & healthy. Once I am in love tho, eyes 4 no one else!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-08 02:55:03	Hello Twitterland...stuff coming up later. However, I think I need to nuke wrongplanet. I have no interest in fora business.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-07 04:13:50	Okay, now I'm going to (try and) sign out. For a bit. Gah.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-07 04:11:48	Oops. I said I was going to sign out but W00t! My first Twitter Splogger! I'm surprised it took this long! *rolls eyes*
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-07 04:07:45	@archkittens That's good...I'm trying to get the meaning...hmmm...

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-07 01:33:08	@scottgladstone Depends how you look at it re: ADD and IBS. They have been given names as diagnoses.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-07 01:30:45	@asdquefty Has 2 do w/ "Ancient Etymology" basically. "X" is adjective in most simplistic terms. Knew this but bugger 2 get it perfect!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:40:50	@asdquefty You too dear. xo
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:40:30	@asdquefty Fair enough but again, always remember that every med and every head is different. I don't know all of your sx and am not a MD
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:39:33	Well Folks, time for wee PA to have a lie down & then get some sleep? I need to straighten the rudder and raise another sail tomorrow.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:34:39	@asdquefty Nothing makes me happier than to hear when ppl get on the "right" meds and achieve good results. Excellent.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:29:18	@asdquefty Well, apply the KISS rule? If it's working for you; it's working for you? Again, completely fabbo!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:27:03	@asdquefty Yes, grasshopper...I am training you well. Either that or creating a monster OMG! LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:26:07	Oh, anyone else reading re: blogrolling...I need to do more probably...you might find yourself there at some point...I'm slow.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:25:06	@asdquefty 98% That's great. Pseudo is in cold medications though, right? Different usage.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:24:32	@asdquefty Those down't sound pleasant. Waking up could be migraines--can wake you. And I am geek too re: meds. You have seen my blog?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:23:29	@Roseshouse Oh, my pleasure and indeed, had to give you a Blogroll.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:22:53	@Roseshouse Well, tomorrow is another day. Let's hope that the "brain fairy" will return us our cerebellums? Cerebelluae? LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:21:10	@asdquefty Gotcha. Well, I could always take Pseudoephed. 4 yrs. then a few ago, auditory hallucinations. Contraind. 4 some w/ Bipolar.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:19:20	@asdquefty Oh yes, if you have a headache...well...uh, yeah.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:18:21	@Roseshouse Vanished? Like my brain? Again, good to see you here.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:17:43	@asdquefty Can't recall the diff. between Paracet. and Acet. but there is difference I believe. Still, maybe just another sensitivity.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:15:30	@BPDINOKC Ewww...cold Taco Hell! LOL I'd still eat it too because...well, I need to eat period.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:14:41	@asdquefty Some ppl just have bio clocks, some are screwed. I never was as bad as I am now from years ago. W/o meds, PA never sleepies!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:12:47	@BPDINOKC Taco Hell? Hey, at least it's cheap? Or it was the last time I ate it.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:11:01	Thanks, dear and you too. I'm so gone & stressed, just took a Valium as an "Appetizer" be4 my "Main Course" of sleep meds. Chronic Insomnia.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:08:41	@asdquefty You could have a sensitivity w/ those. Lots do. I could look into ingred. and maybe REM sleep cycles? Maybe something there?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:03:35	Better? Complex? Screwed? Dream could be representative. I am getting a few more snippets but I think it is due to my anxiety too!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 09:01:56	@asdquefty Not too much on 2day just feeling bad. I'll save it for my post tomorrow? Tho, can't change things. Sry abt sleep better 2night?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 08:53:06	@asdquefty Oh and you? How rude of me not to ask...
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 08:52:31	@asdquefty Not much fucking knackered LOL. Probably take meds soon and maybe read for a bit? My head is starting to droop...

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 07:56:44	@JNH77 What a coincidence! Yes, it's hard. Maybe you can only show your true crazy to another? I've had some good NTs that have understood.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-06 07:21:33	@zippitydlicious It's like that ancient joke where you call and they put you on hold...bah-dump-bump!

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-01 03:12:20	@Aspie101 Interesting thought re: nightmares. I so rarely remember my dreams. Hardly ever! So what does that mean LOL!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-01 03:10:11	@moritherapy "Should." Indeed. Just "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" and all of that re: Depression etc... could go on and on.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-01 03:08:05	@moritherapy It was nice to read that. I re-connected with half of a great couple after a long time (knew thru my ex) and maybe will visit?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-01 03:04:55	@marissa_miller At least you are poetically speaking to your insomnia? Perchance then, dost wicked beast shall allay!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-01 02:59:00	Oh dear, I'm getting "hot pants!" Everything is as it should be. There is only one person on this planet that knows what I am talking about.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-01 02:57:19	@catatonickid It will just be your tummy saying "Om..." Sorry, that was a pathetic joke. Don't worry, even the monks and nuns got hungry!
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-01 02:47:42	@aspieteach SHIT! I argued w/ friend re this as I hadn't seen anything but ding! Plus, I didn't have an ED per se but I would qualify here?
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-01 02:43:16	@nataliaantonova I'm such an idiot but I love it when I see people typing in different characters/languages. So cool.
16253011	patientanon	2009-04-01 02:41:38	@nataliaantonova Not much! It's my favourite season.

16253011	patientanon	2009-04-01 02:31:33	@asdquefty That's funny abt less Twit #'s. Me too as so confusing for me to follow all of this and that! My brain can't take it! *laughing*

16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 10:25:17	@asdquefty Yes. I am kind of a mess. Apart from today a lot of stress from other things. Again, you are so kind 4 looking out for me. *wink*
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 10:11:18	@asdquefty You are so sweet: "mostly the patient sort." I still owe you an e. reply. I suck. I suck more as I should probably lie down?

16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 09:56:52	@catatonickid Ok.

16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 09:47:03	@asdquefty It's also so much more--hence the need for a proper post.
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 09:46:39	@asdquefty Well, only half hour but most abt. Asperger's of course. So, yes, dx confirmed but dredging up childhood to present, not pretty.
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 09:42:51	@asdquefty Got dx as last Twit. I am dusted. Went well but...my brain is so fucked.
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 09:40:09	@asdquefty Thanks, I am so flattered.
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 09:34:23	It's "official!" Got the dx as an Aspie! Will make post but session exhausting and my brain still trying to deal.
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 01:29:31	Oh, crap. Time to get a move on for my appt.! Laters!
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 01:25:33	@catatonickid I'm thoroughly impressed by what 1 can read via Twitter & "destructive asses?" *laughing* No offense! Just thought msg funny.
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 01:20:37	@DavidKyle That is pretty funny. I still see the ads on TV with a 1-800#And they do kind of look like fleece, monks robes, don't u think?
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 01:14:11	@aspieteach Well, you have to dig so far in research and then you can bend stats like toffee. Still... *shrug* Better than blank paper?

16253011	patientanon	2009-03-31 00:22:51	Hi...morning/afternoon etc... everyfolks/one/people... I just woke up as you may have gathered. Body is moving; brain is not.
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-30 11:12:17	Okay, night Twitter Friends. Meds ingested and appt. tomorrow to move on with the Asperger's jazz. Take care, PA.
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-30 10:49:50	And further...I like the fact that I now have lots of pretty square avatars/icons that I can look at now. I only had so few before...LOL
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-30 10:44:54	@gomar3720 You are so fucking funny! No, I'm just overwhelmed because I'm a Twitter loser. Keep getting emails...Boing! Oh...hi!
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-30 10:41:10	@aspieteach Hi, nice to meet. Yes, the stats vary and I believe presentation 2 but I need to do more solid research. Like ADD Inn. Att Type
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-30 10:38:49	@asdquefty Looked at an option that seemed good but not so.
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-30 10:31:53	Man, I'm picking up followers like bees to honey LOL! I actually feel like people like me? PA has sense of humour but still, too much!
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-30 10:28:32	@asdquefty Yes,hard. Not just being socially ridiculous but I have so much trauma too...well, all tied together? It's all one big puzzle.
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-30 10:23:33	@asdquefty I got laid off from my job about a year ago and still haven't found work. *PA so upset* No, it's bad but still trying.

16253011	patientanon	2009-03-29 23:48:23	@asdquefty Oh, btw will get to your e. later as am going out in a bit okay?
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-29 23:45:43	Further, Dyscalculia common overlap for Asperger's. I have Dysgraphia too and it is common overlap as well.
16253011	patientanon	2009-03-29 23:44:18	@asdquefty Hi. Making pres. 4 my sis'. Can't do math. 99% sure I have Dyscalculia LOL. No, really. Just see mess of stuff! No sense of it.
