284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-11 20:29:01	Part of me hopes they can't find a vein today. I'm so not in the mood for the dentist or you know, people.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-10 03:31:33	I'm not crying, you're crying. Shut up.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-10 02:26:12	Sleep is for the weak! (I'm gonna crash so fucking hard later)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-09 21:49:37	When your hands are so cold you don't wanna touch your own skin
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-09 20:07:01	6 folders of gifs sorted through, 5 more to go but first...sleep.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-08 18:38:35	I do not wish to be thought of as cute or sexy or even beautiful, I'd rather be thought of as wonderfully weird.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-07 22:13:31	That annoying side effect that blurs your vision so much you can't stitch any projects. Fuck! I have deadlines, damn it!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-07 20:15:52	So happy I went to church. Very enlightening, uplifting and fulfilling. Hoping I can go again next week. God is good
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-07 00:29:11	@tinyarmyofqueer knew you'd appreciate this one
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-07 00:28:56	@tinyarmyofqueer oh, it's about you lol it was a random thought I had.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-07 00:24:50	If I can keep this up I might have this page of my @AADaddario cross stitch done by the middle of next week pic.twitter.com/GDttAOfyuk
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-07 00:23:35	@NormalIsOutTher @BipolarUs I like hypomania so long as it's not combined with anything else. I'm so productive when hypomanic.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-07 00:21:40	"My inner artist is an asshole."
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-06 21:51:42	So excited!!! Booked tickets to go see @simpleplan with my best mate. I can't wait!!! Last time I "saw" them I was blind, not this time!!!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-06 17:19:24	Working on my @AADaddario cross stitch and I can actually see it coming together. Can't wait until I work on the top half, a while off yet.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-05 19:28:19	3 hours sleep after being awake for 50 hours is not the one
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-05 05:12:50	@AADaddario cross stitch slowly coming along pic.twitter.com/wTvjS9QseO
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-05 03:44:56	So glad I thought to bring her bear with me. All I wanna do is cuddle up with it and just be.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-02 19:31:35	Cold, tired and in pain. I think it's safe to say today already sucks.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-02 13:57:19	@tinyarmyofqueer no. No scheduling. Just a "we should". All other stuff, the who, when, how, why can wait until sleep has been obtained.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-02 13:55:55	That moment when you realised that your communication started off as one thing and is now multi-platform. Tumblr Kik Skype Twitter. Oops?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-02 13:52:03	@tinyarmyofqueer true and I inflict pain back haha oh God, I didn't mean now. Pain should be scheduled after I've survived the dentist.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-02 13:49:43	@tinyarmyofqueer you inflict pain on the characters who in turn inflict pain on me. We need to schedule some pain
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-02 12:23:38	Finally finished @AADaddario shirt! pic.twitter.com/Fd9wRuB2eH
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-02 12:22:06	As you should https:// twitter.com/tinyarmyofquee r/status/694373025987297280 …
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-02 12:12:22	Eating Oreos at four in the morning like a cool kid. I blame @tinyarmyofqueer for this
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-02 00:25:16	Seriously contemplating faking my own death, just so I can get some fucking peace and quiet. Why won't people leave me the fuck alone?!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-02-01 20:04:21	3.5 hours sleep, woke up to discover pup has eaten my iPhone cable and had to spend £22 on a new one. Not the best start to the day.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-31 23:44:05	Al post finished @AADaddario shirt, just a few odd stitches here and there, then on to skin for a bit pic.twitter.com/TfOXSVZ2n8
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-31 20:38:47	Dying of a heart attack cos my mum's a dickhead and let my baby out of the house without even fucking realising! Idiot woman!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-31 19:08:44	I seriously need new knees. I'm too young for this crap!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-31 15:39:46	I miss you
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-30 13:55:32	Actually made some progress on my @AADaddario cross stitch. Hope I can do more after I've had some sleep. pic.twitter.com/zmD3A0alUY
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-30 06:27:38	Seriously thinking of stitching @shaymitch next but first I must finish @AADaddario I need more hands...and threads and aida...oh dear
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-28 19:08:42	Ever get those moments where you're just thankful?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-27 20:09:20	Happiness is a toasty bed. If anyone wakes me before 5pm I may actually kill them...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-27 19:51:03	Almost finished the pattern part of @AADaddario shirt pic.twitter.com/tH7Ftd70rN
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-27 04:37:22	So much for half hour. Oh well, I'm up and moving now. Time to clean try fluffbutt! And maybe sneak in some snuggles with her.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-27 03:39:55	Half hour to let my brain decide if it's going to work or not, then clean Bailey and try stitching. I will stitch tonight. I'm determined.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-25 22:30:48	I feel like it's time for an "accidental" nap
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-24 15:40:55	Nobody tells you just how badly antipsychotics will kick your ass. The price of mental stability is a sucky one. I feel truly awful
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-24 15:36:34	A little progress on @AADaddario I feel this is going to take forever if I don't start feeling better soon *sigh* pic.twitter.com/TDkplvaE3u
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-24 04:35:26	It's a I feel like I'm annoying everyone even though I've done nothing wrong kinda day. This headache isn't helping either. Meh.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-23 12:52:57	I don't get much say during psychotic episodes. I hear and see all kinds of shit. But every time I pray that she is one of the things I see.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-23 11:37:28	I think I can see the rest of @AADaddario necklace coming together. #crossstitch is slowly getting there pic.twitter.com/lQL32J9iUV
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-23 11:33:14	Really should do the things I said I'd be doing but I seem to be having a what's the point of anything crisis *sigh* what is the point?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-20 13:59:39	My head feels like a nuclear bomb went off in it and is now filled with worms. I'm gonna feel like such a dick tomorrow. Shoot me now.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-20 10:30:36	I can hear you. I can hear all of you. Shut up! Shutupshutupshutupshutupshutupshutupshutupshutupshutupshytupshutupshutupshutupshutupshutup
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-19 14:55:08	Slowly beginning to realise that I may have to do the thing I really didn't want to do and it's beginning to bum me out. Suck it buttercup.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-18 14:37:12	Well, I haven't had that kind of bad thought in a while. It's a tiny bit scary. Must focus on things I have planned. Not gonna quit.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-18 00:16:13	ERROR: This person is currently out of service.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-15 10:14:14	Page 1 of my @AADaddario cross stitch is done and I can already see it coming together. 1 down, 5 to go! pic.twitter.com/xziuoKqfEZ
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-14 14:26:48	One colour left and then the first page of my @AADaddario cross stitch is finished! pic.twitter.com/3dbcDbmAHg
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-14 11:26:42	The difference between Brits and Yanks, Yanks will finger pillows at 2:30 in the morning.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-13 09:20:17	Going into hiding to avoid PLL spoilers cos Netflix UK hasn't got the episode up yet no cross stitch updates until I've watched it. Bye!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-11 08:22:49	@AADaddario then they're not the kind of friend you need in your life. A real friend would put on their onesie to go out with you lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-10 05:16:53	2 hours and 44 minutes. I can make it that long. Yep.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-09 09:21:56	My @AADaddario cross stitch would go a lot faster if I wasn't feeling so crappy. Time to try sleep it off. pic.twitter.com/APJrieEX3S
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-08 07:09:04	@PLLTVSeries the UK is stupid. We have to wait an extra day! that's a whole day of running away from spoilers! No fun.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-04 04:27:16	Alcohol is not the answer but it tastes good and makes for a good temporary band aid. bottoms up! #gonnaregretthis
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-04 02:35:56	@AADaddario feel sorry for everyone delayed but slightly amused by the constant updates about @United I feel this makes me a bad person oops
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-03 22:44:25	Last year I stitched @ddlovato possibly my biggest project so far. 60,000+ stitches or something like that. Insane! pic.twitter.com/G8shLqxYfE
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-03 12:40:11	Officially started @AADaddario project last night. Had to stop cos of a killer headache though pic.twitter.com/n9mbm9T4sy
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-03 01:36:08	I'm such a dick sometimes. One day I'll learn to shut up.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2016-01-03 01:35:26	@SarahMillican75 no idea, but I don't recommend dipping cake in it.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-18 06:17:42	I am on the receiving end of some major bunny loving right now. Love my little Bailey Boo so much Bestest bunny ever! pic.twitter.com/ps3Y1v4NLD
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-16 22:43:51	Thanks for watching as I fall.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-15 09:54:48	I seem to have an addiction to crisp sandwiches...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-15 09:38:20	@the_awesumtwin if you do, you best link me!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-15 06:01:59	I'm over this being single crap. I'm in a good place, possibly best I've ever been. Time to get out and start enjoying life.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-15 02:49:09	I think this was quite possibly my favourite song at the concert. ♫ Criminal by @Eminem — https:// path.com/p/ia3zh
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-15 02:20:15	Walked Sasha around the lake. I'm not sure who's more knackered, her or me. Such a good walk though.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-13 11:30:20	Little Demi should be sleeping, instead she's perched high up and spying on us all. #Hipstamatic #Burke #Shilshole pic.twitter.com/tYrbZGYeb6
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-13 11:29:30	My bunny. I'd be lost without this little fluff butt. #Hipstamatic #Burke #Shilshole pic.twitter.com/mhfxqGHF1y
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-13 11:28:53	"I've got my eye on you, human..." #Hipstamatic #Burke #Shilshole pic.twitter.com/wXe0AqB32K
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-13 11:22:19	All tucked in and case asleep dreaming of whatever dragons dream about. #Hipstamatic #Burke #Shilshole pic.twitter.com/J1ZysQMgls
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-13 11:21:19	New hat to add to my collection. This one came from @Eminem concert on Friday. #epic #Hipstamatic #Burke #Shilshole pic.twitter.com/C8Fa2SW9lw
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-13 11:19:47	Look at that face and tell me Elliott's not cute, I dare you! #Hipstamatic #RayMarkII #Irom2000 pic.twitter.com/Y9oQRmPOnc

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-13 11:15:38	Going through old photos on my phone and came across my sleeping baby girl. #Hipstamatic #Jane (null) pic.twitter.com/fyi18TSBcG
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-13 07:37:27	Ever just get hit with the thought of who your true friends are?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-13 07:36:34	I don't get people that are scared of my babies, Elliott and Demi. They're just too cute for words!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-13 04:10:52	Wish me and Col could be @Eminem tonight as well. Made that boy so happy and I wish I could see that smile again.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-12 21:32:45	After last night I feel like I'm gonna be listening to @Eminem for a while. That show was fucking amazing, never been to a show like it.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-12 02:36:50	Wembley with my one of my most favourite people to see @Eminem I keep my promises, even if it takes 9 years pic.twitter.com/2gbRK7hbtg
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-11 07:31:17	There are some people I would just love to slap and call an idiot.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-10 11:07:25	I wish I lived somewhere warmer. I need sun in my life.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-09 23:30:26	Excited to go home and watch Pretty Little Liars. #PLL100
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-09 12:27:13	And finally we crawl into bed. At half five in the morning.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-08 08:13:10	I think I've lost weight
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-06 22:19:44	@Gabry1986 thanks
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-06 22:19:11	@AusGirlyGirl thank you. Hopefully it'll be finished soon and everyone will finally get to see the whole thing.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-06 09:09:10	It's one thing to think about your ex it's another to think about your ex-wife. What the fuck is going on?!?!?!?!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-06 08:05:51	Memories suck!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-06 06:42:19	Finally picked my cross stitch back up again. @Pink now has a finished eye. Only hair left to do now. pic.twitter.com/0vJdlyEShc
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-06 02:23:24	I was the 25,907,222nd baby #bornontheNHS . Find out which number baby you were >> http:// labour.tw/1mCoxr1
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-05 21:41:18	Finally uploading the photos I took of the wedding. Really nervous about whether I got any good shots or not.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-03 05:42:51	I wonder if I should be concerned with certain things I do and if they have the potential to lead me down a bad path again but then meh!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-02 01:10:58	@DionUltear it's a predicament
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-01 23:34:34	@DionUltear I know. I've pretty much given up on the whole dating thing, although I'm not gonna take up sleeping around lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-07-01 23:27:58	@DionUltear if it makes you feel any better it's the same with lesbian dating sites.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-28 21:32:40	Twinkle's little cutie pie, Merlyn. He's such a sweetheart. pic.twitter.com/nlz4h6EcFP
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-28 05:21:05	Shooting one of my best friends from uni wedding. I'm excited and terrified all at the same time.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-28 03:26:30	Really need a new @michellebranch album!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-27 09:10:24	My @Pink cross stitch now has most of her face and no more creepy looking half eye. pic.twitter.com/wZQ6e7QvXX
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-27 03:30:06	"Really Don't Care" music video has made it even harder to decide what @ddlovato video I wanna cross stitch when I've finished @Pink
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-25 00:18:13	Sometimes I really hate the ocean. Now would be one of those times.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-24 09:06:28	Maybe I should quit taking meds. Maybe that's the key.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-23 06:27:30	When you can't make a decision on what to watch...ask daddy! lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-22 10:27:42	29,800 stitches in total. 24,530 stitches so far. 5,270 stitches left to go. My @Pink cross stitch is almost finished pic.twitter.com/AEL5Jfl49F

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-20 10:17:44	Only 675 stitches and them I'm on the last page of my @Pink cross stitch pic.twitter.com/Mqm5dP4Sxa
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-19 21:23:26	"You just don't mean enough to really mess me up" love this line so much.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-19 01:58:51	Men confuse me. Sometimes they do things that just make no damn sense whatsoever.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-18 08:39:31	My @Pink cross stitch now has lips. I have officially started work on her face. pic.twitter.com/TRPwLQOPKu
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-18 04:52:00	My photo hanging up in Middleton Hall for the college exhibition. Kinda cool. pic.twitter.com/BciYWZjtSA
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-17 09:22:02	@Pink cross stitch has seen so much progress lately. I think I've started her lips as well as the rest of her arm pic.twitter.com/SzBVZ6Kvc6

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-13 04:38:51	Really making progress with my @Pink cross stitch. I'm thinking when this ones finished I'm gonna stitch @ddlovato next.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-11 19:34:47	@jennfle thanks. I made the pattern using a program on my computer.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-11 09:21:28	My @Pink cross stitch is really getting there now. I can't wait to see it finished. pic.twitter.com/I40VkVKRUA
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-10 06:24:57	Sometimes I wonder, how do you repair friendships with people that won't even acknowledge you?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-09 03:14:20	My study buddy! Demi has a couple of mug trees on my desk and she hangs out with me while I get my study on. pic.twitter.com/eHTC0IT0Cp
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-09 00:30:39	Season 2 of @OITNB is freaking amazing! But, now I need season 3.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-05 04:39:36	Been trying to decide if I wanna shave all my hair off or dye it. I think I've finally decided to dye it purple. Tomorrow's job me thinks.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-03 14:56:05	My @Pink cross stitch is coming along nicely. pic.twitter.com/xWwpreFe41
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-02 11:32:27	Sleep is highly overrated
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-02 05:22:30	I'm on a bit of a downward spiral at the moment but having Demi fall asleep on me definitely made me smile. pic.twitter.com/SBP3JFq9XV
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-06-01 03:33:22	New favourite. #Mercy #tvtag http:// tvt.ag/1kvdWNY
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-31 09:07:49	I think...I need to ask for help but I don't know who to turn to. Everyone had expectations. They all think I'm so strong. I'm not strong.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-31 05:59:28	I do believe that Netflix is my new favourite thing.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-30 07:27:29	Anxiety is stopping me from going to London to see @ddlovato in Leicester Square. Sometimes I hate being me. I'll blame it on being broke.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-29 01:14:41	Really thought that the Paul O'Grady show was really inappropriate and inconsiderate to @ddlovato considering everything. Poor girl.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-28 09:48:51	Apparently listen to @ddlovato while I stitch means I get lots done, almost finished the punching bag on @Pink pic.twitter.com/05SuWE6369
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-28 05:28:40	The thing about recovery? Some days are harder than others.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-27 05:42:01	Not feeling so great. I do believe this means I should curl up and watch Buffy and possibly working on the baby blanket I'm knitting.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-27 05:38:59	@MCadeW they would make for some nice tattoo designs.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-24 10:15:51	Yay for triggering things. Guess I'll be having nightmares tonight then.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-24 09:09:47	@Helen_SD_Smith it really is. You should see how tall he is now. Oh to be so young again lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-24 04:37:45	@Helen_SD_Smith I know. It's so hard to believe that he's all growed up now. pic.twitter.com/qVp5Fv1H9b
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-24 01:26:49	Can't believe my baby brother is 21. Feels like only yesterday I went to the hospital to meet him in special care.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-23 03:00:57	I've got people I haven't spoken to in years as well one of my college lecturers telling me to go A&E. Hmmm... pic.twitter.com/VbsKATWinm
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-20 20:45:04	@ELPHIElicious you don't need to marry one. I'm almost certain that eventually you'll turn into one!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-19 08:04:00	Watching BtVS Once More With Feeling and remembering the much fun had singing the soundtrack on a drive with @DionUltear on many occasions.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-18 08:32:37	It was nice knowing you all. I'm iff to go die from a photoshop induced migraine. #studentproblems
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-18 03:59:00	@DionUltear I need to get a car so we can do that again! I miss that.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-17 06:08:51	Got a lot done today but still not enough. I'm wiped though so it's time to snuggle up in bed and watch Grey's Anatomy #FarewellToCristina
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-16 20:17:26	A year ago today, I went into the Campbell Centre. Never thought that this is what my life would be like. So thankful for the life I have.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-16 03:31:16	@SarahMillican75 damn! Didn't know you were gonna be somewhere I can actually get to. Oh well, maybe next time.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-14 08:01:50	Today would be kind of fitting to throw away 194 days...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-14 03:36:33	@ddlovato @Spotify ironic that Demi's Live in London playlist doesn't work in the UK lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-12 10:41:24	Play with knives.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-12 08:16:36	Can't believe it's been almost a year. It's kinda surreal. I've even made it 6 months. I'm not sure how I feel about all of this
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-11 10:44:46	The start of bad habits?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-11 10:42:30	@emmemusic @mandyknows one question...why? lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-11 06:47:38	Me thinks @ddlovato pressed a wrong button or somebody did. She was there and now it's a black screen???
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-11 05:13:47	Wish @ddlovato a happy #Demiversary and help blow out the candles! #firestarter http://www. demiversary.com

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-09 16:57:31	Stayed up all night so I could get @Eminem tickets and I succeeded! Now time to pass out
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-09 02:30:47	@LanaParrilla could you please tweet @ELPHIElicious it would mean the world to her! She's such an amazing person.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-07 05:17:02	Even with no money, my DVD collection still manages to grow. #Ihaveaproblem
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-04 05:02:53	I will not let others actions determine my own. I'm stronger than that. I am a warrior.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-03 07:25:23	183 days. Is it really worth throwing all of that away?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-03 05:29:56	It's great when people make assumptions and misinterpret what you say. It's a real great way to make you feel like shit. I give up. Fuck it.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-05-03 05:04:42	Blood, vomit and alcohol. Which order do shall they go in?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-28 10:50:06	Fire bad. Tree pretty.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-28 07:36:28	@MCadeW thanks. How are you?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-28 07:22:08	@MCadeW beautiful. Where is that? I'd love to go take photos there.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-21 08:06:06	Felt so crappy the last couple of days. I hope I'm not coming down with something.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-19 21:56:51	@emmemusic @mandyknows good luck with your race ladies

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-15 02:06:31	@soundrop can't access @ddlovato chat via Spotify, Deezer or the web link.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-14 02:17:39	@ddlovato @soundrop @Spotify it's not working
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-11 17:36:17	I may not have tickets to see @ddlovato but I still have the uber cuteness that is my little Demi pic.twitter.com/DZNglb2YUl
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-11 17:24:07	The ordering system for @ddlovato London show was utterly appalling! The websites wouldn't load, venue wouldn't sell over the phone. Stupid.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-10 04:47:10	Managed to get money together, now all I gotta do is hope and pray I can get tickets for @ddlovato on Friday.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-09 01:06:45	@ddlovato determined to find a way to be there. Not entirely sure how I'm gonna pull it off but I'm on a mission!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-08 05:08:57	Next 12 hours are gonna be long! Wanna know what the announcement is now! @ddlovato patience is a virtue I apparently lack lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-04-08 03:43:25	The famous chameleon walk! Yes, I'm a proud mama right now. I just can't get over Demi's cuteness! [pic] — https:// path.com/p/YfTaW

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-03-28 02:13:48	@DiannaAgron it's an axolotl, I've heard they're pretty easy to take care of.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-03-26 12:11:16	15 years. I miss you lil star. I wish you were here. I'd give anything to be able to hold you. I love you so much, Charlie. Always my baby.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-03-25 07:42:48	@MCadeW bumped into her and Elle the other week. Couldn't get over how grown up Haidee is or how much she looks like Elle.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-03-17 09:31:36	168 days without cutting. So close to 6 months. Just over 2 weeks away. I will make it. I'm gonna get inked if I hit 6 months.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-03-16 10:47:16	Somebody please, make it stop. Please?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-03-16 05:11:18	I can feel myself slipping. If I relapse today I won't be surprised.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-03-15 08:07:32	@ddlovato I'm sorry but that's not art. To me that's mocking people that suffer a very serious disease.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-03-15 06:31:08	Torn between the right thing and the wrong thing. Stay in recovery and get to 6 months or go get it back and throw it all away?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-03-14 23:06:15	That moment when you realise that someone really doesn't care about how much they hurt you and they're not the person you thought they were

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-03-08 11:12:50	To say tonight has been an emotional night would be a bit of an understatement.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-03-08 09:38:08	Why is it when I really need someone I can't get hold of a single damn person?! I don't know how much more I can take

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-02-24 06:53:45	@DionUltear I agree. I can't wait to see what they do with Mockingjay!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-02-24 06:47:41	@DionUltear don't get me wrong I like them both. I just preferred Catching Fire cos it stuck to the book more.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-02-24 06:37:56	@DionUltear I know what you mean, I had the same issue. I actually think Catching Fire was better than The Hunger Games.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-02-24 05:45:04	@DionUltear I know right?! I watched it the other day and was like new next film NOW!!! lol

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-02-04 11:37:01	@DionUltear it's a win. You're just a sore loser!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-02-04 09:18:15	@DionUltear it's a brick! That was my argument. You admitted it is a brick therefore I do win lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-02-04 08:59:48	@DionUltear just accept defeat already. I won, like it or lump it lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-02-04 07:23:39	@DionUltear AHA!!! You admit it! It's a brick! I WIN!!!

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-31 07:58:20	Have reached the conclusion that there is no way I'll have knit the entire alphabet by Monday. Stupid fucking shoulder. Grumble grumble.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-30 09:07:26	@DionUltear we need to hang out! I miss you!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-30 09:02:28	@DionUltear might have to give it a listen. I like Demi Lovato at the moment lol apparently we are still just as bad as each other lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-30 09:01:20	@DionUltear uh oh...what are you thinking?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-30 08:57:46	@DionUltear no way I'd have time to do actual letters. It requires learning a stitch I'm not familiar with.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-30 08:56:24	@DionUltear any good?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-30 08:54:55	@DionUltear individually cos I'm nuts lol it's a project for college. We have to make alphabets. I doubt anyone else will knit one lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-30 06:28:02	On a mission. Gonna attempt to knit the entire alphabet in time to shoot and have ready for class on Monday. It's quite possible I'm insane!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-29 05:22:00	@DionUltear LOL true.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-29 03:09:01	@DionUltear told you Hershey's amazing! You should've listened to me.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-21 08:07:50	@DionUltear awesome. I'd say this weekend but Courtney is visiting. She leaves on Sunday but I don't know what time yet.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-21 07:41:06	@DionUltear ok. I'll keep that in mind. We have to meet up before then though for a catch up!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-21 04:57:00	@DionUltear it probably won't be until next month now. I have to wait to see who else wants the studio. I'll keep you posted.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-19 06:56:25	@DionUltear well damn. Was gonna ask you to come be a model for me but you work during times I have access to the studio.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-19 02:42:44	@DionUltear that's the understatement of the century right there! Hey random question but what hours do you work now?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-19 01:55:43	@DionUltear you sure? That's be awesome. We need to meet up for a drink and a catch up soon. It's LONG overdue.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-18 14:41:55	Course I'm awake at 6:40 in the morning, that makes complete sense. Screwed up sleep sucks ass! Stupid bipolar meds, it's all their fault!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-18 14:38:08	@DionUltear is that I don't know if I could pull off a bandana. I'd be so anxious that people thought I looked like a twat or something.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-18 14:37:20	@DionUltear so I meant to reply and accidentally got retweet and don't know how to make it go away lol anyways what I was gonna say (tbc)...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-18 06:35:46	@emmemusic ironic that you put this on a site people use to stalk their favourite celebrities lol
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-16 11:51:44	Last night was Honey, I Shrunk a The Kids so of course tonight is Honey, I Blew Up The Kid. Love these classics.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-16 08:17:15	#PrettyLittleLiars is extra creep worthy. Mr. Fitz is definitely a creeper.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-15 08:35:58	Feelso horrid. Meds that fuck your sleep up and being ill are definitely not the one.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-14 12:19:54	Can't sleep and the room is moving...awesome!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-14 11:21:30	Random thought: I wish I could pull off head bandanas. Yep. That's all.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-14 05:11:09	There's cruel, then there's fuck you.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-13 08:18:15	I should be counting down the hours instead of holding back the tears.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-12 08:18:03	Kicking butt with college work. Figured out format for artists book, what lighting I'm gonna use, and drawn some sketches. On a roll!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-09 10:49:43	You suck!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-08 11:56:48	What'd you do last night? Stayed up til 4 in the morning doodling for college lol that's a new excuse. I'll take it! pic.twitter.com/huflxwvWRP
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-08 06:06:41	Currently feeling like a mad genius!!!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-07 09:58:55	Bed. Bed is good, even if I do need a new mattress. My shoulders and back are killing me from sitting at my desk so long. Do not want!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-06 08:34:20	Funny how someone with anxiety about being round people seems perfectly fine going out all the time drinking and going to gigs. Wish I could
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-06 08:27:28	It's a great feeling when you realise that you no longer matter. Not the way you used to. So much for things not changing that much.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2014-01-01 04:27:32	Fuck! But of course I should end 2013 feeling like shit. After all it's been the shittiest year ever so why stop in the last few hours?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-31 12:32:56	Head is far too busy. Time to distract it with another movie. #SpringBreakers #GetGlue http:// gtg.lu/Ki3udo

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-30 04:33:24	My head is killing me. Just spent the last few hours shooting for my ABC project at college. My eyes are so sore! pic.twitter.com/AAWyWNporC
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-29 04:53:29	Made loads of progress with my @Pink cross stitch lately. Glad to say I reached my end of year goal. pic.twitter.com/I1BVQusE6J
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-27 19:39:15	Post-Christmas sales are a dangerous thing indeed. I have absolutely no idea how I'm gonna rework my DVD system to accommodate for new DVDs.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-27 14:06:45	Well apparently I'm awake and gonna stay that way by the looks of things. Le sigh.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-26 05:21:39	Christmas has put my DVD shelves to the limit! pic.twitter.com/YnocrrnBho

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-25 19:58:43	Merry Christmas all
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-24 09:13:40	Why is it whenever I have to get up early for something I can't sleep more so than usual?! So frustrating!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-23 06:15:35	@emmemusic will your new record be on iTunes?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-23 02:55:36	One Tree Hill and cross stitch. This is how I'm spending my time off from college work. After Boxing Day I'll knuckle down and get organised
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-21 13:38:52	Resuming work on my @Pink cross stitch. It's been neglected far too long. pic.twitter.com/su7193LeFY
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-21 13:37:01	@DionUltear LMAO nah. You're too classy to be a wash out whore.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-21 10:56:53	@DionUltear LOL well you were bound to slow your sluttish ways eventually
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-19 13:24:01	@DionUltear I'm not too bad. Relieved that it's not Christmas break. How have you been?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-14 19:16:44	Yes it is cold enough for me to be wearing my scarf indoors. Really need to dye my hair again. The blue is fading :( pic.twitter.com/5hRtEWXbnq
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-14 19:14:18	@DionUltear you look good sweetie

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-01 22:39:56	Nap time. Hopefully I'll feel better when I wake up and will be able to get on with my David Bailey portrait.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-12-01 03:12:43	Well, getting my nose pierced hurt as much as I thought it would. Definitely made my eyes water. May or may not repierce my lip.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-11-29 12:29:53	@cnhedges boy is like a computer god. He's forever making posts about computer stuff.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-11-29 12:28:57	Can't sleep. Not sure why. Can't think of anything in particular on my mind. Bizarre.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-11-29 12:27:35	@cnhedges I miss these kids! Can't wait to see them all.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-11-25 10:00:24	It's a great feeling when your best friends are dropping you. Either by not talking to you at all, slowly not caring or just pushing away.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-09-26 09:05:26	How I wish this didn't exist, that words remained unsaid, that days had not been spent.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-09-25 06:19:44	Feeling a little better. Me thinks the stress of a new routine and new people just proved a little too much. Thankful for my mummy.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-09-25 04:56:32	I wish I could cut this out of me.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2013-09-24 08:41:24	Hoping I be all caught up in time for when it returns. Just over halfway through season 3. #PLL #GetGlue http:// gtg.lu/17tQzwj

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-10-22 19:08:57	@ODarling I'm not too bad in summer unless I'm somewhere with ridiculous humidity. Then I suffer. But mainly it's the cold that messes me up
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-10-22 19:06:40	@ODarling it's stupid cos my asthma isn't that bad really. Until the colder months. Flu leads to chest infection and that puts me in A&E LOL

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-07 18:03:21	@ODarling you don't remember sitting in class going "badger badger badger"? LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-07 18:02:55	@ODarling currency abbreviation is GBP
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-07 17:40:05	@ODarling you're a bunny now? At school you were a badger! That's right...I remember LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-07 06:28:18	I love crisp sandwiches!!! :D
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-06 23:58:48	@ODarling ok mate cheers. I'll give ya a text probably tomorrow when I'm a little more human LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-06 23:57:10	@ODarling interesting...do you think you could do a little research for me first? Ask if it'd be possible to transfer to US?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-06 23:54:23	@ODarling better than it was. I need to try an make a hospital appointment for it. What's your idea?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-06 23:53:20	@ODarling a little of both. That an it costs a company something like $5,000 to sponsor a work visa, not many will.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-06 23:51:27	@ODarling work visa
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-06 23:50:13	@ODarling cos I'm same sex I'm not eligible for spousal or fiance visa and trying to get a H1B visa is impossible
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-06 23:48:54	@ODarling well I'm sorry that I seem to upset you for being pissed about a difficult situation
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-06 23:43:35	@ODarling 1) I just got back and 2) fuck off, if it were that easy do you really think I'd still be here?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-06 23:41:59	Ok, I'm ready to go home to Texas now. I'm already over England. Can I just take my geckos and go back? Please?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-06 03:39:39	I don't wanna leave :'(
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-05 23:35:42	@ODarling I'm not sure if I'd be able to do that yet mate. I'm still learning stuff. Sorry.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-09-05 23:30:32	@ODarling depends how complicated it is mate. What is it you want knitted?

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-26 23:18:08	Cleaned my babies vivs, me thinks it's not time for a quick smoke and then to get started on attempting to knit a squirrel LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-26 08:04:52	Just learnt how to knit intarsia and all I can say is...my poor little brain LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-24 22:43:58	Teehee I knitted a penguin! :) http:// twitpic.com/5v63j5
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-24 21:25:56	@CaelStorm of course not my Lover, I'll do that now so I don't forget LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-24 20:00:23	I've found some truly awesome knitting patterns online but they cost money...do I dare spend money on patterns? They're so cute!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-24 19:20:00	@CaelStorm I downloaded some really nice patterns over the last few days. I'll put them on my HD and bring them over later if you'd like?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-24 19:04:34	@CaelStorm I google them LOL I find all sorts of things.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-24 09:38:38	So Friday I knitted an elephant, Saturday I knitted a hippo...I think Sunday's knitting project shall be a penguin!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-24 00:36:40	This hippo is proving to be slightly more difficult than the elephant. Hmmm...I hope it turns out ok :S
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-23 22:27:51	@CaelStorm haha I guess so.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-23 20:18:34	Hmmm...apparently my (soon to be) ex-wife has been checking out mine and my girls dA pages...should I be worried? Ah fuck it! I don't care!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-23 05:23:21	Bubblegum the pink heffalump almost has a body, head and trunk. Then I'll start on the legs :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-23 00:14:30	Gonna take a shower, see if it helps me feel any better. At least it should help ease my shoulder for a short while.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-22 23:50:13	Cute little squirrel http://instagr.am/p/IPa8z/
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-22 23:03:34	I have reached the conclusion that marriage is a state of mind.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-22 20:03:23	Time to hang out with an old friend for a little while. Not sure I'm in the right frame of mind for company but oh well!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-22 03:38:40	Somehow I don't think I'll be finishing Big Red today seeing as I didn't get up til 6pm cos of not feeling well :'(
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-21 10:03:57	Ok so I'm only half way with knitting Big Red. Hopefully I'll finish him tomorrow.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-21 06:46:56	I'm gonna be so sick of the colour red by the time I'm through with Big Red LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-21 05:51:34	So Big Red has legs a body and half of his arms. So far so good. Hopefully I'll get all the knitting part done tonight.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-21 02:26:40	I introduce...Tango! http:// twitpic.com/5t3i08

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-20 05:21:13	I think I gonna try and be smart and attempt to mattress stitch the seam of my USA beanie. Fingers crossed I can pull it off.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-20 04:55:52	I've nearly finished knitting my American flag beanie. I'm excited to see how it turns out.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-19 23:02:44	I do not feel good on an epic scale.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-19 21:08:31	Me thinks I'm gonna be a sad ass and watch High School Musical. Why? Cos I'm a big kid and I don't care what anyone else says.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-19 19:39:27	Must remember to start with purl when I get back. Must remember. Purl, purl, purl, knit, wait...d'oh! LOL Purl!

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-19 08:24:06	That shower was awesome. I feel all nice and clean and refreshed. Didn't screw up once. Very good shower.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-19 07:20:17	Damn, when did it get to be twenty past twelve? Best go for my shower now before it gets any later...oops!!!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-19 05:55:25	Time to let loose with my OCD. I'm really gonna enjoy this! Time for a new system and to listen to Glee :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-19 04:51:17	Finally have access to my DVDs again!!! This is both good and bad LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-18 23:54:49	I has a desk!!! And a bookcase. My rooms finally becoming a room. Happy days for me :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-18 08:58:33	@CaelStorm very cool! Cookies got unravelled. I didn't like the way it looked as stockinette. Gonna start again tomorrow as garter though.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-18 06:18:55	@CaelStorm I is an alien! 
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-17 22:09:11	Contemplating modifying the teddy bear pattern to make it a rabbit...I can picture how to do it in my head and it works in theory LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-17 22:08:22	@CaelStorm how's it going my Lover?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-17 10:28:43	Oh! And I also finally remembered to upload chapter 67 of Dirty Little Secret. Look at me go! LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-17 10:28:03	A productive day. Knitted a teddy bear, tried double knitting, got Xander to eat and fed the girls and got weights recorded. Productive Sam!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-17 08:38:28	Note to self: forgetting to eat is bad. It will make you feel sick. Stop forgetting to eat!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-17 06:16:28	My tiny little brain is getting all discombobulated with double knitting the pattern I'm working on LOL I is not very smart I feel.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-17 04:25:26	Ok so I'm learning double knitting now. Yep. Now we're getting complex! LOL my poor little brain is gonna get so confuddled!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-17 03:45:36	@the_awesumtwin said I'm trying to call the nurse again but she's a little bitch! I think I'll get outta here...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 23:29:40	It's funny how life always manages to surprise you in ways you don't expect. 2011 and the last of 2010 has been amazing. So blessed.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 21:45:08	Gonna knit one more teddy today and then I'm gonna try step up my game and try something a little more complex...might end badly LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 20:33:54	@CaelStorm LMAO that's London for ya sweetie!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 11:02:59	@the_awesumtwin I'll do it first thing tomorrow. I got a little distracted by creating a scary looking teddy bear LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 11:01:50	@the_awesumtwin oops?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 11:00:54	Damn it! I still forgot to upload chapter 67. Oh well, I'll try do it tomorrow. Right now I'm too tired to care.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 11:00:02	Oops it appears that my experiment with button eyes failed epicly LOL I give you...Voodoo! http:// twitpic.com/5qthgl

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 02:57:43	Done with the knitting part of the bear. Now time to get sewing and stuffing :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 02:57:11	@the_awesumtwin hey chick how ya doing?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 00:19:12	Half way through knitting bear number 2. I've decided this ones name is Haze cos of it being purple LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 00:17:46	@CaelStorm lose any weight. You're perfect as you are!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 00:17:09	@CaelStorm don't be daft! Ignore the silly bastard. Yes you've put weight on but in a good way. You are by no means fat and don't need to
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-16 00:16:12	@CaelStorm fair enough. Let me know what you make of it but I think you're right, I'll stick to how I did Red :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-15 22:39:21	On to bear number 2! This one's gonna be purple. Must remember to post chapter 67 at some point today LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-15 21:38:37	I have officially finished my first knitted teddy! :) introducing...Red! (yeah I know not very original) LOL http:// twitpic.com/5qia48
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-15 20:57:35	Right I think I've sussed out the ears. :S LOL time to stuff teddy :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-15 20:39:10	Almost time to stuff my first knitted teddy bear :) just trying to figure out this backstitch malarky.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-15 17:54:13	@CaelStorm hello my Lover! Don't suppose you figured out how backstitching gives teddy his ears did you?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-15 17:53:34	In Northampton like a good girl. I get the feeling that this weeks session is going to be...interesting, for lack of a better word LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-15 09:22:21	Well the knitting part of my teddy bear is done. I'll sew him up tomorrow. Not quite sure how to give poor teddy his ears though :S
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-15 06:28:30	I'm half way through knitting my first teddy bear. It seems to be going well so far LOL won't know for sure til it's time to sew it up.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-15 02:20:59	Finishing up chapter 67 of Dirty Little Secret. Will hopefully post it later on.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-14 06:43:06	998 words for chapter 67 done. Hopefully will finish it tomorrow. But now it's time for film and knitting.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-14 04:13:11	Finally my laptop has finished updating! Time to refuel and then get back to writing chapter 67. Wanna try post it before bed tonight.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-14 03:04:26	Damn gotta tale a break from writing for the next 40 mins while my laptop updates. Now what do I do? Hmmm...guess I'll go back to knitting!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-14 02:12:38	Finally started work on chapter 67. So far I have 324 words. Not sure where this is heading though. It's not going how I thought it would go
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-13 11:37:12	Was all excited to see Corinthians (my favourite passage of the Bible) is trending only to find out it's actually about football...boo!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-13 09:17:24	I have Joseph Arthur's 'In The Sun' stuck in my head. It's making me wanna write...this is not got at nearly half two in the morning.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-13 04:43:33	Thinking of opening an etsy shop and selling knitted hats. I seem to be getting the hand of them now and think it'd be a good idea.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-13 00:20:10	So thankful to my brother for my awesome headphones. They make travelling that bit easier. Music helps with anxiety.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-12 20:57:39	I really don't know what's wrong with me at the moment but whatever it is I wish it'd go away already. I'm fed up of feeling crap.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-12 19:02:20	@CaelStorm sweetie...you are a gay man LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-11 20:23:33	Do I knit or stitch today? Hmmm...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-11 04:54:24	Would give anything to go home to Texas. Anyone wanna buy one of my kidneys? LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-09 09:50:00	Is this the face of a content Xander? I think so! http://hpstm.tc/p/qhtr #hipstamatic

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-08 20:52:46	Think it's time to take a break from knitting and get back to stitching Buffy Season 8. That's right, it's time to get my stitch on.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-08 10:41:25	I'm so happy right now I could actually cry. My baby boy ate 3 silkworms! I'm so happy and proud. I now have hope that he'll get better.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-08 08:31:21	I am determined to finish this hat before I go to bed. I will finish it damn it!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-08 00:44:05	Hoping to finish knitting my purple and black hat today. So far it's going well. Hopefully I won't mess this one up.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-07 07:39:22	Ever have one of those profound moments that are prompted by absolutely nothing important, just the little things?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-07 03:03:07	Me thinks it's time to start Grey's Anatomy season 3 and work on a new hat :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-07 02:07:21	Proof that my peripheral in my right eye still isn't good...I walk into a big ass box cos I didn't see it. D'oh!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-07 01:27:38	@the_awesumtwin haha yeah, made me smile.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-07 01:17:10	Mmmm...soup.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-07 01:16:53	@the_awesumtwin oh dear LOL That's quite an imagination you have there.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-06 22:31:10	@ODarling that film is brilliant. Has such an amazing cast in it though.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-06 09:03:21	@the_awesumtwin @diannaagron @corymonteith random! I like the old names better.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-06 08:59:40	@the_awesumtwin huh? Since when? Who changed?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-06 07:06:56	@ODarling LMAO or you could do that
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-06 07:01:14	@ODarling next time someone says you're old tell them "I'm like a fine wine, I only get better with age" that's what I say LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-06 05:50:24	Finally finished hat number 3. So far the best hat I've knitted me thinks. I'm getting there, slowly but surely.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-06 01:09:10	Must remember k7, k2tog, is what's next. Must not forget!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-05 09:09:54	Cuddles with my boy http://instagr.am/p/G-949/
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-05 09:07:16	Me and my baby boy http://instagr.am/p/G-9ey/
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-05 09:05:34	Me and Xan-Man, together again :) http://instagr.am/p/G-89r/
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-05 08:47:42	Enjoying cuddles with my baby boy. I love my little Xander so much. I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose him. He's my baby.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-05 03:06:32	Me thinks this hate is gonna take longer to stitch than I had initially anticipated.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-05 01:53:11	I feel if I'm successful with knitting this hat the next thing I'll work on today is chapter 67 as knitting is letting me plot it out.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-05 01:36:11	Must remember that the next row is purl
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-05 00:18:39	Having another crack at knitting a hat. Third time's the charm? Or it comes in threes meaning this one will be crap like the others? LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-04 19:00:48	Slowly starting to feel more awake.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-04 07:32:45	Now to get my geek on and maybe do some more knitting experiments.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-04 07:31:30	Dishes done. Xander bathed and attempted to feed. Helped mate out. Got some stitching done. Experimented with knitting. Productive day, no?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-04 07:08:15	Xan-Man happy and snug in a towel after his bath http://instagr.am/p/G59R_/
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-04 05:31:05	Anyone throwing out an old blender? I need one so I can make slurry for Xan-Man.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 21:47:49	Damn. They didn't have any worms or the antibiotic powder I'm after. Next...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 20:43:36	Off to the Koi Company to see what I can get to help my little Xan-Man. So worried about my baby boy.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 19:58:44	@Leahstaplehurst @ODarling damn I wish I weren't skint :(
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 18:48:07	@ODarling you luck git! Have fun!

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 06:37:09	Getting my geek on night #2 http://hpstm.tc/p/p6br #hipstamatic
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 06:06:03	I'm so sick of all the things with wings in this house!!! ARGH!!! Fuck off and die already!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 05:17:58	Still forming ideas for chapter 67. Me thinks I'll actually start writing tomorrow once I've solidified them.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 05:14:40	Buffy Season 8 02/07/11 http:// twitpic.com/5k8vlh
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 03:02:54	@the_awesumtwin ok, I'll post it later when I've finished this section. Hoping it'll only take an hour or so.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 03:01:44	@the_awesumtwin I can post a pic if you wanna see it?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 03:01:36	@the_awesumtwin I'm working on a big Buffy project at the moment. I'm working in sections. Got a section of white that needs finishing.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 03:00:20	@the_awesumtwin haha good cos I think that's the plan. Probably gonna start writing in a couple of hours. Wanna finish stitching first.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 02:56:00	@the_awesumtwin I think it's gonna be mostly filler, with the hint of something important happening. Kinda a build up for the next chapter
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 02:54:12	@the_awesumtwin you see my problem?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 02:52:14	@the_awesumtwin I just can't decide if it's gone be a simple filler chapter of if I want something important to happen in it.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 02:43:35	@the_awesumtwin LOL I just might. I'm still in the process of forming ideas though at the moment. Got a couple, just gotta pick one.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 02:22:28	Very tempted to start chapter 67 tonight. I seem to be in the process of brain storming ideas as to what's actually gonna happen.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-03 00:01:01	Apparently higher dose of my meds will knock me the fuck out LOL didn't get up til gone 3pm!

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-02 07:22:02	Getting my geek on :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-01 23:38:53	"I want to paint my face and pretend that I am someone else. Sometimes I get so fed up, I don't even wanna look at myself."
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-01 17:03:06	Off to Northampton I go. I really hope I don't bump into her while I'm there. Somehow I don't think that would end well.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-01 09:51:32	Why is it whenever I plan to be in bed by a certain time I always end up going to bed much later than planned? LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-01 04:35:55	Hmmm...Buffy, Grey's Anatomy or Star Wars (original films), what do I watch? Can't decide.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-07-01 03:54:23	Right then...I feel it's time to have a batch at doing something pointless...I'm gonna play on the wii. Hope my shoulder will be ok :s

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-30 07:20:10	@the_awesumtwin maybe it should be whom instead of who?

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-28 23:28:08	Gone from 498 words to 1,687 words...not bad. Still not finished though. Gonna try and get more written later. But for now...stitching!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-28 21:49:55	Wow...I seem to have tripled my word count and I'm still nowhere near done with this chapter...d'oh!

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-28 20:45:12	Right I have snacks and caffeine, I even have some form of nicotine (no real cigarettes though), me thinks it's time to get my writer on.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-27 01:51:13	Ok I am officially scarred for life. There's not enough therapy in the world to make what I've seen unseen LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-27 00:33:55	It feels odd to be wearing 3/4 length trousers. This is the first time since before dermatillomania took hold of me that I've worn them...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-26 18:42:46	@CaelStorm bitch, get your ass to mine today!

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-22 06:40:28	Attempt at knitting a beanie failed epicly LOL but I know where I fucked up and will try again tomorrow.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-22 04:04:10	Gonna attempt to knit myself a beanie...could be interesting...could piss me off LOL only time will tell...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-21 19:57:59	I'm really struggling today and I have no idea why. Feel like utter shite. Gonna treat myself to chip shop and veg out.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-20 02:28:54	Happy father's day to all the dads out there, especially my Daddy. I'm a daddy's girl and not ashamed to admit it. I love my Daddy so much!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-19 01:54:26	So apparently knitting is rather addictive LOL I blame @CaelStorm entirely for this. Looks like I've found a new hobby. Oops!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-18 07:15:20	Buffy Season 8 17/06/11 http:// yfrog.com/kh5jkwdj

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 23:41:31	Really looking forward to the pub followed by a weekend of Glee with @CaelStorm :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 21:27:55	@CaelStorm speaking of Buffy. Ice started watching it from beginning again while I work on Buffy Season 8 cross stitch
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 21:23:53	@CaelStorm very true. This weekend is much needed I feel. I'm not gonna bring my stuff to the pub cos of laptop but we can grab it after
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 21:16:13	@CaelStorm sounds like a plan to me babe. You gonna sing this week or no?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 21:12:42	@CaelStorm can't wait! You still pub bound tonight?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 20:30:49	@ODarling we live in England, it's definitely a myth
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 20:30:11	@ODarling it's a myth! LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 19:40:02	Hello all! Follow @TheLeoTrio for all tweets leopard gecko and to keep up to date with Xander, Willow and Tara :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 18:47:44	@ODarling I'm seriously thinking bout it. It'd also be a good way to keep record of weights etc. for all of them. Hmm...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 18:46:27	I'm actually contemplating opening a twitter for my leopard geckos so I can tweet stuff just bout them and keep this one personal, thoughts?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 18:38:45	@ODarling cool beans :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 18:36:37	@ODarling yeah I know what you mean. It's impossible for me to watch TV here so I either watch it online or get the DVD boxsets
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 18:34:53	@ODarling ah cool beans! Wish someone'd give me a voucher LOL am desperately after Grey's Anatomy, my girl got me hooked!

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 18:24:10	@ODarling Green Mile is the best adaption from a book I've ever seen. As for Singin' In The Rain it's one of my all time favourite movies
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-17 18:17:51	@ODarling The Green Mile and Singin' In The Rain

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 20:35:22	@ODarling I'd take him on if I could but mum's dog is a terrier and chases everything moves! LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 20:30:41	@ODarling he needs a new home? Sad dadys
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 19:29:35	@ODarling well yeah, there's no arguing that R2D2 rocks LOL

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 19:24:53	@ODarling aw that's great news. I'm so happy you were able to find his owners. I bet they've missed him.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 19:24:19	@ODarling he's probably scared mate. He's lost and in a strange place. Probably missing home.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 19:22:55	@ODarling hasn't bitten me yet LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 19:22:42	@ODarling that makes a big difference in an animal. Look at my girls. Tara is so sweet and laid back and Willow, well I'm surprised she
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 19:10:51	@ODarling aw yay! You excited?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 18:58:43	@ODarling definitely a film for when you need cheering up. LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 18:54:25	@ODarling cheers mate. I only recently saw the first one and it was better than I expected LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 18:47:32	@ODarling cool beans! Let me know if it's any good?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 09:39:23	I hate things with wings!!!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 08:27:12	Damn I is tired. Me feels I'll have to get Tara out tomorrow. Got kinda distracted by stitching.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 07:04:19	My progress on Buffy Season 8. It doesn't look like much right now but I've actually done a fair bit. http:// yfrog.com/gydb6kfj

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 01:57:09	@ODarling fair enough. I think I'll follow him on me other account. This one's for friends and family so I can tweet private stuffs.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 01:55:29	@ODarling @lucaspage what does he tweet about? I only follow certain people on this account.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 01:24:08	@ODarling yeah. I wish I could help but I'm afraid I'm rather useless LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-16 01:22:23	@ODarling I hate that word. He probably is missing his home mate, cut the poor little guy some slack.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 23:33:33	Looking forward to having Tara out later. Feels like I've neglected the girls the last week cos of worrying about Xan-Man.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 22:55:56	Sometimes I wonder how it is I always seen to find myself in these situations? It's like the grown up version of piggy in the middle.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 20:14:22	God bless skype! Let's me stay in touch with me mates even if they have moved to frickin' Holland LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 18:22:57	Empty house. Yay! I can listen to whatever I want, as loud as I want :)

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 17:36:40	@ODarling have the owners been contacted?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 17:33:48	@ODarling He's not identichipped?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 17:10:03	The woman at the smoking clinic was FAR too cheerful. Scarily cheerful. Odd woman LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 09:17:41	Dear God, please let him be found safe and alive.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 06:27:52	Wow my head hurts.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 05:06:57	@ODarling LMAO all stupid people should be moved to an island haha
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 04:52:40	@ODarling crazy right? They spell it without the P. Morons.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 04:41:20	@ODarling I don't blame ya. You have no idea how many people manage to spell Campbell wrong.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 04:04:01	@ODarling morons LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 02:05:29	Anyone wanna pay for a flight to Texas for me? I don't need a return.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 02:04:59	@ODarling it's not that hard LOL people are idiots.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 00:54:30	Ok next time someone tells me they're gonna commit suicide unless I'm related to them or they're one of my best mates I not getting involved
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-15 00:35:16	Ok, seriously! Why me?!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-14 23:12:57	@NekoChan1987 it's ok. Me thinks I'm gonna make some corn muffins later on.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-14 22:00:48	@NekoChan1987 true. But I has nothing to munch on :( and I is craving crisps and cake LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-14 21:58:07	@NekoChan1987 just as well everyone knows I'm not girly and pink then LOL I'm ok, annoyed that amazing stole my money so I can't go shop :(
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-14 21:54:27	Got some more magazines sorted, and sorted my shoes. Me thinks that it's now time to get my stitch on or possibly do some writing.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-14 19:30:48	I do not approve of waiting. Wish my mate would text back already so I know he's still living.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-14 08:47:29	Successfully managed to talk them out of it for tonight but I feel I got my work cut out for tomorrow.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-14 08:27:05	How is it that I always end up in the middle of these things? Why do people pick me to tell that they're gonna commit suicide?! ARGH!!!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-14 05:30:33	@CaelStorm LOL ok well let me know when you've sent it an I'll check and let you know.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-14 05:09:29	@CaelStorm still yahoo. You mean didgetspatch right?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-14 00:45:56	I don't feel so good. I hope I'm not coming down with something. This week is far too busy for me to be ill.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-13 23:25:19	Finished stitching my fathers day project. http:// yfrog.com/h0texubj
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-13 22:33:31	Almost finished fathers day project. Well the stitching part of it that is. Then I gotta mount it to the card, etc.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-13 22:31:12	@CaelStorm cool beans! I look forward to reading it.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-13 21:16:13	Ok. That's amazon sorted. Should get my money back by the end of the week. Now on to stitching!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-13 21:08:41	@CaelStorm aww my poor huni. Did you get much writing done last night?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-13 21:07:33	Amazon are fuckers! Bastarding steal my money you arseholes. Not impressed!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-13 20:08:25	Ok. I'm up, fed, dressed and ready to get on with the day! Gotta finish fathers day project, get some more magazines done and sort shoes out
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-13 05:53:58	Xander is in his warm hide!!! This makes me so happy. He's been in there for bout an hour. Fingers cross he'll keep it up. :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 23:23:14	Ok sorting through cross stitch magazines was a bad idea. I now have a pile forming of projects I really wanna do LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 21:23:36	I move the heat mat to the other side of his tank for him and yet still Xander goes to sleep in the cold side! Argh! What the hell do I do?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 20:47:24	I do believe it's time to watch Grey's anatomy.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 20:07:11	@ODarling yeah. He's ok at the moment. I just have to keep a very close eye on him.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 20:04:02	@ODarling he's not been using his warm side so he's getting too cold. They can slip into a coma if they get too cold. :(
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 20:01:54	@ODarling seems a little better. Can't seem to settle at the moment but he has been to the warm side a couple of times.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 20:00:29	@ODarling ok. I'll have to check if mum is taking the dog with her. If she is then it shouldn't be a problem.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 19:35:43	Xander's heat mat has been moved. Hopefully that'll solve the problem.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 19:24:13	@ODarling where abouts is here? LOL I've also just found out I'll have the house on Tuesday, mum and sis are London bound, bro has college
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 18:35:45	@ODarling I'm not sure at the moment mate. I've got a lot of appointments this week LOL I'm also skint this week but get paid the next.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 18:34:32	the problem and he'll soon be back to his regular squirmy self. He's currently warming up in my hood LOL I love my Xan-Man, he's my baby boy
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 18:33:56	Good news! Xander seems to be doing better today. He's still far too cold, but he's much more lively. Hopefully moving his heat mat will fix
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 18:33:22	@ODarling I wouldn't worry too much about it mate. Just sounds like one of her little quirks for getting ready for bed LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 18:23:43	@ODarling what do you mean by fidget?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 18:21:26	@ODarling I used to. My parents bribed me with him to get braces LOL his name was Mikey. Dad's was Charlie and my sisters was Flash.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 18:19:28	@ODarling sylvia has three syllables and fits with her colouring.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 09:44:17	Happy 2nd Birthday Xander! 09/06/11 http://hpstm.tc/p/jw1j #hipstamatic
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 09:42:50	I'm a little late but...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 09:03:19	I'm so worried bout my baby boy. Please God let him be ok. I can't lose him. I just can't.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 08:05:52	He seems a little better for being warmed up. I'll be keeping a very close eye on him the next few days. Praying that he was just cold.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 08:04:59	Fuck! Xander just scared the shot outta me! I thought he was dead! Then dying. He was so cold and lifeless. I've warmed him up now.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 07:26:21	Just had the best idea for chapter 66 and the best thing is...it wasn't one of the options I listed so no one will even see it coming LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 07:24:45	Stitched Daddy's card, sorted some magazines, got 498 words of chapter 66 written and still going. All in all a rather productive day for me
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 04:25:45	Oh yeah. I'm good. I is kicking OCD and dermatillomania butt. *happy dance*
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 03:51:03	Shower time. I'm really hoping a nice hot shower will ease the pain in my shoulder.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 02:32:44	Vroom! F1 car that I'm gonna turn into a card for my Daddy http://hpstm.tc/p/jstm #hipstamatic
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-12 01:18:16	I'm stuffed. Spaghetti bolognese was nummy. I'm in a bit of a food coma now though LOL not good when I gotta do the dishes.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-11 23:41:12	@Helen_SD_Smith aw that's great. Well done!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-11 22:45:51	Dear hayfever, you suck!!!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-11 22:27:55	Stitching my Daddy's fathers day card. I hope he'll like it.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-11 21:22:22	Handsome Xander http://hpstm.tc/p/jr63 #hipstamatic
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-11 08:16:42	Splat!!! http:// yfrog.com/kiuruzj
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-11 07:25:09	Damn...why am I so hungry? I swear I've done nothing but eat today LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-11 06:31:12	Kiri the kitty! Hoping my aunt will like it. http:// yfrog.com/gzrlbpsj
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-11 04:49:32	I should feel bad for leaving my wife I know. But how can I feel bad when I found my soulmate? Life's not perfect but I love the life I have
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-11 04:48:31	It seems I had a bit of a lucky escape where my ex is concerned LOL the more I find out the funnier it gets!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-11 01:08:04	After making me worry the last couple of days Xander has finally decided to use the warm side of his new tank. http:// yfrog.com/h8xzkkij
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 23:32:44	Can't seem to shake this funk I've found myself in. Grrrr!!!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 22:13:45	Cracking on with stitching my aunts birthday card.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 21:04:34	Italy bear = done! Now to figure out what to stitch for a birthday card and stitch my fathers day card. http:// yfrog.com/kl96873507j
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 19:44:33	Cigarette + listening to Slipknot very loud = a less stressed out Sammy. Me thinks it's time to get stitching to take my mind off things.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 19:43:17	Saw a guy that looked scarily like Charlie's father, thankfully it wasn't. But he looked near identical. Kinda stressed me out.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 19:37:32	Me thinks it's time for a cigarette.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 18:07:35	Starving Marvin!!!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 17:23:44	Today is not my day I feel.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 05:31:20	It's only 22:30, why am I so tired? I didn't even get up that early! Ah well, dishes are done at least now I can chill out and stitch a bit
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 04:52:12	Ugh time to do the dishes. Thank God I've got good music to listen to. Limp Bizkit sound epic through Dr. Dre Monster Beats
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 01:14:22	Hmmm, what film do I watch? Star Wars? The Sound of Music? See what's in my DVD cupboard?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-10 00:23:15	Good God I'm so full!!! Me thinks I'm headed towards a food coma...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-09 22:55:07	Finally writing the rest of chapter 65. Hopefully it'll be done, edited, checked and posted before I go to bed.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-09 22:32:43	@NekoChan1987 I know mate. You know what I'm like with books. They will be looked after. I'll be up in a minute for it ok?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-09 22:30:11	@NekoChan1987 if I smoked inside then yeah it would but I don't. Trust me, none of my books ate nicotine stained. I promise.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-09 22:23:02	@NekoChan1987 it's not too bad. Bit odd. Less privacy cos of everyone coming and going through my room. LOL pain in ass for seeing C
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-09 22:19:20	@NekoChan1987 ah well that makes more sense now LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-09 22:15:54	@NekoChan1987 I didn't gave to rush before. I just did everything at night when everyone else was sleeping LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-09 22:01:24	This whole waking up in the morning business has completely messed up my concept of time. I thought it was like 5 or 6 turns out it's 3 LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-09 21:58:39	Forgot how much I loved Limp Bizkit and how good they used to be.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-08 20:42:37	Gotta love having the house to yourself. Peace and quiet. Even the Bastard Bird is calm. All are very good for music and stitching. :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-08 04:25:57	Schindler's List is such a sad movie, truly heartbreaking and yet fascinating. Me thinks a smoke is in order followed by a comedy LOL

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 06:23:56	Beginning to feel the effects of not taking my meds yesterday...this is not good, especially when I have no way of smoking to deal
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 05:16:34	In other news I can not wait for next month when I can finally upgrade my phone. Piece of shit I've got now is fucking useless!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 05:14:19	Why is it I find out that I have no more papers to roll cigarettes until after the shop has fucking shut?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 04:58:55	One baby clean and with a happy tummy LOL Xan-Man sure does love his waxworms LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 04:23:58	Time to clean my babies.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 04:08:28	@CaelStorm alive and kicking my good man. I know a good thing when I've got one and I'm not letting something like 5,000 miles get in my way
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 03:50:20	@CaelStorm it really is!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 03:47:52	@CaelStorm Yeah I think so. Was nice being back together you know? Stupid bloody ocean gotta be in the damn way
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 03:45:24	That's right...I stitched a Wicked quote, what about it? LOL http:// yfrog.com/h3y98dhj
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 03:44:44	@CaelStorm I'm ok I guess. C went home today so I is a bit down in the dumps. Missing her like crazy already.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 02:31:37	Stitching...something of my own creation but to do with a show. Hehehe charted it all by hand, hope it turns out ok... :/
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 00:47:22	Well, we can't all come and go by bubble!"
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-04 00:38:16	@CaelStorm Haha it really would be intense multi-tasking. How are you my lover? You pub bound tonight?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 23:02:58	@ODarling haha true true. Should be able to get "divorced" soon LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 23:01:19	@ODarling Ah cool beans! I'll go accept it shortly. Not logged into Twitter website, using an app on my iMac LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 23:00:23	@ODarling yeah, you're right. There's only so much shit we go through before good things start to happen right? I've got my girl after all
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:56:27	Hmmm...do I write or stitch? Stitch or write? Or do I say sod it and read? LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:55:32	@ODarling I hope you're right.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:54:36	@ODarling social work, it's something worth doing and it'd give me a high chance of getting employment over there so I could stay
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:51:41	@ODarling she's real good, I'm hoping (but nothing's set in stone) to go over some time in August.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:51:00	@ODarling until then I gotta figure a way to raise 40 grand so I can get a visa to go to school over there LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:50:24	@ODarling haha wouldn't surprise me. I imagine that things will be very different 5 years from now and visas will be available
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:48:34	@ODarling You'd think so but there's another bill trying to get visas for same-sex partners that's been stuck in senate since 2009 so... LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:46:48	@ODarling recognise gay marriage, same-sex couples for a lot of other things and open up visas for same-sex partners
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:46:21	@ODarling Yeah I guess. I mean it's all up for debate at the moment as they're relooking at the DOMA (1996) which if they change will ...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:44:23	@ODarling You crazy, crazy badger you! LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:44:12	@ODarling Yeah, the US still has a way to come when it comes to gay rights and all that. Oh well, one day they'll get there.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:42:45	@ODarling I dare you! It's a lovely day.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:42:07	@ODarling I really wish it were that simple. Federal law doesn't recognise same-sex relationships for visas and I need a visa to live there
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 22:40:59	@ODarling I wish I could but I don't have the money for flights. Believe me if I did you wouldn't see me for dust! LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 21:58:08	@ODarling why didn't I what?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-03 20:40:56	My girl's gone home :( wish I could've gone home with her.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-02 07:18:43	I love that my girl is as big of a dork as I am. Just another reason why we're meant for each other.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-02 00:57:42	Wicked with my girl was AMAZING!!!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-06-01 07:16:15	My phone is possessed!!! Piece of shit is acting spazzier than usual. Can not wait for when I can get my new phone.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-25 08:21:52	Which sickness put American Idol on before Glee? No one gives a shit, the world does not need yet another crappy singer. Gimme Glee damn it!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-25 06:08:27	I is stuffed! That burrito was so good! Me thinks I'm in a bit of a food coma.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-18 03:31:23	Why is backstitch such a pain in the fucking arse?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-17 06:44:42	Two of my best girls @Kepwick http://instagr.am/p/EVhDC/

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-15 21:01:13	Stitching a cute l'il fox and being quiet while my girls naps. Is there a lovelier thing than watching the girl you love sleep? Precious!

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-10 06:14:33	Taking my victories where I can. Didn't screw up in the shower and I'm still washing once instead of 4 times. #dermatillomania and #OCD lose
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-10 05:16:47	I has a bed!!! Yes I'm excited. I've been on my parents sofa since December. I has a bed! *happy dance* :) bed bed bed!! http:// yfrog.com/gzd20xij
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-09 17:40:28	Really wanna keep stitching Mickey Through The Ages but I should probably work on the Boys present while he's at college. Damn.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-08 03:23:21	Watching Buffy "Once More, With Feeling" like a cool kid.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-07 20:57:16	I think I'm probably the only person that can't wait for this weekend to be over LOL means I'll be that little bit closer to seeing my girl.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-07 09:35:02	Can't sleep. Marvellous.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-06 10:18:56	@the_awesumtwin LMAO that's brilliant
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-06 10:18:07	@the_awesumtwin haha fair enough huni, then ignore them LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-06 10:16:57	@the_awesumtwin well that sucks mate. Usually I'd say ignore it, but the last time someone said that bout me it kinda turned out to be true
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-06 09:58:21	@the_awesumtwin that's parents for ya. My mum thinks I've slept with everyone I've dated, guys included!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-06 07:00:40	Ok...why the fuck is my knee hurting again?! This makes no sense!!!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-06 02:32:10	Gonna do some more of the backstitch for the Boys birthday pressie tonight when he's in bed but for now I think I shall work on Mickey.

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-05 21:41:25	I feel like shit all because of a stupid form I gotta fill out for the doctors. Thanks ever so much for reminding me bout that. :'(
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-05 20:08:50	The Internet is back! I've managed to stay fairly spoiler free for this weeks #Glee now it's time to watch it.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-05 19:37:36	Knee is still a little sore but at least I can walk on it without excruciating pain. This is good.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-05 09:44:18	Hoping that my knee will stop hurting after some sleep. If mother catches me limping she'll start going on at me to go doctors.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-05 09:43:35	I am in so much pain with my knee. I really don't wanna go to doctors bout it cos the last time I did they mentioned surgery...do not want!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-04 10:21:03	Damn Internet cut out so I didn't get to watch Glee. Now gotta try stay spoiler free til I can get it and watch it. Bye tumblr LOL

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-03 20:08:39	Me thinks it's time to get cracking with my #Glee project until I can go get my meds.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-02 22:15:39	@CaelStorm thank you my lover. Hoping to finish it today. Did you see Zack in the end?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-02 21:14:51	Only two colours left to do and my #Glee project will be complete :) http:// yfrog.com/gygokxjnj

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-01 23:44:34	I really need to get my motivation back but I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle at the moment. Must get motivated...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-01 22:21:14	I have a nasty feeling that I'm not gonna get much work done on my #Glee project today...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-01 20:39:44	I has a bed!!!! Not able to use it just yet but I has one! :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-05-01 11:05:14	#Glee project is really beginning to come together. http:// yfrog.com/h4atybzxj

284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-30 20:39:51	Beginning to see things coming together with my #Glee project. Can't wait to see what it looks like finished.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-30 06:53:55	Dear anxiety, you are not wanted nor are you welcomed so fuck off and leave me alone!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-30 03:47:58	Sod it, I'm gonna watch Step Up and stitch like a cool kid LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-30 02:15:33	I don't feel as though I'm getting as far with my stitching today for some reason. It's weird cos I've actually done quite a bit.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-29 18:16:13	There's no escape from #theroyalwedding
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-29 09:15:56	My girl knows how to #makemesmile when I'm lost and thinking #whatsthepoint I am so grateful for having her in my life.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-29 09:12:05	It's 48 degrees and my girl's not here to cuddle up with to keep warm. This makes me very sad.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-29 07:39:46	If I can keep stitching at this pace then I may just be able to finish my #Glee project by the end of this bank holiday weekend. Yay!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-29 00:07:50	Finally feel like I'm getting somewhere with my #Glee project. Hoping to have it finished in about a weeks time.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-28 21:58:57	Me thinks it's time to get my stitch on!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-28 06:54:45	I am officially 3/4 of the way done with my #Glee project! Can finally see Quinn takin form. Yay me! LOL http:// yfrog.com/hsdrdetj
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-28 02:22:13	Almost three quarters of the way with my #Glee project. Will post a pic later.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-27 01:02:34	Where I'm at with my #Glee project. Now to to crack on with it. Hoping to get a lot done today. http:// yfrog.com/h42p0ccj
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-27 00:13:16	Right got my threads, time to put them on bobbins, have some grub and then time to get cracking on my #Glee project. Yay! :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-26 22:42:32	Off to get some more threads so I can get cracking with my #Glee project :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-26 21:14:38	Done therapy like a good little girl. Question is...what do I do now?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-26 17:17:34	Off to therapy like a good little girl.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-26 07:25:00	@the_awesumtwin haha thanks hun. Just my girl scaring the crap outta me LOL stupid tornado warnings freaked me out...she was asleep LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-26 07:21:35	@the_awesumtwin yeah I'm sure. Panic over, crisis diverted. LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-26 07:17:22	@the_awesumtwin Hey hun, ignore my last message. All is good LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-26 07:14:32	@the_awesumtwin hey hun...I need a favour...message me as soon as poss?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-26 07:12:56	Ok not gonna lie...I'm a little worried...
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-26 05:06:46	Just found out that I should be getting my girl in about 16 days! This makes me so fucking ridiculously happy, you have no idea :D
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-26 02:42:44	Yay for swollen glands! Head + desk = how I feel.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-26 02:36:59	Still don't feel well and it's making me all depressified. Feeling so meh right now. Screw it all.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-25 19:42:11	Bored in London. Ready for Chinese now please, I'm so hungry!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-25 09:46:35	Can't switch off. Not good. Need to sleep. Gotta get up in 5 hours.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-25 07:42:22	Feels weird being in bed so early. So happy that I got to see my girl though. :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-25 06:28:16	It's odd to think that I now have 20 tattoos. It's even odder that I don't know why I find it odd in the first place LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-25 05:38:53	Less than half hour in the shower, I feel that's a new record. Had a trigger for a flashback and even managed to not have one! Big deal :)
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-25 05:10:00	Time for a nice hot shower me thinks. I hope it makes me feel better. Do not approve of feeling ill.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-25 04:28:20	Cleaned Xan-Man. He seems to be enjoying the slight modification to his favourite hide so it's a humid hide - I just hope it works.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-24 09:59:18	I don't feel so good.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-24 01:44:46	Good God! It's 79f in England! I thought it was unusually warm for this time of day. LOL
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-23 21:16:03	It's a beautiful day today. Slightly amused that we're currently hotter than Texas, although not by much and not for long.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-23 08:57:20	@CaelStorm having trouble sleeping my lover?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-23 04:20:12	Beginning to feel like I'm making some progress with my Glee cross stitch. I wonder if it's too ambitious to try finish by the end of April?
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-22 16:12:30	"I'm scared to death but I'd face all my fears for you"
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-20 21:25:03	So today's shopping plans have been rescheduled for tomorrow...guess that means Desperate Housewives and stitching for me then
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-19 23:10:37	I'm marvin!!!
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-19 09:29:08	Stupid Facebook has got me thinking bout Charlie. Feel better knowing that I've got her tattoos done now.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-19 02:27:45	I'm slowly beginning to lose my mind.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-19 00:10:46	New crafty stuff is a bit intimidating. Not done anything like this before. I'm sure I'll fuck it up. Oh well won't know unless I try.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-18 23:22:13	Has new crafty stuff...could be interesting.
284000637	CharlieLilStar	2011-04-18 22:02:40	New twitter...fresh start. In theory.
