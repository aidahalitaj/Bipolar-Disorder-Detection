26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-06-11 04:17:38	Happy that Mona's moving back home, but sad that there won't be anymore Manchester adventures. Adios Manchester, it's been great. #growingup
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-06-11 02:55:32	Lesson learnt from Parklife: Don't go to Parklife.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-06-10 21:19:24	I just said ludacris instead of ludicrous in conversation. Oh god. Hip hop on the brain.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-06-10 16:45:24	Last night the Flaming Lips were on stage with dancing frogs & hoards of dancing girls in lederhosen dresses. Seriously, frogs. Bizarre/epic
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-06-10 03:11:11	Is making out in mud the UK equivalent of Spring Break?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-06-10 03:06:39	I feel like I'm at a frat party. #parklife

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-06-08 02:13:54	In the past week I've gobbled down meaty American treats at Bodeans, Pitt Cue & the Diner (twice). It's good to be back. #meatmeatmeat

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-05-24 06:29:51	The Exploding Girl is a really lovely film, but singing Neil Diamond Sweet Caroline with @bexter2001 at the end made it even lovelier :]

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-29 20:19:49	@pristyles one month of planning & my eyes are already failing. This does not bode well...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-29 20:18:56	@Carli_H genius. Where does one purchase a monocle these days? Other than the pet store...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-29 20:17:58	@Mattfitch81 losing my vision is definitely not cool.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-29 20:17:17	Got the most granny style glasses possible. There's no hiding my inner old lady now. #YouCanCallMeDoris
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-29 19:10:17	Going to get my first pair of glasses, car in front has license plate beginning EY35. I feel like the world is laughing at me.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-29 01:51:32	Only good thing about being ill is that I've finally fully caught up on Homeland. I'm sure you're all sick of hearing it, but boy is it good
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-28 04:33:43	@bexter2001 LIKE A LOT.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-26 22:12:05	@bexter2001 oh god smecks, it's so depressing in here. Even 'what'll I do' can't make this better.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-26 22:07:05	A little old lady dumped on a bed in the corner has been crying for a nurse for 10 mins & has been ignored by all of them. This is horrible.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-26 22:01:14	@bexter2001 yeah, just here for my wisdom teeth. The man next to me has been making a weird gargling noise for the last 20 minutes. Bleurgh
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-26 21:45:04	I hate hospitals.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-25 06:00:31	@pristyles how do you do safe searches?! I'm sick of google forcing me to look at willies, boobs & abnormal body parts!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-25 02:16:50	@amy_forster beans beans they're good for your heart, the more you eat the more you...start dreaming of money?

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-24 19:34:46	@Mattfitch81 I hope they at least compensated with sweets?

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-21 02:56:27	Haven't slept in 38 hours. Just spent 5 minutes standing in a lift before realising it hadn't moved because I hadn't pressed the button.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-19 06:29:04	@Mattfitch81 really like that the grumpy tweets now come with grumpy photos. Your fans are pleased.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-17 15:08:37	@Carli_H good luck!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-16 15:25:11	Realised this morning that a LOT of my DVDs are missing. This displeases me. If I've loaned you a DVD, please could you return it! :(
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-15 19:32:12	I'm learning the dance: http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=g1-9vw 8cUi8 …
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-15 19:17:37	Thanks to Ally McBeal, I am going to spend the rest of the day singing & dancing to Barry White. I recommend that you all do the same.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-15 06:52:34	@bexter2001 dont mess with smecky
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-14 23:16:28	@LaRain__ I want a pony.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-12 03:53:19	Just been to the Damien Hirst. Wish he'd given the shark gold & diamond teeth. But he didn't.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-09 06:47:40	Actually quite liked Hunger Games. There, I said it. Also, don't think the comparisons to Battle Royale are very fair.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-08 18:32:00	@Mattfitch81 an eggstremely bad joke
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-08 16:35:34	Been stuck in Egham for half an hour now. Just realised the train to Bournemouth doesn't normally pass through here at all. #ahh #freakedout
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-08 16:26:09	On the way to Bournemouth to see Jonny, train has broken down at Egham. Freaky coincidence or a sign of some sort? Weird. #badomen

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-04 02:52:08	Are we all just projecting our identities constantly? Is this a projection? Is anything real?! Was it ever different? #ahh #mindexploding
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-04-02 03:05:44	I wish Bill Cunningham was my great grandfather. Such a lovely old man, everyone go see the film!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-03-24 22:21:48	20 minutes. I have been waiting for a bus for 20 minutes. They're supposed to come once every 6-10 minutes! Not a happy bunny.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-01-28 16:49:40	Squuueeeeeeeeeee!! SO PSYCHED, but I really wish my bag wasn't filled with quite so much work. The works good but the bags stupidly heavy.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-01-26 05:08:37	An APG paper just made me happy-tearful. Seriously need to turn the volume down on my emotions. More sleep (& cake) required.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-01-24 04:18:06	Basically, food + friend + film = fun. That's pretty much the formula for all my favourite activities.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-01-24 04:15:05	Feasting on duck & doing a TV quiz with my bessie @bexter2001 at Roxy Bar. I wish every Monday eve was like this.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-01-23 00:26:01	I know the next book I read should be the one selected for Book Club, but I'm going to feast my brain on Angela Carter instead. #BadassRebel
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-01-22 23:44:56	I just cried over Tereza's dog dying in The Unbearable Lightness of Being. I cried over a dog in a book. Seriously?! #pansy #NewLow

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-01-20 06:58:00	The Artist is brilliant. Charming, enchanting, heartwarming & just lovely. The kind of magical film that makes you forget all your woes.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-01-18 07:09:50	War Horse, what a weeper! My face was wet with tears. I shouldn't be allowed to watch films about the war/noble animals.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2012-01-08 23:59:37	Pants & projections: Pipilotti Rist's Eyeball Massage at the Hayward is dreamy. George Condo's Mental States isn't http:// twitpic.com/84u7on

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-26 00:32:30	Just realised I have the exact same haircut as when I was 3. And my face is pretty much exactly the same, except...not cute. Damn.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-25 15:28:34	If someone doesn't wake up soon, I'm going to have to do something rash to get their attention. Like set a pet on fire. Do goldfish burn?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-25 15:18:30	Literally twiddled my thumbs through the night & now no one else will wake up. DON'T THEY KNOW ITS CHRISTMAS??!!!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-25 10:23:56	It's 2:22am on Christmas Day & I'm not asleep because I've been meticulously cleaning my room. There is definitely something wrong with me.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-25 06:04:03	I want my sister to open her present now! Got her 12 presents for each day of Christmas. I love Christmas! Squeeee http:// twitpic.com/7xynob

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-25 05:00:49	Just ate 2 bulbs of roasted garlic. Where's the mistletoe? #SoSexy #ComeAndGetMeBoys
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-25 02:09:56	Arrive in Ealing to find 15 buses at standstill, stuck in the road honking at each other. Brilliant!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-24 21:12:35	@abiyooooo got the perfect dress & a story to tell you & @_dokidoki next time I see you! Hooray! Pics to come :) x

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-06 04:42:36	@amy_forster is the best. For real.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-02 04:43:42	Have had 1.5 hrs sleep in the last 38. Looking forward to snoozing on the sofa mid Bridget Jones Diary. The ultimate recovery night in.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-02 04:24:19	I feel GOOD
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-12-01 13:37:17	So proud of the pitch team & glad I was a part of it. Really nice to see people come together to bring an idea to life.Don't want it to end!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-30 07:53:26	You know you've been in the office too long when you put up posters in a colour coordinated symmetrical pattern. FML
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-29 20:59:50	Depressing moment of the day -realising I've only slept 3.5 hrs but thinking it's fine cos it's Friday today. Then realising it's Tuesday :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-29 11:14:18	Another late night in the office, surviving on chocolate & team love. Thanks @pristyles :) http:// twitpic.com/7lelse
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-27 09:18:37	Should probably stop reading xfactor tweets & go to bed...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-27 09:10:43	Really interesting article, makes me miss uni RT Kate Bolick: why marriage is a declining option for women http:// gu.com/p/3
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-27 08:15:50	Just saw a little cat skip playfully across the road. Made me very happy. In conclusion, cats make everything good. More skipping cats pls.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-25 16:35:32	So happy my sisters home for the weekend. Why can't she quit her degree & come home for good? Don't want her to ever leave!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-25 04:03:06	Have made a beyond terrible day slightly better by filing 250 emails. I think that says it all really. :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-24 15:47:23	@wahabning I know! Hilarious! & the post-sex scene too! I was wetting myself with laughter all the way through! Brilliant!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-24 06:01:45	Breaking Dawn is the worst film I have ever seen. Worse than Troll 2. Fortunately, I love bad movies. Can't wait to watch it again & again!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-22 06:24:03	@amy_forster haha! & Gabriella too! Such a bitch!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-22 06:09:04	@amy_forster what is going on with millies random sideburn?!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-20 21:13:01	Must stop weeping when I watch Christmas adverts. It will be here soon!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-20 05:36:09	So psyched about seeing @Elizgbeth & @Carli_H tonight! Would really like the train to hurry up & get me to the pub.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-20 02:34:04	'Art is the highest form of hope' Gerard Richter, you are just wonderful! Such a delicious exhibition. The Tate Modern has redeemed itself.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-19 23:45:16	The John Martin's Apocalypse exhibit at Tate Britain is terrifying. TERRIFYING. I need to get to a church & start praying for forgiveness.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-19 22:18:09	I love winter walks around London. Everything looks golden today :]
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-18 06:36:31	New Argos ad is bloody weird. Mummy alien mmm's at the thought of Justin bieber. Err, perverse?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-17 05:40:38	Oh no! Poor baby penguin! I hate the scary bits on Frozen Planet :(
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-15 06:47:12	What a day. Won the pitch, went to the theatre with clients & got told off by Alastair Campbell in front of the strategy department. Surreal
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-14 04:37:09	@stephenwake also because they are disgusting. Just saying...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-14 02:10:06	@LaRain__ I miss dancing in the common room with you :(
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-14 02:09:33	@wahabning it was a guy called Roberto who looked & sounded like Manuel from Fawlty Towers! & he was just as clumsy too! Nightmare!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-14 02:07:36	@stephenwake you can do it Steve! Just keep inhaling the pies!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-14 02:00:56	The new Wuthering Heights film is intense & brutal. Beautifully done but don't think I'll be able to read the book again for a long time.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-13 07:07:02	@bexter2001 Smecky Sands, I bloody love you. That is all.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-13 04:24:11	@wahabning I still feel that way dude, but I'm worse off with my hair as it is!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-13 01:00:12	@LaRain__ gravy train!!!!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-12 18:50:47	New favourite snack: tortilla chips dipped in hummus with pomegranate sprinkled on top. Delicious.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-12 04:04:07	The new John Lewis ad is so ace I watched it twice in a row & it made me & my workmate cry. #ohdear #ultimateloser
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-12 03:25:29	Really great day :) about to get even greater - movie night with @LaRain__ !
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-11 05:35:44	Got a pizza & a cab home, BBH sure know the way to my heart. Sleep city, here I come!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-10 02:33:57	@wahabning Wahababa! That tweet has inspired me to make a pitch playlist! After I sleep. Need to sleep first.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-10 02:32:17	@josiet_j haha amazing!! Rolf is such a dreamboat.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-10 02:31:12	@_dokidoki pitch baby! Super fun & exciting but boy do I need some rest
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-10 01:52:01	Have been awake for 36.5 hrs & at work for 34. Think it might be time to go home & sleep...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-09 17:05:48	In another cab. Definitely going to vom. Have been working for 25 hours now (minus my shower break). Determined to make it through the day!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-09 14:07:33	In cab. Trying my best not to vom. Going to blast the rocky theme tune when I get in the office & do a Mr Motivator dance. #pitchtweets
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-09 12:07:53	4am. Leaving work now...to take a shower at home, change my clothes, & come back in for 6am. Sleep? What is 'sleep'?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-09 10:34:09	2.30am. Still at work. Not even close to wrapping up. Have to be here for a 7am start. Wish I brought a blanket & change of clothes to work.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-08 08:09:39	So tired I can't see straight. That was one hell of a 1st day back. On the brightside, the work the team are producing is amazing. Psyched!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-07 05:01:04	@amy_forster so sad Johnnys gone :( me & my sister both thought we heard Dermot say One ERECTION are playing next week... #badbadhearing
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-07 00:58:17	Watching the panicking penguins running away from the killer whales on Frozen Planet was more tense than any horror film I've seen recently!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-07 00:42:03	I want a pet arctic wolf cub!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-06 22:25:37	Have realised Rolf Harris is my dream man: bearded artist, plays piano & accordion, loves animals & has a great sense of humour. #oh god.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-04 18:06:44	Just got called a troll by a gypsy woman...hope she doesn't put a Drag Me To Hell style curse on me... @bexter2001
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-03 23:09:43	Visited the Devils Tower today. Terrifying, felt like a Bond badguys HQ. Probably because it was a Nazi base & later a Soviet spy tower. Duh
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-11-03 17:38:06	There's a Dunkin Donuts on every street corner in Berlin. I'm going to come home fat. #livingthedream
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-31 11:25:30	Trying to sleep on the cold, hard, dirty floor of Luton airport. Can't wait till the day I'm earning enough to book decent flights.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-30 23:53:52	On the way to Sonja's for Sunday in the 'burbs, train smells like poo. Want to burn my nose off. BERLIN in 14 hours!!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-30 22:41:04	Just saw a hilarious new playdoh ad where a kid shouts out 'fun to play with, not to eat!'. Wow. Brilliant.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-30 08:24:21	@wahabning Cringe! http:// twitpic.com/77vpbs
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-30 06:34:46	@wahabning haha! Oh Wahababa, that is amazing!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-30 06:31:44	Just went to a pub dressed as suicidal rapunzel for pre-fairytale party drinks. Crowds reaction was like a scene from Mean Girls. Awkward.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-28 23:06:49	I know this is going to sound ridiculous, but I'm so excited about work that I don't want to go on holiday anymore! #geekout
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-28 21:47:34	@Tomsowerby1 99% yes! Miss you dude!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-28 13:16:25	SO EXCITED
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-28 08:25:01	Just realised I worked 17.5 hours today & have been up for 19.5, but I've got enough energy to (try & fail to) run a marathon. Oh dear.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-28 08:13:04	Just leaving work now, so excited about the meeting tomorrow! Got a good feeling!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-27 14:35:12	@wahabning YES. On it like a car bonnet!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-27 14:34:36	4 days till Berlin 4 days till Berlin 4 days till Berlin
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-25 14:39:49	@stephenwake good to know you're representing the dino love. I sung the theme tune down the phone to reception :]
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-25 04:36:55	@stephenwake hah ace!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-24 06:39:39	So excited about visiting the Tomas Saraceno Cloud Cities exhibition in Berlin next week! Berlin = geodesic dome dream! http://www. hamburgerbahnhof.de/exhibition.php ?id=29989&lang=en …

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-23 21:31:54	Just booked a winter holiday to La Palma with @bexter2001 ! Forget relaxing beach holidays, we're going to the Island of Doom! Hooray!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-22 22:19:31	Second time this week that my mum has told me off for not wearing lipstick. If it were up to her, I'd be dressed in party-wear all the time.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-18 06:29:52	@MechaMorgan you mean teaching yourself art history through wikipedia didn't work?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-17 05:42:54	@stephenwake damn it! That's what my friend said :(
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-17 05:24:39	@stephenwake you need to get over this otter thing. It's clearly a trex. I hate you.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-17 03:48:25	@Carli_H haha! We are thoroughly enjoying your tweets. Becky says you can join us if you lose the fringe. 3 fringes in 1 room =hairtastrophe

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-09 10:14:22	Oh god. Somehow my quiet night in turned into a monster night out, ending with Benny being sick in the cab. How did this happen?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-09 01:10:11	New Yeo Valley ad by @bbhlondon is the best ever. Ever. Now I want a pet owl more than anything. http://www. youtube.com/Yeotube

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-10-01 18:35:51	Manchester bound! Psyched, but I've got a 5 hour coach journey to get through before the fun can start. Cue National Geographic.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-27 02:51:22	Why is it that everytime I get my haircut by a hairdresser I end up looking like a middle-aged lawyer? I like Ally McBeal but come on!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-27 02:26:35	Getting a haircut. Hate hairdresser chat. I don't want to awkwardly discuss reality tv!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-25 06:53:19	Troll Hunter was hilarious but a little too long. (yep, I just spent my entire Saturday evening in the cinema. Odeon is my new home)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-25 03:38:36	Drive is BRILLIANT. In other news, I'm going to move to NY, find Ryan Gosling, & marry him. #NotEvenJoking

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-24 09:14:28	Making Wahab watch Troll 2 for the first time. Watching her reactions is almost as hilarious as the film itself!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-23 04:24:08	Hiccups. I hate hiccups. Would like them to stop now please!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-23 03:53:25	Letting me drink champagne is the worst idea ever. Letting me down champagne is even worse.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-22 01:44:24	About to start a 10k charity walk with the Barclays team. Actually really looking forward to it?! Concerned for my mental wellbeing.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-21 20:50:42	@stephenwake no. Snozzcumbers are disgusting.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-21 17:10:24	The RSC are putting on a Matilda musical?! Ace. Must see. I wish there was a Roald Dahl theme park. BFG dream jars room would be incredible.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-21 17:04:29	Nicest nurse in the world did my blood test this morning, feeling really positive thanks to her. Chin up! :)

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-10 22:49:43	Dancing to Benga at 3.30, followed by cheesy moves to The Village People, all whilst dressed as a bird of paradise. Surreal.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-09 01:23:03	Deep in conversation with Katie on the train when her giant sleeping bag fell off the train rack directly onto my head. Classic jinx moment
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-08 15:18:45	Didn't have time to paint my nails though. Damn.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-08 15:17:48	Stayed at work till 11 last night, then got up at 5 this morning & managed to shower, pack, make a costume, & bake. Feel like superwoman.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-07 14:48:54	@stephenwake shut your face! I've been too busy to be mean to you this week but don't get too comfortable, I'll be back with a vengeance.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-07 05:42:18	So, Jane Eyre was brilliant. Lots of things that could've been improved, but how could I not have loved it? I mean, JANE BLOODY EYRE!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-06 05:51:21	Just remembered I'm seeing Jane Eyre tomorrow!! So psyched so psyched so psyched!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-05 01:24:20	Mona's summary of TP ep 23 - 'Bob is such a douchebag. At least put her somewhere less wooden.' !!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-04 22:10:19	Squirrel pie has quickly turned into 'Giant Owl & Squirrel Army' pie. What can I say, it's Twin Peaks day! http:// twitpic.com/6fzbly

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-04 01:35:57	@murrayjames Ah James it's brilliant! Loved the Vaccines cover & watched the Protect Me video which is also ACE & now stuck in my head!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-01 05:55:04	Celebrated not being pescatarian anymore by eating the best, bloodiest steak ever. & they served us seconds! Amazing!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-09-01 04:02:24	Been waiting in the queue outside a restaurant for an hour. This food better be worth it!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-30 19:44:17	@murrayjames where are you playing today? Can anyone come? x
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-30 06:34:18	Ah Independence Day! By far my favourite alien film of all time. Will Smith & Jeff Goldblum are my heroes.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-30 00:32:32	@amy_forster You are AMAZING!!! That's almost as good as a giant jaffa cake! Please save me some! (just me though, not the rest of the team)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-29 23:18:53	Just saw Sonja's new place, suffering from major house envy. Want my own home more than anything.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-29 16:10:36	@alexjeffries what can I say, I like popping film cherries? Oh dear...

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-28 21:19:59	Another day of Twin Peaks with @bexter2001 , David Duchovny is dressed as a lady yet again. What a guy. & what amazing legs!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-28 02:24:47	Cocktails at Fika with Lally has turned into dinner. Such a piglet. http:// twitpic.com/6c51ce
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-27 23:48:57	Kids are so insightful: http:// twitpic.com/6c2liv
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-27 23:18:18	There's a clip of a cat being saved from a bomb site by soldiers! Any exhibit that features cats is a winner for me.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-27 23:05:37	This too. Kids are great. http:// twitpic.com/6c1vu7
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-27 23:04:07	This made me chuckle though: http:// twitpic.com/6c1uww
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-27 23:01:58	Children at home exhibit at the Imperial War Museum is great/horrible. Lots of tears from me.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-27 21:05:45	@MechaMorgan sure but I would've liked it if people could've looked back & celebrated nice memories, rather than whinging. Forgive & forget!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-27 20:59:09	Not very impressed with the museum of broken relationships. Nice idea but poorly executed. Whingey & cringey.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-26 06:04:44	My sister just asked me what kind of meat is in the KFC chicken wrap... :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-26 03:26:01	@amy_forster haha Amy! Amazing!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-14 20:47:51	Fainted in the shower so I'm late to see a friend. Friend doesn't believe me. Tempted to ditch friend & keep watching Twin Peaks. #douchebag
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-14 03:05:54	My dads summary of Twin Peaks: They live in such a beautiful town but they're all insane. Is this meant to be a comedy?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-13 23:55:31	@stephenwake Now that my rabbits dead, I've decided I'm going to get a pet log.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-13 21:52:00	@Tomsowerby1 @KirstyLaRain Thanks guys, Lionel would have shown appreciation for your kind words by pissing on you. What a rabbit.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-13 21:15:29	My rabbits dead :( RIP Lionel Richie, you were the naughtiest bunny ever, we will miss watching you bully/pee on/attempt to rape the cats.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-13 19:07:56	Today I plan on spending the whole day watching Twin Peaks with @bexter2001 . Ideal.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-13 19:01:47	@stephenwake I did come back douchebag! No videos of my air guitar performance but there are photos. Don't worry, I'll reenact it at work :]

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-10 02:46:17	I love Ealing. Love the leaflets & that the streets were clean when I got home from work & the brilliant/terrible looting jokes. So nice!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-10 02:35:59	Getting pretty sick of hearing sirens. Suggest they make them sound like ice cream vans. Much better. (I realise this defeats the point.)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-09 15:40:45	@thisisthebang hey, didnt get a text but I'm ok, just pretty devastated that my hometowns been fucked over! Thanks for checking though :)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-09 07:40:08	Half of me wants to stay in and cry, other half wants to go out and teach those fuckers a lesson.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-09 06:34:25	Ealings been hit. Terrified & devastated.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-08 06:30:12	LOVE Sister Act too much.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-07 01:49:46	At Field Day. There are a lot of inappropriately dressed people. Do they always dress like that when they go to the park?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-05 05:42:08	Reasons why today was good: won a treat trolley at work, my boss showed my presentation to the head of strategy & dinner at The Dorchester!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-08-01 04:17:42	Today's my first day as a pescatarian. Let's see how long this lasts. Last time I tried I lasted 4 hours...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-07-31 20:01:30	Got flu & I'm heading into work on a hot sunny Sunday to work on an extra project. Oddly enough, I'm really looking forward to it?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-07-31 04:38:46	@emledger my parents thought it was a kids film cos of the clown & left me & my Sis to watch it alone when we were little. Ah! Terrifying!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-07-31 04:13:47	Watching It for the first time since I was a kid. Still terrifies me. Hate clowns.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-07-22 07:53:45	Watching Jackass 3 with the ex & my family. Mum is wetting herself laughing.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-07-21 03:01:00	Missing Beggars Opera because of the rain :( booooooo

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-07-17 03:14:05	Harry Potter party last night, lounging at Lallys today, Whoopi tonight... Still haven't recovered from work summer party :s
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-07-16 02:32:57	@KirstyLaRain shhhhh, quiet in the library!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-07-15 20:32:35	Got into work 2 hours late, whole team laughed at me. Then made crude comment about a guy as the company owner walked past. Feel like death.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-07-15 16:55:47	My whole body aches this morning. Too much shimmying/dutty wining/general shaking of ladybits. Hope I didn't flash my bum/fanny at everyone.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-07-10 21:08:35	Just thought I'd let you all know, I'm quitting my job & staying in Paris forever. Could someone let my boss know?

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-26 03:07:08	This month I've spent 20% of my wages on lingerie. Probably a good thing I'm not seeing anyone, I'd be broke.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-24 07:27:05	Jenny Lewis is the ultimate babe.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-19 09:56:31	Watching 'Dogs In Frocks'. Who thought this show was a good idea?! I mean, it definitely is, & I'm enjoying watching it, but still...weird.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-19 06:44:46	Please can we bring back 90s fashion? Butterfly hair clips included.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-15 03:37:22	The last two weeks have had too many awkward moments, even for me. I didn't even think that was possible!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-14 06:04:39	@LydiarghGrace Watching Predators is never a waste of time x

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-10 03:27:19	At a client party with a free bar. I'd say I spend at least a third of my week drinking with work folk. Ace.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-04 20:03:20	Went to the most bizarre pub ever last night. Had Tinsel chickens in bird cages hanging from the ceiling. Wow. Surreal, but amazing.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-03 22:11:21	First summer Friday at work! Buying ice cream for the team, hope we actually get to leave at 4!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-03 06:23:11	Just attended a great lecture on Digital Anthropology at work. Have decided that I'm terrified of the internet. Oh dear.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-01 06:26:48	I really want to go to bed but last night I had a vivid nightmare about the devil & am too scared to go to sleep now :[
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-06-01 06:25:01	My tummy hurts. I would really like it if someone would rub my tummy. Like a cat.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-31 14:43:11	Ah awkward morning train with an old acquaintance. Way too awkward for my liking.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-31 00:25:46	Reading Strangeland, losing the little faith I had in people.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-30 17:50:36	Ah! My dad & sister are doing a 45 day road trip around Europe & the Middle East this summer. So jealous! Damn work.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-29 16:29:19	Last night I dreamt I had a pet hamster & it drowned in the toilet :( I also dreamt I was eating a peanut butter yoghurt. Weird.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-29 04:54:55	Really like all of these: http://vimeo.com/alexbohs/videos
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-29 00:26:54	Tracey Emin, what have you done to me! Drained & inspired by the new Hayward exhibition.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-28 20:22:18	Made friends with 2 grannies & a guide dog on the bus. Love Saturdays.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-26 20:14:57	Chairman of the company just serenaded me with Sade songs. Love my job.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-26 17:30:41	Made the mistake of listening to LBC this morning. All this playboy talk is making me lose the little faith I had in people. H8 THE WORLD.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-26 17:01:50	I feel woozy.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-26 15:36:00	Blood test in an hour. HATE BLOOD TESTS, PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME GO
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-25 06:37:11	Spent the evening organising my bag into neat little pockets. So satisfying/lame.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-21 05:39:10	Today has been pretty intense. Looking forward to a day of reading, lounging, & Tracey Emin tomorrow. Ideal.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-20 22:37:32	Half day at work, off to 'team bonding' BBQ. Schwing!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-20 06:26:59	I fucking love Sufjan Stevens!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-19 20:44:47	Such a good exhibition, I don't want to leave! Might just spend the rest of the day in here...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-19 20:21:07	Seriously though, all this mind blowing is hurting my head.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-19 20:18:24	Ahh! Anish Kapoor just totally blew my mind with When I Am Pregnant. Dizzy from all the mind blowing.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-19 18:49:20	I know it's ridiculous, but the Whisper Song makes me so happy.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-19 06:09:21	Have come to Manch to see sister. Sister has just told me she's got so much work to do, she can't even come get me from the station. GR8
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-19 05:02:11	I wish Zeus was my homeboy.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-19 04:59:57	Dear Zeus, Sorry to bother you twice in one night but would you mind striking lightning on the loud people chatting on my train? FANKS BABES
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-19 03:36:52	Dear Zeus, I promise I will be good forever & ever if you don't make it rain in Manchester tonight. Yours faithfully, Shadi
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-18 03:09:54	In the GP's waiting room. Dreading my appointment. Hate doctors.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-17 07:40:02	Boss gave me free tickets to see Inception at the IMAX. Forgot how frustrating the ending is. Guaranteed vivid dreams tonight.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-15 23:45:30	At the Barbican 70s NY Performance Art exhibition. Mind has been sufficiently blown for the day.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-14 22:21:02	Worried I'm getting ill again. Thought I'd made it to shallow water. Wrong again. 'Rolling me over the waves will shoulder me under'
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-13 07:25:45	Dear Pink Floyd, Mind. Blown. Many thanks, Shadi.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-12 21:38:21	Was making tea & singing Patrick wolf songs, only to realise he's sat in the room next to me. Heartattack ensues. I am so uncool.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-12 20:21:23	Patrick Wolf & Roger Waters today. I am excited.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-12 15:28:57	If Indiana Jones/Fifth Element/Amelie/Father Ted/Allo Allo had a baby, it would be Adele Blanc-Sec. SO GR8. Luc Besson makes me happy.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-12 01:25:42	On my way to Cafe Rouge to get dinner with Becky. Tempted to get a KFC on my way. #foodmonster #neverfull #fattyboomboom

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-11 07:04:07	I forgot to buy train tickets to Manch for Sufjan next week & now tickets cost unspeakable amounts. GR8. SUPER. FANTASTISCH.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-11 06:53:48	For those of you who are wondering what two squirrels fighting sounds like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlVUF6UDcpw #enlightening
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-11 06:49:13	My ex is watching Mars Attacks in bed at The Ritz. I'm listening to two squirrels fighting outside my window. Life isn't fair.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-11 06:44:47	@MechaMorgan Surely that puts you on the competent end of the scale?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-10 00:41:02	Patrick wolf is playing an acoustic set in the coffee bar at work on Thurs. I am likely to be one of the only people to attend. BEST EVER
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-09 02:28:58	I could spend forever looking at this: http://media.skysurvey.org/openzoom.html

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-06 16:40:25	Took my brother to work so he can record a voice over for an anti-bullying campaign. Boss told me off for bullying him. :s
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-06 06:27:07	Have decided that as I've worked extra hard this week, I deserve a lingerie shopping trip tomorrow. Stupidly excited. #ItsTheSmallThings ...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-05 14:39:37	Have just realised I'm covered in cuts & scars from playfighting with cats. Look like a self-harmer. Totally worth it. #CrazyCatLady4Life
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-05-05 02:03:05	Beyond exhausted. Counting down the days till Sufjan. He is my happy thought.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-25 04:02:40	Watched Village of the Damned. It was like watching my worst nightmares come true. Almost as terrifying as Rosemarys Baby. Almost.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-25 00:39:04	Kids in the park have some kind of balloon/helicopter toy. Incredibly hypnotic. I want one.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-24 21:06:47	Mona just said 'even when you were skinny your bum was always big'. EVEN WHEN i was skinny?? For real guys, since when was I fat?!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-22 10:50:58	Something just growled at me from inside a tall bush, then the leaves all started rustling really fast. Freaked the fuck out & sprinted home
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-22 10:11:56	Night ended with riddles on a street corner. Man on bus next to me is crying/swearing about Nazis/hitting on me. GR8

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-15 02:36:13	Have become hysterical. Hands are shaking. Might cry. Might vom. All cos i have to run on a treadmill for 30 mins. I am so pathetic.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-15 02:29:19	If you fancy watching me collapse within 5 minutes of running on a treadmill, watch here & DONATE http://sweat4japan.bartleboglehegarty.com/
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-15 02:12:52	Doing a charity run for work in less than an hour. It's being live streamed on the net. Terrified of falling over/passing out. #OhGod
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-13 02:15:17	Guy I fancy at work bought me an ice cream today. I sent him a thank you email with a picture of a happy cat. He didn't reply. #cringe
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-11 02:32:55	@alexjeffries Alex Jeffries, you giant hussy! ;)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-10 21:43:52	On my way to Southbank to admire art (& @alexjeffries face. What a babe.)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-10 19:29:19	So much I need to do, but all I wanna do is play on the trampoline. With my cats. (it's a good game, trust me)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-09 20:37:43	Got out my dusty sandals, heading to the park to catch some rays & drink some pimms. HELLO SUN
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-09 19:46:06	@alexjeffries Babe, i'm gonna try every chat up line i know on you x
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-09 19:35:03	@alexjeffries Sweet! Royal Wedding weekend! 4 days of PSYCHED. I'm finding stuff for us to do on our date right now x
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-09 19:20:03	@jessiegood ME
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-09 19:14:24	Just booked flights to Rome! PSYCHED. Anyone know of any good/cheap hotels/hostels?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-09 03:18:47	I love it when you get a cheeky bit of fish batter in amongst your chips. #fridaynighthighlights #wildnightin
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-09 03:06:56	@MechaMorgan ditto. Come to London so we can do fuck all/wallow in self pity together. #funtimes
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-09 03:02:48	It's Friday night, I'm a little tipsy, waiting in a queue at the local chippy, gonna go home & eat chips/watch films on my own. #pathetic
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-09 00:05:34	Have left work early to all go to the pub. This job is ideal.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-07 04:23:48	Saw Essential Killing. Fucking intense. Vincent Gallo doesn't say a single word in the entire film. Not a single word. Zilch. Nada. None.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-07 04:20:54	Just got home from the worst date ever. HE HAD FOOD IN HIS MOUSTACHE. Reminded me of this: http://bit.ly/ev4GGg So awkward.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-05 06:27:26	Thinking of starting a blog documenting all the awkward moments of my life. Hope the Internet doesn't run out of space :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-03 23:00:31	It's called Make It Or Break It. Cringe. We are the lamest of the lame.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-03 22:56:19	Me & Mona are crying at some lame Us drama about teen gymnasts. We don't even know what it's called?! #overemotional #totallylame #OhGod
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-03 21:10:18	Hummingbird bakery ain't got shit on me! TWEE AS FUCK http://twitpic.com/4gi76g
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-03 19:42:41	Baking cakes for mum. Mona suggested we decorate them like vajayjays & write 'thanks for giving birth to us!' :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-03 04:50:02	Mona just showed us cat porn, then told me my cats willy looks like lipstick. Worrying.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-03 02:30:18	Felt pretty stupid. Then Mona said 'look, meat on meat!', pointing at her fork piled with roast. Made me feel better.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-03 02:28:41	Went to woods, climbed tree in heels, sprained ankle. Now eating pub roast. Roast is the cure for everything.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-02 07:29:29	I clutched Mona's cat like a teddy bear until she started being nice to me. I refuse to not be loved by a cat.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-02 07:15:50	@LydiarghGrace Also, i want this book more than anything in the world: http://www.nomorefriends.net/
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-02 07:15:28	@LydiarghGrace Yemen! Working at an ad agency! (Bartle Bogle Hegarty - I like to think of them as the Harry Potter of the ad world)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-02 07:10:02	Mona's cat just attacked my face. When I made an alarmed squeak, my mum told me off for being childish. Now the cat is purring. Bitch cat.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-02 04:12:50	My dad keeps playing pranks on everyone. This is bizarre, he's normally so...serious?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-02 04:02:48	My dad told me my mums pregnant. I believed him. Forgot it's April Fools. #BiggestFoolEver
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-02 03:01:09	Today at work I ate dino sweets, was sent a dino email, & there's a giant dino head by my desk. BEST JOB EVER http://twitpic.com/4frv4h

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-01 14:28:56	@Tomsowerby1 Thomas, what are you on about?! Burn After Reading was TERRIBLE.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-04-01 06:08:37	True Grit! Wow! Coen brothers get it right every time! (except Burn After Reading. But we all have off days right?)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-30 21:31:52	@thisisthebang ?! Must have been a great lecture, considering I don't remember it!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-30 01:24:34	@MechaMorgan we had 14 chickens in our tiny London garden so I'm sure 1 on your balcony would survive!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-30 01:23:09	So far, I've managed to embarrass myself in front of the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, & MD at work, all on separate occasions. I got skills.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-29 20:42:51	In Leon eating lunch. Girls next to me are telling poo & fart stories. GR8
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-29 16:00:03	Worst morning. Worst!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-29 03:16:56	'I know how to talk to dogs' - JCVD. Incredible.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-29 03:14:18	Watching JCVD's tv show. He's crying about loving animals/nature & wanting to save the world. What a guy.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-29 03:12:25	@thisisthebang yes please yes please! Sleepovers are my fav!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-29 02:21:30	@thisisthebang I dooooooo! Psyched about tomorrow!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-27 10:13:42	Lars & the Real Girl makes me so happy.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-27 06:25:18	Eating bacon & ranting about how shit people are with Daizy. Ideal. Wouldn't wanna be anywhere else :)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-26 01:44:12	All my team & the teams around me just gave me a round of applause for surviving my 1st week. So embarrassing. Have gone bright red.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-25 07:03:14	@LydiarghGrace I hadn't even thought about work. Fuck. I was just worried about damaging my hair!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-25 06:54:22	Want to dye my hair blue/navy/purple so much. Can't wait till i'm a granny so i can get a blue rinse.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-25 04:17:17	@emledger haha so punk rock!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-25 02:47:01	Got Punk'd at work today. Annoyed with myself that I didn't see it coming. Pretty hilarious though, such an ace team.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-22 21:28:59	@MechaMorgan whyyyyyy! If Pattinson & Timberlake get the leads, I will burn down Hollywood.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-22 16:34:26	Woke up this morning to find that I was using Mona's cat as a pillow. *no cats were harmed in the making of this tweet.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-22 04:56:33	I think that was a good first day. Didn't fall over in front of everyone, didn't say anything ridiculously stupid, still alive. Yeah, good.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 16:55:25	Me? Nervous? Pah! #TryingNotToHyperventilate #HopeIDontFaint #OhGod
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 07:41:18	Blew my brother a kiss & told him I loved him in front of all his friends. He went red & looked like he was going to start crying. WIN
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 07:18:51	Found Lady Gaga boy hiding behind the sofa. Wish I could hide too.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 06:56:09	Just met a girl who told me she signed up to Jewish Society at uni for the speed dating. There's a girl after my own heart.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 06:34:08	Oh no. They've started playing Iranian dance/trance/techno/shit. Cue headache.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 06:27:36	Cute little Iranian boy just told me 'Lady Gaga is the devil' Why you may ask? 'because she lives underground'...right...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 06:16:07	Um, so, just found out Lallys cousin is the author of Catwitch. My mind is blown. That book made me & Mona the people/weirdos we are today.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 05:58:12	For real though, i need to get a copy of this cd. Iranian belly dancing music is insane!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 05:53:51	I always say I'm not gonna dance at these things...& then they put the belly dancing music on. MY HIPS CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 05:46:05	Just had several awkward 'two air kisses or three?' moments. Oh god. Can feel the Iranian women scrutinising my every move already. :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 03:55:51	@thisisthebang hahaha maybe she's just given up on me. Depressing.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 03:50:36	My mother has approved my Iranian New Year outfit, without argument, for the first time in my life. Not sure why.. http://twitpic.com/4bjtir
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-21 02:01:02	New year countdown! Bought new clothes, about to eat traditional meal, started getting new year texts/calls. SO EXCITING. Fav time of year!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-20 08:20:45	Mona's pretending to be pregnant & i have a giant rip in my tights revealing half my arse. They should call us the Sexytehdarzadeh sisters.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-20 03:50:23	Can't believe it's 8 already. Today i did some cleaning and watched films in bed, alone. I also devoured a box of lindor. GR8
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-19 22:58:43	@emledger Haha amazing! There's a drawing of the cat with a witches shadow, would make such a great tat!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-19 22:50:35	@emledger haha I thought you'd enjoy it! Here's another gem: http://twitpic.com/4b24lu
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-19 22:38:46	Also found this gem: CAT WITCH. What more could you want from a book? Some of the drawings are incredible! http://twitpic.com/4b1zsa
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-19 22:32:29	Cleaning attic. Found all my Roald Dahl & Goosebumps books. SWEET! This one used to give me nightmares... http://twitpic.com/4b1xgx
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-19 22:00:51	So excited about Iranian New Year/Spring that i'm actually enjoying cleaning my room. Even did some dusting. Spring does weird things to me.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-19 18:56:03	Got my brother into BSS & Alkaline Trio. MUSIC WIN. If he plays Bruno Mars one more time i'm going to go insane.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-18 07:40:37	Mona just licked soap. Thought i didn't notice. Tried to justify her actions with 'but it tastes so nice!' It's good to have her home.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-18 07:38:53	@alexjeffries Ooh Circe! Good call. I would totally turn my enemies into pigs. Missed you too beautiful :] xx

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-17 18:20:27	Decision made. Start work at BBH on Monday, which coincidentally is the first day of Spring and first day of the Iranian new year. Nervous.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-17 08:36:51	Today's been a pretty bizarre day. I spent a good 5 minutes watching a cat have sex with a pillow. Can't really get more bizarre than that.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-17 07:34:40	@emledger Just thought i should warn you, i am going to steal your cat/parrot.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-17 01:10:28	@jessiegood I love avant garde b horror French movie things. They're my favourite.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-17 00:55:00	Perving over gimp cats & cereal with @jessiegood is the best. We're definitely not watching P.S I Love You though. That would be lame...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-16 21:55:11	Really sick of nosey people. Had an email from uni acquaintance asking me to get him a job in advertising. :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-16 21:13:34	@thisisthebang boooooooooooo
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-16 20:58:16	@MechaMorgan Agreed. It's difficult not to be misanthropic when there are douchebags out there using death as a tool for self-promotion.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-16 20:34:54	@MechaMorgan Déjà vu. I swear you've tweeted that before?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-16 20:25:27	@Carli_H I bow down to you, Queen of Puns.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-16 20:03:25	@thisisthebang if it is, then I'm gonna steal him from you. Mostly because I've always wanted to ride in a sidecar.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-16 19:54:20	Shadi's interview tip of the day: Don't do cat impressions in interviews. Or talk about dinosaurs. (face palm)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-16 19:52:36	@thisisthebang hah! I hope you sent it to a pervy old man. I hope he texts you back!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-16 19:46:15	@thisisthebang nothing! I'm receiving texts fine from everyone else?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-16 18:04:57	Of course me & Lara spent the train journey to work/interview singing J-Lo songs. Of course!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-15 06:42:52	Nichole de Carle is without a doubt my favourite lingerie designer, but she's just such a fucking diva. Makes me glad i'm outta Selfridges.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 23:05:46	I eat the hearts of baby lambs for lunch. No, really. So tasty.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 22:42:15	@thisisthebang i'll bring you potato salad.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 20:14:41	@thisisthebang because I am a clumsy awkward fool, of course!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 20:14:16	BLEUGH.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 19:18:28	At BBC. Have nail varnish in hair & had awkward moment with receptionist. No surprises there then.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 15:46:51	I love it when i wake up to find both my cats in my bed, snuggled by my side. I feel loved.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 03:45:04	@LydiarghGrace It is indeed! Raptors are the worst. They're too clever and menacing. AND they have sharp teeth and claws. Bad combiination.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 03:43:52	Is it weird that i think T-Rex's are incredibly cute? It's their itty bitty arms & ginormous thighs. So cute.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 03:31:08	I hate Raptors. They give dinosaurs a bad name.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 02:34:02	Please will someone get me a pet baby T-Rex. Fanks #lostworld
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 02:01:58	@Carli_H amazing! You gotta do yr stick people drawings to go with it as well! Would be so great!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-14 01:54:23	@Carli_H Please start a film blog where you retell film plots!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-13 20:31:02	@alexjeffries definitely! Can't wait!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-13 15:29:35	Still sick. it's going to be a long day. :[
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-13 10:03:56	Still sick. It's gonna be a long night.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-13 10:03:23	@thisisthebang moi?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-13 08:16:38	I'm definitely not watching Sister Sister clips. That would be totally lame of me. (GO HOME ROGGGEEERRRR)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-13 07:36:58	Went for dinner with my ex last night, now we both have THE WORST food poisoning. Conclusion: No more dinners with ex's. FEEL LIKE DEATH
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-12 23:45:03	Slept with mouth wide open entire journey home. So sexy. Boys-please form an orderly queue.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-12 21:38:00	@Carli_H I love giant walking flowers. Especially brass playing giant flowers. They're my favourite. After you.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-12 21:27:08	Don't want to leave Bmouth. Wish I could kidnap @Carli_H. London isn't London without her.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-11 04:48:51	Maple syrup & bacon & pancakes + steak & root veg + oysters & shelled prawns & linguine vongole = best food day ever.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-11 02:54:32	At Corfe Castle, making friends with the sheep :) http://twitpic.com/487hh2
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-11 00:54:22	@thisisthebang I'm in bmouth till Saturday so anytime after that! :)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-11 00:20:57	I GOT IN! BBC! Just got a call from the pm on The One Show! Oh my god! Can't stop screaming/crying! B B C
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-10 22:11:06	Ah! Got an interview with BBH on Tuesday! Ahhhhhhhh! Schwing!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-09 19:31:26	Should not be on a train when I feel like this. Journey from hell. Need some Bmouth sea air to cure my ills.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-09 17:39:58	I'm giving up life for Lent. #20ChickenNuggets #GonnaVom #NeverEatingNuggetsAgain #whhyyyyyyyyyy
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-09 11:35:00	Ate 20 chicken nuggets. And fries. I'm a sick human being. My head feels like it's on fire. Must not vom on bus.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-08 21:52:18	@Carli_H Lizzie would love that pun!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-08 21:11:21	Oh, and got pancake mix on my hoody so it looks like someone came on me. Pancake breakfast was a great success!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-08 21:07:16	Made pancakes for boys, then kirsty smashed a jar, i spilt pancake mix on the floor, & we cleaned the kitchen. The irony is not lost on me.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-08 19:39:35	Bought Kirsty red carnations. International Womens Day is my equivalent of Valentines.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-08 08:25:12	Cat pie & Chaplin at Kirstys. Ideal. http://twitpic.com/479xcu
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-08 02:56:45	Please can someone get me this for Iranian new year! http://twitpic.com/477kic
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-08 01:54:26	Bought 'the boys'. Least lady choice possible, but Garth Ennis! Darick Robertson! ...I'm a terrible lady.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-08 01:37:07	& they're playing Springsteen...ideal.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-08 01:36:08	@a_howlett I'm gonna try! Thanks Alice :)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-08 01:35:38	Since when did Ealing Waterstones stock GNs?! & they have lady ones! Can't choose which one to get...could get them all...goodbye savings!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-08 00:47:31	@a_howlett amazing! I want watermelon nails!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-07 15:21:42	Fuck it. I'm wearing the cat print dress.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-07 15:08:23	I look like a law student. Wish i could wear my creepers and biker jacket. FEEL SICK
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-07 05:10:15	In other news, BEECHER HAVE REFORMED! 17-yr-old me is ridiculously psyched: http://www.beecher-online.com/
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-07 05:03:01	Worst case scenario: am awkward & intense, word vomit over interviewers. Best case scenario: am less awkward & intense than usual. GR8
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-07 05:02:42	Seriously freaking out about tomorrow. Am infamously terrible at interviews. Must not talk about vajazzling or murderering people. :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-07 04:35:55	My dad is a terrible Antiques Dealer. He loves his antiques too much to sell them. On the brightside, our house is like a museum!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-07 00:28:05	Mona's interview advice- 'just jam your hype ok!' Yes, ok, i will try.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 21:00:53	@HonkATonk not sure that's actually him - the account hasn't been verified. If it is him...he loves tegan and sara?! It can't be him.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 20:32:21	Might have just eaten 12 Weetabix...Guess that means i've got my appetite back then!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 07:54:01	@Carli_H or LOL + ROFL + LMAO + ROFLCOPTER + OGIGWM (oh god i'm gonna wet myself)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 07:45:59	@Carli_H still laughing. oh god. you know it's been a slow day when you spend 2 minutes laughing at a tweet. FML
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 07:44:27	@Carli_H That made me laugh out loud so much that my cat awoke from her sleep, just to give me a dirty look. SO GREAT
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 07:40:46	@Carli_H Also, woah at my pent up aggro?!! Sorry to sound bitter, it's probably because i am. It's been a tough couple weeks!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 07:39:06	@Carli_H Agreed. This scene would've been so much better if he called her a bitch & threw a bomb at her at the end: http://bit.ly/G62kz
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 07:25:06	@Carli_H hahaha carli harraser, you're film commentary is GREAT, miss you man, love Snobooby x
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 06:29:50	Um...did anyone else just notice Germaine Greer eyeing up Jedwards bottom?! #24pp
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 05:49:46	Have discovered this evening that the meaner i am to cats, the more they want to play with me. Wonder if this works with people too...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 05:04:29	Freaking out about interview outfit. Can i get away with wearing my cat print dress? You think i'm joking, but i'm being deadly serious.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-06 01:20:04	SO GREAT: RT @emledger "SHUT UP, CRIME!" - http://thedailywh.at/2011/03/04/movie-trailer-of-the-day-8/
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 23:13:21	Just realised you can see my nips through this bra. GR8. Cringing.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 23:11:57	Note to self: Must not walk around house in bra&shorts when 12-year-old brothers friends are visiting. Awkward.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 22:56:26	@LydiarghGrace Also, it's good to know I’m not the only comic loving, film adoring, toy collecting, television show watching type geek :]
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 22:55:27	@LydiarghGrace Definitely! I wanna go to them all, line up is so good! Especially can't wait till critters/tremors & showgirls! Ideal.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 22:36:05	@LydiarghGrace Also, your blog is EXCELLENT.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 22:30:02	@LydiarghGrace Naked, of course. All the best things are done naked (birth...sex..umm, showers?)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 22:28:56	This were a good thing what i liked: http://bit.ly/idsy6N (also, they are wearing Dr.M-blue tshirts, should i take that as a sign?)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 22:06:01	Have an uncontrollable urge to paint my room Dr Manhattan blue. Finding it difficult to think about anything else. NEED TO CONCENTRATE
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 22:01:23	@MechaMorgan Your mother is a wise woman.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 18:37:16	It's nice to see someone 'sticking it to the man' etc etc but he's still a knob. I wonder what his motivations are... http://bit.ly/hvSr6J
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 18:00:35	Hah!: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnxNnJYziMY&feature=youtu.be&hd=1
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 00:47:27	Me & Kirsty were teasing her cat earlier so now he keeps sneaking up & clawing us :( revenge of the killer kitty.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-05 00:04:21	@jessiegood applied for production management assistant, interview on mon! Eek! Want it so bad! Freaking out!! BBC is the dream man!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-04 21:29:02	How am i supposed to get any work done when Mona keeps sending me these bizarre videos?!: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZprNwUFCHpM

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-04 20:39:20	This has got to be the greatest shark film of all time: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnIcLjNCu5U
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-04 20:34:21	Ahhhhh! #18thCenturyTV humour overload! So good!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-04 20:30:09	I definitely haven't spent all morning looking at pictures/videos of silly dogs when i should be prepping for my BBC interview. :s
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-04 04:59:51	I have got to stop watching shit tv.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-04 04:59:32	According to 90210, Iranians are child pornographers, & according to Glee, people with bipolar rant, talk to teapots & are shit parents. GR8
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-04 04:53:38	@thisisthebang seeing you? :]
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-04 04:32:35	Does anyone have jstor access? I wanna read the rest of this article on gender in rock music: http://www.jstor.org/pss/853570
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-04 04:13:13	@thisisthebang i think the point is that he's a cockfaced selfish shit! He's living in his own dream world!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-03 23:25:55	David Starkey, you absolute wanker. #dreamschool

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-03 20:26:24	I mean, my absolute dream jobs would be working on Kids tv, or Historical dramas/documentaries. Soooo laaammmeee
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-03 20:24:31	Starting to think maybe i should just accept that i am really quite awkward & lame and become a (social) History geek full time.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-03 06:32:06	Trainspotting @PCC. So great. So fucked up, but so great. So depressing & fucked up, but so great.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-03 02:32:49	@jessiegood haha! Chubby little Stanford :)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 23:54:43	@Tomsowerby1 hmm. I'm going to find a solution to that predicament! Promise!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 21:57:21	@Carli_H haha miss you marli! Thinking of coming to bmouth for a couple days next week...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 20:10:15	Booked two tickets for the manch show. Not really a consolation. London tickets going for £160 x2 on ebay. Tempted. But shouldn't. Fuck.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 19:50:45	Can't believe i forgot to book sufjan tickets. So annoyed/upset. I knew i'd forget! Set loads of reminders on my phone and still forgot! :[

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 06:55:27	Mona just suggested that we play spin the bottle. Then she told me not to tweet about it cos 'people will think I'm really incest!'?! :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 06:35:48	We are piglets: http://twitpic.com/45513c
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 06:34:58	Opening our Iranian takeaway boxes is like opening Christmas presents. Really shit Xmas presents. Wish I knew what the orange liquid is...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 06:24:33	Reminds me of guy on bus guessing my ethnicity 'Indian? Egyptian? Iraqi? Muslim?' MUSLIM ISN'T AN ETHNICITY.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 06:21:50	Just got told by an Iranian man that Mona looks Pakistani & I look Indian. Adopted?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 06:12:28	Cringing just at the thought of cringe night.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 06:09:39	New plan: CRINGE night-truth or dare, 90steen movie, prankcalls, makeovers, binge eating, dance routines & spiritual shit (witch/bitchcraft)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 04:58:04	Plan: drink so much we don't remember anything tomorrow, dress as skate witches/grunge whores/goth bitches, stroke strangers beards-psyched!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 00:26:25	@thisisthebang but I really like it :(
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 00:10:03	@thisisthebang spent £200 on clothes when I'm unemployed and meant to be saving. &bought a £140 jacket...mona won't pay more than £20 for it
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 00:04:11	Mona's gonna kill me. :s
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-02 00:02:31	Might have just spent £200 on a shopping trip with Nabila...oops.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-01 22:22:50	When did I change from twee girl-next-door to goth bitch? Today, that's when.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-01 21:15:32	Also, I know you're probably all bored of me saying this, but @AWoodroffe is the loveliest of all. Ever. That is all.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-01 21:14:08	Lovely evening with @MechaMorgan , even though we did watch THE WORST MOVIE EVER. Happy 1st day of March everyone! Spring=favourite
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-03-01 03:10:31	@thisisthebang haha! See me silly! :) miss you xxx

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-28 22:55:43	'you can't piss on hospitality' - also can't piss on this fucking megabus. :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-28 22:52:30	I have Troll 2 on DVD. & I've seen it at the PCC before. Can I justify going again? Probably not, but I'm going to anyway. 'oh my goooooood'
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-28 22:40:28	Trying really hard to think of Plato & More but all I can think of is wee. More's golden utopian toilet isn't helping.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-28 22:37:26	@MechaMorgan oh god. Guy on the coach is watching a loud film on his laptop. Tempted to piss on it. Kill 2birds with 1stone.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-28 22:24:10	On the brightside, had a Eureka! moment in my daydream. Wish I hadn't forgotten my notebook!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-28 22:19:20	I NEED TO WEE. H8 MEGABUS.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-28 20:16:19	@Carli_H I want your job.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-28 18:41:32	Watched Howl last night. Pretentious but good, didn't like the animation though. Also, was it sponsored by Specsavers?! Opticians dream.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-28 08:41:51	In the infamous words of Beverley Knight - ''Shoulda Woulda Coulda' are the last words of a fool'. Such poetry, such insight...such wisdom.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-28 03:13:06	Um, so, first scene of Angus, Thongs & Snogging is like reliving Halloween 2001. So awkward.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-27 23:44:44	Alice Woodroffe = cure for all ills.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-27 08:51:41	At Lallys, dressed like TLC, making 90s music videos. Of course.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-27 04:07:17	@HonkATonk :) you're the best
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-26 20:52:22	Getting so excited about Spring! Can't wait to see my good friend Sun again!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-26 19:55:02	My bros seriously considering becoming a plane engineer...inspired by watching Porco Rosso. He's almost as much of a daydreamer as me.almost
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-26 07:57:09	On the brightside, Turbogeist were excellent (& Nymph too, of course)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-26 07:43:22	@thisisthebang tell me when you're free! I'm free all the bloody time!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-26 07:07:34	@thisisthebang no lie I was gonna text you earlier & ask if you wanted to go out but then realised it's my friends gig. See me soon pls!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-26 05:48:26	Just realised I have a giant rip in my top. My life is one constant fail.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-26 05:42:20	Didn't I say last week that I wasn't going out east anymore? What the fuck am I doing here?!! I'm so weak.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-26 01:40:14	Do I stay in London in the hope that something exciting happens or do I go visit manch, Southampton and Bournemouth? Hmm
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-25 21:06:58	Oddly nervous about seeing the Selfridges ladies again?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-25 20:51:54	First time leaving the house in 5 days. Feel dizzy from all the fresh air.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-25 10:45:32	Can't sleep cos ovary hurts so much. Might go to doctor in the morning?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-25 06:08:48	My left ovary really really really hurts :(
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-24 23:25:05	Why do Iranians put saffron on everything? Fish & chips doesn't need saffron. :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-23 19:30:55	@asthmatickitty Hello, when will the london tickets go on sale? The buy links don't work & i don't want to miss out! Thanks
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-23 00:11:01	@Carli_H yes yes yes yes yes! You just made my day! When are thinking of coming? Yay!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-22 23:40:34	Oh dear. Let the rabbit in the house & now he's causing havoc. Can't get him out. Such a little shit!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-22 23:38:59	@jessiegood oh my god so many great horrors! Can I come over & watch them with you please?!!!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-22 06:17:19	Can't believe the bipolar reference on Glee. So angry I might write a letter of complaint. Not that it will make a difference! H8 the world.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-21 19:03:53	Do i go to Manch this week? Can't decide. Feel like i'm forgetting something important in London
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-21 19:00:17	Is it Monday? Already?!! Not that it makes a difference to me, every days the same in unemployment city.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-20 08:25:27	Best night ever @ThePCCLondon ! So hard resisting the urge to shout out all the troll2 quotes! Must learn Hollys dance.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-20 02:16:05	I hope the trolls of nilbog don't eat me. #irrationalfear
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-20 02:15:08	'oh my GOOOOOOOOooooood'

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-19 17:10:01	I love that my dad didn't ask any questions, just made me tea & breakfast & sent me to bed. Home is the best.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-19 15:25:41	Friends, if I ever suggest going out in east London again, please remind me of tonight. Fanks
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-19 15:24:07	Worst walk of shame ever.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-19 11:33:06	Uh ohhhhhhh. How did I manage to get myself in this mess?! I wanna go home!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-19 07:16:06	@Tomsowerby1 I would give you an obe if I could. Coming to catch tonight?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-19 07:08:54	@Tomsowerby1 too much weed?! Didn't we say you weren't going to do that?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-19 06:58:33	I blame Sonja for anything bad that happens tonight.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-19 06:57:46	I'm definitely not drunk. I definitely didn't paint my nails when drunk. I definitely didn't paint my hands with nail varnish. Definitely.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-19 06:18:44	@jessiegood come to catch! I miss you...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-19 06:18:22	I think I drunk too much already :(
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-19 06:17:53	I have a terrible feeling that tonight that will be both dreadful & amazing. Uh ohhhhhh

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-16 21:52:52	@Tomsowerby1 she's my fav! Have you seen Funny Face? It's the best ever.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-16 21:44:21	Seriously considering doing a Sabrina and moving to Paris for a while. Problem #1: I don't speak French.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-16 21:34:56	@LydiarghGrace the braindead/frighteners double was so good! I hope they do a bmovie one!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-15 02:01:47	Protests in Iran! So haps!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-14 19:33:25	@oliviasinger It's meant to be 'No Strings Attached'. Might as well be called Sex Friends...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-13 11:42:41	@Tomsowerby1 considering we spent the majority of the evening watching people wanking on chat roulette, the drawing doesnt seem that bad!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-13 11:40:57	Would just like to clarify that I was on chat roulette with friends. Was not flashing boobs on my own.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-13 11:22:58	@Tomsowerby1 Lally made me!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-13 11:22:11	Lally is a true artist: http://twitpic.com/3z77bp
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-13 10:55:40	Just tried to make my boobs move up & down for someone on chat roulette. New low.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-12 04:16:34	Uh oh. Looks like I'm back on the Eastenders wagon again...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-12 03:00:28	I'm totally not crying over leaving a two week work experience. That would be totally lame. :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-11 17:08:42	At a recruitment agency interview. Wish I was in bed.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-11 04:09:17	Magic carpet ride http://twitpic.com/3ydsa5
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-10 16:42:17	First one in the office, again. Kinda wish I'd slept a little longer...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-09 16:10:38	Terrible morning. Missed alarm, Used wrong toothbrush, didn't get any work done. Booooo
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-09 04:56:12	I went for pinacchio! He's so cute! I feel bad eating him...but he's so yummy. http://twitpic.com/3xsp11
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-09 04:46:27	Which of these tasty treats do I get? I'm thinking pinocchio... http://twitpic.com/3xsmlo
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-07 21:54:56	Had lunch with the new work experience girl. She told me not to stay late this week cos it will make her look bad when she leaves at 5. :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-07 15:44:27	So sad 90s weekend is over. Still wearing shag bands & peace necklace. Might wear dungarees to work tomorrow...too much?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-04 16:23:07	@thisisthebang should be ok but not sure what's happening with work exp yet, when are you free? X
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-04 16:21:58	First one in the office...all the doors are locked. GR8
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-04 04:37:02	Forgot to close my drawer this morning, came home & found this bundle of joy snuggled between my skirts... http://twitpic.com/3w6o0q
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-02 19:46:07	Didn't get the job, considering i didn't apply & was offered the interview the night before it would have been a miracle if I had!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-02 08:31:31	On my way home. Could have stayed out and had the best time, but no, I'm going home so I can spend all night learning how to edit films. Fun
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-02 03:05:43	Help! Does anyone know any female road trip movies other than thelma&louise + deathproof?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-02 01:02:21	That was the worst interview ever. Not happy with any of my answers. However, just got best project ever!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-01 06:25:05	Although realistically i won't be able to get a wink of sleep anyway so i might as well get some work done!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-01 06:24:23	Can't decide if i should stay up all night prepping for the 7 interviews tomorrow (yep. 7!) or if i should get a good nights rest instead
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-02-01 04:28:38	So today was my second day of work experience at BMB...& they offered me a job interview for tomorrow!!! Won't get it but still! So happy!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-31 11:45:24	Just woke up, today is going to be a long day.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-31 01:01:26	50s/60s Elvis = swoon city.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-29 10:16:40	@jessiegood GAH just realised i forgot to call you after work! i am such an idiot! i knew i forgot something! sorry lady xxxx
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-28 23:16:00	1st day at BMB. Why am i so socially awkward? Constantly cringing at everything I say & do. I'm like a nervous guinea pig.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-28 06:55:12	@Tomsowerby1 I think it's worse that most people don't even know it's going on. They aren't even acknowledging that there's a problem!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-28 03:08:00	Really really hoping that the protests in Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia & Yemen spread to Iran. Maybe this time the world will take notice.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-28 03:00:11	First they blocked twitter, now they're blocking mobile phones. I hope this doesn't become another forgotten protest #egypt
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-28 02:01:00	I must have seen this ep of friends a million times, and I'm still laughing hysterically. I don't even like friends?!! Brainwashed?! Must be

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-26 04:52:04	Why am i watching Teen Mom? More importantly, why am i weeping while watching Teen Mom? Hormone city.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-25 21:48:28	My mum is the best, she shows me her love through chicken pie :) http://twitpic.com/3ta0ng
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-25 20:35:00	As if I wasn't having a bad enough week already, a woman just told me my skirts so short she can see my bum, which FYI isn't true. Bitch.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-25 05:33:34	@rosiebroad haha thanks Rosie! i'm ok, just in a bit of a shit situation, long story! hope to see you soon laddddyyyyy xxxx

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-24 23:10:27	I think its fair to say that i've had a pretty bad day. New Zealand?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-24 21:23:45	Just found out some news that has made me sick to my stomach. Not 100% confirmed so i can't throw around accusations, yet.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-24 19:37:18	@rosiebroad hah Rosie your tweets always make me laugh! Thnx for recommending me for the BMB job, didn't get it but it was a gd experience!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-24 19:35:16	With every door closed a window opens?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-22 04:35:49	Literally can not believe how unjustifiably rude and bitchy some people are. See ya later Ashley!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-22 02:53:32	Also the director gave me a hug goodbye & said im welcome back whenever & the team bought me a Monica Vinader 'Success' fiji bracelet :[ :[

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-21 07:44:38	How is it possible that i got 10/12 on the 1st practice test, 6/6 on the 2nd easy, and found the actual test so hard?! So fucked off!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-21 07:37:08	Still pissed off about the bbc test. GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-21 07:25:18	Just took a timed numeracy test for the bbc. AS Level maths was easy. This test was hard. I didnt even have time to finish it! GAH

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-09 09:05:46	All i want to do for the rest of my life is play. Why isn't 'playing' a career option? I am really very good at playing.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-09 09:01:01	Must resist drunken urge to text people. Must not text people about doing the 'best wee EVER'. Oh no, too late.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-08 08:41:49	I love @ldotbear . Not going to let her go travelling, must find way of making her stay. Hope it snows lots so no planes can leave.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-08 03:32:07	Just realised all the clothes ive bought so far in 2011 (quite a lot) are black. Oh dear.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-07 23:57:44	They're playing @IamAlexWinston in Selfridges. I am going to miss working here so much :(
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-05 22:04:27	Just had a discussion about rape whilst eating jelly tots. Bizarre.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-05 07:47:17	@rosiebroad whats your hair like?! i wanna dye mine my-little-pony purple.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-04 21:53:29	@thisisthebang love the job/team/company but want to do something more creative. Don't really feel fulfilled or challenged! :(
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-04 20:43:46	Just hit me that I leave my job in 2 weeks. So upset I've lost my appetite.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-03 21:23:41	Three Men and a Baby is on! One of my favourite films as a kid.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-02 23:05:45	Just watched Step Up 2 with my mum. Is it wrong that I really enjoyed it?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-01 01:37:06	My ex's dad got awarded an OBE for lifetime dedication to the Navy! Amazing!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2011-01-01 01:15:21	On the train to Dorset, can't wait! Have never been a fan of new years but country weekends with bestfriends are my favourite :)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-31 17:27:25	Fell asleep on train and missed my stop. #biggestidiotof2010
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-30 23:55:34	I just wrote out fabric compositions for 134 items of lingerie. So glad I've only got 2 weeks of this left.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-30 21:28:11	Heimstone pony biker jacket I have been lusting after for months has gone from £2495 to £450 in the sale. So annoyed I lost my debit card!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-30 20:54:22	Practiced my Photoshop skills by superimposing my bosses face on a penguins body. Made her the funniest card ever, so sad to say bye to her!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-28 08:46:09	@Carli_H Thats not a kitten, its a lion cub!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-28 06:32:07	Also, i am pretty convinced my cat is a pervy man trapped in a cats body. He always stares at my bits when i'm getting changed. Creepy.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-28 06:27:34	Mona has just pointed out that 3 of my past lovers look highly similar to Sufjan Stevens. Cringgggeeeeee
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-28 04:08:21	Watching Cry Baby. I wish all men were like Johnny Depp in this film. Swoooon
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-27 22:24:40	@Carli_H Dinosaurs are a real cause for concern Carli, you are right to worry!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-27 11:32:53	My cat just walked in my room, threw up on the carpet, and walked out again. Little shit. Anyone want a fat turd of a cat? I certainly dont.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-27 01:55:15	Romancing the Stone is on tv! Amazing!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-27 01:30:18	Just woke up. It's dark outside. Worst food coma ever. FML
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-26 00:29:37	Food coma.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-25 23:13:40	Also, my dad is looking through a bonhams catalogue...and thinking of bidding on Churchill's false teeth. Legend.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-25 23:12:33	The Grinch! The Grinch! I love The Grinch!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-25 09:25:50	Just set my alarm to 5am, wouldn't want to waste a second of christmas day. CAN'T WAIT.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-25 08:27:13	Hacking into my 12 year old brothers facebook account and reading his messages is my favourite hobby. He's almost as fickle as me.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-25 02:07:04	Fainted, lost my card, couldn't pay for presents, no money on oyster, trying not to cry, worst Xmas eve ever.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-25 00:14:58	Nabila made me a zine about beards for christmas! She knows me so well...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-22 17:46:29	Gonna miss the Selfies team so much, who else would make me Xmas cookies?! http://twitpic.com/3ic0ar
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-22 17:25:06	An old lady told me I'm lovely and there's a hamper of old fashioned sweets at work. Might be a good day afterall!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-17 19:11:07	2 Xmas parties last night so sick twice this morning. Worst. Day. Ever.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-16 20:56:55	Roast pork on tues, beef on weds, turkey today, what meat tomorrow? Christmas canteen food is the best.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-15 09:00:20	Also, i just spent a good few minutes searching for my phone, only to realise it was in my hand. fml

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-13 03:21:06	Sang some of my fav songs and now I feel much better. Singing is my favourite.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-13 03:01:56	Always alone.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-10 18:12:20	Meant to be at Tom's at 12 to go to ATP. Still in bed. Haven't packed. Haven't showered. Should probably get off twitter...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-10 04:23:23	Can't decide what taxidermy to get my sister for christmas. Might get a pigeon as she wanted to set up a pigeon charity. Not even joking.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-09 20:22:03	Rank. Someone sent us used dirty knicker samples to use in our lingerie fashion show. What were they thinking?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-09 05:59:10	Literally gobsmacked. Can not believe some people.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-08 23:56:55	Feel like i've been kissed by a death eater.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-08 03:57:17	Waiting to see the doctor. Hate going to the doctors. Always scared of what they're going to say, feel totally unprepared.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-08 02:28:10	Just saw Xfactor Aiden at Selfridges. Is it wrong that I find him attractive? Yes, yes it probably is.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-07 06:02:00	The X-Files theme tune still gives me shivers down my spine. Will i ever get over my fear of aliens?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-07 01:49:06	Feel like bambi. Really hope I don't collapse on my way home. Hate my crap body. Its always holding me back.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-05 01:55:04	@Carli_H you and your genius mind never cease to amaze me. Curio City sounds like my dream shop!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-05 01:30:53	Can't wait till I have my own home. Instead of an office & tv room, I will have a library & curiosities cabinet.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-03 00:26:52	One of the directors tried to sneakily steal a choc but tripped over & fell into the wall. Must. Contain. Laughter.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-02 17:41:06	If I get one more email about missing samples, I am going to fly over to Italy just so I can bitch slap this crazy woman. Hate divas.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-02 15:58:00	Fuck. Just realised i left £500 of samples on the table at work. Hope no ones nicked them. Terrible terrible terrible week!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-02 15:48:18	Totally unprepared for this weather. I only own mini skirts and shorts. Don't even have any thick jumpers. I live for summer.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-02 08:38:09	@thisisthebang Both, you know me ;]

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-01 21:37:22	Just bought my entire team advent calendars, that's 16 calendars. Christmas does weird things to me.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-01 20:37:49	@oliviasinger on the brightside...um...Christmas? :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-01 18:55:48	You know those weeks when everything that can go wrong goes terribly wrong? Yeah, I'm having one of those.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-01 07:11:28	Harry potter was great. Best bit: when my mum fell asleep and started snoring.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-01 04:21:04	Just realised sara's wearing a snowboarding jacket. :l
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-01 04:18:15	Sara just referred to herself as the 'endearing idiot, the loveable moron'
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-01 04:10:34	Sara on xtina 'I liked her when she was dirty with a double r'
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-01 04:09:44	Going to see Harry potter with Sara... And my mum. Probs should have read the book first...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-01 03:39:26	Why is my brother wearing salopettes...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-01 02:56:04	@MechaMorgan small & mighty> large & flighty
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-12-01 02:15:50	@Carli_H that actually made me lol to myself in public
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 23:32:56	Crying uncontrollably for the past 45 mins over something that I had no control over. Terrible day. Someone send me some funny photos please
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 21:30:04	Changed mind. Want this for Christmas. And an occasion to wear it. http://twitpic.com/3blu8d
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 17:51:53	Must stop daydreaming at work.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 16:56:11	Adding leather trousers and leather hotpants to my Christmas list.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 16:08:28	Wish I didn't have work so I could make a snow fort. Or pillow fort. Or any other kind of fort... I love forts.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 09:41:25	On a side note, wouldn't it be great to have a 60s 'free love' themed wedding. With ideas like these, i should be a wedding planner.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 09:30:57	It's almost 2 & i have work tomorrow, so naturally i am trying to solve the equation of marriage: http://longestnameinlights.tumblr.com/
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 07:21:35	Haha, gotcha! No really though, I should stop that...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 07:20:33	Must stop posting photos of my cats. Must post more interesting things, like this: http://twitpic.com/3bg486
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 07:08:56	He's so handsome... http://twitpic.com/3bg169
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 05:19:29	Becky screamed in terror when I walked in the room. I know I'm no Aphrodite but really? It was like Freddy Krueger had just walked in!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 04:21:32	My brother is wearing a onesie. My brother is fat. Tempted to take a photo so I can mock him till he's old...but that would be mean, right?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 03:57:35	@oliviasinger 7-6?! That's terrible! Blog more please, your blog is inspiring.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 03:52:49	With that noted, I am off to Beckys to swoon over Don Draper. What a man.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-30 03:51:45	Currently my days consist of work 9-7 followed by Mad Men till I fall asleep. Doesn't leave much time for starting a blog worth reading...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-29 23:24:38	Crisis averted. Must not be like the girls in Mad Men who constantly cry in the toilets. It's just work right?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-29 22:57:51	Have fucked up big time. Trying not to have a panic attack. Trying not to cry. Don't know what to do. Fuck
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-29 21:31:51	(says the girl that bought £300 shoes and a £100 ring in the last month. What have I become.)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-29 21:30:44	I've decided Selfridges should pay me to tweet for them. I could do with another pay rise.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-29 21:28:39	Please can someone buy me this for Christmas.. It's only £10,000... http://twitpic.com/3bbr2d
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-29 21:08:44	@MechaMorgan bloody link won't work on my phone, I want something interesting to read in my lunch break!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-29 06:30:53	@jessiegood I wanna see you too! Tuesday eve, my house, movies? X
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-29 06:29:16	My cat brought me a welcome home gift. It's nice to know she cares. http://twitpic.com/3b5lqj
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-29 01:23:59	Bus driver said we're on our way to Glasgow. Almost had a heart attack. Turns out he was joking. What a guy
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-29 01:12:57	Would also really appreciate it if he would stop staring at me. I hate 99% of people.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-29 01:09:59	Creepy man on bus next to me, trying to start convo. Oh god. All I wanna do is zone out to Smashing Pumpkins. As Dr M said 'leave me ALONE'
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-28 07:21:18	Not going out, staying in and watching movies on my own. Such a granny.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-28 06:42:36	All the kids wanna go out but I just wanna watch movies in bed. Lame.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-28 03:22:58	Aside from Nabila, mona's housemates are monsters. Glad I don't own a gun, there would be a massacre.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-11-28 01:23:49	Got id'd in Lidl. I'm 23. My 20 year old friend however, did not. FML

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-04-09 01:58:01	Iranian family dinner with special guests Kirsty LaRain and Becky. So psyched!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-04-08 02:46:21	WHY AM I SO AWKWARD. Oh gawwwwwd. Someone needs to teach me phone etiquette
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-04-07 07:18:53	Oh also, was meant to go to a Scott Pilgrim preview but the spaces filled up so they paid me a tenner for standing in the queue?!! Sweet.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-04-07 07:17:15	Yet another great evening, watched Weird Science with Kirsty and the merry men. Should really do more dissertation work though...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-04-06 06:11:22	Watched Ghoulies at Kirstys. They are so cute! I want one.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-04-06 02:20:14	@oliviasinger a friend of mine at work got a free black herve leger dress the other day! I almost died of jealousy
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-04-05 06:12:52	Watched Tie Me Up Tie Me Down. She fell in love with him way too soon. All in all a great film though.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-04-02 07:03:38	Something very bad just happened. On the brightside, tomorrow is going to be such a great day. AA sale, brick lane, iranians, kick ass, pub.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-04-01 05:34:48	Except for the dissertation situation, that kinda sucks
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-04-01 05:34:36	Squeeeeeee! Really excellent times!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-31 07:23:31	Watched Taking Woodstock. Now all i want to do is roll around naked in a festival, possibly in mud, most definitely in a theatre group.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-29 23:46:36	Painting my nails, watching youtube links & buying awful/amazing horror films with my favourite Kirsty :] Not doing dissertation work. Uhohs
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-29 17:53:19	Got a study date at Kirsty's today. Just gotta force myself out of bed first...

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-24 06:04:03	I always forget how much i love Queens of the Stoneage. Mosquito Song is probably one of my favourite songs ever.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-23 16:01:51	@bexter2001 Maybe we should just do power walks/jogs and get a fitness dvd...or go to yoga classes!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-23 16:01:27	@bexter2001 Those prices are insane!! I paid £75 a YEAR at uni!! Though i know we won't find a deal that good anywhere...

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-21 22:20:30	@bexter2001 'Fun, watchable, a bit silly and disjointed' YOU DID NOT JUST GO THERE
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-21 09:32:26	Also, saw old piano teacher from when i was 13. She said she didn't recognise me. I said thank god. She agreed. I WASN'T THAT UGLY.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-21 09:31:42	Slutty dresses + Slutty/Iranian dancing + Hannah & Rosha + Iranian Food Feast = Great Night!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-21 04:02:21	Realllyyy don't want to go to this Iranian party. Full of gossips, snobs and suck ups. Middle aged Iranian women are the worst ever.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-20 20:03:12	@bexter2001 I'm ok, more importantly, HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY AT WORK!!! miss you maaaan

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-20 03:29:14	This week has flown by, very excited about Iranian New Year tomorrow! My favourite day of the year by far. Spring makes me happy :]
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-17 04:47:03	Now there's an old lady rubbing her boobs....
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-17 04:32:28	I thought this was meant to be a ghost story?!!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-17 04:32:11	Longest sex scene ever. Including a toe fetish.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-17 04:29:07	Watching Don't Look Now with Becky. The nudity is so unnecessary!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-17 02:53:43	@Carli_H incredible!!!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-17 02:51:29	Feel so immensely HAPPY today! Spring is my favourite! :]

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-16 03:54:36	My dad bought me the most beautiful Accordion today as an Iranian New Year gift. So sweet! Can't wait to learn how to play it!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-15 17:56:06	Oh my goodness i am so excited about SUMMER + FESTIVALS + PICNICS + BEACHES + THE SEA + FRIENDS + HOLIDAYS. Life will be so SWEET
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-15 16:04:20	Woke up early to write an essay, painted my nails instead...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-14 21:06:07	Got Red Hot Chili Peppers stuck in my head. How random.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-14 17:22:50	I watched Tracey Beaker this morning because i couldn't be bothered to change the channel. Oh gawd.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-13 07:36:40	Watched Shutter Island with Becky tonight. INCREDIBLE. One of my top ten films of all time maybe? Definitely a NINE out of 10!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-12 03:02:28	The Metro was so funny today. Also, i am dying for a doner kebab. Also, last day of internship tomorrow, so sososososo sad.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-07 06:14:50	Watched Deliverance. INTENSE. Nightmares tonight. Inbred people scare me the mostest.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-06 02:36:42	Why do i have muslce pain in my thighs?!! Please please please can these be late growing pains! All i want in the whole world is to be tall!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-05 07:12:21	Watched Teeth. Disturbed at first, now i kinda wish i had my own extra set of teeth...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-04 02:31:45	Pretty sure i'm forgetting something really important but i just can't figure out what...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-03 07:16:40	Just watched Beaches. Totally wept. I love Bette Midler. She's just so...Jewish.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-03 04:38:00	Feeling pretty optimistic that i can manage a full time career job AND graduate this summer with a 2.1. WATCH THIS SPACE. IMA DO IT.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-02 22:52:26	Reassessing life with Elizabeth on Founders field on a sunny day. Ideal. Looking forward to our study date and this afternoons lecture!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-02 00:51:56	Has anyone read Lucky by Alice Sebold? Is it any good? Also, is Lovely Bones any good? I can't decide if i would love or hate it...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-01 19:32:33	Also, last night i wished for sun and today it is ridiculously sunny. Maybe next time i will wish for a million pounds...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-01 19:31:25	Just had a lecture on the Supernatural. History is so rad.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-01 03:15:00	@emledger I miss you too ladyyyy!!! What're you up to these days?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-03-01 02:54:38	Oh Gawwwwdd my 11 year old brother is throwing a preteen tantrum. He just told me he hates me for being bipolar. I hate him for being FAT
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-28 21:09:57	I could take a shower, clean my room and write my essay...or i could watch Hollyoaks, play with my rabbit and eat my bodyweight in food. Hmm
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-28 01:00:55	I love Maury. Why isn't he on tv anymore?! He is the King of chat shows.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-26 06:10:12	I am so worried about my mum?! What if they find out she protested and arrest her? What if she never comes back??!! Fucked up.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-25 16:20:08	My mum is stuck in Iran. They aren't letting her leave the country. It will be at least a month before we can get her back. I hate Iran.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-25 03:46:43	I quite want to get into Eastenders again. God knows why. Can anyone update me on whats going on?!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-24 07:14:56	Had the nicest night ever, minus the tears at the end! I am such a cry baby
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-23 03:40:06	I wish i could spend the rest of my life just studying. I want degrees in english lit, philosophy, architecture, graphic design & textiles.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-20 17:51:38	I have come to the resolution that i am the unluckiest person that ever lived and that the fates are plotting against me. That is all.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-20 10:15:50	The only things that saved tonight were Thom & Farida and ghetto kareoke with Sara.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-20 10:14:18	BRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-20 04:29:27	'This year im going to be easy.' THIS IS WHY SARA IS MY BEST FING
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-19 15:59:15	Old toy syndrome. On the brightside, at 8 o'clock this evening, i will be in Manchester.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-19 03:50:48	I know i should be packing for Manch, or writing an essay, or cleaning my room...but all i wanna do is sleep...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-19 02:15:42	@MechaMorgan Whats How It Is? Why have i not heard of it??
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-18 15:54:46	@MechaMorgan that was the greatest advert EVER! 'I'm on a horse.' SO GOOD
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-18 03:24:38	Becky said i have to go on a healthy food diet from today onwards but i dont wannnnnaaaaaaa. I want CAKE
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-17 07:32:19	Watched Hotter than your Daughter with @bexter2001 . Quite disappointing. Its nowhere near as good as Snog, Marry, Avoid.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-17 04:18:13	Fav chatup line: 'you've got something on your face...' 'what is it?' 'ME' IM SO USING THIS ON FRIDAY NIGHT

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-16 05:44:18	@bexter2001 you would make a really good roman catholic church.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-16 04:50:39	@bexter2001 Kirstys dad sung that to me when i told him about the ghost :] What if it starts haunting me like in Paranormal Activity??
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-16 04:41:27	Would really like it if my so called 'friends' would stop pushing me to find them jobs. I am not a careers service. Grr. Arrd.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-16 04:33:09	@bexter2001 no but thanks for reminding me. I get scared just THINKING of The Omen. Scariest. Horror. Ever. Maybe i'll watch it now...

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-16 04:18:17	@bexter2001 AMAZING. You and your dad make me laffo
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-16 04:11:55	Went to Kirsty's house to escape the ghosts. Made friends with her cat who normally doesn't like me. This makes me unbelievably happy :]
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-16 00:58:56	When he jumped up he knocked over my collectable piggy bank and cracked it :[ Silly cat
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-16 00:57:44	My cat was lying on my tummy all serene & then suddenly jumped up onto the windowsill & is now terrified of something in my room. Im scared
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-16 00:03:42	Things i would like to do this weekend in Manch: Cinema (Wolfman?), Manchester Art Gallery (animalation), Whitworth gallery (wallpaper)
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-15 23:09:20	My teacher made us do embroidery in our history of the home class. I got frustrated and sewed a raincloud on my inital. I ain't no domestic.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-15 19:10:00	'Why not peace between eagles and vultures and man?' AMAZING
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-15 19:09:44	I want to see this so bad: http://www.viceland.com/blogs/uk-film/2010/02/15/birdemic-is-the-new-best-worst-movie-ever/
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-15 18:22:06	Fuck. I forgot it's reading week. I just came all the way onto campus, feeling mega ill, to find that it's reading week. FML
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-15 17:06:40	Oh gaaawwwd, fainted in the shower again. Worst way to start a day. Wish i could skip uni today.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-14 21:17:52	Scared and dizzy.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-14 20:38:52	Happy BARFday
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-14 02:59:37	Watching The Thing. Such a great film.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-14 02:06:54	Umm, apparently T-Rex's are only 4 metres tall. Thats like 2 and a half people. THEY ARE TINY. Jurassic Park lied to me. I feel deceived.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-14 02:04:14	Maybe its because i can't imagine anything bigger than a T-Rex. Becky says Blue Whales are bigger. Is that true? Thats kinda scary.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-14 02:02:20	What do you guys think God looks like [if he exists]? I know its a little odd, but i always imagine he/she/it as a T-Rex. Don't ask me why.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-14 01:45:33	Watching The Love Bug with @bexter2001 . Herbie the car is trying to commit suicide. Comedy gold.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-13 23:51:49	Quote of the day: "Look I only had sex with you because I was drunk from all those WKD's u made me down and I was feeling fat!"
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-13 23:15:55	@thisisthebang YOU'RE THE ONE THAT BROUGHT IT UP
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-13 21:24:42	@thisisthebang They were pretty! I did NOT like the back entrance suggestiveness! NO ONE IS ENTERING MY BACK DOOR
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-13 21:24:02	I wish i could just hibernate for a couple months and wake up in the summer
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-13 20:47:34	@thisisthebang shup slag, YOURE easy
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-13 19:36:33	@EdwardStroud hahahha thats cool, i just think these days they are more about fashion than about politics
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-13 19:19:40	@bexter2001 ...i just woke up...
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-13 19:18:07	@EdwardStroud The times they are a changin

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-13 18:47:53	@EdwardStroud DMs are not lesbotic. You are wrong.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-13 11:44:14	@EdwardStroud DMS ARE AMAZING
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-13 11:43:49	Two tonk black men came on to me tonight. THAT is the kind of guy i attract. Great.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-12 01:42:11	My 11 yr old bro made a heart keyring with the slogan 'give it to your wife and have a good night'. Dirty child.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-12 00:08:24	RIP Alexander McQueen
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-11 06:56:51	All i want in the whole wide world right now is for someone who cares about me to hold me and tell me its going to be alright. Dark days.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-10 00:39:02	@MechaMorgan Possibly because they sound like middle aged dad-rockers.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-08 23:31:26	About to leave the comfort of the library and head to the office for interview. Really dreading it even though the last one went well.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-07 22:32:05	I do however love Spartan women. I think my essay on Spartan women i wrote in 2nd year is probably my favourite essay i've ever written.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-07 22:31:43	Watching 300. So unsure about this film. Its visually true to the GN but honestly, i never though much of the GN to begin with. Too basic.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-05 05:50:50	Today my boss said that she knew i was shy because i have long hair that covers my face. Maybe i should cut my hair?
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-05 05:01:19	Do i go to Manch on the 12th for Your Mamas Cookin or 19th with Sara? Sara is my favourite but i miss all you manch lovelies already!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-03 06:26:52	I haven't cried this much since i was sent to hospital.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-03 06:20:41	I can now add Jonny to the list of 'guys that hate me and will never speak to me again', alongside Stephen
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-03 04:03:02	Very sad. Would like it if someone would call or skype me ASAP.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-02 15:59:30	My favourite thing to do in the mornings is to do silly dances on my bed in my undies to early Springsteen. Best way to wake up :]
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-02-02 04:51:28	Pretty gnarly Alan Fletcher exhibition with @mechamorgan at the Cube followed by an excellent drive home with agony aunt Alex :]

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-01-29 03:12:26	Quite sad about J.D. Salinger. Nothing dinner with @bexter2001 won't cure though!
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-01-29 02:29:08	Just ripped my new stockings. So mad.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-01-29 01:47:50	Also, today i applied for my first real job. I am so nervous/excited about this.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-01-29 01:37:01	Lunch with lego today. The new Lego Star Wars is awesome. Also had breakfast with Katie Price's agent. Not quite so awesome.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-01-28 07:12:39	Saw Laura Veirs with Sonja at Union Chapel. SO FRIGGIN GOOD! Better than i remember her being!

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-01-27 03:55:16	Watching Save the Last Dance. I LOVE THIS FILM. I feel like i'm 13 again.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-01-27 02:34:31	Winona Ryder in this film makes me so sad. Whyyyy did they cast her? She deserves better roles than this.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-01-27 02:11:09	Watching the recent Star Trek movie. I really enjoyed this in the cinema but i just can't seem to get into it now. Maybe it was all the hype
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-01-26 00:10:55	I need to learn to be less personal over the internet. Maybe i will start writing in a diary.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2010-01-25 02:42:34	Uh Ohs. Mona is out on Friday. My friends are all busy. I am going to be stranded in Manchester. Not good.

26771040	Shadi_Sade	2009-08-19 18:20:48	Listening to Owen to calm me down as a trawl through these death-inducing essays. Missing my fella. Counting down the seconds till New York.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2009-08-19 18:05:48	And Plato. Plato writes for 5 year olds. Socratic dialogue is made for simple people. Repetitive and annoying. I am in a foul mood today.
26771040	Shadi_Sade	2009-08-19 18:04:43	Aristophanes is the worst writer ever. All his plays have the same stupid plots and fart jokes and ego boosting rants.
