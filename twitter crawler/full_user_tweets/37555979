37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:52:18	@painspeaks hugglesnugs - i gotta get busy on my next post, but food first. LOL my stomach thinks my throat's been cut . . .rest well
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:47:30	@painspeaks he'd make more in about 6 hours than he brings home from michaels in two weeks
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:45:32	@painspeaks need to start pushin hubby a little, too - thinkin he's not good enough to play solo, but two gigs waitin on him say diifferent
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:41:36	@painspeaks it's outrageous . . . is why i'm so focused on making a living without having to depend on some blasted corp
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:39:29	@painspeaks i actually made almost $100 MORE sitting on my butt for a week drawing vacay pay than i get for working
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:38:09	@painspeaks so i did . . . and they cut my hours back to 20 or less a week cuz i'm not available 2 days a week now
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:37:07	@painspeaks the manager had the nerve to tell me that if i wanted to actually make enough money to live on, i would have to get 2nd job -
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:35:04	@painspeaks yeah, i figure if what i'm doing isn't working, it's time to do something else, and kroger is NOT working LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:29:37	@painspeaks but i have some ideas for unique stuff, so that should help. gotta get my life together, i'm tired of being "stuck" LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:27:27	@painspeaks it is - now it's just a matter of getting some content up and getting traffic going. There's lots of competition
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:24:53	@painspeaks as soon as i can afford it. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:24:35	@painspeaks gotta get a shopping cart set up, and work on getting traffic to it - and i found a new deck i really want to use
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:23:14	@painspeaks it's fun - i've started doing a daily post that combines numerology and tarot, lots of work, but i think it'll be worth it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:20:43	@painspeaks yeah, i haven't posted on tycl in forever, and don't get to do wego any more either cuz i always work on tues
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:19:51	@painspeaks nice! that's a HUGE improvement.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:18:58	@painspeaks been doing tarot readings for one of the phone places, working on setting up my own business doing tarot and numerology
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:17:55	@painspeaks messed around and made some changes on the website, and screwed everything up, but doing a new site now -
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:16:26	@painspeaks he plays with a band one night a week, and as soon as he has enough material, he's got two regular gigs he can get as solo act
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:14:56	@painspeaks still at the deli, but this store is SO much better than the old one. Hubby's fine, and is practicing every day
37555979	kimmieCollas	2014-08-22 11:09:51	@painspeaks holy cow! that's a lot of weightloss, AND a lot of working out.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 12:16:05	@painspeaks but you know me - i always find a way to survive, and i'll do it again, in spite of my employer
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 12:14:53	@painspeaks I started it while i was cut off from the net, and now that I have access so i can do the research, i'm working on it again
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 12:13:25	@painspeaks the place i work is gonna be sorry though. never piss off a writer. my next book is going to be about retail wage slaves
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 12:11:08	@painspeaks although we may end up having to take him to the ER and hope that THEY can arrange for the surgery before he dies

37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 12:08:55	@painspeaks what i was actually told was that they only help in "dire circumstances" like a death or hospitalization where bills can't be...
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 12:07:59	@painspeaks although if the pain causes him to stroke out or have a heart attack, they MIGHT consider helping me (my interpretation)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 12:06:26	@painspeaks and only full time employees are permitted to insure dependents
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 12:05:44	@painspeaks that should be covered by insurance, even though the reason he doesn't have insurance is bcuz they won't let me work full time
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 12:04:18	@painspeaks which has an emergency assistance fund, won't help because the fund isn't intended to help with medical expenses

37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 11:59:21	@painspeaks nobody will even talk to us unless we can pay in full, but after 5 years of part-time retail work while trying to find >

37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 11:56:07	@painspeaks oh, the rant made me feel a little better, but there's not likely to be much sleep going on
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-10-25 11:52:36	@painspeaks and the rest was about the retail industry and how they f@ck their employees and the taxpayers to increase their profits

37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:32:04	@tibetanterrier7 it is insane, but that's the way SS works. They hope you'll die or give up before they have to give you any money.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:31:11	@painspeaks @tibetanterrier7 survivors indeed, if not we'd have killed ourselves years ago
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:30:11	@tibetanterrier7 he was trying to get her hearing moved up cuz of the situation, bt SS was fighting him
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:28:32	@tibetanterrier7 yep, sure nuf did. He had 1 client that got turned down at steps 1 and 2 even though she was bedridden and dying of cancer
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:26:17	@tibetanterrier7 @painspeaks only time i can catch them is on days off - bus doesn't get me home til midnight
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:19:02	@tibetanterrier7 @painspeaks me too, but it also makes me mad to know there are so many of us
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:17:55	@tibetanterrier7 @painspeaks better believe they would change! F@#ckers wouldn't deal with our lives for a week before they cracked
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:16:28	@tibetanterrier7 thanks - i applied, bt wait for hearing is 3 years, and was starving so had to find any job i could
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:14:19	@painspeaks yeah, was thinking maybe foodstamp office one day, bt gotta go get replacement DL and SS first. Lost wallet at train station.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:12:07	@painspeaks plus, instead of walking about 3/4 of a mile each way, it's over a mile between getting 2 bus, bus2train, train2bus, bus2store
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:10:30	@painspeaks the two hours IS on the bus . . . we live on the other side of town now, and none of the stores on this end will let me transfer
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:08:52	@painspeaks exactly! I've even considered begging on the street, but not QUITE there yet (I still look too healthy and well-fed)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:06:29	@painspeaks i've only met one person in our building, and he works days. I'm never here when the neighbors are (unless they're sleeping)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:04:28	@painspeaks hubby offered to drive me, but can't spare the gas, he's got to be able to get to work til thurs on what we have
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:03:05	@painspeaks finally managed to kill the vomiting with ginger tea, but it was bad for a while
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 12:01:58	@painspeaks nothing worse, and with no phone, had to walk down to the complex office to call out. About a quarter mile each way - urgggghhhh
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:58:32	@painspeaks and spend that trying to catch up the things i can't do on work days (like sleep and laundry)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:57:37	@painspeaks i'd go back on foodstamps if i could ever manage the time to apply, but almost never have more than 1 day off at a time >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:55:49	@painspeaks it's gonna get better tho - got a couple of mag submissions out, and working on some proposals and queries for freelance work
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:54:00	@painspeaks tell me about it - the only reason I'm home is because it finally caught up with me today & i got up with a migraine (w/puking)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:51:17	@painspeaks yep I'm gonna apply for one of those Safe-Link phones, & the hell with his pride. Not like folks that call know its a freebie
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:48:19	@painspeaks he's got a job, but they're giving him less than 20 hours a week, plus he's got a 15% garnishment, so not a lot of help
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:44:17	@painspeaks acck - more than 140. lol anyway, was supposed to say "more than 20 hours straight"
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:42:48	@painspeaks i DO miss writing, but the sleep deprivation makes it almost impossible. In 2 weeks, I had 4 days where I was up more than 20...
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:41:04	@painspeaks hubby keeps putting in apps, bt we frequently can't keep the phone on, which screws up his chances
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:39:41	@painspeaks yes, too many hrs (AND not enough hours) 20 hrs a week commuting, + 25 to 35 working, but never enough money for bills & food
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:37:34	@painspeaks 2nd marriages usually work out better than 1st ones - we're smarter about it after we mess it up once
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:34:20	@painspeaks i've been trying to get my vacation for a couple weeks, but no joy yet - & put a link on the group page if you want more details
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:31:48	@painspeaks good for you, time off is great, and weddings are fun . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-03-19 11:25:58	@painspeaks the job is killing me, i'm broke as hell, and I can't keep up - in other words, the usual LOL How are you doing?

37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:50:59	@painspeaks no sleep for a while - gotta finish laundry & make smokes. NiteNite - hugglesnugs (4/40 is 40 hours in 4 days)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:48:43	@painspeaks i'd not only have 3 days a week off, I could write (or clean) between calls - doin 45 to 60 hrs a week now with commute
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:45:33	@painspeaks the job is 40 hours a week, but it's a 4/40, customer service, and you can do what you want between calls
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:39:09	@painspeaks it's why cops always look at the spouse first when someone is murdered . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:38:12	@painspeaks LOL know what you mean . . . marriage is a def challenge sometimes, and you do learn each other's buttons.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:31:18	@painspeaks best thing about that job is that they provide the comp, AND pay for phone and internet (business class!)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:27:48	@painspeaks and changing others isn't possible, but i'm really proud of you for refusing to allow him to reabuse you.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:25:59	@painspeaks between rent & utilities, it costs double what it cost at the cottage, and that doesn't count bus fare and xtra gas for him
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:24:31	@painspeaks the worst thing about not having time to write is the cut in income . . . especially with the higher expenses
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:22:36	@painspeaks awesome! heck of a milestone, especially with chronic illness in the picture. you should be proud of that!
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:20:51	@painspeaks she was probably as afraid of him as you were
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:19:03	@painspeaks yeah, they do, and she has to live with him. At her age, leaving him wouldn't be much of an option.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:16:02	@painspeaks good for you! he needs to know that he doesn't get to treat you or your family that way any more
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:12:57	@painspeaks yeah, i remember. was wondering how that was working out
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:11:04	@painspeaks but! there's a job fair for a company a friend works for that's "work from home" - gotta score 35 wpm & 90% accuracy
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:08:17	@painspeaks LOL "torture by job" That's a perfect description. As for sleep, I don't much. Also don't have time for writing
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:06:54	@painspeaks i sure can't see YOU starting something like that . . .and good for you for cutting contact! hopefully you can resolve it.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:05:04	@painspeaks so why the heck did it get so bad you got in a physical fight with your dad? or rather, why did he attack you?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 13:01:54	@painspeaks hubby's doing much better though, and is still working, though he's started asking me to break his arm every time he has to go
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 12:58:55	@painspeaks and they mostly schedule me 7 and 8 hour shifts now, some of which are turnarounds (get off at 10pm and have to be back at 9am)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 12:56:52	@painspeaks so for a 6 hour shift, i'm gone anywhere from 9 to 12 hours, plus I walk about 3 miles getting to and from buses and trains
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 12:54:57	@painspeaks the schedule is that I now live on the other side of town, and it takes anywhere from 1.5 to 3 hours on the bus (each way)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2013-02-08 12:52:11	@painspeaks woohooo, it's a Lizzie! family drama sucks. Love the new place, been adopted by a kitty, and still the same job.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-09-07 12:38:28	@painspeaks yeah, i noticed a minute ago that you're on late . . . I'm gonna lay down too, wait for herbs and heat to help so i can get busy
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-09-07 12:36:50	@painspeaks plus, we're prolly gonna get a 2BR cuz there's a special, and that will give me a place to work away from the tv, AND meditate
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-09-07 12:30:08	@painspeaks plus i'll have to take the bus to work, so can rest instead of walk. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-09-07 12:29:27	@painspeaks i think gettin moved will help. More room means easier to keep up, kitchen means less time cooking and cleaning,

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-09-07 12:18:54	@painspeaks i do get upset about it when he does it, but it's usually bcuz he doesn't have enough ppl to do the work, not cuz he's mean
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-09-07 12:16:21	@thevalcat @painspeaks thanks Valerie - I hate moving worse than anything in the world, but I can't WAIT for this one.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-09-07 12:12:27	@painspeaks told my boss today that we found an apartment, & he said to let him know when we were moving so he could give me time off
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-09-07 12:09:58	@painspeaks i'm LOVING his extra hours, cuz it's giving me alone time when I'm NOT asleep . . .I've missed that
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-09-07 12:08:55	@painspeaks boss has been doing better with the schedule, thank heavens, and hubby's still down, but not as bad as he was.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-02-29 05:54:27	@TiffanyAndLupus I keep having to remind myself that it's their right to choose to complain without doing anything, & not my responsibility
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-02-29 05:37:14	@TiffanyAndLupus exactly. And it can be frustrating when some1 SAYS they want better care bt won't DO anything to get it . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-02-29 05:26:40	@TiffanyAndLupus LOL - I know so many pts that just sit back and let the docs make the decisions, then wonder why they still feel crappy
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-02-29 05:06:40	@TiffanyAndLupus docs provide advice and tools, but *I* make the final decisions, even if that decision is to let them choose . . . #HAchat
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-02-29 05:05:01	@TiffanyAndLupus it took me years to figure out that my healthcare was MY responsibility - I see my docs as "advisors" #HAchat

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-02-29 04:57:34	Takeaway: AND communication is KEY, less communication = less effective care #HAchat
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-02-29 04:56:48	Takeaway: informed, confident patients get better care, simply because they know what's going on and can catch "mistakes" quickly #HAchat

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-02-29 04:43:29	T3.1: Communicate, communicate, communicate. A doctor who won't TALK to you, or explain reasoning when asked is a waste of time #HAchat

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 11:59:18	@nursefriendly BUT, when i no longer had insurance to pay them, suddenly i didn't need meds bad enough for anyone to help me get them
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 11:58:35	@nursefriendly i had to find out about the others online, AND i was told meds were my only treatment option
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 11:56:55	@nursefriendly yeah, when they put me on olanzapine, the only side effect they bothered to tell me about was excessive drooling

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:50:07	@MHSMchat they MUST at least tell the family what to watch for, even if they don't tell the pt #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:48:33	@isalwayssick they don't have that right though. if its something dangerous, especially #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:47:35	@MHSMchat side effects should never be presented as "you WILL," always as "it's possible" even when they're common #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:43:50	@ShyDi47 i was on psych meds for 5 years, the only time they did bloodwork was when i was inpatient for 2 wks #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:41:50	@kimmieCollas and that's not my opinion, that's the law #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:40:59	if we don't understand what we're told and make a bad decision, that's on us, but if they don't GIVE the info it's malpractice #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:39:15	@MHSMchat both - the doctor has an obligation to provide the info, but we have to learn enough to use it #mhsm

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:37:43	i found out the hard way, by losing my ins and having to come off cold turkey, that the meds made me worse #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:35:59	@isalwayssick if i'd been given the information, i would not have chosen meds, and would have been better sooner #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:34:46	@ShyDi47 i've been clinically depressed for more than half my life (suicidal, mostly) talk therapy helped more #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:33:28	@MHSMchat not without consent, but without the information i needed to make an informed decision #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:31:19	and for things like depression, that meds aren't the only option - talk therapy, etc are also effective #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:30:25	my biggest issue with consent is doctors who don't bother to tell you the dangers of the meds they want you to take >> #mhsm

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:26:23	that's totally unacceptable on the part of both the doc AND his parents #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:25:48	i dated a schizophrenic at one time who had no idea the meds he was on were causing sexual dysfunction, and blamed me #mhsm

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:21:35	@MHSMchat i'm not willing to let any stranger, even a doc, make my decisions for me #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:20:35	@MHSMchat nobody EVER told me what the side effects were, i had to go find out for myself #mhsm
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 10:19:12	@NAMIMass that's why my husband has a durable power of attorney, so that if the doctor tries to say i can't consent, hubby has the pwr #mhsm

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 04:31:29	@TiffanyAndLupus that too. another thing that pisses me off. I think anger plays a role for a lot of us. #HAchat
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-11 04:29:32	T2: but I think what really pissed me off was when I realized I knew more about my illness than my doctors did #HAchat

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 08:41:01	@RobertLBynum now i'd be doing my own risk/benefit analysis, rather than letting someone else decide for me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 08:38:38	@RobertLBynum yeah, they did that with me a LOT. at one point, i was on 5 psych meds and 8 or 9 for other stuff, not counting "as needed"
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 08:31:12	@RobertLBynum not the doc's fault of course, they didn't know very much about that stuff back then, and i didn't do my research
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 08:03:26	@RobertLBynum my doctors did - for years i just did whatever they told me to
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 08:02:04	@RobertLBynum got it, you've got "mail" LOL - i gotta run eat while it's hot, bbiaf
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 07:56:03	@RobertLBynum then add high levels of excitotoxins like MSG, and huge levels of aspartame . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 07:54:48	@RobertLBynum throw in the risperdal i was also on for years, random antidepressants, methotrexate and a lousy, nutrient deficient diet . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 07:47:00	@RobertLBynum and i was put on Lipitor almost as soon as it came out, and kept on it until 2008 when i lost my ins
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 07:46:04	@RobertLBynum that's exactly what i think caused mine! most of my symptoms parallel statin damage almost exactly,
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 07:41:31	@RobertLBynum and the idea that it also happens in physical medicine doesn't surprise me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 07:40:43	@RobertLBynum i have noticed how many "normal" human behaviors have become mental illnesses in the latest DSM though
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 07:39:02	@RobertLBynum life would be pretty boring if we all thought the same thing all the time
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 07:38:17	@RobertLBynum and polite discussion never offends me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 07:37:56	@RobertLBynum i wonder if my fibro was caused by drugs. (and the first drug for fibro was approved in 2007, i was diagnosed in 1994)

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 07:26:29	@RobertLBynum it probably helped that my major was comp sci, and there was a lot of math/statistics required
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-08 07:25:20	@RobertLBynum looking for other options led me down all kinds of interesting byways

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 17:34:26	@jorawstron i'm just avoiding added msg, because it's an excitotoxin, and my system is "excited" enough
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 17:29:21	@jorawstron the parmesan i buy doesn't have any MSG in it, just milk, cheese cultures, salt, and some enzymes
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 17:20:52	@jorawstron a lot of herbs and supplements can have dangerous interactions with prescription meds
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 17:20:17	@jorawstron there's some serious research to be done before adding herbs though, especially if you do take prescriptions -
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 17:15:49	@jorawstron B complex, C, and magnesium. Eliminating artificial sweeteners made a huge difference in my pain levels, and I'm working on MSG
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 17:14:04	@jorawstron it's an NSAID, and i use it for the arthritis. The stuff I take regularly is ginger, turmeric, and skullcap, fish oil, vit D
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 17:09:36	@jorawstron no insurance means no doctors, and no doctors means no meds. I was on about 12, and had to go cold turkey on all of them
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 17:08:01	@jorawstron but i didn't have a choice in the beginning, i lost my insurance 5 years ago, and HAD to find another way to cope
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 17:06:09	@jorawstron i manage with ibuprophen, herbs, supplements, meditation . . . and LOTS of epsom salt baths
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 17:00:06	@jorawstron except an occasional painkiller (maybe half a dozen times a year)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 16:59:26	@jorawstron LOL - I've probably been there and done that . . . more than once. I actually don't take any prescription meds (cont)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 16:34:25	@jorawstron you're very welcome. Always glad to help. I've been doing this shit for almost 20 years, so I've prolly been there at some point
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 16:24:35	@jorawstron the theory is that the magnesium from the epsom salt is absorbed through the skin and eases the pain
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-07 16:23:14	@jorawstron add 2 cups of epsom salt. It always makes the bath work better for me. (Sea salt helps too, but not as much.)

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-05 13:42:51	@painspeaks i think it was a joint project. Jody cooked it, and hubby brought it down so i wouldn't have to go upstairs to get it.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-05 12:01:40	@pamfb7557 not MUCH better, but a little. LOL The only saving grace is that I have some great customers, and I like most of my coworkers.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-05 02:59:27	@DiamonDie exactly . . . the pricey bit I understand, but synthetics better than natural cuz they cost more? that makes no sense to me.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-05 02:08:15	@DiamonDie probably because allopathic doctors only prescribe the synthetic. Most patients don't even know there's a natural version
37555979	kimmieCollas	2012-01-05 02:01:08	@DiamonDie probably because healthcare here is a for-profit enterprise with very few regulations or restrictions

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-12-29 13:04:26	@painspeaks pffft, as far as i can tell, the IRS is the only place hiring full-time workers, and it's all in collections
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-12-29 12:46:15	@painspeaks and our clothes. Everything else we have belongs to the roommates except 1 plate, 3 bowls and some ziploc containers

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-29 13:13:27	@painspeaks i want a goat, but living in the city means no livestock. a nanny would be nice for milk,
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-29 13:11:20	@painspeaks yeah, i do. I also miss the fresh eggs. My ex and i raised chickens, and the eggs were so much better than the ones at the store
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-29 13:09:56	arrrrggghhh, who are all these porn star types that are suddenly following me, and how did they find me!?!?!?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-29 13:07:19	@painspeaks there are a FEW advantages to working at a grocery store. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-29 13:06:37	@painspeaks i'm gonna be watching the cranberry celebration to get close to last day of sale so i can mark it down . . . it's yummy
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-29 13:04:09	@painspeaks yeah, my grandma raised chickens, and we had one of them for dinner just about every Sunday when i was small
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-29 13:02:15	@painspeaks i figure he is more than worth the pain though. we should get 8+ pounds of useable meat out of him, & that's a lot of meals
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-29 13:00:22	@painspeaks but if he'd still been alive, i wouldn't be able to eat him. I don't eat things i know personally. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-29 12:55:24	@painspeaks hubby has a JOB! it's seasonal, but it's still a job! I'm so excited
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-29 12:43:14	@painspeaks yay for low pain! mine was too until i walked home from work carrying an 11 pound turkey. (couldn't pass up a $35 bird for $5)

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-28 13:50:34	@painspeaks it's a new junk fee they've added. you have to pay $25 per bag to check anything, & since there's so much you can't carry on..

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-28 13:33:40	@painspeaks i hate planes because they make it so hard to take all the stuff you need.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-28 13:31:17	@painspeaks yeah, they keep messing around and making things harder
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-28 13:25:41	@painspeaks but driving is expensive, cuz you either have to HAVE a car, or rent one
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-11-28 13:25:00	@painspeaks busses are a pain . . . actually, trains and planes are too. I like driving because i'm a bit of a control freak

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:48:17	@painspeaks I was pale, and sweaty, and shaking like a leaf when I came out of the bathroom, and she told him that when he came to check
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:47:04	@painspeaks oh, they could tell by looking at me I wasn't faking, and luckily there was someone in the breakroom when I came flying thru
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:45:40	@painspeaks yep, that's pretty much it. the only time you can do anything about it is if they violate federal law
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:43:48	@painspeaks the boss hasn't given me any crap about going to eat since the day my blood sugar got so low I had to go throw up
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:42:51	@painspeaks then she stayed 45 minutes late, even tho I was only gone 20 minutes.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:41:44	@painspeaks when I got back from eating tonite, the girl that covers for me smarted off "I guess you know you're makin me late clocking out"
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:39:41	@painspeaks none here. GA is a "right to work" state, which means they can fire you for anything - my boss is okay, it's the other workers
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:34:54	@painspeaks from low blood sugar before I finally got a chance to make a run for it tonite.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:33:18	@painspeaks like they're supposed to if i get a line. Plus, they get all cranky when I go to take my break. I was ready to pass out >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:32:00	@painspeaks the people that are supposed to be my "back-up" are at least 50 ft away, across the bakery area, and they NEVER come help >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:29:08	@painspeaks >> be behind the counter waiting on customers, AND out on the floor stocking & rotating, AND cutting meat for sandwiches
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:25:33	@painspeaks honestly, i'd rather be shot than go to work. It's horrible. There's never more than one person, and they expect us to >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:19:01	@painspeaks cool. it's gone over really well, got a bunch of clicks on here, too.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:18:22	@painspeaks I HATE that damn place.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:17:50	@painspeaks need to write an article before I go to bed, one of my guys wants the one I've got started on juicing, (& work is USUALLY bad)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:14:02	@painspeaks did you see the link to the laundry detergent recipe on the group page?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 12:12:35	@painspeaks work totally sucked, and I need to take something, but don't feel up to dealing with finding food yet . . . LOL the usual
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 11:51:07	@painspeaks hey girlie, how's you tonite? pain better?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-13 11:50:12	@DownSouthKisses cool. That works too, I just prefer liquid detergents, and the liquid works btr 4 dishwashers.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-12 12:21:06	@painspeaks ehhh - it happens. I'll be fine by tomorrow, and ready (but definitely not willing) to do it again. LOL

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-12 11:21:28	@painspeaks hate that you had a bad one today too.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:33:27	@painspeaks tell ya what. I'll do a couple posts on the blog & send you links, that way you can print em, & they'll be available for every1
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:27:22	@painspeaks if you relight it before the essential oil has a chance to evaporate off the wick, it can blaze up and burn you, or start a fire
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:26:29	@painspeaks if you get the essential oil on the wick, you have to wait at least 24 to 48 hours before you can light it again
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:25:25	@painspeaks add 1 or 2 drops of essential oil to the wax, WITHOUT getting it on the wick, and then relight the candle.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:24:13	@painspeaks you have to burn the candle til you have a nice pool of melted wax around the wick, put it out,
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:22:55	@painspeaks yes, BUT you have to add the essential oil in exactly the right way or you'll have a fire . . . it's REALLY flammable
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:21:25	@painspeaks got all of that too, but luckily cats aren't one of the things that sets it off. The exertional asthma is the worst tho
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:14:56	@painspeaks AND, that way, I can have a different scent every time I light it if I want to
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:14:15	@painspeaks for candles, i always buy unscented. If I want scent when I burn them, I know how to do that safely too,
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:13:02	@painspeaks i mostly make my own bath salts too, but love trying new stuff, and i've got a real thing for candles, too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:12:06	@painspeaks and the stuff i used today was all natural herbal extracts and essential oils in a blend of diff salts
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:11:05	@painspeaks me too, but with my asthma, i can only use natural scents, fragrance oils and other chemical smells KILL me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:09:33	@painspeaks shake well before using . . . LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:09:13	@painspeaks rinse out 1 of the bottles the gel stuff comes in, put in about 1/8 C bleach, 1 C hot water, finish filling w/the laundry stuff
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:07:24	@painspeaks and it only takes 1/4 C per standard size load - we use it for the automatic dishwasher, too-
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:03:58	@painspeaks it comes out the best if you mix it every 30 minutes or so while it cools, so that it doesn't separate as it gels
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:02:51	@painspeaks add 2 more gallons of water and mix well (I add it 2 qts at the time, mixing the hell out of it every time with a whisk)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:01:19	@painspeaks once the ivory is completely melted, pour that on top of the borax & washing soda, and mix it til it's completely dissolved
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 12:00:16	@painspeaks dump the borax and washing soda in the bottom of a 5 gallon bucket (3 gallon will hold it, but 5 gallon is easier to get)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 11:59:07	@painspeaks oh, it's easy . . . 2 cups of borax, 2 cups of washing soda, 2 bars of ivory soap, grated up & melted in 2 qts of boiling water
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 11:55:54	@painspeaks spent some time making a bucket of laundry detergent, so i won't have to mess with that again for about 3 or 4 months
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 11:34:32	@painspeaks it goes . . . too fast. LOL gotta work tomorrow, an i dun WANNA go to da awful place
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-09-11 11:14:13	@painspeaks awesome! the friend hubby was visiting in CA sent me some great bath salts, and they actually did what they said they would

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:35:40	@painspeaks well, if i just sit here and whimper, there's no way i can pull a miracle outta my a$$
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:29:12	@painspeaks hubby told me to start looking for a nice box to live in, preferably one that's waxed to keep the rain out - LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:28:07	@painspeaks it's not gonna be very pleasant around here for a while, i'm guessing - pup in a foul mood, jody not happy & hubby, well . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:22:28	@painspeaks staff, but if they don't pay him, all he can do is take em to court, and by the time he gets the money it'll be way too late
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:19:11	@painspeaks what's worse is they may not even pay him tomorrow. He was havin trouble with them payin him late as it was, & they may keep it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:17:27	@painspeaks i'm having a bit of trouble believing that at the moment . . . lately, seems like every time 1 thing goes right, 10 go wrong
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:13:07	@painspeaks oh, YES
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:12:42	@painspeaks and pup is talking about we need to be lookin for a place to live cuz he's gonna have to put the house on the market
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:11:47	@painspeaks so we may be living on the street in a few weeks, there's no way i can pay rent & utilities anywhere else on $200 a week
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:10:31	@painspeaks well, we now have four people trying to live on 2 part-time incomes. the roommate that was working full-time got fired today
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:06:51	@painspeaks and i'm not real sure my grin works any more
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-15 11:06:26	@painspeaks ya don't wanna know how my thursday was LOL

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-12 00:48:39	How awful is this??? >> Popular Painkillers That Can Cause Killer Pain | | AlterNet http:// bit.ly/pyjcQs

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-10 12:36:34	@painspeaks i need to, it's just scary to put myself out there. This one wants a sample post, & adding even 1 more thing is overwheming
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-10 12:27:51	@painspeaks & i DO know about social marketing, just not my best subject. LOL for $80 a post, couldn't hurt to apply tho.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-10 12:26:14	@painspeaks there's another listing that i keep eyeballing, too. it's outside my area of expertise, but it pays $80 a post . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-10 12:24:57	@painspeaks wouldn't have to worry bout hubby finding a job, so he could wait til he finds something he likes
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-10 12:23:03	@painspeaks so reducing the hours @work by enough hours to cover the new responsibilities would double my income
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-10 12:20:51	@painspeaks yeah, i quoted them $20 an hour, so i'm really hoping i get it. that would completely replace what i make, in 1/3 of the hours
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-10 12:06:44	@painspeaks but i got my fingers crossed. applied for another online thing, and if i get it, i'll be able to cut my hours @deli
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-10 12:05:18	@painspeaks just seemed like the thing to do . . .LOL. an i'm grumpy, don't like my schedule for this week. *giggles*
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-10 11:24:59	@painspeaks *stealth hugglesnugs*

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 13:11:10	@lissyvz67 i WILL be wrecked, but nothin i can do. i like to eat, and if i give him shit he'll get rid of me . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:41:05	@painspeaks hugglesnuggles to you - rest well.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:35:07	@DownSouthKisses i use lots of peppermint, too, applied around the doors and windows it keeps the crawly bugs out of the house
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:33:44	@painspeaks worn out. got home at 11pm, gotta be back at work at 9am. should be asleep, but my body wanted to know why we were in bed early
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:31:20	@DownSouthKisses i use a lot of essential oils, for a lot of different things. I really like citrus ones for cleaning
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:29:14	@SarahBear9708 >> will usually unstuff my head within about 15 minutes, and the same thing will help with headaches, too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:28:08	@SarahBear9708 i even use it as a "decongestant" for my sinuses. 2 drops on a Q-Tip, applied to my forehead over my sinuses, >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:25:59	@SarahBear9708 it's great. I usually buy a new bottle when the one i have is a little past half empty cuz i WON'T be without it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:24:41	@SarahBear9708 4 or 5 drops in a box of baking soda, allowed to sit for a day or two, then sprinkled over the carpet b4 vacuuming kills odor
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:23:05	@SarahBear9708 >> that helps ease my psoriasis and keeps the mosquitoes away, a drop on my pillow helps me sleep, >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:20:38	@SarahBear9708 about 5 drops mixed with a couple of tablespoons of coconut oil it's a soothing, itch killing skin moisturizer,>>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:16:04	@SarahBear9708 i pay anywhere from $5 to $7 for a one oz bottle, but for most things it only takes a few drops. I use it for cuts, burns >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:09:34	@SarahBear9708 i've gotten it there before. i normally buy the biggest bottle i can afford, cuz i use it for TONS of stuff, & use it FAST
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:07:05	@SarahBear9708 i get mine at the local organic grocery store, or you can order it online . . . and it helps with the itching, too.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:01:48	@SarahBear9708 lavender essential oil seems to work pretty well to keep most bugs away . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 12:01:01	@lissyvz67 i got home at 11, and gotta be up by 7 so I can be back to open at 9.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 11:59:34	@lissyvz67 uggggghhh. sorry fuckers. . . (although i hate my job enough i'd prolly celebrate if i got sacked. LOL)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 11:57:37	@lissyvz67 "out"? what on earth have i missed?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 11:56:29	@lissyvz67 with all that, i'd definitely be doing the same thing. gotta be scary as hell.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 11:51:12	@lissyvz67 i'd prolly feel different if i DID have risk factors . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 11:50:20	@lissyvz67 doing a preemptive strike on the possibility of the big C, huh? Dunno that I'd be willing to, but I don't have any risk factors >
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 11:48:01	@lissyvz67 i've got my fingers crossed for you, you need OUT of that awful place you're working now.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 11:46:44	@julianna12369 LOL - that sounds about like Freyia's evil bark at the invisible ppl that aren't wandering around the back yard . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 11:39:18	@lissyvz67 cool - boob sandwich done for another year. LOL. How did the job interview go?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-08 11:25:49	@painspeaks WOOT! It's a Liz! How's the back and the bruising?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 14:19:45	@DownSouthKisses you must be skinnier than i am - lol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 14:16:33	@DownSouthKisses i'd rather deal w/ a bath thn wht 1 of my #spoonie friends calls #fibro torture yoga (btr known as cuttting ur toenails)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 14:08:49	@TooOld4ThisCrap the answer to that one is "the same thing that burned the hair off your ass"
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 14:05:10	@TooOld4ThisCrap lol- particularly stupid crap can still surprise me "Flame can cause fire" duhhhh
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 13:57:41	@TooOld4ThisCrap hubby and i have two male roommates, there's not much guys can come up with that surprises or annoys me any more. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 13:51:23	@TooOld4ThisCrap yes, he's an idiot, but i frequently find idiots momentarily amusing.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 13:41:08	@GrowingThruPain good luck girl - hopefully it will be a WHILE . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 13:33:06	@TooOld4ThisCrap @DownSouthKisses @Godgarazzi actually, i do - if it much bigger than that, i don't want nuffin to do wif it. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 13:29:15	ROFL - no SHIT Sherlock! Wonder who came up with THAT one. RT @IBetUDidnKnow Found on a butane lighter: "Warning: Flame may cause fire."
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 12:23:39	@TooOld4ThisCrap lol - tell me about it . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 12:16:20	too true (dammit) RT @TooOld4ThisCrap Photo: stuffnjunkmose: http:// tumblr.com/xyx3d8di9y
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-07 11:40:28	@painspeaks yay for getting better! hopefully the bruising will go away quickly and the disk irritation will stop.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-06 14:35:43	@painspeaks nitenite - rest well sistermine. huggggggzzzzzz
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-06 14:29:35	@painspeaks at least that way you'd get SOME kind of good out of it. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-06 14:29:06	@painspeaks i hate that you're hurting. Maybe you should get hubby to take a close-up of the bruise and use it for background for something.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-06 13:53:57	@painspeaks woot! you made it in for a few! i just found out about your fall a little bit ago when i checked in, how are you doin?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-06 05:27:51	@Bethan_Griffith don't feel bad - mine is so strange that i haven't even spoken to any of them in 7 years
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-06 05:24:51	@IAmDrTiller Baby, there are tons of us down here that would be more likely to burn that shirt than buy it . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-06 05:19:19	@Bethan_Griffith LOL - it's always confusing when folks start identifying with a different culture than their own . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-06 05:14:33	@kspitalsky and why do great girls get shitty guys?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-06 05:13:02	@Bethan_Griffith lol - that sounds like my reaction when i was listening to some black friends puttin down black folk in general - weird!
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-05 10:20:56	okay, THAT was FUN! lol #fireworks in the front yard, with Mother Nature joining in . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-05 01:31:09	@lissyvz67 yeah - and he KNOWS better than to schedule me like that,
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-04 15:24:53	@lissyvz67 not bad enough that he didn't give me the time off, i work til 10pm thurs, gotta turn around an b back at 8am fri
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-04 15:22:42	@kspitalsky i get migraines sometimes . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-04 04:16:50	@lissyvz67 we've actually GOT a union, bt this is a "right to work" state, means employers have all the rights, cn fire you for nothing
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-04 04:13:39	@kspitalsky yeah, it does, but then, it could be worse . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-04 01:41:36	@kspitalsky yup - fibro an a bunch of other shit to go with it . . . lots of fun stuff goin on. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:57:47	@maggiemunkee very true - i've gotten to the point i just walk out on them if they're asses.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:56:17	@painspeaks enjoy the movie, and rest well when you go. i'm about to start some heavy duty cleaning (fun, fun. NOT) lol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:51:55	@maggiemunkee lol- he pissed me off. at the time i was only about 20 lbs overweight, & i'd had docs that had no prob when i was 3x that
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:44:59	@maggiemunkee i had one doc tell me i was 2fat for him 2 b able to feel something, i thanked him for telling me he was incompetent.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:42:35	@painspeaks you're the best cheerleader ever, too! i was feeling really down all day, and now i feel much better
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:36:11	@maggiemunkee figures. it never matters what the problem is, they always blame it on the weight . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:33:57	@painspeaks everyone else gets so many "dings" that we barely make a passing score
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:32:49	@kspitalsky nobody that is actually aware of the way things are . . . LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:32:04	@painspeaks he ALWAYS schedules me to close the nite b4 an inspection cuz i'm the only one that passes with a high score
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:30:09	@painspeaks i know he doesn't want me to leave, because i always get 100% on secret shops, & that's all that keeps his average over 80%
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:27:59	@painspeaks i think he's trying 2 sabotage the writing so i can't afford 2 quit. he knows i can't afford 2 quit over this weekend thing YET
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:17:36	@painspeaks he already lost several regular customers while i was on light duty cuz they wouldn't let anyone else cut their meat
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:16:30	@painspeaks if i make a go of the writing, he knows i won't stay there, so yeah, i think he'd do whatever if it prevents me quitting >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:14:42	@painspeaks that's awesome! maybe you'll be busy enough not to miss them too much.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:10:30	@painspeaks so how are you doin with the kidlets gone? any pillow sniffing yet?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:09:32	@painspeaks think bossman may b trying 2 sabotage the writing - he overheard me tellin someone about it, & schedule bn wonky ever since
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:07:52	@kspitalsky LOL - i wonder why mean is so much funnier?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:05:09	@painspeaks hopefully the fact that he was on holiday this week, and me sending him an extra 400 words free cuz they were late will save it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:03:38	@painspeaks and then 6 in a row and too tired to think when i was home, so he got 1 yesterday and 2 today. >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 12:01:48	@painspeaks he may have screwed me over with the writing job, too. no net cuz of storms the 2 days i had off, so i missed my deadline sun>>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 11:57:57	@painspeaks yeah, well, it's gonna be nice when i get to go in and tell him what he can DO with his job
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 11:31:54	@painspeaks i'll have to work, if i call out i'll have to have a doc excuse, and i don't have $250 and 18 hours to spend at the ER to get it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 11:30:31	@painspeaks they don't make promises, but everyone else has gotten whatever time they wanted, and *I* put my request on the calendar 1st
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 11:28:07	@julianna12369 that's what happens when you work retail . . . especially when they won't hire enough ppl to do the job
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 11:24:06	@painspeaks I've got folks driving 3 hours to come to the party & see me on monday, & i'm not gonna be here . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 11:20:21	@painspeaks yeah, i requested this weekend off 3 wks ago, and he scheduled me to WORK sunday and monday.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 11:16:06	@painspeaks it sucks, how's yours??? (the boss strikes again)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 11:14:46	@kspitalsky i have to admit, it's funny as hell . . . i almost sprayed my computer with coffee when i read it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 11:05:45	@kspitalsky rofl - i dunno if i'd go out with someone that said that to me . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 11:04:12	@julianna12369 yep - i just want to know why the hell i had to work 6 days in a row if he wasn't gonna give me the time i asked for . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 11:03:04	@julianna12369 i've had to work with migraines because i couldn't afford $250 to go to the doc, & they said they'd fire me if i didn't
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 10:59:55	@julianna12369 oh, i would enjoy the hell out of tellin em, "okay, fire me" when they made the threat if i didn't have a doc note
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 10:58:15	@julianna12369 i can't afford to risk them firing me, & unless i'm in the hospital they'll assume it's just cuz i want off
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-07-03 10:54:55	@julianna12369 lol - if hubby wasn't out of work, i'd just tell him to go f**k himself, but i can't even call out

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-30 11:40:21	made it VERY plain that that STUFF they put in her dish was NOT edible, and they needed to fix it. I got a txt, "bring cat food" LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-30 11:39:12	when they tried to pet her, she walked off, waited for them to follow and led them to the food dish, then gave them the "i'm hungry" stare>>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-30 11:37:29	tonite, she decided she'd waited long enough for them to get the hint, so she sat and stared at them til someone got the hint >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-30 11:36:06	#cats are so funny. the roomie's cat didn't like the last food they bought her, so she's been doing all her eating here > >
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-30 11:34:36	@lissyvz67 i know what you mean - it's like, why do they have to make shit so HARD?

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-29 11:38:41	@originalchip i actually don't mind working close, i just hate that they don't schedule enough time to do what needs done
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-29 11:32:52	@originalchip you can't clean the meat slicer, the drainage tray, the wrap table, the scale, or the floors until after the last customer . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-29 11:31:30	@originalchip i swear they're all idiots . . . it takes at least an hour to clean that place, and even if you have EVERYTHING else done >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-29 11:26:26	@originalchip i'm beginning to think that one of the requirements for working at our corporate offices is having a lobotomy . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-29 11:22:30	@originalchip for some strange reason, they have me scheduled to leave every nite at 10, but we don't CLOSE til 10. ?????
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-29 11:20:14	@originalchip i work in a deli, slicing meat and toting boxes, and the customers were more of a pain in the ass than usual. LOL

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 12:53:51	@ThePathBeyond lol - never! i grew up in Ft. Lauderdale - salt water is AWESOME, and the minerals are really good for you, too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 12:51:48	@ThePathBeyond and that one is tough enough to handle salt in the water, too

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 12:00:18	@painspeaks exactly - how stupid is it to take $20? - not like they aren't gonna notice . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 11:55:40	@painspeaks if i was gonna steal from a register, i'd at least take enough to be worth gettin fired over . . . LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 11:54:37	@painspeaks yeah, that's how i got fired from my last job - some turkey stole from the register . . .$20! can you imagine?!?!?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 11:52:19	@painspeaks cool - that explains why you were late for chats . . . LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 11:51:31	@painspeaks @Pamelavrf last year at one point, they called me in on my day off, and i ended up working 11 in a row
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 11:50:18	@painspeaks @Pamelavrf i will be SOOOO glad to get away from a place that will schedule you to work 6 days in a row . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 11:48:30	@painspeaks i don't have time to do everything i'm supposed to as it is, they ain't draggin me off and addin more
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 11:47:19	@painspeaks they're talking bout making everyone cross train as cashiers. (not a CHANCE! not makin ME responsible 4 money others can touch)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 11:35:56	@ThePathBeyond love stories are always fun . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 11:33:16	@ThePathBeyond i actually haven't been on SL in almost a year - been way too busy with other stuff. i kinda miss it tho.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 11:32:22	@painspeaks @Pamelavrf coulda been worse. I managed to clock out only 15 minutes late (I cheated, my last customer was at 9) #ihatemyjob lol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-27 11:23:31	@painspeaks so how was your day (and how's the back actin today?)

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 13:14:50	@SarahBear9708 i know the feeling. i get nauseous when i eat at least 3 or 4 times a week
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 13:08:57	@SarahBear9708 try just leaving off the multi while you're taking the other, see if that helps
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 13:08:17	@SarahBear9708 i normally start having problems around 1250 mg. it's not dangerous or anything at 1500, just uncomfortable.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 13:06:07	@SarahBear9708 that's prolly it, cuz a multi usually has about 500mg of C in it.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 13:02:25	@SarahBear9708 whew you scared me half to death
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 13:01:54	@SarahBear9708 taking more than 1500mg a day can cause diarrhea and upset stomach if you're sensitive to it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:59:27	@SarahBear9708 ten THOUSAND milligrams?? no wonder you've got tummy troubles . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:52:16	@SarahBear9708 how many milligrams of vit C is it? and how much are you taking?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:34:21	@painspeaks enjoy the movie. rest well when you go . . . *hugglesnugs*
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:33:28	@painspeaks sure, i'll post it soon as i figure out what i've done with it. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:32:50	@painspeaks last time i saw mine was about 4 years ago, went up to get something i left behind when i left him. his new wife didn't use it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:27:13	@painspeaks me too. gonna try it on chicken, and do pineapple casserole to go with it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:24:33	@painspeaks canned creamed corn makes me gag - WAAAAYYYYY too sweet, and the texture is funky, too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:23:19	@painspeaks LOL - mine is way to big to throw, so i burned his picture instead.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:21:23	@painspeaks which is actually just homemade creamed corn, made with white field corn instead of sweet corn
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:20:41	@painspeaks oooooo, yeah, and cracklin cornbread . . . my ex taught me about "fried corn" >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:17:19	@painspeaks i've never tasted it either. LOL that's why i'm plotting.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:16:00	@painspeaks lol - i've wanted to throw my ex LOTS of times . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:15:03	@lissyvz67 that's very odd . . . i've never heard of the hot water working in one room and not the others.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:13:14	@painspeaks i'm hoping for the time and energy to get a bushel of corn from the farmers market and do homemade creamed corn this year
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:10:17	@painspeaks i'm already plotting for the pineapple sage when it gets big enough to harvest a few leaves.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:07:42	@painspeaks dunno bout bigger, but definitely better. LOL i don't have a damn thing, but i'm happier than i've ever been . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:04:11	@painspeaks then i didn't have a place to do it for years. this is the first chance i've had to grow anything in forever.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 12:02:04	@painspeaks i got out of it when i first got diagnosed, then went back to school, got a job working 65 hour weeks, and left the ex.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 11:56:38	@painspeaks i've missed it, but i just haven't been able to do the heavy work of prepping, an this year hubs an the roomies made me a place
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 11:55:33	@painspeaks i used to garden every year, made jelly and canned and froze my own veggies too - this will be the first time in 15 years
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 11:54:15	@painspeaks my chosen family takes super good care of me . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 11:53:10	@painspeaks only my roommate had already done it for me - and when i got up today, he'd put two tomato plants out there too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 11:51:48	@painspeaks yep! a friend of ours brought me some extra herb plants from her garden the other day and yesterday i went out to plant them >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 11:27:53	@painspeaks roomie did GOOD! I love when something pops like that, it always feels so much better after . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 11:27:01	@painspeaks stuffed! LOL had a plate waiting for me. Sausage stuffed pork loin, corn on the cob, potato salad, and home canned shelly beans
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 11:19:38	@painspeaks could be worse . . . LOL i was late gettin out of work, but came home to a super yummy dinner. How's your back doin?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-26 10:57:13	i was supposed to get off work an hour ago, instead, i just got home. yuck! (but at least i kept my OT down to an hour this week.)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-25 14:10:57	@DanaBaker ROFL - he prolly didn't, that's more of a really young kid, or an old lady kind of thing . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-25 14:07:54	@DanaBaker LOLOL so did it do any good, or did he just pee himself and keep sneezing?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-25 11:27:43	@originalchip i think watermelon is just about the best part of summer
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-25 11:26:58	@painspeaks i see you haven't gotten yourself in twitterjail yet . . . LOL how's the back?

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 12:05:18	@lissyvz67 oh, i HATE when that happens . . . i'm a wash and go girl myself
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:59:12	@painspeaks i'll find it, i'm assuming it's with the others. and sharing natural options isn't work, it's fun.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:57:18	@SueInge LOL - i got very little done cuz internet went out and i couldn't research two of my articles. the aromatherapy one, i have books
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:55:34	@painspeaks i'm excited, she brought pineapple sage, a couple other sages, some basil, and i don't remember what else. There are a bunch tho
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:52:49	@painspeaks my only issue with it is that a friend brought me some herb seedlings, and if it doesn't dry up a bit i can't plant them
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:50:41	ROFL sounds right to me >> RT @SueInge So, if you're an Australian with Celiacs, would you be Down Under-Under Diagnosed? Just wondering....
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:48:58	@halfwaybetweenT i do the same thing all the time. lol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:47:47	@painspeaks LOL true. I would probably have gotten more done today, but we had a bad storm this afternoon, and the net was out for HOURS
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:40:56	@halfwaybetweenT and i used to have to look up british slang a lot, used to hang out on irc with a bunch of brits
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:39:39	@halfwaybetweenT lol - you can find damn near anything with google
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:36:22	@halfwaybetweenT how's this sound? chiefly British : affectedly or excessively dainty, delicate, cute, or quaint (miriam-webster.com)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:33:06	@halfwaybetweenT ROFL - i'd have the same problem explaining some of our slang to folks
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:26:25	@halfwaybetweenT @maggiemunkee but now you have to translate "twee" LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 11:24:38	@painspeaks EEEP! i lost track of what time it was . . . it was good, how was yours? *hugglesnugs*
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 03:46:40	@kittyb2113 YW - i did ebay for a while, but had supply troubles so i quit
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 03:44:02	@SueInge yeah, it's pretty cool. I got a slot ghosting articles for a blog site. (for a real per word rate, not a % of adwords)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 02:39:36	@SueInge i love deadlines because it means i'm getting paid when i turn it in. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 02:20:16	@SueInge definitely - got 2000 words due by sunday, and don't want to have to do it all in one day again.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 02:19:21	@kittyb2113 yep - once ebay knows you're cancelling the transaction due to nonpayment, you should be good to relist
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 01:42:32	Not yet, but soon, gotta eat first. >> RT @SueInge Today #amwriting -- what about you?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 01:40:02	@kittyb2113 contact the buyer, tell them they have a certain #of days to pay or you're reselling. Also contact ebay and let them know.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-23 01:26:49	@kittyb2113 if you don't have the money, don't send the stuff. They pay, you ship, that's the way it works.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-16 13:05:22	@SarahBear9708 i had a really bad ingrown toenail once, and the doc removed a section of the toenail on that side. Hurt like a mother >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-16 12:46:47	@SarahBear9708 poor toe . . .i guess that's why jerking out toenails is a favored form of torture, it just keeps on going, and going,
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-16 12:36:11	@painspeaks @DownSouthKisses glad it went well. We had a storm, and no net for about 4 hours.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-16 12:34:59	YAY! My net's back!! We had a storm around 7:30, and it knocked out the cable and internet for hours.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 12:16:21	@painspeaks enjoy - me an the knee are headed to bed with the icepack. nini *huggles*
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 12:15:34	@painspeaks @DownSouthKisses all they gotta do is check out the blog http:// transformyourchroniclife.com/wordpress
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 12:13:19	@painspeaks hang around me long enough, you'll learn all kinds of odd stuff. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 12:07:16	@painspeaks yep, catnip. for humans, it's mildly sedative and helps relieve anxiety (and makes a yummy tea with a lil ginger an some honey)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 12:01:47	@painspeaks i will - i'll take some hops and catnip when i head that way, to go with my melatonin
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 12:00:55	@painspeaks lol - i doubt if there's any damage, it would hurt if there was. It's just overuse irritating it.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 11:52:53	@painspeaks yep - 2 possibilities: it'll be fine, or after 8 hours in the bed it won't work. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 11:51:40	@painspeaks i been doin this shit doctor free for 4 years - i got it down. LOL

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 11:43:39	@painspeaks i'd think it was a big bug bite except it doesn't itch . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 11:42:42	@painspeaks without ins they won't see me unless i hand them $150. I have $40 in the bank, and hubby gotta have gas tomorrow
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 11:36:27	@painspeaks not unless work pays. no insurance (or money) I'll b fine once i can stay off it 4 a while. It's just workin 30+ hours in 4 days
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 11:33:38	@painspeaks standing and walking on it for 8 hours 2morrow is gonna be interesting . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 11:30:22	@painspeaks the knee? nope, first time. so far no pain, just kinda numb feeling. Maybe i can use it to call out 2morrow. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 11:16:19	@painspeaks so, it could be worse. at least i can sit up, and so far, i can still walk, too. lol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 11:15:27	@painspeaks oh, and the sciatica is giving me a fit, and i've got several myofascial trigger points causing numb spots on my upper back
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 11:13:31	@painspeaks however, my right knee is red, swollen, & inflamed (the temperature difference between it & the left can be felt bare-handed
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-15 11:11:00	@painspeaks well, hubby cooked dinner, it looks like he may have a job, and i only have one more day before a day off

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:17:07	@amynluv in the meantime, get caller id, don't answer unless it's someone u know. let hubby listen to messages. U have to protect ur health
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:14:59	@amynluv prevents you from being able to appear. If nothing else, declare bankruptcy, give hubby power of attorney, and let him deal with it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:13:34	@amynluv if you can't appear, you need to send someone to represent you, with a sworn statement from your doc saying ur medical condition >
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:12:13	@amynluv and they're taking you to court because if you don't show up, they win by default, and they can try to attach your assets
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:11:23	@amynluv usually the threat is enough -
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:09:51	@amynluv and if they want their money, THAT's how they're going to get it. include that they are NOT to call and harass you, or you will sue
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:08:51	@amynluv when you get the letter, write them back, offering what you can afford, tell them that you're on disability, they can't touch it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:07:48	@amynluv if you tell them to stop calling you, they have to stop. if they continue, they're breaking the law. Make them send you a letter.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:06:00	@amynluv disability check? you need to do some research, you may not have to pay at all.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:04:45	@amynluv there are VERY specific laws in place to protect us from collections agencies, and they're breaking them
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:03:50	@amynluv they're lying. they keep records, because if their collectors get money from you, they get a commission. Report the company
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 05:00:36	@amynluv and tell them you're going to file a counter-suit for harassment and making your illness worse
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 04:59:21	@amynluv keep good records, tell your lawyer what's going on, and let them deal with it (name, date, time, what they said)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-11 04:58:15	@amynluv put a recording device on your phone. it's against the law for them to harass you. at the very least, write down their name, etc.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 13:05:08	@painspeaks yeah, once i start talking about it, i remember how silly it all is. LOL. Thanks for listening. See you tomorrow.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 13:00:52	@painspeaks you're welcome. I'm feeling much perkier now, i think i'll do some writing. LOL Night. rest well.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:59:53	@painspeaks she doesn't dare tho. i'm hypoglycemic, and if she tells me i can't go on break, and i pass out . . . can you say "lawsuit"?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:56:11	@painspeaks oh, it is. i love watching her blow up like a frog when i tell her i'm going on break cuz i know she's dying to tell me i can't
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:48:23	@painspeaks i'm one of the few people that work at that store that doesn't spend half the shift sneakin out for smokes and chatting
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:46:59	@painspeaks nah. i think it's kind of funny. i frustrate the hell out of her, and not a thing she can do about it.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:46:06	@painspeaks lol - i am a stubborn bitch, and don't take shit off anyone but the hubby (& not often for him.)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:44:49	@painspeaks hell, if i talk to the store manager, i can be out of that department on the next schedule. He won't let me quit over that crap.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:43:20	@painspeaks she don't like me much, cuz i won't take her shit. I'm freakin GOOD at what i do, and i can get another job in a week if i want
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:41:50	@painspeaks and left everything sitting out for me to deal with. I got my bag, walked over to the other side, and told her i was going home.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:41:02	@painspeaks he called her and told her i wasn't COMING back, he was sending me home, but when i went to get my stuff, she walked out >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:40:02	@painspeaks she actually had the nerve to page me to come back to the deli while i was upstairs with the manager filling out the report. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:39:05	@painspeaks yep - i finally broke down and joined the union, just in case she got worse and i needed backup. The night i hurt my shoulder >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:35:54	@painspeaks i'm thinkin jody may have threatened to file a formal complaint, cuz he's been getting a full 8 hours
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:34:52	@painspeaks the front end manager does that to everyone he can get away with. (used to do it to the roomie, but hasn't lately.) >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:33:34	@painspeaks i can't do anything because my boss doesn't pull that crap, but if i was a cashier, i'd file a grievance with the union
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:32:25	@painspeaks i've been known to wait until i close, clock out and take my break, and then clock back in to do the cleaning. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:31:05	@painspeaks i think Ayesha has finally figured out that she can bitch if she wants, i'm TAKING my break. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:29:57	@painspeaks heck, when i worked at Krystal, they'd raise holy hell if we didn't take our breaks cuz they didn't want to have to pay OT
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:26:52	@painspeaks some of the departments won't schedule a shift longer than 7 hours and 45 minutes, so you can't take more than 15 for break
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:25:51	@painspeaks Ga only requires a 15 minute break for shifts 4 hours +, and a 30 minute one if you're scheduled 8 hours
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:23:44	@painspeaks and if she CHOOSES not to take hers, that's HER option, but she doesn't get to tell me i CAN'T
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:22:51	@painspeaks oh, they're legally required to GIVE us a break, but if we don't take it, they aren't gonna complain,
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:16:24	@painspeaks oh yes she did. LOL most of the time when i tell her i need to go eat, she says something about >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:14:24	@painspeaks but they get all pissy if i ask them to cover for me so i can go on break or go to the bathroom.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:13:20	@painspeaks what pisses me off is that i'm always by myself in the deli, and they have anywhere from 3 to 5 people on the other side, >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:04:18	@painspeaks she thinks because SHE'S willing to work 8 hours without taking her break, all the rest of us have to, too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:03:07	@painspeaks then when i got a chance to go take my break and eat so i wouldn't pass out from low blood sugar, the asst. manager got pissy
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:01:54	@painspeaks i finally got rid of the last customer, and RAN for it without even putting the meat away or anything. if i'd wet myself . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 12:00:44	@painspeaks 30 minutes later, she goes and clocks out, and i STILL haven't had a break between customers so i can pee.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 11:59:43	@painspeaks i asked him to send the bakery lady over to take care of my customers while i went. He told her, told me she'd be over in a few>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 11:58:28	@painspeaks it was busy, busy, busy. i had to go to the bathroom for an hour and a half, so when the boss came over for something >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-10 11:47:56	@painspeaks OMG - work was AWFUL tonite. I'm supposed to get off at 10, and i've been home less than 15 minutes. ARRRRRGGHHHHH. LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-09 12:37:08	@painspeaks great that the spasms were under control last night - hopefully the trend will continue for a while . . .NiNi, sleep well.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-09 12:34:39	@painspeaks Thanks for all the encouragement and cheerleading this week! Have a good rest. **Huggggzzzzzzz**
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-09 12:33:12	@painspeaks Luckily, hubby volunteered to cook, so I squeezed in a nap. how's your day been?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-09 12:32:12	@painspeaks worn the f** OUT. LOL 8 hour shift, followed by a 20 minute walk home in 90+ degree temps, then writing (2 down, 3 to go)

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-08 11:47:39	@painspeaks i got to do some writing, and already got my first check, so we had a special dinner to celebrate
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-08 11:45:46	@painspeaks even though today was busy, and physically tiring, emotionally it was pretty relaxing because i was doing stuff i love
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-08 11:43:17	@painspeaks it was fun. we actually got 4 or 5 folks that turned up, even though we didn't start promoting it until a few hours before

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-07 12:50:51	@painspeaks most people withdraw because they're uncomfortable with the idea that the person is dying.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-07 12:49:19	@painspeaks it helps immensely just to have someone who WILL talk to you when you have a family member with cancer. >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-07 12:48:01	OMGOMGOMG! I have a WRITING job! WOOOOOOOT! (Can you tell I'm excited?) LOL

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-07 03:45:46	@tooold4thiscrap that's my attitude too, most days. It could ALWAYS be worse, and at least I woke up on this side of the dirt, once more.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-06 12:41:53	@sweetpandora85 ewwwwww - no you didn't need to know that.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-06 12:23:22	@painspeaks >> and will withdraw because they're so uncomfortable with the idea of being around someone who is sick.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-06 12:21:35	@painspeaks your aunt is so lucky to have someone like you in her life. There will be many who don't know what to say to her, >>

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-06 05:10:54	@bethan_griffith i hate when they change things so that you only have a choice of filters, and they take out the option of "all"

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-05 12:28:15	@painspeaks holy cow - that must have been a major pain getting all that moved when they changed the groups . . .

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-05 12:08:26	@painspeaks whatcha lookin for? if it's a specific question i may either already know, or know where to find out
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-05 12:01:49	@lmd1106 weird - a friend of mine is an RN, works at two diff places, and takes pain meds

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-05 11:46:47	@painspeaks will probably do some articles, etc. too, and may set up a group.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-05 11:45:37	@painspeaks i talked to the guy that runs @NAIDW , and i'm gonna be doing some volunteering on the site. gonna do a weekly life coaching chat

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:57:53	@lissyvz67 have a good one. reading is a good distraction. it always helps me.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:54:49	@lissyvz67 exactly. what goes around, comes around; but the waiting can be a bitch.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:49:12	@lissyvz67 you're welcome
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:47:01	@lissyvz67 hope is like love, the more of it you give away, the more of it you get back (and not always from the person you gave it to)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:44:30	@lissyvz67 and you'll say it to someone else again. that's how it works. one day, you may be reminding me of it when my heart has gone numb
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:39:10	@lissyvz67 without down, we couldn't have up
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:38:34	@lissyvz67 i can take it. down is just a direction, not a permanent situation.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:34:24	@lissyvz67 sometimes just being able to tell someone how miserable you are helps. i'm not sure why, but it does.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:27:58	@lissyvz67 & even if i can't see tomorrow, it's coming anyway, & with every tomorrow that comes, the possibility that things will get better
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:25:58	@lissyvz67 darlin, i've been there, more times than i can count. The one thing I've learned from it is everything changes, >>
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:22:40	@lissyvz67 and that part i understand, too. the total hopelessness, and just wanting it all to be over, to not have to TRY any more
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:18:17	@lissyvz67 it's okay. you've listened to me vent before. Sometimes it helps to just dump it all out there. Keeping it inside, not so much.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:16:08	@lissyvz67 now THAT i totally understand. The rest of it, i can sympathize, I can even imagine what it must be like, but I can't KNOW
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:13:01	@lissyvz67 oh, man, you're really getting hit hard right now, aren't you? I'm sorry you're having to deal with all of this at once.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:11:33	@lissyvz67 or maybe a bowl of your favorite ice cream and a good movie?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:10:52	@lissyvz67 maybe you could try something a bit less dangerous? like a nice long soak in an epsom salt bath?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:09:47	@lissyvz67 no wonder you're crabby. I would be too if I'd just gone through all of that stress and worry.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:08:14	@lissyvz67 and it's okay to be out of sorts with the world sometimes. Frustration gets to all of us.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 12:07:20	@lissyvz67 ahhhhhh. If you can't win with her, what can you do to make YOURSELF feel better? Something you enjoy, that relaxes you?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 11:58:42	@sueinge lots and lots of luck headed your way. have fun with it.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 11:56:56	@lissyvz67 her dissatisfaction may have nothing at all to do with you. maybe she's just not happy about moving back in.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 11:55:16	@lissyvz67 have you just tried asking her what you could be doing to please her, or what it is that you're doing that is not working?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-04 11:40:01	@lissyvz67 then do what pleases you and let her deal with it. It's YOUR house, and if nothing you do makes her happy anyway . . .

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-03 13:16:59	Okay, i'm done for the night. Only got about 6 hours sleep this am, and i'm out of spoons.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-03 12:49:01	@painspeaks i normally don't get dinner til i get home from work around 10 or 11, so this is pretty much my usual time.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-03 12:46:29	@sarahbear9708 figures. i used to have upstairs neighbors, guy beat his girl about twice a week. i'd call, cops came, she'd say she's fine

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 15:02:20	@fibrotv i've got mitral valve prolapse. i haven't actually been diagnosed with hypermobility, but i'm pretty sure i have it, too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 15:00:39	@diamondie when i could afford it, i used to make salves with black pepper oil to apply to achy joints
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:59:44	@diamondie eating so much pepper may be why so little turmeric works for me. i like the essential oil of black pepper too . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:58:27	@diamondie and yes, i get tons of black pepper. i love it, use lots in my cooking, and add more to my own plate.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:57:07	@diamondie i do fine on 1.5 grams twice a day, and $15 is half of my grocery budget for two ppl most weeks
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:53:37	@diamondie i can't afford the "enhanced" stuff. most weeks, i'm lucky if i have enough money to buy food
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:52:03	@downsouthkisses that's mostly why i take it. the arthritis is a minor annoyance for me compared to the fibro
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:49:13	@downsouthkisses they've been using it in ayurvedic medicine forever - for people i mean
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:47:36	@downsouthkisses it helps with the pain from my fibro and arthritis. doesn't seem to do much for the fatigue tho.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:45:42	@diamondie i started off with a standardized extract, but it was too expensive and i was always running out, this way, i always have it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:43:33	@diamondie i don't know anything about bioavailability, and percentages, all i know is that taking plain ground turmeric works well for me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:39:35	@downsouthkisses it makes a big difference for me, and with food, it doesn't cause me any tummy troubles
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:38:20	@downsouthkisses I've been taking just plain turmeric that i put into capsules myself. if i don't take it for a couple of days, i can tell
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:36:34	@downsouthkisses i was studying a bit. i'm taking a certification test, and needed some review on a couple of things
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 14:01:09	@sarahbear9708 i take about a gram and a half (3 size 0 capsules) at least twice a day. i normally take it right after a meal

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 01:59:34	@indyhealer Nutella is definitely not a healthy food, but it sure is yummy. (I've replaced it with organic almond butter with dark choccy.)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 01:56:36	@mindfreedom yes, meditation helps me immensely. It's reduced my stress levels, my blood pressure has come down, and i just FEEL better
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-02 01:15:16	@originalchip cats are great. this one isn't even mine, she lives in the main house with one of the roommates, but she comes down to visit
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 13:37:59	okay bedtime for me - i've had enough for today. laters all
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 13:11:45	@painspeaks lol s'ok - i knew that bit was for SarahBear
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 13:10:28	@sarahbear9708 another important thing to know is that anything with aspartame in it can increase pain levels. (mine dropped by almost half)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 13:06:32	@painspeaks i'm jealous! i love hot tubs. Have a great time.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 13:03:20	@sarahbear9708 i use herbs and supplements almost exclusively for my fibro and other issues, so I've done a lot of research.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 13:01:49	@sarahbear9708 and ginger is good for pain, too. I mostly take it in capsules I make myself (I wrote about it here http://bit.ly/fAvGmA)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 12:57:57	@sarahbear9708 capsaicin cream applied externally might help with the pain, too, if you aren't allergic to hot peppers

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 12:50:18	@sarahbear9708 have you tried ginger and or turmeric to help reduce the inflammation? Fish oil capsules are good for that, too.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 12:47:14	@painspeaks i'm more interested in things like ghosts and psychics and such. Metaphysics can be such a fascinating subject.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 12:31:16	@painspeaks i do too, but i want NOTHING to do with demons or devils or such
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 12:27:03	Ya'll pardon me a moment while I play string with the cat. (I'd rather not end up with my leg in ribbons because I'm ignoring her.)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 12:14:59	@painspeaks and the exorcist had me sleeping with a rosary for WEEKS after i saw it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 12:14:18	@painspeaks the roomies like Saw, and a couple of times i've been up there cooking dinner while they watched it - creepy
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 12:07:24	@painspeaks i think Jaws and The Exorcist are the ones that broke me of watching that kind of thing tho.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 12:05:04	@painspeaks lol - i can watch the old stuff like Frankenstein and such, but the new stuff like Saw or Nightmare on Elm St? don't THINK so.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 12:03:18	rofl - but are you gonna do it by punching me, or something more fun? RT @lukeromyn : I'm no astrologer, but I can make you see stars.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 11:57:17	@painspeaks ewwwwwww - i can't watch that kind of thing, gives me nightmares. the roommates will watch that stuff sometimes
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 11:50:39	@painspeaks thanks - so how did your day go?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 11:44:38	@painspeaks so how was the movie last nite? did hubby pick a good one?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 11:34:17	@sarahbear9708 it's as bad as calling #ME "chronic fatigue," just makes it sound like some minor crap that's no big deal
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 11:29:22	@sarahbear9708 "goosefoot"? couldn't they have at least come up with something that even semi-describes the pain it causes?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 11:25:00	@painspeaks plus a bunch more, but the most exciting thing is that someone approached me about my life coaching
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-06-01 11:23:18	@painspeaks it was tiring but productive . . . got hubby applied 4unemployment, put in several apps 4 him, and one for a blogging job 4 me

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-05-31 12:23:00	@maggiemunkee it took me a bit over 5 years, but it was worth it. kind of a shame the degree doesn't do me much good any more tho

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-04-20 13:20:46	@sarahbear9708 there's also a scale where you bag it, so with a calculator you can check and make sure you aren't going over budget
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-04-20 13:19:04	at the organic grocery, bulk herbs are in big containers, and you dip out what you want, they weigh it at the register, like fresh fruit
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-04-20 13:12:44	@sarahbear9708 and i get the capsules online for about a penny each
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-04-20 13:12:07	@sarahbear9708 the handy thing about bulk herbs is that you can just buy two or three $ worth at the time if you need to
37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-04-20 13:10:28	on the chamomile, if you're allergic to ragweed, test carefully before you take much. the two are related, so you can be allergic to both

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-04-20 13:06:12	@sarahbear9708 if you still have the valerian and melatonin, and they aren't too old, try looking for hops to add to them

37555979	kimmieCollas	2011-04-20 13:00:40	@sarahbear9708 you'd have to experiment, but i'd go for something that has valerian, skullcap, hops and melatonin in some combination >>

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 12:21:36	@SarahBear9708 although you might not have that issue since you aren't bipolar, and the whole reason you're depressed is cuz you're in pain
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 12:20:35	@SarahBear9708 actually, bein in the hospital isn't that bad, except that they don't let you have your pain meds
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 12:10:15	@SarahBear9708 those folks are REALLY good listeners, and know how to help
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 12:09:39	@SarahBear9708 i've actually even called one of the suicide hotlines when it got where i just didn't think i could handle it any more
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 12:08:17	@SarahBear9708 when the pain gets bad, it's really hard to remember that it gets better - it feels like it's ALWAYS gonna be that way
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 12:03:55	@SarahBear9708 when the fibro gets really, really bad, i need someone to remind me that it's been bad before, and it always eases eventually

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 11:45:58	@SarahBear9708 you might be surprised at how much support you have available too, all you have to do is reach out . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 11:38:22	@SarahBear9708 that's one hell of an incentive to stay alive, no matter how bad it gets
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 11:37:36	@SarahBear9708 my family and friends are very open with me about how much they love me, and how painful it would be for them to lose me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 11:36:05	@SarahBear9708 i'm also lucky because i have people who depend on me, and killing myself would be a hell of a betrayal of their trust
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 11:33:32	@SarahBear9708 my mom tried once, but i've been lucky enough not to ever lose anyone that way
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-16 11:32:20	@SarahBear9708 it really helps to talk about how you feel tho - depression has a tendency to screw up your thinking

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-15 03:13:17	@SarahBear9708 i'm hoping the health care reform thing will help, but i doubt it. big business always finds a way around the rules
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-15 02:55:41	@SarahBear9708 arrrrrrggggghhhhhh, i HATE HMOs - the ins. company is so worried about profits that they cut corners anywhere they can
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-15 02:48:36	@SarahBear9708 can you go "doctor shopping" and find someone who can actually help, or are you stuck with what you have?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-15 02:40:43	@SarahBear9708 it's always great when the one you love supports you, but you need support from the docs and the rest of your family, too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-15 02:35:19	@SarahBear9708 yeah, it can be really frustrating to feel like shit all the time, especially if you don't have the support you need
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-06-15 02:29:04	@SarahBear9708 what's wrong?

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-30 13:08:26	okay, this is MUCH better - the history of NWA. sounds like Chris Rock narrating, and commentary by folks like Ice T and Dr. Dre

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-30 11:11:49	@SarahBear9708 not under the old, "healthy" rules we can't - we have to redefine what winning IS when we have fibro
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-30 10:36:52	@SarahBear9708 it's a vicious cycle - fatigue triggers depression, depression makes the fatigue worse, which makes the depression worse . .

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-23 15:32:49	@giasrose dunno, the fibro one made me sleepy too, but then i'm ALWAYS sleepy (until i go to bed, then i'm wide awake)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-23 15:30:59	@giasrose hmmmm, if the list is no longer available, you may have to contact support to get rid of it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-23 15:29:43	@giasrose lol- my email is ALWAYS open, and i jump over there every time i get a new one . . . i'm hooked
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-23 14:39:50	@giasrose i don't know what the issue is - i didn't hear any clicking or white noise tho, it was more of a deep, rythmic throbbing sound
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-23 14:23:04	@giasrose it's extremely low pitched, so that may be the issue - maybe if u downloaded it & converted to a format that plays on a cd player?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-23 14:06:36	@2commonsense oooooo, smoothies sound good - wish i had some yogurt to go with the blueberries in the fridge

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-23 13:57:25	@giasrose you're very welcome
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-23 13:47:58	@giasrose there will be an "unfollow" link at the top on the right

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-23 13:45:16	@giasrose but then, i'll try most anything that doesn't involve chemicals
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-23 13:44:15	@giasrose dunno if it's gonna help, but it sounds kinda weird, all deep and slow an sort of woo wooooo wooooo

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-21 12:25:57	@SarahBear9708 yep, would help with the soreness & clean it out. & while it soaks, i can finish signing up for my domain name & hosting
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-21 12:19:07	@SarahBear9708 i'm thinkin i should prolly fix myself a pan of water with some epsom salt an soak it for a bit, but damn that'll burn
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-21 12:17:34	@SarahBear9708 yep, always gotta look for the upside.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-21 12:15:25	@SarahBear9708 lol - honestly, compared to the fibro, this is barely noticable, it just throbs
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-21 12:14:16	@SarahBear9708 got a nice scrape on top, too. maybe, if i'm lucky, i won't be able to put my shoe on tomorrow an i can lay out of work
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-21 12:13:16	@SarahBear9708 + looks like i've separated at least part of the nail from the nail bed, cuz there's a good bit of blood under it. +

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 12:27:49	@2commonsense thanks - i've gotten pretty good at managing, but it would be nice to at least be able to get a painkiller when i need it

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 12:10:09	@SarahBear9708 it is, it is - i think he FINALLY started understanding when i put it in terms he could relate to - things he's felt himself
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 12:07:39	@SarahBear9708 nobody that doesn't have it could really understand - even hubby, who sees me cry myself to sleep, can't fully "get it"
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 12:04:25	@problogger oh, lord - honor or not, they want you to speak, they should at least give you free attendance.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 11:58:18	@2commonsense oh, i KNOW, believe me. i haven't been able to see a doctor in almost 3 years - i survive on ibuprophen and herbs
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 11:56:34	@SarahBear9708 oh, yeah, time for a new doc - if they don't believe you, they're totally useless
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 11:54:14	@2commonsense ahhh, that explains it - when you have to take whatever doc you can get, it's harder
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 11:51:43	@SarahBear9708 it is! maybe you could get him/her to refer you to a pain management clinic, preferably one that treats fibro regularly
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 11:50:01	@2commonsense the problem comes in when they refuse to listen to us, or we demand to be tested for every disease under the sun
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 11:47:41	@2commonsense we frequently know more about our illnesses than our doctors, after all, we only have a few to keep up with, they have tons
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 11:16:57	@SarahBear9708 most docs just don't "get" chronic pain, and are afraid that they'll get in trouble if they write too many scripts for pain
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 11:10:15	has anyone out there used #GoDaddy for web hosting? I'm thinking about setting up a web page, and am curious about their service

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 10:45:56	@FabandFrugal omg, i gotta try that. Do they make it with real ginger?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 10:44:11	@SarahBear9708 hot pack and computer? lol, that's usually my solution to bad pain days
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 10:43:10	@SarahBear9708 what used to piss me off was the docs that acted like i just wanted drugs to get high. at least the rheumy knew better
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-20 10:28:09	@SarahBear9708 hopefully it will get better soon

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-19 19:21:37	@goddesslissy oh, yeah, i remember the asshole boss
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-19 19:13:21	@goddesslissy over here, they wouldn't be able 2 do that unless they wanted to lose a lawsuit. it's illegal to discriminate against disabled
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-19 19:10:30	@goddesslissy that's discriminatory - what's the law over there about discrimination when it comes to medical illnesses?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-19 18:56:46	@goddesslissy i remember the "drug-fucked" feeling - when i was on meds, i couldn't write anything longer than a couple of paragraphs
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-19 18:46:34	@goddesslissy at the bottom it explained that the mind can "see" the right thing, as long as what your eyes see is close to what is intended
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-19 18:43:34	@goddesslissy i saw a poster once that had all kinds of misspellings, switched letters, misplaced spaces, etc. +
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-19 18:24:06	@goddesslissy rofl - i didn't even notice that you'd misspelled it . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-05-19 02:10:51	anybody else out there that has a job where they expect you to be in two places at once?

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-03-11 17:18:10	@EmperorNorton and not just in religion, either. so many ppl judge others by what groups they belong to, rather than on who they are

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-29 14:42:56	@Hyacinths4 I'm working that way, that's one of the reasons I chose wordpress. As soon as I can afford the hosting I want, I can port it.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-29 13:47:14	@MarcyRubin i know what you mean - it took me something like 3 hours to write a post that's less than 500 words cuz i'm flaring

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-17 03:15:40	@Hyacinths4 i'm using wordpress for my personal blog, but i contribute to a group blog on blogger, too. +
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-17 02:15:54	@SpoonieJen omg - i'm so glad you're not hurt
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-17 02:13:55	bravery isn't the lack of fear, it's being terrified and doing it anyway
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-17 01:05:39	@CFSBloggers thanks for the RT
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-16 16:07:36	@MarcyRubin nite, rest well

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-16 15:42:43	@MarcyRubin oh, well, guess i'll just post it manually
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-16 15:41:45	@MarcyRubin but when i went in with the generated pswd they sent me, the twurl showed up in the list. weird
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-16 15:40:32	@MarcyRubin lol - i know the feeling. i just tried to log in to tweetburner, and the pswd that let me twurl wouldn't get me in
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-16 15:33:14	@MarcyRubin i don't see an RT from you in my timeline either. maybe it's twitter? my twurl isn't showing either.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-16 15:31:37	hmmmm, i just twurled my new blog post, but it isn't showing up - does anyone else see it?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-16 05:43:26	omg - i just found my former therapist on LinkedIn . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:31:00	@SarahBear9708 lol - i do indeed - nite, rest well
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:29:28	@SarahBear9708 and i want to do another one on the team gimp blog too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:28:56	@SarahBear9708 i've got two posts to finish (Guilt and Chronic Illness, and Managing Your Healthcare Team, Part II),
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:27:12	@SarahBear9708 that way i'd only be workin 6 in a row, and i'd still be an hour up
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:26:15	@SarahBear9708 i'm SERIOUSLY considering callin in sick on my short day
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:25:17	@SarahBear9708 i work, cook, do what cleaning can't be ignored, and sleep - i HATE my life
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:24:21	@SarahBear9708 lol - time for me? what's that?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:21:47	@SarahBear9708 then i'll be able to go back to only cooking on my days off
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:21:15	@SarahBear9708 but if i could have, i'd have gone to bed as soon as i got here - i will be SOOOOOO glad when jody gets back from kenya . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:19:56	@SarahBear9708 we both work second, i don't have to get up til noon . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:06:00	@SarahBear9708 tell me about it - i still gotta finish the laundry, feed the hubby supper, and take out the trash
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:02:17	@SarahBear9708 days i work, all i do is what's absolutely necessary, play catch up on days off - today was sposed to be catch up day
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 13:01:05	@SarahBear9708 the uniform is filthy, and i'm out of socks, too - lol, plus, 4 of hubby's uniforms are in the dryer-started em b4 the call
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:58:57	@SarahBear9708 yep, puts me over 30 hours for this payperiod, but it really isn't worth the extra stress on my body
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:56:54	@SarahBear9708 hell, the only reason i'm not already asleep is that my uniform has to be washed, and i won't have time when i get up
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:55:32	@SarahBear9708 the only good thing about the whole screwed up mess is that they can't say a word to me about extra hours cuz they ASKED me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:53:51	@SarahBear9708 but i REALLY want to be a fly on the wall when the GM has her little TALK with whoever told her P called out
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:52:16	@SarahBear9708 lol, i guarantee i'm gonna remember this the next time ms P wants to trade shifts or somethin
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:51:18	@SarahBear9708 just so that bitch can ride home in a warm car instead of takin the bus
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:50:40	@SarahBear9708 so i got to walk a half mile each way in the cold, stand on my feet for 6 hours, and give up my only day off
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:49:05	@SarahBear9708 plus, that puts me workin 8 days in a row, cuz i don't have another day off til friday, an i've worked every day since thurs
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:47:58	@SarahBear9708 but i'm bettin SOMEBODY gonna be hearin from her. P stayed til 7, so our department is now 4 hours over budget for the week
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:46:52	@SarahBear9708 she was indeed there. the GM came by around 5 and discovered she was there. didn't say anything then,
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:45:21	and she didn't want to have to stand out in the cold and wait for the bus.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:44:37	far as i can tell, P just wanted to be able to leave at 6 instead of 9 cuz she had a ride at 6
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:43:10	@SarahBear9708 go upstairs, get a manager to override me in, get to the deli, and just GUESS who's standing there cuttin meat for a customer
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:42:10	@SarahBear9708 i'm like, okay, i suppose so. Rush around gettin everything done, him off to work, me dressed and ready, and walk to work
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:40:27	@SarahBear9708 so i answer, and it's the manager at my store sayin that P has called out, and can i come work her shift
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:39:00	@SarahBear9708 cuz i've finally got a day off, and then the phone rings. i started not to answer it, but you know how that is . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:37:50	@SarahBear9708 was sittin here this morning takin care of some stuff hubby needed for work, thinkin i could go back to bed when he left
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:36:44	@Fierstarr i haven't been on much either - got a job, and it's about to kill me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 12:34:12	@SarahBear9708 i've got a story for you . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-12 00:47:02	lovely - i just got called in to work, i guess i'll be working 7 days in a row this week
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-11 03:49:42	@FarThingpenny i haven't read the book yet, but i've been browsing the blog, and it's fascinating . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-10 15:41:06	@SpoonieJen oh, ughhh, you too, huh. how do you handle it?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-10 03:03:36	could someone please break my leg so i don't have to go to work??? it's food stamps week at the grocery store
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-10 01:00:40	@fibroladen oh, i hate when that happens.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-08 11:30:19	@SarahBear9708 oh, how was dinner and bowling last nite?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-08 11:03:55	@SarahBear9708 been there, done that - annoying isn't it? oh, btw, i finally got around to doing an intro post on the blog. . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-08 04:04:06	omg - it's SNOWING . . . in Atlanta. this doesn't happen often
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-08 01:25:35	i'm baaaaack: new blog and post - The Placebo Effect: Do We Care Why it Works, as Long as it Does? http://wp.me/pLo6N-5
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-07 07:19:03	@SarahBear9708 nice! It's been so long since i've had dinner out, i've forgotten what it feels like to go into a restaurant and be waited on
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-07 07:12:30	@SarahBear9708 lol - going out where? somewhere fun i hope.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-05 11:56:55	@SarahBear9708 they'll feel better as soon as they thaw out, i'm sure - lol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-05 11:55:53	i just spent almost 7 hours standing on them, then had to wait for the bus in wet shoes and socks, in 23 degree weather - brrrrrrrrrrr
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-05 11:54:04	@SarahBear9708 awwwwww - for me it's the feet
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-04 14:39:08	@atmagazine i don't use essentials every day, but i use them a lot, mostly by inhalation, massage, and bathing
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-04 06:07:38	@DoctorRobin but what if the current moment really, really sucks?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-04 06:05:14	i'm getting closer tho - getting past the things i want that aren't really mine, that i can't "fix" and into what will do it for me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-04 06:02:40	i'm working on figuring that out for myself, and so far i'm still at the generalization stage. i need specifics before i can make changes
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-04 05:59:16	i mean things like "a better life" or "happiness"- what does that mean to you? Better health, more money, love? what would REALLY change it?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-04 05:57:00	do you ever wonder what it is that you REALLY want? i don't mean cars and computers, and things in general, those wants come and go . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-04 03:27:00	@WellnessHill crass, maybe, but funny as hell
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 09:21:27	@EmperorNorton i've been among the missing since i got a job, and it's probably gonna get worse before it gets better
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 09:20:07	@EmperorNorton good to hear
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 05:32:51	RT theediblegarden Living on Nothing but Food Stamps http://bit.ly/6jQ8RA - been there, done that
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:55:17	@SarahBear9708 at this point, i'd settle for staying the same
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:54:50	@SarahBear9708 folks have been telling me things will get better for 2 years now, and all they do is get worse - i've about given up
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:48:37	@SarahBear9708 at this rate, i'm gonna die living in this hole, i just hope it happens soon
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:47:19	@SarahBear9708 i think he was just waiting for me to start working again so he could quit
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:46:38	@SarahBear9708 yeah, that's what he SHOULD do, but i doubt if he WILL - he wants me to help him write a letter of resignation this weekend
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:42:40	@SarahBear9708 and if he quits his job, we have to start paying the $70 a week child support out of mine, too, which cuts it in half
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:41:07	@SarahBear9708 problem is, we can't LIVE on my measly $150 a week, it's all we can manage to pay rent and eat on BOTH checks
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:38:27	@SarahBear9708 and he wants to quit because he hates the ppl he has to work with, and the company and pay SUCK (18,000 a year)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:36:33	@SarahBear9708 i walk 1/2 mile or so each way, plus stand on my feet for hours on end, and have to lift up to 30 pounds several times a day
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:34:58	@SarahBear9708 i'm working in the deli at the grocery store down the street - i actually enjoy it, it's just wearing me out
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:27:52	@SarahBear9708 my issue is the new job - it's killing me, and now hubby is talking about wanting to QUIT his
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:20:08	@SarahBear9708 at this point, i'd be willing to risk damn near anything if it would make me feel better
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-03 02:08:59	@SarahBear9708 did you take the prednisone with food? it always makes me sick if i take it on an empty stomach
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-02 01:07:10	well, i guess i just found a "benefit" to not having a car - i don't need a Jupiter Jack to talk on my cell phone legally-that saves me $20
37555979	kimmieCollas	2010-01-02 00:57:14	@Treagie i dislike my head too - day 3 of a migraine, and i gotta go to work at 5 -
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-12-20 10:09:55	@lissyvz oh shit, that sucks
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-12-20 10:03:30	@lissyvz how's your jobhunt going?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-12-20 10:02:35	@lissyvz it's wild - i worked two split shifts this week, plus one cover shift, and they actually called and asked me to come in TODAY too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-12-20 09:53:25	omg, this job is gonna KILL me. 3 weeks since my last tweet????
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-29 09:30:37	@lissyvz true dat, but still . . . i'd rather be tweetin LOL
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-29 09:21:54	i've been slacking - started a new job, and i'ts wearing me OUT. Standing on my feet for 6 hours + walkin back an forth + fibro = UGGGGGHHH
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-29 05:55:08	@goldman huh?? no cash on board??? i'm confused (can ya tell i don't fly?)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-22 11:29:18	omg - just got home from work, and i'm BEAT - what's worse is i worked close tonite, and have to open tomorrow - UGGGHHHHHHH
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-20 14:01:14	@lissyvz that does make a difference . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-20 13:33:14	@lissyvz that sucks, but then, i waited for like three weeks for the grocery store to call me back, and they never did check my references
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-20 13:25:33	@lissyvz oh, btw, didn't you have a job interview this week? how'd it go?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-20 13:24:56	@lissyvz lol - with that request, you'll either get tons and tons of dms, or none at all cuz everyone assumes someone else did it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-20 12:42:21	@SarahBear9708 nice pic, and a good philosophy . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-20 12:41:09	@Midnightmatters - lol. It's a funny phrase until you ummmm, run into one of em
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-20 02:49:40	@QuatreVingtSept it all depends on the person, and what they happen to be sensitive to. You just have to try them and see.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-19 15:11:14	ughhh - i gotta get my sorry ass to bed, gotta be up at 7 to go to work, but waitin for the dryer to stop . . .

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-11-12 04:14:35	@RawHealer this is a great tip - chlorine is very drying to the skin (and isn't very good for you internally, either)

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 14:31:43	you know you're getting old when the music teenagers listen too just gives you a headache
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 09:09:48	@lissyvz then she doesn't know the pattern very well
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 09:08:40	@pgoss if it's cancer, he could be DEAD before then
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 09:06:18	@pgoss one of my roommates had abnormal cells show up in a biopsy, doc sent him to the free clinic 9 months ago - his colonscopy is in MAY
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 09:04:34	@lissyvz omg - how did you stay out of lockdown?????
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 08:55:32	@pgoss i HAVE coverage, and STILL can't afford to go to the doc
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 08:54:26	@lissyvz thanks for the RT - and yes, the suicide jokes are the worst . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 08:29:11	Note to self: never joke with a psychiatrist - they don't have a sense of humor
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 08:01:21	@FibroButterfly thanks for RTing the link - can ya tell the article pissed me off?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 07:59:20	@FibroButterfly +and perhaps even a doctor who knows the difference between physical and mental illnesses.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 07:59:05	@FibroButterfly +Besides which, there are no such things as “crying Jaguars”. You should probably get yourself an editor who knows English,
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 07:58:10	@FibroButterfly Excuse me - chronic fatigue is a PHYSICAL illness, not a mental disorder!!
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 07:57:11	@FibroButterfly my comment will probably be moderated out, so here it is:
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 07:56:09	@FibroButterfly i'm not real concerned about anyone paying much attention to an article that talks about "crying Jaguars" -
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 06:41:55	@EmperorNorton ooops - that last one was for you, i missed the button and didn't notice til too late
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 06:41:17	only if the thing is in ATL - i can't afford to travel - lol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 06:40:24	@Bipolar_Blogs maybe so, but somebody had to say it for you to repeat it - if they follow you, they saw it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 06:35:16	@Bipolar_Blogs good for you!! If he's lookin at the puter instead of you, can you even be sure he's paying attention? Sounds unethical to me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 06:34:00	@MeridianTapping the VA WANTS ppl they have to treat to die - it saves them money
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 06:33:05	@Kazcita i don't understand folks that find it necessary to hate ppl they don't even know for something that doesn't affect them personally
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 06:17:34	@Kazcita even worse for her son tho - can you imagine being gay, and knowing your mother has that attitude?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 06:03:48	@Kazcita that's news to me - AND to our two gay roommates
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 06:00:50	woooooot!!! i just got a new high score on bejeweled - 92,950
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 03:40:11	ugggghhhh, i guess it's time to go start the banana bread i promised the roomies - at least hubby will get a nice surprise . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 03:39:27	@torturedsoul he's adorable - annoying sometimes, but adorable nonetheless
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 03:26:16	@torturedsoul meanness just asks me "whatcha doin?" every time i do something new, or tells me what a "good boy" i am when i give him kisses
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 03:22:17	@torturedsoul got me VERY well trained
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 03:21:51	@torturedsoul rofl - he's a brat, but he's my baby . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 03:09:38	@torturedsoul wouldn't have been so bad, but he had his own grapenuts - just wanted mine
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 03:09:08	@torturedsoul turned my back this morning to get the milk, turned back around, he was stealin grapenuts out of my bowl
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 03:08:10	@torturedsoul *giggles* but how many do you know that fly down and try to help themselves to dinner?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 03:04:09	@torturedsoul he's an 18 yr old cocatiel - spoiled rotten mama's bird lol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 02:58:11	@torturedsoul in GA too . . . we're neighbors lol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 02:54:06	@torturedsoul Oh, i know.Friends are always askin me about that kind of thing - my advice - spend your money on a lotto ticket, better odds
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-09 02:50:03	@torturedsoul that's the whole scam - get ppl to pay you to tell em how to get other ppl to pay them

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 15:11:14	@Hyacinths4 rofl- there we go, my language is "colorful" - that sounds much better than "foul-mouthed"
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:51:59	@BPDINOKC i could definitely make a good argument for that one
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:49:57	@BPDINOKC of course, he'd prolly just remind me that i was crazy WAAAAYYY before he came along, so i can't blame it on him - lol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:46:47	@BPDINOKC uh oh, i'm gonna get blasted - good thing hubby doesn't do twitter
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:45:32	@Hyacinths4 he's a really bad influence, too - when i'm with my friends,i tend to be pretty foul-mouthed
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:44:47	@Hyacinths4 lol - i was being restrained, mine usually cuss like a sailor-prolly cuz hubby was a squid, and curses to beat the band
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:40:37	@Hyacinths4 that's what causes my problems 9 times out of 10, because if i don't push, i don't get the things done that i need to do
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:39:12	@Hyacinths4 mine are ALWAYS saying, "dammit, stop overdoing it"
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:38:10	i've got work to do, but instead, i'm tweeting and playing bejeweled - can you say LAZY?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:36:24	@BPDINOKC did you see the Carlin quote yesterday? Men are stupid and women are crazy, but women are crazy BECAUSE men are stupid
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:34:31	@Hyacinths4 omg - and i was upset about my knees griping because i stood up too long
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:25:16	@BPDINOKC hate away - sometimes you just have to VENT
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:23:54	@FreshFoodCA THAT is exactly the reason that i still buy paper books - if someone wants to take it back, they have to go thru the courts
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:16:56	@teeskie i wish i'd saved it, it was really stupid - i think it was actually posted on here tho, - it's been a while
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:15:29	@FreshFoodCA and i mostly MAKE our snack type stuff, so i don't have to worry a lot about getting them in processed foods either
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:14:25	@FreshFoodCA i solved the trans fat problem by only using liquid oils or (very limited amounts of) butter
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 14:10:39	@Hyacinths4 ouchie!!!
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 12:44:54	i need some catnip - i think i'll fix some tea
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 12:43:43	@Fierstarr damn - i saw cat NIP, not catnap, and was jealous of the kitty
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-08 12:27:55	@teeskie nope - it's not . . . some idiot tweeted a bank robbery instead of callin 911, and THAT was an adult

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:46:47	@fmslife he switches between nick at nite and tvland, and sometimes the car channels and espn
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:45:04	@Hyacinths4 i'm allergic to ragweed, so i haven't tried chamomile - i do catnip and ginger with green tea, and use lavender essential oil
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:42:04	@Hyacinths4 rofl - one of the proposals i have out on elance is to write an aromatherapy ebook for someone
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:39:28	@Hyacinths4 ginger tea is WONDERFUL stuff
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:38:43	@fmslife right at the moment, Roseanne is on the tv, he's got music coming out of his computer, AND he's talkin to about 4 ppl on skype
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:37:26	@Hyacinths4 i want to study herbalism when i get some money coming in - i'm discovering herbs can be very helpful with the fibro
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:35:59	@fmslife he's got adult ADD, and can't stand for it to be quiet, so if he's here, the tv is on, and sometimes the radio, too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:35:11	@fmslife rofl - at least now he's working, so i get control of the remote sometimes, and can even turn the tv OFF every now and then
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:32:28	@Hyacinths4 writing - i've got some articles on helium, and have a couple proposals out on elance, plus i'm researching a couple of ebooks
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:30:47	@fmslife it is, however, better than waking up to Dora the Explorer because he likes to watch Fresh Prince when he goes to bed
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:29:38	@fmslife lol - i WISH
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 13:26:27	help - the hubby is makin me watch Roseanne repeats

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 12:46:34	@Hyacinths4 i'm learning about pacing - right now, getting the freelancing off the ground comes first so i don't have to live in a cubical
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 12:33:26	@Hyacinths4 i wish - it's the health issues that stop me, not the lack of available stuff - but i reallly, really miss it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-09-07 10:08:47	@BPDINOKC by a TWO year old

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-17 16:48:05	@Gone84 yay!!! now if i just had some relevant articles with decent html, i'd have it made. word conversion needs major tweaks
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-17 15:54:34	@Gone84 will do - will convert a helium article to html, just for testing
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-17 15:53:33	@Gone84 mmmhmmm, and the ads are sometimes hard to recognize as ads. a good place to look for fibro stuff is http://chronicfatigue.about.com

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-17 15:43:13	@Gone84 as long as they've got a disclaimer about not doin it without checkin with a doc, you should be okay
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-17 15:40:01	@lissyvz i thought it was cute, tho - only reason i could think of too. my stepdad used to raise shepherds, never heard of one worth that
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-17 15:38:18	@Gone84 after 13 years of it, i should be an expert :) and the alternative stuff is really interesting, too http://twurl.nl/533atc
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-17 15:34:16	@lissyvz lol - that would be a mean thing to do to the pooch
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-17 15:28:12	@Gone84 good for you ,. ,. , no tellin what you'd get otherwise - i'm considering one myself, on alternative treatments

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:35:53	@FibroHaven thanks, that would be great - i'd love to not have to spend most of my time in bed on hot packs, or in a hot tub
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:33:07	@FibroHaven just for really bad days, when nothing else helps, or for the 3 day migraines
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:32:26	@FibroHaven i figure i'm probably going to continue to manage without major prescription intervention, but it would be nice have pain stuff
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:31:23	@FibroHaven i'm afraid to try yoga without an instructor, because of old back and neck injuries, but as soon as i can afford it . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:26:07	@FibroHaven yes - i have an interaction guide i use, that i reviewed on my blog. i also have a huge wish list on amazon - lol

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:22:50	@FibroHaven i've been learning, and as i can afford to buy something, i experiment, carefully, to see how it affects me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:21:22	@FibroHaven you can do the tea two to three times a day. powdered doesn't work as well, cuz the active ingredients lose strength over time
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:19:38	@FibroHaven if you have powdered ginger in the cabinet, use about a teaspoon instead of the fresh
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:18:38	@FibroHaven the sedative effect of the catnip moderates the stimulation of the ginger and keeps me from gettin manic
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:17:44	@FibroHaven i normally add catnip to mine, since i'm also bipolar, and ginger is a stimulant and can cause mania - catnip is sedative
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:16:13	@FibroHaven pour about a cup of hot water over it and steep for 10 minutes (minimum), sweeten with a bit of honey
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:15:13	@FibroHaven cut a chunk of ginger off a root, about an inch long, peel, cut into small chunks and drop it into the cup,
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:12:01	@FibroHaven great info - i've tried all of these, and they really do help (i'm making ginger tea as i type, for a headache and sore neck)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-14 02:07:41	@FibroHaven thank you for reposting it - i'm always interested in natural ways of coping with my fibro

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 18:53:54	@Midnightmatters course, buying a book does put it all in one place . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 18:51:54	@Midnightmatters don't need to spend money on a book to tell you how to eat to prevent reactive hypoglycemia - the info is out there free
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 18:22:37	@Midnightmatters specially if i have to call and ask a question, like at a business or doc's office
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 18:20:59	@Midnightmatters omg - telephones - i HATE them. i have a minor phone phobia when it comes to having to call ppl i don't know.

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 18:04:06	@Midnightmatters yep, it can happen - parties are not safe for me, i either get anxiety attacks or get hypomanic (i don't DO crowds well)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 18:01:00	@Midnightmatters i HAVE to go up and see the roomies at least once a day. there's no kitchen in the cottage, so dinner is at the main house
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 17:59:17	@Midnightmatters and i, at least, tend to isolate even more. Luckily, now that hubby and i have roommates, it's a lot harder to do

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 16:02:40	omg - in Memphis TN, it's illegal for a woman to drive a car unless there is a man walking or running in front of it waving a red flag
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 15:57:45	@MarcyRubin it would, it would. i was wearin shorts, so i know the seat was COLD - major shrinkage
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 15:53:51	@MarcyRubin it was HILARIOUS
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 15:50:45	@MarcyRubin although it might have been the yelp when he sat down an his butt hit the bare seat. he'd never worn a kilt, didn't know to tuck
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 15:49:29	@MarcyRubin little bitty black lady - we decided she must have figured he was a neo-nazi or something,

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 15:39:27	@MarcyRubin they talked Him into changing into it at the festival, and He wore it home. Picture a 6'1", 260 lb white guy with a shaved head
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 15:37:42	@MarcyRubin hubby and i scared the shit out of one little old lady on the train a few years ago - we went to pride to buy Him a kilt
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 15:28:29	@MarcyRubin did you ever hear the Cosby skit about the free entertainment on the subway?? sometimes *I"M* the free entertainment
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 15:26:39	@Midnightmatters i walk when i can, but with the fibro and hypoglycemia, it's not an option very often
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 15:24:14	@MarcyRubin i don't have a car any more - couldn't afford the payments when i lost the job, so now i take the bus. thank goodness for MARTA

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 15:15:33	@MarcyRubin i couldn't return any of it, the vast majority was dinners out, computer software, and books and CDs

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 14:59:54	@MarcyRubin the last time i had a full blown manic episode, i spent $30,000 in 3 months, all on credit. that's how i got diagnosed
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 14:53:11	@Midnightmatters i hate that ANYONE has to deal with the meds, but i hate it worse when they need them and can't get them
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 14:51:51	@Midnightmatters sometimes it takes more strength to take the meds and deal with the crap that goes with them, i'm sorry that you understand
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 14:48:37	@Midnightmatters as do the rest of us . . . every day is a new learning experience, sometimes quite unpleasant
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 14:42:31	@Midnightmatters or look down on those who NEED meds to cope, assuming that they're just weak
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 14:41:30	@Midnightmatters and sharing that is a wonderful thing, as long as you don't demand others do as you do,
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 14:36:32	@MarcyRubin @Midnightmatters and different complicating factors, many of which they have no control over
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 14:33:34	@Midnightmatters just like what works for me may not work for you
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 14:32:36	@Midnightmatters but your personal experience doesn't necessarily transfer. just because something works 4 U doesn't mean it will work 4 me
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 14:23:53	@EmperorNorton i did - and nearly sprayed my coffee on the puter
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-09 13:55:44	@EmperorNorton lol - of course he doesn't believe it, it's his folks that are doin it - but if it was the Dems doin it, he'd be ranting

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-06 08:16:45	@EmperorNorton in other words, they're hoping we'll pay them more than $3000 in the next year, and die before the coverage kicks in
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-06 08:15:00	@EmperorNorton they don't cover his high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or adult ADD, either - not til the 12 months are up
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-06 08:14:03	@EmperorNorton we have to pay $300 a month for 12 months first - pre-existing conditions are unpaid til then
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-08-06 08:12:58	@EmperorNorton they do! we're finally eligible for ins thru hubby's work - only my bipolar, fibro, migraines and hypoglycemia aren't covered

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 16:03:46	@CliveWild rofl, there is that - they do say that the mad are more creative - we gotta get SOMETHIN good outta this
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 16:02:47	@EmperorNorton caps are wonderful things
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:59:59	@EmperorNorton adopted, that is
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:59:42	@EmperorNorton they also yell about putting the baby up for adoption, but don't worry about the fact that if the baby isn't perfect it's not
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:58:02	@CliveWild okay, now I'M worried - i answer myself all the time *giggles* but then, i've never claimed to be sane
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:56:39	@Treagus but i think the numbers are screwy anyway - my number goes up by two, i go look, there's only one new follower
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:55:14	@EmperorNorton with some of the adoption horror stories out there, no, i can't
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:54:07	@Treagus now i don't feel so bad i only lost about a dozen
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:53:05	@EmperorNorton now THAT's the way to fight against abortion - give women other, workable options
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:52:15	@CliveWild when i'm depressed, i don't talk to ANYONE, including myself
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:49:11	@EmperorNorton what really gets me is the claims that it's "in God's name" sounds like blasphemy to me - making decisions for god
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:45:19	@EmperorNorton seems to me if killing is wrong, then killing ANYONE is wrong
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:40:02	@EmperorNorton how can you say "killing is wrong" then go out and kill someone?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:38:24	@EmperorNorton it looks that way. i'll never understand why some folks think it's okay 4 THEM to murder folks
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:34:29	@EmperorNorton however - it's the wrong kind of hanger, can't untwist the plastic ones
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 15:28:33	@EmperorNorton lol

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 14:28:49	@lissyvz milk baths are supposed to be good for the skin - dunno if i didn't do it often enough or what, but i didn't see a difference
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 14:15:27	@lissyvz i START with water, but have added all kinds of interesting things to it - herbal teas, salt, even powdered milk
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 13:55:13	@lissyvz rofl - you'd be surprised at some of the things i've put in the tub - but i never tried potatoes
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 13:54:25	@BPDINOKC lol okay, you got water, right?? alternate warm and cold compresses 20 min warm, 20 min off, 20 min cold, 20 min off
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 13:47:57	the pineapple should be eaten, the parsley or potato applied externally - parsley crushed and applied, the potato cut
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 13:46:21	@BPDINOKC well shoot- how about pineapple, fresh parsley, or potoatoes?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 13:41:44	the great thing about epsom salt is that it's full of magnesium that can be absorbed thru the skin, and stress depletes magnesium
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 13:39:29	@BPDINOKC do you have any kind of bath salts? dead sea salt, scented bath salt, anything like that? those would work too
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 13:32:08	@BPDINOKC man that sucks . . . bruises aren't fun. . . try a warm bath with epsom salt, it will help the soreness
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-24 09:41:40	growls - stupid twitter is puttin the posts on my background, and i can't read them

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-23 02:32:10	you know you're getting old when it takes forever to scroll down to your year of birth in the dropdown

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-22 04:54:20	Doesn't that make you even worse than the person you claim is a killer? Not only have you killed someone, you've set YOURSELF up as god.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-22 04:52:44	i'm confused. How is it okay to commit a murder to prevent something YOU consider murder?

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-18 06:45:50	@Treagus just be careful with that one, too much ginger can trigger a manic episode (i couldn't try it with my migraine yesterday, too sick)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-18 06:44:09	@Treagus if you have powdered ginger in the spice cabinet, you can try a teaspoon of that mixed in lemonade or something similar
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-18 06:42:29	@Treagus yw - it will even help a little with migraine, although not as much a with a tension headache
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-18 06:32:04	@Treagus if you have it, a blend of 2tsp carrier oil, 25 drops lavender, 5 drops each peppermint and rosemary essential oils, will help
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-07-18 06:30:40	@Treagus i use lavender essential oil on the temples,

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-26 13:32:27	@EmperorNorton the answer to that one is also #3wordsduringsex yes, i do - lol

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-25 06:37:56	@EmperorNorton ohhhhh my - love the cacti, they're great
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-25 04:03:22	Swiss woman fired for using facebook while sick http://bit.ly/rHNbW
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-25 01:12:07	@BPDINOKC lol - i know that feeling
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-25 00:35:14	@lissyvz that's what i mean too - i haven't had any meds in over a year, the only thing i take is otc ibuprophen and tylenol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-25 00:12:34	@lissyvz well, for me it's definitely not drugs-lol-i don't have any
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 10:14:02	@EmperorNorton hell, at this point, i'd be happy to oblige them, but i'm not allowed to die - lol
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 10:10:13	@EmperorNorton who's gonna hire someone who was out on disability leave 18 of the last 36 months they worked? but SS says i'm not disabled
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 10:09:01	@EmperorNorton i'm tryin to get into a program to help disabled folks get a job - but i don't have much hope of that
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 10:03:28	@EmperorNorton i know what you mean. the way things are set up now, a married couple without kids don't qualify for ANY kind of help
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 09:54:05	@EmperorNorton tell me about it - we're livin on about $800 a month after the rent is paid
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 09:41:18	@EmperorNorton the real question is how to scrape up the money to pay a doc to write the script
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 09:39:57	@EmperorNorton well, in a lil over a month, we'll qualify for insurance thru his job, IF he can stay stable enough to keep working
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 09:37:10	@EmperorNorton been there, done that, they say we don't qualify, even tho neither of us has been able to take meds in over a year
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 09:34:34	@EmperorNorton hubby's ADD medication is almost $400 for a month's supply, or it was the last time we were able to afford it 18 months ago
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 09:32:59	@EmperorNorton or perhaps it's just that psychiatric medications tend to be more expensive than meds for other stuff
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 09:32:14	@EmperorNorton me too. the only thing i can figure is that maybe it has something to do with comorbid conditions
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 09:30:07	@EmperorNorton "many of the specialty costs for bipolar patients are not directly related to seeing a mental health provider.” from article
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 03:18:43	i just spent 5 minutes trying to come up with "elective"
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 03:17:55	is aphasia one of the cognitive symptoms of fibromyalgia?? i keep losing words. i know what i want to say, know the word, but can't GET it.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 02:58:24	ohhhhhh, i hate when that happens - hit the wrong "x" an closed my tab
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 02:52:53	@kevleitch rofl - yeah, touching it would be bad. did they mention you shouldn't look right at it?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 02:51:22	@SarahWisbey i have so many headaches from the fibro i'd never notice extras from meds i know its fibro cuz i've been off meds the last year
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-24 00:14:15	@kevleitch that yellow thing in the sky . . . i remember seeing that, it's been a loooooong time tho
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-23 12:50:37	@GinaSelir that's a great article - and spot on, too. ppl with chronic pain face a lot of stigma, cuz folks assume we're just addicts
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-23 11:33:34	@MarcyRubin they STILL said they weren't gonna stop. Ppl are IDIOTS . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-23 11:32:51	@MarcyRubin Dr Phil did a show about that. They even tested em on a test track, showed em how much worse their drivin was while they texted
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-23 10:06:39	i give up, lets see if the TENS unit will help anything
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-23 05:54:21	i want to cry - did some cleanin today, an now i'm payin for it with pain so bad i can't see straight. heatin pad, here i come.
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-23 02:45:07	@MoodieProf omg - poor chipmunk. So do you know anyone he can see? :-)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-22 13:04:09	@BPDINOKC i know the feeling
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-22 11:32:06	RT @lissyvzthis is where I get my mood chart from (and instructions for use) #BIPOLAR http://bit.ly/Mmxt8 - very handy!

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-21 12:39:40	@othesun23 i've made new friends that accept me as i am - they don't really understand it all, but they're willing to learn, and that's good
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-21 12:37:58	@EmperorNorton why on earth would they ban you for THAT photo????? Have they lost their minds??
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-21 07:09:32	@othesun23 yep. doesn't help much, does it? ppl are idiots about stuff they don't understand - and they don't WANT to understand bipolar
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-21 06:49:15	@othesun23 i know what you mean about stigma - when i got diagnosed ppl that had known me for years started treatin me like i was dangerous
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-20 03:53:28	@othesun23 self discipline? what's that? lol - definitely not something *i* have
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-19 13:06:15	@MarcyRubin exactly-and when i'm in this place, i need familiar things around me. my books have always been a bit of a security blanket
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-19 12:55:39	@MarcyRubin they do indeed have lots of quite interesting books, however, they aren't old friends like the ones i had :-)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-19 12:47:11	@MarcyRubin i just wish i'd been able to save all of my books and stuff when we lost the house - i miss them
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-19 12:36:54	@MarcyRubin i've been hiding in my Harry Potter books - i've read 5 of the 6 in the last 3 days, i wish i had more fiction, it helps
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-19 12:13:02	havin a rough week - days like today, all i want to do is sleep and sleep til it's over #bipolar
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-18 02:19:38	@SarahWisbey not all - just not completely here, either
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-18 01:07:01	@tonyhawk - tease! now i really want to see it http://twitpic.com/5d6di
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-18 01:04:08	what a weekend . . . can i just skip over the next week and go straight to payday? :-)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-16 03:08:16	for anyone who loves cats http://lolcats.com - it's hilarious
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-16 01:39:31	headed up to the main house with one of my Harry Potter books to watch for the mail - i'm expecting a package, and may have to sign for it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-16 00:53:44	@leighshev poor parrot. My cocatiel hates hawks too, has a hissy if he sees one
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-16 00:50:46	@SarahWisbey thanks - habits i can fix - :-)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-16 00:38:17	@SarahWisbey ty, ty, i thought that might be it, but wasn't sure
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-16 00:30:08	@SarahWisbey nope, not a one, and i'm good at recognizing them. i've been suicidal off and on since i was 5 - 45 years ago
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-16 00:28:33	okay, i give up - what is #followfriday ?
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-16 00:21:21	@SarahWisbey it seems to happen more when i'm on the downward spiral, or in a mixed episode - any kind of stress or frustration triggers it
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-16 00:07:21	@SarahWisbey it freaks me out, and it's happening more and more often. there's not even anything i can do about it, no insurance and no help
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-15 23:53:15	does anyone else just randomly have the thought "i wish i was dead" pop into their heads even when they aren't suicidal? #bipolar
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-15 23:06:38	@BPDINOKC - omg is right, how weird is that? I'd freak if it suggested my stepdad . . .
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-15 06:42:04	@Bipolar_Blogs i have conversations in my head all the time- you tellin me that ain't normal? :-)
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-14 23:37:10	@commonsense4 day off? what's that? i think i work harder now that i don't have a "job" than i did before
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-14 10:17:49	@EmperorNorton - good for you, i wish i could say the same
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-14 10:04:19	informal poll: how many of the bipolar folk on here are smokers?? I've heard that ppl with bipolar are more likely to smoke . . .

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-13 02:04:17	uggghh, being bipolar sucks - having a mixed episode, and all i want to do is scream, or throw things, i HATE being irritable

37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-10 05:15:49	@victorjkennedy that is soooooo true. madness has it's own unique intelligence, and what it creates is sometimes amazing #bipolar
37555979	kimmieCollas	2009-05-10 05:14:08	RT @victorjkennedy People see no use in madness. That's why they pay it no attention. In fact, they avoid it at all cost. More fool them.
