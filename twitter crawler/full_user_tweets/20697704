20697704	wayne386	2016-11-29 16:22:11	@MCRMetrolink any chance you could put more doubles on the Rochdale line, I've seen more room in a Japanese bullet train..

20697704	wayne386	2016-10-25 19:35:04	@LithiumLibGirl don't get me wrong it's a good drug, but it's a bit slow to work it's magic
20697704	wayne386	2016-10-25 19:31:33	@LithiumLibGirl it seems to be a side effect of the aripiprazole, I never managed to get it sorted till I switched drugs..
20697704	wayne386	2016-10-25 19:30:01	@sainsburys still waiting for that DM..
20697704	wayne386	2016-10-25 19:23:38	@RosalynRodenOC Call me stupid, but it would have been nice to inform me that you were going to quote me in the Oldham chronicle..

20697704	wayne386	2016-10-19 22:08:03	@sainsburys it was the Oldham store, and the store managers attitude towards the situation was frankly disgusting...
20697704	wayne386	2016-10-19 17:45:45	@sainsburys also ask @Sainsburys_Bank to check there DM's it's contains a email address, where we can talk further without the limit.

20697704	wayne386	2016-09-30 15:17:25	@bbcradiomanc does not surprise me ..... all the officers and I use that term loosely are about as honest as a nine bob note.
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-29 02:16:09	@matthewbloch true, but personally I would demand a wet ink signed warrant, due to your customers data privacy!
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-28 21:16:30	@TonicHealth2 @btbusinesscare two weeks for openfail is quite fast to be honest
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-28 20:18:02	@TonicHealth2 @btbusinesscare shouldn't that be all hail openreach for patching your ageing phone line...
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-28 20:09:44	@matthewbloch although you could have a laugh, ring them and ask
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-28 20:06:29	@matthewbloch tv licensing would be banging on your doors and demanding to inspect your receiving equipment #crapita #stupidrules
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-28 20:04:40	@NatWest_Help just seen you tv ad, looks good, is that what all the Â£6 charges for failed DD's paid for? #pretendingtocare
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-25 04:59:57	@HackOldham @TJG1 would this be like @OldhamCouncil who perform mitm attacks? On their public wifi Please say no.....
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-22 03:19:19	@William_Leech @tvlicensing would love to hear crapita's response to this one.....
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-19 23:44:23	@FixBritInternet am happy to sign, however you represent the largest isp's why can't said isps build own network and not rely on open reach
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-19 21:07:01	@UncleThargy @BTCare please please tell me you used recorded mail. #noexcusesforlostinthepost
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-19 00:28:48	@UncleThargy @silevy @BTCare you can't complain really only 8 days.... /sarcasm
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-15 19:30:14	@oddsocket @YPLAC or better yet, a nice deep scratch that will rust come winter

20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 23:42:28	@VodafoneUKhelp also could someone translate this error message for me? pic.twitter.com/RX6eAoqoHp
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 22:52:51	@VodafoneUKhelp quite simply, do you agree with them / abide by them?
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 18:16:23	@BTCare @UncleThargy what actually is the problem???
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 18:13:08	@VodafoneUKhelp Hi, Do you subscribe to Ofcom's voluntary code of practise 2010 (residential) ??
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 17:58:51	@UncleThargy @BTCare Is this the point you jump ship to someone with better customer service??
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 17:57:36	@VodafoneUK Do you subscribe to ofcoms's voluntary code of practise (residential) ??
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 03:31:01	@UncleThargy that's true
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 01:44:08	@UncleThargy just a thought is the faulty line at home or the office???
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 01:23:37	@UncleThargy heard a rumour that Vodafone are planning own fibre to the premises network (already deployed in eire) I've crossed everything
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 01:19:58	@UncleThargy I asked isp what would happen if I replaced drop wire with open reach spec cable you can imaging reply..
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 01:14:50	@UncleThargy even had them saying can't find property, I offered them gps coordinates, still waiting....
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 01:13:36	@UncleThargy the best bit is, when the wind picks up the drop wire moves the dsl drops, but hey I'm not openreach so I'm not qualified.
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-09 01:06:48	@UncleThargy @BTCare I feel your pain, still waiting for openfail to fix a line fault
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-06 21:59:11	@loudmouthman or their security expert is a Microsoft employee
20697704	wayne386	2016-09-06 21:55:24	@loudmouthman haha

20697704	wayne386	2016-09-01 05:58:53	@BTGroup @TomMockridgeVM haha, consider that BT was given the network and didn't have to build one!!!
20697704	wayne386	2016-08-15 19:38:08	@mneylon reminds me of the Microsoft incident and a USA court thinking they had jurisdiction
20697704	wayne386	2016-08-15 19:34:21	@mneylon so does that apply the other way round american company Irish DC ;-)
20697704	wayne386	2016-08-14 22:20:37	@andyd close, 34 and on Vodafone

20697704	wayne386	2016-08-04 23:55:45	@OUComputing true but every registrar asks which country you are based in, thus come renewal I foresee a problem

20697704	wayne386	2016-07-17 16:28:36	@OldhamNews @MENnewsdesk did they demolish civic centre, looks out of window sadly, and returns to bed..
20697704	wayne386	2016-07-11 23:56:38	@OldhamCouncil why do you insist on waisting so much cash eg silly flower displays yet we suffer with the highest council tax in the region?

20697704	wayne386	2016-01-11 20:33:12	@followpocock and admitting to yourself that you have a mental illness is almost impossible
20697704	wayne386	2016-01-11 20:28:47	@FollowPocock just seen you post on planet Ubuntu, as a person with bipolar, its a hard one, both in a professional sense and the stigma
20697704	wayne386	2016-01-07 22:05:15	@natural20 its basically the same only you control the hardware thus you own the data, have a look at http:// ownCloud.org
20697704	wayne386	2016-01-07 21:03:07	@natural20 regarding dropbox, have you considered ownCloud??

20697704	wayne386	2015-12-16 04:42:30	@ChloeRaccoon makes you wonder how btb have any customers left, with that level of support
20697704	wayne386	2015-12-16 04:38:47	@ChloeRaccoon yup, and the really annoying thing is it makes you look bad in front of your customer
20697704	wayne386	2015-12-16 04:37:03	@ChloeRaccoon or the sales droids are just useless
20697704	wayne386	2015-12-16 04:35:25	@ChloeRaccoon they don't do sim provides, wow that is ..... Shocking

20697704	wayne386	2015-12-15 20:51:56	@ChloeRaccoon omg that sounds like a nightmare
20697704	wayne386	2015-12-15 20:16:05	@ChloeRaccoon @BTBusiness what's the job? If you don't mind me asking.

20697704	wayne386	2015-02-02 18:24:33	@BipolarBlogger I cant do this morning dose for much longer.

20697704	wayne386	2015-02-01 23:03:10	@wizardsLtd Hiya, folks when does your office open on Monday morning?
20697704	wayne386	2015-02-01 20:29:54	@davesleney To much blood in your caffeine system ???
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 21:21:31	Lmao, just had a letter from PIP regarding my Christmas bonus.
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 05:42:45	@BipolarTweets I found the Venlafaxine made my cycles worse
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 05:38:30	@BipolarTweets no they 'cant' ask for your medical notes, it's optional, I've been on those meds before. didnt work !!!
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 05:36:14	@BipolarTweets oh plus the diazapam when needed
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 05:35:50	@BipolarTweets yup, what are you on?
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 05:35:13	@BipolarTweets 4 and a bit years for me, you sending a copy of your GP's notes is optional, they give you the envelope after the face 2 face
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 05:31:56	@BipolarTweets nope, they look at your 'medical' issues not your employment status,
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 05:30:56	@BipolarTweets Errrrrr, let me ask my better half. Ariprazole & Quetapine
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 05:29:43	@BipolarTweets No work at the moment (not stable)
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 05:22:36	@BipolarTweets 4 months!!, but they are improving..
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 04:18:53	@LithiumLibGirl try me
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 04:18:36	@BipolarTweets I was manic, when i saw them, most of the information is captured on the form anyway..
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 03:59:04	@LithiumLibGirl Anything I can help with?
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-31 03:56:32	@BipolarTweets I felt the same, but the extra money helps, all they ask is about your day to day experiences, p.s. take your meds with you.
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-30 20:35:48	Time to go and pick up the missus..
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-30 20:33:36	@ChloeRaccoon DM sent

20697704	wayne386	2015-01-30 20:23:46	@ChloeRaccoon reminds me of the time a client had a broken leg, SP argued he has data so no need to send openreach ! #openreachfails
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-30 20:15:20	@ChloeRaccoon @BTBusiness o m g, muppets
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-30 16:05:46	@BipolarTweets Just like a text book case, complete with the bad mood when manic, why do you ask?
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-29 19:50:23	@ChadWeather Is this it for the snow? or are we due some more?
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-29 04:22:35	@BipolarTweets I've applied and been granted PIP, Every penny helps
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-28 01:24:40	@ChadWeather any sign of this snow. We keep hearing about???

20697704	wayne386	2015-01-19 19:16:56	@BipolarBlogger I have yet to hear that one.
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-19 19:12:36	@BipolarBlogger I hate it when my GP/ Psych says "Not compliant" on my notes..
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-16 21:47:11	@LivinwithBATman @bipolar_ptsd Maybe I should take a lesson from this..
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-16 03:55:54	@bipolar_ptsd @LivinwithBATman but how many of us live by this rule? I dont...

20697704	wayne386	2015-01-13 03:35:35	@TheRealRevK then does not understand, when you attempt to educate them about good password hygiene.
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-13 03:32:58	@TheRealRevK or worse if it's a high value transaction or suspicious one, some person rings you and asks for all your passwords in full..
20697704	wayne386	2015-01-13 03:30:10	@TheRealRevK It's their new anti-fraud system, It blocks all useful transactions give it 24 hrs and a computer will txt you...

20697704	wayne386	2013-09-07 20:03:34	@JoJoBonetto sounds painful
20697704	wayne386	2013-09-07 20:01:17	@JoJoBonetto fair enough

20697704	wayne386	2013-07-30 19:53:18	@LithiumLibGirl can I ask what made you decide to try abilify?

20697704	wayne386	2013-06-20 03:51:38	@SchizophrenicGB hmm, maybe i should go for the injectable version and only have to worry about it once per month !
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-20 03:42:38	@_xLEANNEx_ ha ha
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-19 19:37:21	@SchizophrenicGB ty, the major problem is most of the time i don't want to take my medication, any tips for that one?
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-16 03:56:19	@electroboyusa Great video
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-15 22:10:21	@SchizophrenicGB i could do with one of those.
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-15 21:48:53	@_xLEANNEx_ YAY !!!
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 04:03:54	@JoJoBonetto 6 years already?
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 04:01:30	@JoJoBonetto love the look of the island
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:54:51	@JoJoBonetto I wish i remember my seroquel days,
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:52:33	@JoJoBonetto thats true
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:51:22	@JoJoBonetto ha ha
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:50:07	@JoJoBonetto I think i'll stop reading now...
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:49:13	@JoJoBonetto probably, but it's still scary reading
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:48:01	@JoJoBonetto thats just scared the shit out of me
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:45:34	@JoJoBonetto nms?
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:43:36	@JoJoBonetto ahhh
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:41:21	@JoJoBonetto there is rumors of a injectable version of abilify ,if thats any interest to you?
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:36:12	@JoJoBonetto double ouch
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:35:17	@JoJoBonetto ouch
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:34:10	@JoJoBonetto I knew you were bad with meds ,i didnt think you were that bad.
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:31:28	@JoJoBonetto I wish.
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:29:54	@JoJoBonetto i want to go back on the lithium, but leanne says hell no way !!!
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:26:11	@JoJoBonetto oh i also have some diazipam, 'just in case' used it once never again
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:25:13	@JoJoBonetto It's quite a good drug, no blood tests, no hunger pangs
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:20:26	@JoJoBonetto strangely enough I've yet to be offered valporate, it seems to be the same two abilify and seroquel.
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-11 03:16:10	@JoJoBonetto can i 'borrow' that one? for the next time I don't want the abilify.

20697704	wayne386	2013-06-06 02:13:16	Just had a lovely meal with @_xLEANNEx_ and the girls
20697704	wayne386	2013-06-01 03:17:03	@SchizophrenicGB mildly expensive, but you get what you pay for...
20697704	wayne386	2013-05-31 23:08:18	@SchizophrenicGB for an even more professional isp than +net try @TimicoUK
20697704	wayne386	2013-05-29 01:03:54	@TheRealSupermum Yes, but I don't think it achieves anything, other than lost pay..
20697704	wayne386	2013-05-27 21:30:39	So it appears that walking around with your country's flag can now get you arrested..
20697704	wayne386	2013-05-27 05:05:45	@SchizophrenicGB done
20697704	wayne386	2013-05-23 05:09:51	@JoJoBonetto stressed over something?

20697704	wayne386	2013-02-09 22:04:20	@LithiumLibGirl Good point, thanks
20697704	wayne386	2013-02-09 22:02:40	@LithiumLibGirl lets put it this way, i overheard a conversation between him & another patient he "demanded" she take her medication there.
20697704	wayne386	2013-02-09 22:00:20	@LithiumLibGirl He's a firm believer in drug therapies.
20697704	wayne386	2013-02-09 21:58:11	@LithiumLibGirl let me re-phrase that the chances of that happening are 0 in a trillion.
20697704	wayne386	2013-02-09 21:55:43	@LithiumLibGirl yeah right thats NEVER gonna happen../me is facing a massive struggle on this one.
20697704	wayne386	2013-02-09 21:48:57	@LithiumLibGirl there is also the point, I do not wish to take anything else anymore
20697704	wayne386	2013-02-09 21:47:03	@LithiumLibGirl In my mind, the side effects out weigh the benefits everytime !
