274535898	act1175	2016-12-18 03:48:39	But there is absolutely no way I can work like this..was hoping to go back Monday despite being signed off till Xmas but not sure I can..
274535898	act1175	2016-12-18 03:47:57	As the sedation is easing my anxiety levels creep up again..never used full dose of prn before but guess what, it works!
274535898	act1175	2016-12-14 20:05:17	@BipolarBlogger but now highly medicated and my gp has added prn to my repeats so that is helping for now..
274535898	act1175	2016-12-14 20:04:07	@BipolarBlogger and all exacerbated by a Dr who didn't know me refusing to give me prn despite it being in my care plan!!
274535898	act1175	2016-12-14 20:03:06	@BipolarBlogger I have had the worst 6 weeks since diagnosis and I thought I was doing things to help but that's just not enough sometimes..
274535898	act1175	2016-12-14 19:38:29	Second day of higher dose and while the sedation is hard the numbing affect it has is helping with the crippling anxiety of late..
274535898	act1175	2016-12-14 19:37:02	@BipolarBlogger yep this is me too..
274535898	act1175	2016-12-14 00:54:43	@LithiumLibGirl thanks lovely & I'm so sorry you've been through the mill recently..sedation is hard but also giving me a much needed break!
274535898	act1175	2016-12-13 22:49:14	Me lowering the dose earlier in the year to well below what I should be on finally caught with me and hit me hard..rest is what I need..
274535898	act1175	2016-12-13 22:45:47	Finally seen my Dr, meds upped quite a lot and signed off work till Xmas..first day of utter sedation but it's what I need and I know that.
274535898	act1175	2016-12-07 02:37:33	Not doing very well, am checking in occasionally but too much to say so I say nothing..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-26 03:17:52	@BipolarBlogger that's exactly how I felt, glad it's not just me!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-25 04:19:27	Bed at 8.15pm..just what I have needed and feels naughty!..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-22 06:45:59	I have raised that I want some time off in December with my manager..I need to catch up with myself before you know what descends..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-22 06:44:49	Really am just so tired and it's only Monday..had 12 hour nights over the weekend and I need more..so much work to do it's unreal..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-22 06:43:14	@LithiumLibGirl sending hugs..x
274535898	act1175	2016-11-17 05:11:10	@Fionaok thanks it is!..a lot of new things to get my head around but I'm really enjoying it and learning loads..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-17 03:04:51	@Fionaok what a lovely tweet, from one of the kindest people I know on here..x
274535898	act1175	2016-11-17 02:37:01	I am really enjoying it though and having my own office in a separate building is really good for my mental health..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-17 02:35:21	This senior worker lark is hard work!..having to think differently, today I entered the world of Gant charts..what has happened to me!..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-17 02:33:42	@GoogleGardener lovely picture, that is a very contented cat!..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-14 01:45:12	@LithiumLibGirl compulsory I would have thought!..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-13 21:46:36	@RDW2303 they so are, and my son has been away all weekend so I have had complete peace, blissful!..enjoy your day..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-13 21:40:33	@RDW2303 thanks Richard, much needed!..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-13 21:37:04	Today has been declared a dressing gown day..with a bit of duvet thrown in!..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-13 21:36:31	@DastardlyDeano done!
274535898	act1175	2016-11-12 04:56:42	Spoke to my sponsor, went to a meeting and left work on time..slowly getting it back together..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-11 04:54:07	That is not good.
274535898	act1175	2016-11-11 04:53:59	Been feeling very low along with the busiest I've ever been..realized tonight I can't remember the last time I told anyone how I was feeling
274535898	act1175	2016-11-09 15:27:20	I actually feel sick that this is happening in the U.S..half my family are there and I am scared for them and all of us..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-01 15:54:24	Morning world!..
274535898	act1175	2016-11-01 15:53:43	@BimSooz that is such a brilliant picture and they are just adorable!!!!..x
274535898	act1175	2016-10-31 19:34:25	@LithiumLibGirl thank you, I knew you would understand..house seems so empty without her..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-31 01:54:19	A weekend of sadness..the cat didn't take to my son being back so she went to be rehomed today..miss her already..will get another, in time.
274535898	act1175	2016-10-31 01:52:59	@_ck_supergirl plum one!..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-29 04:48:07	@LithiumLibGirl thank you!..it's still sinking in..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-29 02:55:18	@Fionaok yes I accepted today!..thank you, I will over the weekend..I hope you're well?..x
274535898	act1175	2016-10-29 01:54:32	On the job front, I was formally offered the role of senior personal advisor today running a new complex needs women's project..stunned!..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-29 01:53:14	But I took some action, my meds have been increased and it is mostly peaceful on the home front..but I am absolutely exhausted..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-29 01:51:57	So I've had a period of rapid cycling, major anxiety, irritability, anger, throwing things, screaming..the lot..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-29 01:50:27	.....my son moving back after 8 years away, my flat turned upside down by decorating..that there would be an affect on my mental health..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-29 01:47:15	Well not sure where to start but I'm back!..I neglected to take into account the major changes I've had in a year, full time work....
274535898	act1175	2016-10-23 18:59:19	Barely on here..a lot going on and not in a great way mentally so staying quiet and doing what I can to practice self care..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-19 16:21:46	So I'm not at work and feel like I've been drugged as not slept off my meds..and he has moaned that he is tired!!!!!
274535898	act1175	2016-10-19 16:20:35	Dreadful night, heard my son go out in the early hours and only just tracked him down..too much anxiety for me to cope with..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-16 00:39:16	Passed Excel course, though not sure how!..but I do feel way more confident using it and that is all I wanted..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-16 00:36:15	@TwelveDrawings and a powerful message it is..amazing stuff I regularly refer to!..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-15 16:11:40	Up and out already, on my way to an Excel training day..much needed and I get a day off Monday for it..flask of coffee is packed!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-12 04:38:10	Well any hope of work being better disappeared by about 9.10am..manager and new worker both noticeably absent too..all just awkward..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-11 01:33:12	Took a day off today so have had a long weekend..feeling a bit low and quiet, hence not being on here..kind of around though..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-08 04:51:30	I don't think I have ever been so glad that a work week is over..it has been unbearable so we were all out of there as soon as we could be..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-07 03:20:39	@glittahcat thanks, it really is bad..I know it will pass but very awkward for now..just about to have hot bath and bed..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-07 02:52:23	It is just horrible being at work, the atmosphere is so tense and nobody is talking..this is the knock on affect of one persons choice..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-06 05:59:40	I am so glad today is over..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-05 19:30:58	I didn't get the job..a senior worker got it knowing it makes one of the rest of us redundant so you can imagine the feeling here today!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-05 05:31:14	@LithiumLibGirl thank you!..will tweet as soon as I can after I hear..for now it's bed with my book and a cat for company..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-05 03:09:39	Find out tomorrow morning..eeekkkk..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-05 03:09:16	Sorry for silence, ran out of charge for a bit..I think it went okay, thought straight after of other things I could have said but done now.
274535898	act1175	2016-10-05 03:03:51	@LithiumLibGirl hiya it went okay I think, I never feel I've done my best and thought of things after I should have said..find out tomorrow.
274535898	act1175	2016-10-04 21:39:42	About to go the interview for the senior role..a bit shaky with nerves but I can only do what I can do..
274535898	act1175	2016-10-01 20:11:06	The anxiety has finally eased up but now I'm ill so having a day of doing absolutely nothing!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-29 01:30:01	Yet another day of high anxiety that has only slightly come down with prn meds..trying more self care and early night-time meds this evening
274535898	act1175	2016-09-29 01:25:58	@BipolarBasecamp that is beautiful!..he really does make the most amazing choices..I hope you both have a lovely break..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-29 01:24:10	@BipolarBasecamp yes yes yes...x
274535898	act1175	2016-09-28 04:29:36	Training today which was really good then on the way home my anxiety rocketed and only just easing with meds kicking in..hate it so much..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-27 05:05:39	After work I finished my personal statement that my mum will kindly type and send to me..she thinks it's very strong but we'll see.....
274535898	act1175	2016-09-26 03:19:46	My son stayed at a friends for the weekend..he came home about 6pm and has been asleep ever since..they didn't stay up all night at all!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-26 01:41:58	Most of personal statement done yesterday, just a few bits to add in then I can submit during the week..bit nerve racking..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-26 01:41:08	Check in to see I missed #ColumboTV again and I feel poorly..going to curl up and read when I should be ironing..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-24 18:49:24	Going to my mum's house to write personal statement for new role at work..I hate doing these but she is great at them so accepting the help!
274535898	act1175	2016-09-23 02:47:27	I have had quite enough of this high anxiety now..meds don't seem to be touching it, neither does self care..really don't know what to do ..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-22 15:06:05	I am so tired I can barely think straight..took meds too late last night so I feel awful and every step is like hard work..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-22 05:01:05	High anxiety almost constantly and very paranoid something is going on at work..really not enjoying this week so far..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-20 04:50:18	Well today has been everything Mondays are so well known for but with high anxiety thrown in too..very glad it's over, for me anyway..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-18 05:13:31	A very dazed day after too much sleep this time..all.I managed was some food shopping and even that exhausted me..early night I think..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-17 03:49:26	Well that was just what I needed and now home with feet up, tea and a fairly peaceful head..knowing there is no alarm set is blissful..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-17 03:47:56	@LithiumLibGirl it was just what I needed, thank you..starting the weekend with my head relatively peaceful..I hope you have a good one..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-17 03:46:05	@BipolarBasecamp totally natural, I was terrified the first time I did it but once that passed I loved it..now I do it yearly!!
274535898	act1175	2016-09-17 00:48:06	So tired but am heading to a meeting..as my sponsor says "If you'd have gone out to buy alcohol feeling that way, you can get to a meeting."
274535898	act1175	2016-09-17 00:42:59	@BipolarBasecamp glad to see you already decided yes, it sounds amazing!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-16 03:36:15	Home so time for a proper cup of tea and feet up while bath runs..I have walked so much today that my steps app gave me a fanfare!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-16 00:42:54	My client is housed and I got to see the sea so it's been a good day..now heading back to London and finishing my book with a cup of tea..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-15 14:52:45	@applescrapples it is thanks, most of the time..progress not perfection!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-15 14:22:18	Slept deeply so feel a bit dazed but at least I'm rested..presenting a client out of London today so coffee and book packed for the day..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-15 14:20:30	@applescrapples congratulations!!!
274535898	act1175	2016-09-14 17:21:14	Why is it not the end of the day yet????
274535898	act1175	2016-09-14 14:36:46	Next to no sleep and don't want to go to work but am on the early shift all week so have to..roll on Friday please..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-10 21:21:46	Building Ikea furniture..wish me luck!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-10 04:48:29	Well actually I had a conversation with a new friend and that helped lift my spirits too..now home and hot bath is the plan followed by bed.
274535898	act1175	2016-09-10 04:47:14	Good day at work but high anxiety towards the end of the day and coming home..ended up going out for a long walk which has helped..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-10 02:17:16	@BipolarBasecamp yeh!!..x
274535898	act1175	2016-09-09 01:14:40	My sponsor reminded me yesterday that I am never alone and that is in the forefront of my mind..my decision, my choice..now just follow it..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-09 01:12:16	Going from work to see a friend..this is stage two now but I feel ready & confident that everything will work out exactly as it's meant to..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-09 01:09:42	@LithiumLibGirl that's excellent, am really pleased for you!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-09 01:07:54	In a really good mood today, not brought on by hypomania just a naturally good mood, it's lovely!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-09 01:04:09	@LithiumLibGirl well done, I know how hard it's been for you..x
274535898	act1175	2016-09-06 05:05:08	@BipolarBasecamp ha ha, maybe!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-06 04:40:43	@BipolarBasecamp need to keep that on a loop for now..x x
274535898	act1175	2016-09-06 04:02:42	@BipolarBasecamp I think because my anxiety levels are so high I just stop thinking things through and react instead..need to breathe more..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-06 04:01:37	@BipolarBasecamp so true, my head automatically jumps ten steps..for now I only need to think about a personal statement, no more..thanks xx
274535898	act1175	2016-09-06 03:57:17	@BipolarBasecamp although it is also scary to think about, just too damn much going on at once for me..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-06 03:56:26	@BipolarBasecamp decided to still try, advice on here was try just for the experience and to show I'm interested so why not give it a go!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-06 03:18:37	@bythesheetstore @SuzeLikes @richardkhornsey excellent points, I hadn't seen it that way!..will still give it a go then I think..thanks!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-06 03:10:39	@SuzeLikes she is way more qualified than me..problem is she's not in our team and if no one in our team gets it then redundancies loom..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-06 03:05:40	Feel a bit gutted as I think I could have done the job but it would be embarrassing to try when the other person is already in a senior role
274535898	act1175	2016-09-06 03:04:11	On the work front I was going to try for a promotion but today found out someone else is going for it and no way could I go against them..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-06 01:58:33	Major decision implementation plan..phase one complete..second later this week then third is living with it..I've got this..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-03 20:52:14	@ceirdyrael Thanks Eric, I'm not going anywhere!..
274535898	act1175	2016-09-03 20:42:16	One day at a time... pic.twitter.com/XEc2un8BCz
274535898	act1175	2016-09-02 17:59:00	@BipolarBasecamp that is exactly what it is..and I love that description!..x
274535898	act1175	2016-09-02 15:02:37	Made a major decision last night and when I woke this morning and it still felt like the right decision I knew I had turned a corner..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-30 21:26:31	Work is a bit full on today so I've disappeared off site for lunch and a bottle of coke in the sun..now just hoping I don't get radioed.
274535898	act1175	2016-08-30 21:23:18	@nikimummy13 nope!..totally reasonable response after the holidays..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-30 03:27:05	Serious back pain this evening..realised I'm a week late taking the injection for it so have done that and have feet up with a heatpack on..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-29 18:50:03	Serenity prayer needed..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-29 18:49:45	I just feel sad today..I am over thinking things I should be letting go of, things I have no control over so therefore my thinking is wasted
274535898	act1175	2016-08-29 02:14:10	A day of gentle housework and lots of reading..feel like I'm on a bit of an emotional comedown from Friday so practising self care..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-28 20:14:49	@2015sober sounds lovely, enjoy!..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-27 20:17:51	Today I am fragile..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-27 02:34:40	....well in real life anyway..I've taken up residence in the kitchen for a while making yet more tea..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-27 02:33:03	This friend is the BEST person in the world to try and relax with..knowing he likes peace and quiet when he finishes work I've shut up....
274535898	act1175	2016-08-27 02:31:10	My views from one ward today.. pic.twitter.com/OrMoFcxPDT
274535898	act1175	2016-08-27 02:23:20	Took as soon as I got back but was a little late..came straight to a friend's and now trying all known measures to unwind..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-27 02:21:59	Spent most of the day in hypomania & all the signs were there but I was at the hospital & my meds were back at work, hours till I could get.
274535898	act1175	2016-08-26 14:48:43	@jadiepye @Antonio_Bay @PickledBaloney @BimSooz @IanBaxter55 @DomJBrown @box5angel @KiranKaurHola thanks Stuart!..will try to be there..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-26 14:37:43	I've barely checked in here, been very busy with work and training this week and only just realised it was Friday!..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-26 14:36:21	@LithiumLibGirl congratulations!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-22 04:28:24	Not the greatest way to start a week..also forgot to eat today so have nibbled but not had any kind of meal..because that will help my moods
274535898	act1175	2016-08-22 04:27:39	Spent nearly 5 hours building a wardrobe today and I've done nothing in preparation for the week ahead..no laundry or ironing or cleaning..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-22 04:26:37	Weekend a write off mood wise, lost the plot at my son who had done nothing wrong..am so irritable with high anxiety, feels crap..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-20 01:52:45	Now I just feel that awful emotional comedown from having cried and yet my anxiety is high..in short I want this day to be over..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-20 01:52:06	....one suggestion was to compress my hours into 4 days but think that would make it worse..it's nice they are so open to helping though..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-20 01:51:10	....on a 'human level'..coming off the early shifts is one thing and to meet again in 2 weeks for me to have a think what could help....
274535898	act1175	2016-08-20 01:50:10	....and we met today for a catch up and told him how fatigued I am..there has been no drop in my quality of work but they are concerned....
274535898	act1175	2016-08-20 01:49:22	Back at work for one day and I was a wreck..in tears twice just because I was asked how I was..manager had noticed before he was off....
274535898	act1175	2016-08-18 20:34:24	@BipolarBasecamp it really has been, threw out so much and whilst it was hard to sort through I definitely feel much lighter..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-18 20:33:22	Going to call my sponsor to share the memory then have another cup of coffee while I wait..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-18 20:31:56	This redecorating has been so important for my recovery..I have stripped away anything linked to my drinking days and it feels amazing!!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-18 20:30:42	And it's not nice as I'm reminded of how I was back then..vodka mixed with coke in a bottle and not having a clue what I was doing in life..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-18 20:29:43	Sitting on floorboards waiting for carpet fitters and I suddenly have a flashback to doing this 20 years ago when I moved in..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-18 05:02:13	Have been fighting tiredness all day as loads to do before the carpet fitters come tomorrow..didn't dare sit down or I'd have slept..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-17 17:16:17	Woken by the door buzzer and missed answering it so now I'm awake, grumpy and have to trek to collect whatever it was..need coffee......
274535898	act1175	2016-08-17 08:03:59	Now I need to take meds, far too late for them but never occurred to me we'd be this long..never mind, was worth it for the laughs!!
274535898	act1175	2016-08-17 08:03:02	A local friend saw us carrying the boxes and enlisted the help of two others so it all got carried upstairs for us too!..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-17 08:01:30	Busy day shopping with my son then onto Ikea with a work colleague and she only just left..we had a great laugh and got loads of goodies..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-16 03:01:35	First day of annual leave was spent reading, listening to music and changing sheets..anxiety is high though so hot bath time..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-14 04:30:17	Late night last night so late start today but managed to buy a carpet before crashing for a nap most of the evening..need tea and biscuits!.

274535898	act1175	2016-08-12 02:50:00	@BipolarBasecamp yep, which is mad when I know it's what I need!..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-12 02:46:54	@BipolarBasecamp it was really hard to do as my automatic response is no I'm fine I'll keep going..but I'm not fine and luckily she is ace..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-12 02:45:44	It's no wonder I feel shattered physically and that affects my mental health..I really need to regroup and look at what is important..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-12 02:43:53	I have had so much going on..the madness of decorating till small hours, adjusting to my son coming home, Crohns active and full time work..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-12 02:41:51	Had supervision and my manager asked if some time off would help and it would so taking 3 days next week to try and recuperate a bit..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-12 02:39:51	@Ghoulgirl gratefully accepted..thank you..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-12 02:39:24	@LithiumLibGirl thank you lovely..x
274535898	act1175	2016-08-12 02:38:34	@ceirdyrael thank you Eric..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-11 21:03:27	Actually what I really want is a hug and the sudden realisation that I have no one to ask for one is really sad..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-11 20:57:59	Really struggling to get through today..feel exhausted, mood is low and I want to be curled up on a ball on the sofa or a corner but I can't
274535898	act1175	2016-08-11 04:32:38	Visited a friend briefly after work which was nice as it helped me to relax also..once home it will be bath and bed..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-11 04:30:33	Mood lightened up again today which was good, till it went a bit too high so I took some meds which have helped..only just on way home..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-11 04:29:03	@nikimummy13 sorry just seen this!..school shoe shopping is torture so I think you can be forgiven for that!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-10 02:26:25	My mood dropped during the afternoon and snapped a couple of times totally unnecessarily..glad to be home with tea and feet up..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-09 19:57:50	It's like I'm either about to go high or low but just not sure which yet..on top of my Crohns I'm not up to this right now..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-09 19:56:42	Work keeping me busy today so brief lunchbreak before an afternoon of training..mood a little off today, anxious and irritable..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-07 01:34:31	My work is done so at a friend's house relaxing with tea and football on the telly..nice to have some adult company..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-06 20:56:35	One sofa bed to take apart while I wait for new one to be delivered and curtain rails to put up..should keep me busy for a while..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-06 20:55:45	Feeling much better today, still mildly nauseated but aching has gone & actually feel awake for first time in days..time to get productive!.
274535898	act1175	2016-08-06 01:13:07	Took today off too and mostly slept..still aching all over though so no idea what that is..taking it very easy..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-06 01:10:46	@MrsPanad thank you, doing a lot of sleeping!..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-05 03:39:12	Been off work a couple days with sheer exhaustion and aching all over..hoping an early night will mean I can go in tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-02 05:08:08	Falling into bed..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-02 04:03:13	I've had a very unsettled mood day, have felt calm, elevated and then low with persistent anxiety..taken meds early to help hopefully..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-01 04:03:46	I know I sound a bit cryptic but I don't want to go into all the details..just helps me and reminds me when I put the thoughts out there..
274535898	act1175	2016-08-01 04:03:02	Got quite a lot done today..also made my decision which has left me with a heavy heart but I know it's right..now I need to plan next steps.
274535898	act1175	2016-07-31 21:03:21	@PeacefulRecover that is all we can do but it doesn't make it easy..I hope you come to the right decision for you..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-31 20:50:05	The difficulty lies in knowing what I should do but not wanting to do that..it may have to hurt further before I make the decision..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-31 20:48:55	I still struggle with choosing what is right for me as opposed to what my self will wants which is usually wrong..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-31 20:47:43	Doing some chores and trying to come to a decision about a recent situation that doesn't feel right to me..it's in my hands how I proceed..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-31 05:35:17	There is a sense of satisfaction in 'cleaning house' from what it was like when I drank..it's taken ages to get here but worth the wait..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-31 05:33:15	Very pleased with the sofa bed I bought today, gets delivered next week..now just rugs and furniture to go..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-30 20:59:15	All the carpets are up and floorboards scrubbed..now it's time for the fun bit, buying new stuff!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-28 19:23:05	Covering the front desk is exhausting and I've had enough of it now..very aware I'm moaning but just not a happy bunny today..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-28 19:22:13	I want the working day to be over so I can collect something from a friend then go home knowing I have tomorrow off..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-28 19:18:40	Woke up full of anxiety which hasn't eased at all..am irritable and clearly my moods are all over the place but not looking after it..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-28 06:14:39	Or is it the people who bring the intensity to the moment..hmm..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-28 06:13:53	I mean would an intense moment have happened in that place at that time with any two people like a chance meeting that was meant to happen..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-28 06:12:31	Finding it hard to unwind though & seem to having racing thoughts about intense moments & what makes them so..is it the people or timing..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-28 06:08:55	On a positive note the carpets are gone from the front room, decided to go for floorboards and rugs, and it's beginning to take shape..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-28 06:05:47	Feeling down..caught my son lying to me about such a basic thing I really feel like I can't believe a word he says anymore and that's sad..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-27 01:25:37	Went to work and was all okay..much less pain so antibiotics are working and having my feet up in the evening is the key I think, so I am!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-27 01:24:33	@serpentgrr that is definitely not my strong point..went in anyway and was fine, antibiotics kicking in already..thank you for concern..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-26 05:23:10	@SarahTheodorou yes I should but definitely struggle with that, need to be 'really ill' to take time off..going to decide in the morning..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-26 02:12:36	@capwell6 thank you, it's annoying more than anything else..hate not working and so much to do at home it's frustrating to have them up!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-26 02:10:25	@MrsPanad aah good point..will look it up, thanks..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-26 01:44:59	It seemed a bit drastic to me but maybe I should follow Dr's orders, I don't know..doesn't sit well with me to stay at home with sore toes..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-26 01:43:29	Problem is I can't take a week off as no one else to cover front desk..not sure what happens if you work when you've been signed off??..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-26 01:42:25	Had to see Dr after work as my toes have been very sore and swollen..she signed me off work for a week and gave meds as they are infected..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-25 05:59:40	The painting is finished..yeh!!..still loads to do but by the end of next week it will be in a liveable state again..really missing telly!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-23 18:45:01	I am actually filled with gratitude today, I have good friends in my life & family who are willing to give up their time for me..blessed..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-23 18:43:30	After a lovely night off its back to decorating..both sisters with me today and can't remember the last time it was just us three together..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-23 03:01:52	Yeh it's Friday and I'm having a night off decorating..spending it with a friend and it is so nice to have my feet up with good company..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-22 01:32:08	But I made it and now home..I so desperately want to say I can't do any work tonight but not enough time to miss a day so onwards..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-22 01:30:36	After a chat with my manager I felt better and got through the day..but barely..had to do a speech for interns leaving & my voice is going..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-21 16:35:07	Well I've made it in & now kicking myself because as soon as someone asked me how I was I burst into tears again..need to pull it together..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-21 15:15:45	Two hours sleep before dry coughing kept me awake the rest of the night..in tears now as I'm just beyond exhausted and am late for work..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-21 01:24:02	Just makes me feel grateful for the life I've got now..this wouldn't have happened when I was drinking..sobriety is a gift to treasure..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-21 01:22:41	I don't spend much time with this sister and it's never just the two of us when we do meet so it's been really nice talking to her a lot..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-21 01:21:02	My sister has been amazing, she's coming here after a training course every night to help and that way we keep each other going..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-21 01:20:01	Grabbing a 10 minute sit down, after work and a hospital appointment, before I start work on the flat again..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-20 06:41:16	This decorating lark is hard work!..straight into it from work finishing up at this time..but it looks really good so far so it's worth it..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-18 17:31:57	Not much sleep so a nice calm, quiet morning at work is much appreciated..especially after the nightmare of Friday!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-18 00:46:42	@nikimummy13 @DarwinForest enjoy!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-18 00:45:52	This evening is moving the furniture so we can start working tomorrow evening after work..it's going to be a long week but I'm excited now..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-18 00:44:52	Spent the weekend packing everything in boxes getting ready to paint..have done my back in so heatpad on and ready for my sister to arrive..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-17 01:06:15	@BimSooz oh wow you kept that quiet..many congratulations!!!..x x
274535898	act1175	2016-07-16 07:00:29	@jch4serenity it was lovely, then dozed off on the sofa!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-16 03:02:33	It is really hard to relax after a day like today..haven't moved from the sofa but still feel alert..hot bath time I think..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-15 23:07:09	Okay this is a first, management have decided we've all worked above and beyond today so been told to lock up & go home, paperwork can wait.
274535898	act1175	2016-07-15 21:26:28	We are all at the stage of just wanting the day to be over now but we are still maintaining a strong staff presence all over the centre..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-15 18:03:33	First 2 incidents dealt with but the ripple effect means smaller ones are kicking off..this is only first day of 2 week cover at front desk!
274535898	act1175	2016-07-15 16:46:55	One of these I need to stay of due to threats made directly to me by the client but police are on their way and it should all be over soon..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-15 16:19:39	Just past 9am and we already have two incidents going on..it's going to be one of those days!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-12 01:20:49	Back at work today to discover we have access to a new database and my log in is 007..how cool is that!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-10 19:33:37	@2015sober I am very lucky, she has always had him when I've needed it and it gives me a bit of space for awhile..hope your day is good! .
274535898	act1175	2016-07-10 17:42:26	My son was at my mum's house last night so a quiet Sunday morning to myself before I start taking shelves down..lots of coffee please..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-10 17:41:09	@SuzeLikes Happy Birthday!!..I hope it's a good one for you, no holiday laundry today!!!! X
274535898	act1175	2016-07-10 03:54:04	Next stage is bookshelves down tomorrow then the painting starts next weekend..for now though it's feet up with telly..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-10 03:53:13	First book clearance since age 15 today..twelve bags went to charity..flat is starting to look very empty now and it's quite exciting..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-09 03:26:55	An evening at home and feeling a bit sad for no apparent reason..unless it's exhaustion..and yet more work to do tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-08 18:35:28	Few tests at the hospital before I can start the medication for Crohns flare up..Lots of waiting but I never come without a book!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-08 02:22:24	A day off flat clearing today so a bit of retail therapy then visited a friend at work..now a quiet evening while my son is out..bliss!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-06 00:42:47	The flat is definitely looking less cluttered but still a lot to do before the painting starts next weekend..but for now it's tea and cake.
274535898	act1175	2016-07-06 00:41:54	More flat clearing today, it's quite tiring going through years worth of stuff collected and deciding what I need to keep..most is going..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-04 23:12:32	And heading out early for some retail therapy on the way..anxiety is high and I need some time alone before company so I don't just moan!..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-04 23:11:25	I let him go to the gym as I think he needs to burn off some energy & I'm going to a friend's house for the evening, need some adult time..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-04 23:09:32	Spent all day yesterday flat clearing then caught my son sneaking out at 1am which caused a row so unsettled sleep & talking all day today..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-02 15:48:02	Early start for a weekend but having my hair coloured this morning so up and caffeinated already..looking forward to upcoming week off..
274535898	act1175	2016-07-01 01:57:47	Second evening this week I've ended up at my old friend's house after work..it's really nice spending time together again..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-30 02:49:18	@mechanical_meat yeah, I'm getting better at recognising when I need it!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-29 23:33:44	Took a couple hours owed to me so home with feet up, tea in hand and Law and Order on the telly..just what I need!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-29 22:47:48	@nikimummy13 thank you, I am..it's part of the job to manage incidents & we all did what we could to diffuse it, just another day at work!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-29 18:35:49	Have watched it all back on cctv and both people involved will be banned for a month..full debrief has been done and it's back to work..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-29 17:28:43	Major incident first thing in the morning where I ended up being smacked in the arm by a flying punch..took 4 of us to restrain someone!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-27 17:32:04	Nice to know I'm not the only one aching like crazy, most of my colleagues are too!!..a sore day all round here today..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-26 20:56:05	My body is still aching from rounders but in fairness it's been about 25 years since I played it last..having to take everything slowly..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-26 18:20:51	Slept for nearly 12 hours but needed it..now coffee and reading to start the day..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-26 18:19:48	@LithiumLibGirl hope you have a lovely time away..x
274535898	act1175	2016-06-26 00:03:27	Managed to doze but fitfully..am aching all over so hot bath then feet up in front of the telly..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-25 20:37:53	I'm shattered now though so it's nap time..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-25 20:37:07	Slight change to my normal release Quetiapine dose but otherwise all is well..always a pleasure to see my g.p so had a chat as well!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-25 17:42:47	Have already left and come to a doctors appointment for a medication review..waiting with a large strong coffee..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-25 17:40:20	Spent the night at a friend's house after chatting away till 1am..but barely slept and feel like there isn't enough coffee in the world..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-25 07:50:29	Work afternoon away playing rounders..I was dreading it but it was actually great fun..and I was in the winning team..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-23 22:29:37	One thing is for sure I never know what will happen in any given day at work..guess it keeps us alert!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-23 22:28:42	I've gone from a quiet morning to two incidents both meaning I needed to radio for assistance and me being called every name possible!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-23 17:58:00	My company at the front desk this morning..makes work that little bit easier!.. pic.twitter.com/FsdcOYCE8u
274535898	act1175	2016-06-22 02:56:23	I did pass a place on the drive there though that brought back memories of a happy occasion & my mood is definitely more positive recently..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-22 02:51:04	Tomorrow I start the appeal process..always hard when this happens, despite us managing expectations from the beginning, as there was hope..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-22 02:49:45	Only just home after a day spent at a housing office with a client..wasn't housed so a disappointing outcome but is safe for tonight..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-21 16:13:32	@BimSooz one of the perks of my job!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-21 15:52:26	My view this morning.. pic.twitter.com/ETYy11ttNT
274535898	act1175	2016-06-21 00:12:30	Made a sensible decision to take some meds and come home to read..meds have kicked in and anxiety easing..now some mindless telly..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-20 22:05:45	I am really having to stop myself from doing something that may not be a good idea..I don't trust myself to make good decisions right now..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-20 21:45:23	Cancelled the housework and went to a meeting instead..needed to feel grounded even if only for an hour..high anxiety today & not sure why..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-20 05:54:19	I do love a Sunday night when I don't have work the next day..taking a self care day, will need to do chores but after that it's feet up!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-20 05:27:38	This is someone I hurt badly yet he has found it in his heart to forgive and said today seeing me as I am is all the gratitude he needed..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-20 05:26:38	Yesterday was flat clearing, today I have spent with an old friend..lovely time chatting for hours..a day of feeling grateful..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-18 02:09:01	I work with vulnerable people every day and listen to what they have gone through, which is often awful, and some times it is just too much.
274535898	act1175	2016-06-18 02:07:00	A very emotionally challenging week at work so I decided to ask for a day off Monday to catch up on rest a bit, need to practice self care..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-18 02:04:19	@nikimummy13 thank you..I know, thankfully, there is..it's just been a long week..x
274535898	act1175	2016-06-17 03:06:07	Sometimes coming on here and reading what people are doing to each other in the world is just too much for me to take in..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-16 03:45:00	Two late nights working in a row and the next two are scheduled to be just as busy..ten hours overtime already to claim back!..knackered..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-14 04:09:13	@IanBaxter55 that's brilliant, congrats!!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-14 01:05:17	In a lot of discomfort a lot of the time and that is just exhausting..luckily my mood remains steady as not sure I can deal with anymore..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-14 01:03:57	Weekend passed in a blur of laziness and now back at work & feeling like I need another break already..Crohns and work do not go together!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-11 20:33:07	My son isn't here so at a bit of a loss as to what to do with myself..I refuse to do housework on my birthday!..maybe some retail therapy..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-11 20:32:05	@SuzeLikes thank you!..x
274535898	act1175	2016-06-11 19:19:54	@act1175 or spoilt..not sure which is right, if either!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-11 19:18:36	More flowers have been delivered and have had some lovely cards and pressies..feeling spoiled!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-11 05:43:59	Had a lovely meal out with mum and she brought me flowers and cake as well as stuff to open tomorrow..now glad to be home and time for bed..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-10 15:22:06	Just have to get through today then a meal out with my mum this evening to look forward to..though am sure I'll be exhausted by then!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-10 15:20:54	It's been a very long week at work, busy and working on a difficult case involving children and safe guarding so hard on the emotions..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-08 03:03:07	@leah_michal I'd get advice and ask if any options more favourable for your mental health, there are quite a few treatment options now..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-08 02:54:58	@leah_michal it is stressful and still quite recent for me, got bipolar diagnosis 4 years ago..and definitely good to connect about it!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-08 02:52:53	@leah_michal don't know about interaction with mood stabilisers as I started those years later but I'd be interested to know the answer..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-08 02:51:24	@leah_michal that was my first treatment and tried a few, didn't work for me but they do for the majority I believe..wish you all the best!.
274535898	act1175	2016-06-08 02:43:59	@leah_michal oh wow very recently, have they given you any idea what treatment options they are thinking of?..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-08 02:27:05	@leah_michal sorry to hear that, yes it's so draining..I've had for years but always forget in between attacks just how bad it is!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-08 02:22:49	Work is knackering me recently..I always forget just how much Crohns exhausts me when it's active, I can't do anything in the evenings..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-06 03:58:11	Another weekend of clearing the flat with my mum..it's hard work but starting to see results..can't believe how much clutter I have..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-04 02:47:15	I am very glad this work week is over..kept myself to myself today but still managed to get irritable and then worked late..in need of rest!
274535898	act1175	2016-06-03 02:32:26	And for tonight it's tea, biscuits, bath and bed..have no energy or wish to do anything more than bare basics and sleep..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-03 02:31:28	My brain seems to be in a fog and when I'm low I lose any shred of confidence in what I can do..today it showed so keeping my head down tom.
274535898	act1175	2016-06-03 02:29:58	Not a good day at work..just couldn't think straight and made a couple of wrong decisions, nothing major but it was noticed..just feel low..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-02 02:22:32	@ceirdyrael me too!..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-02 01:34:37	Home now and hoping tea will make everything better..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-02 01:34:08	The only benefit was someone gave me a seat on the tube as I look about 6 months pregnant!..I took it as too embarrassed to say I wasn't..
274535898	act1175	2016-06-02 01:32:44	Had an MRI scan of my small bowel this morning and the stuff you have to drink before has left me very uncomfortably bloated all day..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-30 19:51:49	A long weekend with my son sorting out the flat..both tired so today is a rest day..which means him on his phone and me reading..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-28 16:42:51	@SarahTheodorou thank you so much!!..x
274535898	act1175	2016-05-28 03:24:38	@applescrapples definitely!..hope you have a good one too and are well..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-28 03:11:33	@applescrapples thanks Chris!!..it's certainly been a journey but the promises do come true..my boy is coming home too, it's amazing!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-28 03:08:50	@LithiumLibGirl thank you!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-28 02:30:48	....that I love & now this..for those who knew me before I got sober or know how hard I have worked on me, they'll know how much this means.
274535898	act1175	2016-05-28 02:27:11	Unplanned meeting with my manager today and I was offered a permanent contract!!..I have gone from unemployable to building a new career....
274535898	act1175	2016-05-26 02:00:25	But I'm home now with trackies on, tea and a bath running..planning a very early night before an early shift tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-26 01:59:14	Work has been busy and mood has turned to anxiety and incredible irritability so really have to watch myself at work which is exhausting!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-24 02:37:45	Some times I love it and can ride with it but this feels more anxiety induced & I don't like that..hard to describe but I know what I mean!
274535898	act1175	2016-05-24 02:35:35	Mood has jumped from quite low to perky but with palpitations and the beginning signs of hypomania..taken meds early so hope that helps..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-24 02:34:35	Spent the day at a council's housing office but client was housed so it was worth it..then an hour at work before leaving which felt odd..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-23 03:11:19	Spent the day with my best friend who is a couple of weeks away from having a baby..all very exciting and lovely to catch up..a good day!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-22 02:39:14	@LithiumLibGirl definitely!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-22 02:09:06	@LithiumLibGirl I don't mind the food shopping so much but it's the housework and ironing I would love to not have to do!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-22 01:51:37	Have done some nice things, went to a meeting and had a chat with an old friend..seeing best friend tomorrow..finding the good in things..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-22 01:50:22	Feel like the weekend is the only time I get to unwind and once chores are done there's not much time left to recuperate for week ahead!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-19 14:01:42	@12StepAnon it is Andy..have to take it all a day at a time!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-19 03:43:21	So much time is taken up filling forms and arguing with councils that just don't have the accommodation to put people in..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-19 03:40:45	Mood still low and horribly busy at work..just don't stop at all during the day, we get times like this and we're all stretched to capacity.
274535898	act1175	2016-05-19 03:39:08	@jadiepye @ana_m_q @AmyLouiseBond @Antonio_Bay @PickledBaloney @BimSooz @Montyboy4 great, thanks Stuart!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-17 04:11:43	I need as much rest as possible to face more phone calls tomorrow..it's times like this I want him here to talk to face to face..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-17 04:10:27	Too much to describe here but I am very concerned about him and his future at the moment..and he has an exam tomorrow!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-17 04:08:47	Half day of work then the rest training on a new database..straight into phone calls about my son, his behaviour is all over the place..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-15 19:26:56	Having a very quiet weekend with lots of reading and lazing around..can't do much more with mood still low..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-14 02:28:29	@LithiumLibGirl thanks..I really thought I would feel better after my holiday but then I remember it doesn't work that way!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-14 01:22:21	Had a week of working, eating, sleeping and repeat..mood has also dropped so want to isolate and do nothing and not speak to anyone..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-11 03:39:03	@BimSooz Happy Birthday lovely!!..x
274535898	act1175	2016-05-10 03:58:42	First day back at work and thrown into the thick of it covering the front desk but all good..early night as still feel tired..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-08 05:34:14	@Fionaok goodnight..yes it was lovely thank you, will dm you tomorrow..hope you're well..x
274535898	act1175	2016-05-08 05:20:01	Nice meal out with my son and had a good catch up..now falling into bed exhausted..will post some holiday pics tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-07 23:02:04	Feel all out of sorts today, didn't get in till 3am but have unpacked & about to head out for a walk..I brought the weather back with me!..
274535898	act1175	2016-05-07 23:00:10	I'm back!!..had a lovely, peaceful, restful time..mostly lying on a beach reading but also walking around a very pretty town..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-29 21:04:32	@SuzeLikes thank you!!
274535898	act1175	2016-04-29 20:42:05	Everything flowed very smoothly and I'm through security..bit of shopping then off I go..see you all in a week!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-29 15:50:47	Morning!..coffee is flowing while I potter around finishing packing and getting ready to travel..anxiety still there but low for now..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-29 01:44:01	Not sure why, I have needed a week on a beach for a long time but now I'm anxious I'll be lonely..just me for a whole week..scary..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-29 01:42:43	I've done as much as I can for today..really don't feel at all excited at the moment..have a feeling of dread in my stomach about going..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-28 19:32:57	I'm at that stage of packing where I just want to abandon it all & ask someone else to do it for me..might have a walk to get out for a bit.
274535898	act1175	2016-04-28 19:31:11	@columbobp no worries!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-28 14:50:26	@BimSooz if you do it will probably come at 7pm!..hope you don't have to wait all day..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-28 13:31:52	I woke in a panic thinking I had slept too late to fly yet that's not till tomorrow..now I'm awake so may as well start the day..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-27 18:15:47	@jadiepye @ana_m_q @AmyLouiseBond @Antonio_Bay @PickledBaloney @BimSooz I'll be on holiday but hope you all enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-27 17:41:04	Trying to have a day of reading but chores keep coming into my head so back to lists and anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-27 17:40:28	@BipolarBlogger Happy belated Birthday!!..x x
274535898	act1175	2016-04-27 02:28:16	Spent the day shopping and general anxiety level is rising, as it always does, when I begin to decide what to pack..hate the whole process..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-26 00:39:59	Have mostly pottered and made lists of things to do for my holiday..four days to go!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-25 18:27:46	First day of annual leave and it feels lovely having breakfast late and still in my dressing gown!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-25 03:46:48	@Fionaok hiya finished on Friday so it's just beginning!..how are you?..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-24 23:11:33	Going to try and avoid that for as long as I can but strictures don't get better, only worse..thus the need for a quiet weekend..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-24 23:10:26	....to come and will have to go back on medication as well as altering my diet..in the past a stricture has meant surgery for me..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-24 23:08:46	Have spent the weekend recovering from a week of hospital visits..scan showed a stricture which isn't good..fine for now but more tests....
274535898	act1175	2016-04-21 22:49:16	Home and in bed with peppermint tea and my book..looking forward to dozing off..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-21 22:48:45	@mechanical_meat thank you, I need it!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-21 20:57:21	Senior manager said I regularly work above and beyond so to go home and not feel badly about it..cried at that too!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-21 20:56:25	After another crying spell I have left work to head home..in no fit state to be there but feel bad as about to have 2 weeks off..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-21 17:00:13	Scan couldn't be done as consultant not there so straight into work but feel awful, shaky and tearful and really should be at home..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-21 02:48:30	I used to love the feeling after sedation, in fact I'd top it up with alcohol, now I want tea and biscuits & a chat with my sponsor!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-21 02:46:28	Mum brought me home and I'm still very groggy but tea has never tasted so nice!..test was all clear so having a scan tom morning too..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-21 02:44:29	Spent last night and all today throwing up everything I drank as wasn't eating before a colonoscopy today..was so weak they put IV fluid in.
274535898	act1175	2016-04-19 04:46:04	@Fionaok not too bad thanks, last week at work before two weeks off so looking forward to that!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-19 03:27:50	@GoogleGardener Happy Birthday!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-19 02:34:14	Busy day but all good..now my last night of eating before a colonoscopy on Wednesday so working tomorrow with only jelly and lucozade!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-19 02:31:49	@Fionaok hey nice to see you back!..hope you're well..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-18 04:08:21	Had a much needed weekend of rest..did a lot of reading and lazing around in my dressing gown..ready for last week at work before a break..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-14 03:08:21	Couple of late evenings at work so feeling a bit like work, eat, sleep and repeat..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-12 02:17:28	Really good day today, productive and happy..maybe a little too happy but feels good for now..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-12 02:16:32	@BipolarBlogger one of mine is anything eaten while walking!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-10 20:28:32	Today is housework day so yet again feel like I've had no weekend..I want a day where I don't have to do anything..maybe next weekend..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-10 20:27:29	Spent yesterday at my dad's coordinating the rubbish clearance and felt shattered after..all just very sad..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-08 04:34:57	Already knew it was rumbling away..pain has increased recently and fatigued almost all the time..stress with my dad can't have helped!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-08 04:32:06	Hospital appointment today for Crohns checkup..not great so have to have more tests..they are being done in next two weeks..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-06 02:04:22	I need another place to be able to write longer as it really helps me just getting stuff out..maybe it's time to start a blog..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-06 02:03:23	And I know it's down to me and my very bad relationship with food yet I still can't seem to change it..too complex to explain in tweets..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-06 02:01:34	Very busy at work getting end of quarter data ready along with training the volunteers on a new project..really struggling with low energy..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-04 03:08:27	Bought a few bits for my holiday then back to do chores..constant tension about dad has meant I don't feel at all like I've had a weekend..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-03 21:21:14	Retail therapy..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-02 21:59:30	@BipolarBlogger @laurawizadora @Gigervamp @samistigger @sjmmurdock @CarolineDNS1990 yeh! Enjoy your day!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-02 21:50:13	@BipolarBlogger @laurawizadora @Gigervamp @samistigger @sjmmurdock @CarolineDNS1990 this one!..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-02 21:30:55	@BipolarBlogger yep!
274535898	act1175	2016-04-02 19:47:00	Morning/afternoon!..I feel utterly exhausted, both emotionally and physically..I need a day of nothingness..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-02 05:18:04	@mechanical_meat thank you..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-02 04:59:03	....until it becomes too much for him..I should know well enough that we can only change when we're truly ready..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-02 04:58:04	He will not accept help from us or anybody else so we have run out of options..the hospital said he will lurch from crisis to crisis....
274535898	act1175	2016-04-02 04:54:30	I had to leave work today to be there in person but they still discharged him this evening back to a house that is beyond disgusting..
274535898	act1175	2016-04-02 04:53:29	It's been a nightmare couple of days of almost constant phone calls while dad is in hospital to get support put in place for him..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-31 05:28:31	It is a very frustrating and sad situation...
274535898	act1175	2016-03-31 05:27:20	He won't let any of us go there and confines himself to the house..now he has stopped even putting rubbish out or washing his clothes..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-31 05:25:25	We've been here so many times now we really don't know what else we can do..decided on alerting social services again & see what they say..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-31 05:23:00	An evening of phone calls to my sisters after my dad's neighbour alerted me he is in a bad way again, house in a state and him poorly..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-31 03:37:18	@chron_ac @MHFAEngland @imperialcollege interesting!..I'm in the 3rd sector so was very relevant and informative..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-31 03:36:22	@MHFAEngland I really enjoyed it thank you, the instructor was excellent as were the resources to take with..will highly recommend it!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-30 14:31:47	Morning!..I'm doing mental health first aid training today, have wanted to for ages so looking forward to it..always keen to learn more..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-30 03:22:36	@jadiepye I'll be on holiday!..but will think of you all..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-30 01:56:10	A lovely spontaneous afternoon catching up and went to a great meeting..now time to curl up for the evening with tea and biscuits..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-29 19:31:23	My best friend is working nearby so I've decided to skip housework to meet her for lunch and a meeting..a much better use of my time!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-29 18:15:25	An extra day off work so lazing on the sofa reading..really must do some housework, just not yet..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-28 21:05:39	This long weekend has equalled a whole lot of laziness..it's been blissful..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-27 18:24:50	@BipolarBlogger great plan!..could look at the whole chicken/egg thing and then whatever you eat first answers the question!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-27 18:22:45	Happy Easter to those celebrating its original meaning..happy chocolate egg day to everyone else..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-26 02:17:14	@BimSooz me too!..it feels lovely..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-25 19:47:49	My son is out all day so I'm still in bed reading with coffee..blissful on a Friday!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-25 03:59:48	@applescrapples that is amazing!
274535898	act1175	2016-03-25 03:59:12	We had 3 crisis situations in the last couple of hours of the day..am very proud of how we rallied round and we all stayed late to help..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-24 04:27:04	Feeling brighter so far this week, hoping it lasts..still busy at work but so much easier to deal with when I'm better in myself..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-22 02:58:31	I always go into therapy with this idealised idea that everything will change and of course that can'take happen so I end up disappointed..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-22 02:54:21	Therapy ended last week but we have 3 follow up sessions over the next 2 months so doesn't feel over..being too hard on myself re progress..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-22 02:52:53	Work week has started much better which I'm really pleased about..mood beginning to lift a little, actually laughed today which was nice..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-22 02:50:12	@richardkhornsey ha ha, that is brilliant!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-19 22:15:38	@applescrapples lovely, enjoy yourself!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-19 22:15:10	@sobermommabee congratulations!!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-19 19:53:41	Have had a lovely lie in and only plan for the day is going to the library and getting some nice food then I'm hibernating for the weekend..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-18 04:26:32	@SparklyErinS Happy Birthday!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-18 02:21:46	Probably not giving enough credit to it also being my last therapy session this week..not made the progress I wanted to with it either..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-18 02:20:21	But I have to keep going, I can't say in my job that I want to stay quiet!..so aware I'm desperate for the weekend..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-18 02:19:15	Things still haven't eased up at work and I feel done in..battling with low mood too so just can't bear talking to or being with people..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-16 21:49:03	I'm having a really bad week at work & really just want to walk out and not look back..finding it very hard to stay put and be professional.
274535898	act1175	2016-03-14 04:20:05	Have felt very quiet and withdrawn all weekend..spent most of it curled up reading and dozing..now feel I've wasted it but also don't care..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-12 22:38:22	Didn't wake up till gone midday and still in bed reading..that's allowed on a Saturday surely..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-12 02:49:40	I got the client into an emergency shelter until Monday when a solicitor will be involved in going back..very glad it's Friday!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-12 02:48:37	From staff who were outright rude to a housing officer who, when I had to quote housing law to him, refused to continue talking to me!
274535898	act1175	2016-03-12 02:47:25	Spent the day with a client at a council's housing office..worst experience ever and officially complaining so won't name it but just awful.
274535898	act1175	2016-03-11 06:19:21	@LithiumLibGirl look after each other, it is a huge shock..sending hugs..x
274535898	act1175	2016-03-11 06:12:45	@LithiumLibGirl oh god that's awful..so so sorry for your loss..x
274535898	act1175	2016-03-11 05:08:45	Worked late and still in pain..got an appointment with g.p. next week..for now just lots of rest is all I can do..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-10 05:42:55	Have been in remission just over 2 years and not sure I'm strong enough to deal with a flare up..heading to bed..take one day at a time..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-10 05:41:16	Couldn't really concentrate on work today, lower back and stomach pains were bad..have eased up a bit but feel very much like Crohns..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-08 17:09:08	Hospital appointment this morning so had a lie in, feels lovely on a work day!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-06 20:24:40	Happy Mother's Day to those celebrating and warmest wishes to those who find this day hard..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-06 20:23:40	Lovely lunch at @BellangerN1 & they spoilt my mum with this after seeing her open birthday cards..fantastic service! pic.twitter.com/yqHaWUVk65
274535898	act1175	2016-03-05 20:13:01	It's my Mum's birthday so we're having a family afternoon tea to celebrate..also need to get flowers for Mother's day..treating her!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-04 03:24:47	I've had two days of training with views like these..struggled with the height the first day but loved it today!!.. pic.twitter.com/XBWJh597Af
274535898	act1175	2016-03-04 03:22:03	@LithiumLibGirl well done!..an added achievement for having struggled through..treat yourself tonight..x
274535898	act1175	2016-03-02 16:50:13	Late start for me as I'm on training today, feels very odd still being at home at 9am..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-01 02:29:11	I am without a doubt my own worst enemy..my default setting is to not look after myself, like someone will come along and do it for me!..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-01 02:28:14	I feel like each time I try and make changes I fail and end up back where I was making me feel worse and so on and so on..
274535898	act1175	2016-03-01 02:27:13	Feeling really withdrawn again recently..spent the weekend doing nothing and apart from work I'm totally isolating..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-29 21:47:49	Trying to explain Twitter to a colleague who is frustrated at having no followers is hilarious!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-26 02:29:59	@SparklyErinS I haven't either!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-26 02:29:18	But that means another night of not bothering to cook, instead having tea and toast then falling into bed which is really not helping!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-26 02:28:18	Felt better today but still very busy..we have our annual away day tomorrow with a new head of services so really need to be rested..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-25 03:04:56	Managing tea this evening and just going to have some toast then an early night..feel wiped out from one day!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-25 03:04:00	Really, really busy day back at work and have been nauseous..couldn't drink coffee this morning which is a definite sign something is up..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-23 20:55:58	It feels very indulgent to be off on a weekday just for the sake of it!..had annual leave to use up so nothing to actually get done..lovely!
274535898	act1175	2016-02-22 22:35:54	Packing up to head home, it's been a nice break away but looking forward to being at home now..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-22 00:42:01	A day of reading under a blanket while the fire blazes and the rain lashes down outside..just lovely!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-21 03:14:42	@LithiumLibGirl thank you!..am curled up with a book and an open fire with the wind whistling outside..blissful..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-20 19:52:09	All packed and ready to travel to my sister's house for a long weekend..hate the travelling but love being there..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-19 04:23:48	Worked late again after an early start so feel shattered..bite to eat then bed for me..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-18 02:41:59	@LithiumLibGirl it does make a real difference..your evening sounds lovely, enjoy!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-18 00:54:43	Home early as I'm still claiming back from the overtime I did..feels nice knowing I can have a 'proper' evening..first up it's trackies on!
274535898	act1175	2016-02-17 03:35:40	Covering front desk today so busy all day but it made time pass quickly..my mood is steady recently which makes everything easier too..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-17 03:34:00	@SparklyErinS done!..good luck..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-16 03:56:45	Good day quietly catching up on admin..and just booked my flight for a week away in April..gives me something to look forward to!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-15 03:37:39	Have seen friends over the weekend..trying to reach out a bit and yes it helps!..now an evening of telly as all the chores are done..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-13 18:00:59	@2015sober and wishing you a lovely day too!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-13 18:00:40	@2015sober small lies that involve self care for you are fine in my eyes..it's hard for people close to us to understand when we change!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-13 17:12:28	Getting up to an alarm at the weekend is hard but seeing my best friend today so it's worth it..coffee and a meeting together is the plan..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-12 02:04:59	Sunset over the city..one of the perks of my job is the views!.. pic.twitter.com/kOD9rIKsqA
274535898	act1175	2016-02-11 03:05:25	What I want is a break from being me and having to live with my head and seeing as that's not possible I don't know what I need..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-11 03:04:31	Been late at work every night and am feeling like everything is just too much for me..need a break of some sort but will be left with me..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-08 15:04:26	A day of training ahead but I really want to just go back to bed..coffee needed and plenty of it!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-06 21:37:22	It's far too windy out there for my liking so I'm declaring today a dressing gown day!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-05 01:17:01	Fitting in working on me whilst also working has been really tricky but I'm trying to break bad habits and that's always hard..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-05 01:10:37	I've had a very tiring couple of weeks doing overtime so able to come home early today..lovely to have feet up with tea by 5pm..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-04 02:25:31	@jenpiedri thanks Jen!..
274535898	act1175	2016-02-04 01:08:04	I've been focusing on therapy & trying to work out what it is I need to be doing to help myself..had gotten to a low place but on my way up.
274535898	act1175	2016-01-21 00:03:19	Re last retweet, sums up just how I'm feeling..aware I've been isolating both in real life and on here..need to look at this..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-19 02:55:28	A great day at work, not from any actual work I did but a good atmosphere & lots of laughs in the office, a lovely way to start the week..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-19 02:53:30	@BipolarBlogger you are..that is just wrong!!..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-18 04:22:16	@SuzeLikes it really was!..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-18 03:19:45	I've done absolutely nothing all weekend, well nothing constructive, I've read and watched telly and slept..and I feel heaps better for it!!
274535898	act1175	2016-01-16 19:59:14	A whole day in bed yesterday off screens really helped..feeling much better today but still going to have a quiet weekend..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-15 03:45:40	What I would do is go to work and push myself and probably get worse and she knows that, she also knows I take her advice seriously!..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-15 03:42:49	Headache has finally eased up but still not feeling well..my sponsor just advised I clear the diary for the next few days and rest..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-14 18:39:08	My head is still pounding so I'm off work..can't read or watch t.v as it makes it worse so lying in bed dozing feeling sorry for myself..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-13 23:57:03	Have come home early from work with what feels like the worst headache I've ever had..going straight to lie down..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-13 05:38:02	Long day today, went from work to the gym..first time back this year and it was hard but felt really good..will be aching tomorrow!..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-12 01:24:10	It was all very interesting but I also found a few areas hit a bit too close to home so I had to focus on keeping my work head there..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-12 01:20:49	First of 3 days training on working with people who have personality disorders today, delivered by someone who has one and a psychologist..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-10 03:00:04	On the last episode of And Then There Were None..a well spent few hours..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-09 21:40:08	Only just out of bed and feeling very lethargic..have overslept I think..oh well, coffee should help!..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-09 00:10:07	Have stirred from lying in bed reading to the sofa..in need of some tea and t.v..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-09 00:08:55	@SuzeLikes thank you..x
274535898	act1175	2016-01-08 18:44:41	And by quiet I mean go home and curl up under the duvet..I just feel very unable to face life today so I'm going to hide from it instead..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-08 18:43:38	My plan for today was to go to a convention in Brighton and stay for the weekend but I've cancelled that and am going to have a quiet day..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-08 18:41:32	Wow therapy was tough this morning and I have a day off so I feel left with all these feelings I usually bury and get on with work..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-06 03:06:07	Felt rested today for the first time in ages which made the whole day easier & work all went smoothly..such a difference a good sleep makes!
274535898	act1175	2016-01-05 04:31:53	First day back was fine but I'm still exhausted so I've had tea and toast and I'm going to bed..a much needed early night..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-04 05:20:16	I don't feel at all ready for work tomorrow, I'm very tired and am dreading the alarm going off early..heading in for as much rest as poss..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-04 03:47:08	Another family day, bit harder as it was with my dad but we got through it and now home with tea and biscuits before I face the ironing.
274535898	act1175	2016-01-03 06:15:35	And of course there were more presents!..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-03 06:15:01	Apart from the rain we actually had a really nice time..yes there were a few 'moments' but nothing got too much to cope with..am pleased..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-02 20:41:42	A family day today..wish me luck!..
274535898	act1175	2016-01-01 21:58:15	I don't do resolutions but this I like.. pic.twitter.com/m6RKqOHcAJ
274535898	act1175	2016-01-01 21:12:34	Happy New Year everyone!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-31 23:32:16	Really I just want to curl up and watch telly followed by an early night but this has been planned for months so I'll do that tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-31 23:30:55	We're going out for our annual trip to Winter Wonderland followed by seeing the fireworks..my son is excited so doing my best to be happy..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-31 02:53:37	Have had a quiet couple of days in with my son..got lots of family events over New Year I'm trying to prepare for..mood says do nothing..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-29 02:45:45	Had a nice enough day but mood still very low..quiet evening in front of telly I think..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-28 19:11:30	Feeling slightly better today, at least I'm out of bed..going to have a walk with a friend soon to get me out of the house..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-27 22:38:49	My mood has plummeted today..am still in bed and staying here..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-27 05:02:57	Early night for me with hot chocolate and my book, I feel exhausted..think my body is just realizing it can relax for a while..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-26 20:23:48	@BipolarBlogger brilliant idea!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-26 19:14:40	A very lazy Boxing Day planned..the aim is to not get dressed which I'm fairly sure I can achieve!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-26 03:52:38	Sandwiches done now it's time for a hot bath and back into Christmas pyjamas..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-25 23:27:45	Presents opened, food eaten and telly watched..it's time for a Christmas day nap..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-25 20:17:17	@LithiumLibGirl thank you, and to you..hope you have a lovely day!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-25 17:45:55	Merry Christmas!!!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-25 04:49:05	Thanks to the cat there are no longer any ribbons, bows or tags on the presents!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-25 03:28:09	Went from work to mum's house for a lovely meal..now home & there are presents under the tree, I have tea & the telly is on..Xmas can begin!
274535898	act1175	2015-12-24 14:31:28	Morning!..happy Christmas Eve everyone..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-24 05:33:35	I am really looking forward to finishing work now, we close early then going to mums for a meal but after that I'm free for 10 days..bliss!!
274535898	act1175	2015-12-24 05:29:26	I'm so tired..went straight from work to pharmacy then food shopping..home and straight into wrapping..still more to do but too tired..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-23 02:14:56	Another very quiet but good day at work..went through and deleted hundreds of emails that had built up which was very satisfying!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-23 02:13:07	@BipolarBlogger I'm the same!..not seeing some family until 1st Jan but still wrapping their presents tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-22 06:09:18	Finally got the lights done but it's still not decorated..that can wait till tomorrow..I can barely keep my eyes open so bedtime for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-22 02:35:07	And I know how long it takes me because it has to be 'just right' and my obsessive need to have it all even takes over..it's exhausting..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-22 02:33:31	I still haven't got around to decorating the tree, my plan was to do the lights tonight..problem is now I've sat down I don't want to get up
274535898	act1175	2015-12-22 02:10:07	Work was quiet and because I'm running the front desk I don't have any casework to do so it dragged a bit, but home now so it's teatime!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-21 03:21:06	Well I'm absolutely exhausted but all the shopping is now done!!..time for feet up with tea and biscuits..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-20 20:21:04	The downside of working until Xmas eve is I have to get everything done today..can't face doing stuff after work..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-20 20:19:30	I managed to do all the housework without waking my son, including vacuuming!..got him up now as we have more shopping to do..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-20 05:55:45	I'm so tired I have to go to bed..trusting my son to go to bed at a reasonable time, which probably means he won't be up till lunchtime!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-20 05:53:49	@_ck_supergirl I'm sorry but I can't stay awake for #Colombotv ..hope you have a great time!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-20 03:27:27	Well we have the tree but can't find the lights anywhere so that will have to wait till tomorrow..never mind, my son has been moody anyway..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-19 18:43:42	Morning!..it is Christmas tree shopping today, my favourite part of the whole holiday is the tree so looking forward to it!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-19 04:11:06	@LithiumLibGirl will keep mine crossed for you too..x
274535898	act1175	2015-12-19 04:08:44	@applescrapples ha ha..I do that regularly too!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-19 04:07:28	But it's been good week and nice Xmas work lunch today..now got my boy home so we're settling down to watch some Monk..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-19 04:04:45	Finally got my upgrade sorted out so new phone..I know this pleases some people, but I hate it..causes me huge anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-16 03:18:56	@applescrapples just sitting down with a cuppa myself, enjoy!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-16 03:17:54	But so far I'm having a really good week, work is all going well and mood has remained relatively upbeat and steady so all good!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-16 03:16:12	Having nightmares with my phone, keeps turning itself off..times like this I miss having a laptop!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-14 03:47:35	@paul_JFT what a lovely tweet!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-14 02:50:34	My feet ache but I think that's all my shopping done..now I want tea and biscuits before I face the ironing..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-13 21:18:37	Right that's it, I'm ready to face the madness that is Oxford Street two weeks before Christmas..well, as ready as I'll ever be!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-13 20:54:25	@SuzeLikes looks lovely!..I'm feeling very behind, haven't got any decorations up yet..going to do next weekend with my boy..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-13 19:28:06	The temptation to just laze again is very strong but I must do more shopping so just one more coffee then out I go..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-13 19:27:11	@LithiumLibGirl it really was!..unfortunately I have to venture out today for more xmas shopping..hope you're okay..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-13 03:08:38	A lovely afternoon nap followed by a long catch with my sister..now ready to curl up for the evening..a blissful day of doing nothing..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-12 22:06:48	@SuzeLikes yep I've decided today is a dressing gown day!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-12 20:56:44	Feeling a bit lost, I know I should go shopping but I can't be bothered to get dressed and move..I want a day in doing nothing!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-12 03:06:54	But in amongst everything at work we have had a couple of proper laughs as well..we need it when we're dealing with a lot of misery..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-12 03:05:33	Difficult couple of days..lots of incidents going on often more than one at once..but mood wise I'm still feeling good which feels lovely..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-12 03:03:50	@BeckyGetsSober I've just seen your news..congratulations!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-10 03:24:45	Busy couple of days..mood has remained good after coming down a bit yesterday, which was needed..now I just need *this* mood state to last..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-08 03:09:20	@applescrapples @YouTube ooh good choice!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-08 03:08:58	And by that I mean I've been shopping after work and treated myself to new pyjamas and some yummy food..thank you very much m&s..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-08 03:07:31	Really good day at work, my mood is up, by maybe a little too much but in the very much enjoying it stage so going with it for now..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-07 00:34:29	No surprise I ended up reading then accidentally dozed off..just woke and desperate for hot sweet tea..with biscuits of course..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-06 19:56:40	Housework done and now trying to decide whether to go shopping again or curl up on the sofa and read..hmmm decisions decisions...
274535898	act1175	2015-12-06 05:16:45	1919 days..all a day at a time.. https:// twitter.com/Just_KillMeNow _/status/673220164469571585 …
274535898	act1175	2015-12-06 03:05:11	@LithiumLibGirl sounds great, enjoy!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-06 02:17:43	Am quite pleased with how much I got done today, despite the high winds!..now in trackies with tea and feet up for the evening..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-05 19:47:46	Lovely lie in then coffee in bed but it's now time to do some Christmas shopping..I've done none so far..wish me luck!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-05 06:38:47	Felt for the first time this week like I could properly interact with others without wishing I didn't have to..a good sign..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-05 06:37:14	Mood wise I had a much better day, some nice chats with staff I've not seen a lot of during the week and just a good vibe about the place..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-05 06:34:44	Bit of a late one, went to hairdresser after work & going from blonde to brunette takes ages!!..anyway am very glad it's Friday, lie in tom.
274535898	act1175	2015-12-03 02:47:33	Living a very cut and paste life..work, eat, sleep and repeat..I know that's what life is but I'm just not enjoying any of it..except sleep.
274535898	act1175	2015-12-01 02:09:42	I think it's because I still feel low and ultimately didn't want to be there..and I think that showed as well..
274535898	act1175	2015-12-01 02:08:29	Horrible day at work..had no phone or Internet so nothing to do..was in a foul mood and am so glad to be out of there..not a great start..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-30 00:53:50	Having to face the ironing..shame my mood crashed during my time off but it also means I have to go to work tomorrow..so don't want to..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-29 23:13:47	Have been in a low, dark mood and just not wanted to interact with the world at all..feels odd being back on here..*scuttles back to bed*..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-24 18:55:21	Dark rainy day here..guess that means another day in reading..I'm not complaining!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-23 22:58:52	There is something extra lovely about lazing around on a Monday..it's like an extra Sunday..I needed this time off work..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-23 22:45:01	I've spent the day snuggled under a blanket reading..the joy of being away from home is there are no chores to do!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-23 05:47:12	@conniegates628 congratulations!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-23 00:20:55	Watched the sunset from the garden..cold but lovely!.. pic.twitter.com/T5aYBRfIBT
274535898	act1175	2015-11-22 22:22:46	@aaireland that is brilliant!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-22 22:21:02	@d3sk yep, that's how it feels..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-22 21:55:41	A day of reading on the sofa for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-22 03:16:14	@bythesheetstore that's so kind, thank you!!..very rare for me to have a picture of me I like!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-22 03:04:55	Packed uo and came to my sisters..she's away for a week so I'm having some time out of London..lovely to have a real fire going..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-21 04:29:39	Peanut butter on toast for dinner..perfect comfort food..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-21 04:28:41	@applescrapples sounds lovely, enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-21 03:23:52	Lovely being home knowing I can relax now..and get myself to some much needed meetings during my leave..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-21 03:22:21	Have been really tired this week and not really felt like talking to anyone, in person or online..but it's Friday and I have next week off!.
274535898	act1175	2015-11-18 06:04:45	In bed and the wind is whistling outside..it's such a nice way to fall asleep..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-17 04:44:01	Isolated all weekend so in a way was nice to be at work but also enjoy scurrying home for the dark evenings to isolate again..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-17 03:42:58	Am covering the front desk again for the whole week so therefore busy all day long..but time goes faster and I do love it there!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-15 04:47:51	Fell asleep about 4 and only just woke up..all I feel like doing is eating and going back to bed..so that's my Saturday night!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-14 21:38:51	Still in dressing gown listening to the rain while I read..a lazy day today..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-14 06:56:19	More senseless killings, it's just awful.. #PrayForParis
274535898	act1175	2015-11-14 04:53:34	I wanted to just walk out at one point but I went for a bit of a walk and was able to face it much better on my return..glad it's Friday!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-14 04:52:24	Major upheaval at work with a total clearout of the office to make way for new desks so none of us got any work done and I got stressed..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-13 03:14:20	And a job that, although I don't see it often, everyone thinks I'm good at!!..feeling quite blessed..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-13 03:12:38	Feels very bizarre to hear, can't help but think 5 years ago I was unemployable and had been for years and now I have a whole new career..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-13 03:11:34	Pleased that my mood has perked up a bit, made the day easier..had supervision and was told I'm a fully fledged homelessness professional!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-13 03:08:32	Left at lunchtime for a hospital appointment..long wait but read my book and all is ok with Crohns, as long as bloods are fine..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-13 03:07:26	@NicsVoice far from defeat, it's self care..x
274535898	act1175	2015-11-12 04:18:58	Feeling low so just want to be alone and quiet..getting by at work but it's hard, each day is dragging & harder to get through than the last
274535898	act1175	2015-11-10 02:54:50	At the moment I'm just trying to do too much & wondering why I feel close to burn out..my body is screaming at me to stop..I need to listen.
274535898	act1175	2015-11-10 02:53:23	But I've decided to stop trying to also do admin on those days and instead assign a day a week I won't leave the office and do it then..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-10 02:51:23	I think I just have to accept my job is going to be busy, including a lot of travelling to and from the hospital & various council offices..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-09 02:59:32	@Glass1ncision wow that is standard practice here!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-09 02:35:48	Okay I still don't like the hearts but I do like the little shower of colour when you press them..it's the small things that make me smile..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-09 02:34:06	@IanBaxter55 it was!..and yes it's my most hated chore but I do the whole weeks worth then it's over!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-09 01:45:21	Met a friend and spent the afternoon walking and catching up, it was really nice as it's been a long time..now home to face the ironing..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-08 20:47:38	As I do every Remembrance Sunday I am heading out to the Abbey to pay respect to my great grandfather who died alongside so many, for us..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-08 00:49:51	Got all my chores done so into trackies and time for feet up with tea and telly..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-07 20:53:18	Begrudgingly getting dressed to get chores done..horrible weather that makes me want to curl up with a book but I can do that later..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-07 05:32:49	@LithiumLibGirl sounds like the same form then..sorry you've been low, hope the therapy helps tomorrow and kitkats are great company..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-07 04:06:14	@LithiumLibGirl ...type you get..have looked over it and some things were glaring out at me..think this is going to help!..how are you?..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-07 04:04:37	@LithiumLibGirl ah okay so it must be part of this type of therapy..was also given a questionnaire to fill in..not the usual monitoring....
274535898	act1175	2015-11-07 04:01:32	@jadiepye absolutely!..just what I need this weekend..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-07 03:05:39	Was helpful just to say some things out loud, makes it more real and gets me to face things I'm trying not to..and I like her which helps..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-07 03:03:27	Therapy this morning was odd, it was talking about the fact that we are starting but not for another month..still had time to talk though..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-07 02:59:49	@jadiepye what a perfect Sunday line up!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-07 02:58:00	I have never worked 9-5 five days a week before this job but I finally get the feeling Thank God It's Friday!!!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-06 03:49:06	I do not like the hearts..in my head they will remain favourites..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-06 02:33:50	It's not helping that I'm still barely eating..really looking forward to first therapy appt tomorrow morning, I need someone to talk to..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-06 02:31:56	Worked really late a couple of nights and just fell into bed when home..back earlier today but it's been a very hard week..beyond tired now.
274535898	act1175	2015-11-03 05:01:02	@applescrapples been running on self will which my sponsor has just spoken strongly to me about!..need to hand it all over..always learning!
274535898	act1175	2015-11-03 04:44:35	@applescrapples bit stressed at work but in a new role so early days...otherwise all good!!..hope you are too..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-03 04:22:25	@applescrapples well done for doing it!..sorry about the headache..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-03 02:44:23	@_ck_supergirl sorry about everything you are going through, sending strength to get through talking to them again..x x
274535898	act1175	2015-11-03 02:41:34	I was covering the front desk all day and I still love it there but very hard trying to manage that and doing casework..very tired!!
274535898	act1175	2015-11-02 03:09:52	@LithiumLibGirl it's definitely one of my favourite feelings, getting back from being away and curling up in trackies..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-02 02:24:38	Had a lovely time away but it's always nice to be home..been greeted by the cat, son has disappeared to his room so it's teatime for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-02 02:23:24	Went from a clear blue sky to dense fog back in London..not seen it like this for years but I do quite like it..something spooky about it..
274535898	act1175	2015-11-01 07:24:05	@LithiumLibGirl thank you, it was so beautiful and yes I am, just what I needed..x
274535898	act1175	2015-11-01 07:23:08	@DastardlyDeano Happy Birthday Deano, welcome to the 40 club!!..x x
274535898	act1175	2015-11-01 01:33:46	Walk on the beach and watched the sunset.. pic.twitter.com/Yzr6RPVczn
274535898	act1175	2015-10-31 21:46:28	Everyone is out either mountain biking or running so I'm sitting in the garden reading my book..it's so peaceful here which is lovely..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-31 07:11:15	@SarahTheodorou that's true but always last minute that they say which platform then mad rush to get seats!..here now though so can relax..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-30 22:34:42	@paul_JFT sorry to hear that Paul..you'll be in my thoughts..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-30 22:32:21	Hoping to read on the train and try to unwind a bit..with a little help from prn meds..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-30 22:29:34	Reaĺly stressful day, I hate getting ready to travel..now we're at the station far too early and I'm in a bad mood.
274535898	act1175	2015-10-30 02:16:07	@LithiumLibGirl I'm well thank you, catching up on rest with a few days off..hope you get home soon..x
274535898	act1175	2015-10-30 02:10:18	@LithiumLibGirl sending *hugs*..x
274535898	act1175	2015-10-29 22:09:42	Dreaded housework is done..now we're heading out for lunch before I start packing for a couple of days away..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-29 02:35:37	I've had a lazy day while my son has been out playing footy..now he's staying the night with a friend so a quiet evening and early night..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-28 05:57:45	Now I can look forward to a couple of days at home before we go to visit my sister..for tonight it's tea, telly then bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-28 05:56:40	Very busy day and a lot of it unexpected so didn't even start handover till everyone else had gone home..was very odd being there alone..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-27 04:02:15	I am soooo looking forward to a few days off and I'm only in my third week of the role..keep waiting for it to be easier but not happening..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-27 04:00:35	My stress levels at work are through the roof..there is just too much to do and I have no idea how I'm going to complete a handover tom..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-26 02:23:23	Instead we have watched telly, caught up on life and generally lazed around..a lovely Sunday..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-26 02:22:35	Well apart from the ironing I skipped the housework..only working 2 days then taking some leave so I'll do it then instead..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-25 20:47:32	A very lazy morning here..keep thinking I should be doing housework but am enjoying my book too much to start any!..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-25 02:39:36	Lunch was nice and the good thing about a 3 course meal is I don't need to cook tonight!..my boy here now for half term so watching Monk..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-24 20:03:26	@LithiumLibGirl yes I read about it this morning and I like how it sounds in theory..just looking forward to the space to talk!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-24 17:32:06	I just feel like if I only have two days off I want rest but I guess this is what people do who work full time, cram things into weekends..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-24 17:30:19	Feel somewhat rested but had to get up as I have a family lunch to attend..not immediate family so dreading it a bit really..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-24 17:28:36	@SarahTheodorou thanks Sarah..x
274535898	act1175	2015-10-24 17:28:22	@LithiumLibGirl oh brilliant, someone to talk to about it!..how are you finding it?..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-24 05:04:04	....not sure how I feel about it..am so exhausted I can barely think so for tonight it's hot bath then bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-24 05:03:03	....no idea what that is and have been so busy today getting client to accommodation, only home an hour so will look up tomorrow....
274535898	act1175	2015-10-24 05:02:13	....that we see each other for 10 weeks as a sort of intervention until she gears back..going to try cognitive analytical therapy....
274535898	act1175	2015-10-24 05:01:17	Saw therapist this morning, she had contacted psych and received a reply it had been logged but no reply in 3 weeks..so she has a plan....
274535898	act1175	2015-10-23 04:33:28	Days like today are the reason I do my job..to see someone's face when you tell them they are housed after 2 years homeless is amazing!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-23 04:32:12	Much better day, first housing outcome for one of my clients at the hospital and I'm taking him to it tomorrow..he was overjoyed..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-22 02:29:51	And that feels like a shame because I loved my part time role so much..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-22 02:28:40	I knew it would be hard adjusting to full time so I'm trying to take that into account but I'm really just not enjoying it at the moment..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-22 02:26:45	This week is unusual as the other person I work with is off sick so I'm doing her work plus mine and a lot of new referrals..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-22 02:25:18	Absolutely shattered, nearly 5 hours at the hospital today, meetings and assessing patients..then back to work to type it all up..too much!!
274535898	act1175	2015-10-21 03:29:57	Have had tea and toast but now exhausted so heading into bed for an early night..a new day tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-21 02:00:50	This is after she has spoken to local psych team and my g.p to come up with a plan so will see what they have come up with..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-21 01:59:47	This is just old problems coming back and I really need to watch it..have asked for help with it at last therapy appt and next one Friday..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-21 01:58:00	What I need to get on top of is my diet..simply not eating or drinking enough so no wonder I'm exhausted, my body has nothing to work with..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-21 01:56:53	A really busy day again because, of course, I didn't call in sick..but my mood was stable..also starting to feel a bit better bizarrely!..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-21 01:54:38	@jadiepye yeh, we can go back to not having to check the tv guide for Columbo as you so kindly do it for us..welcome back!
274535898	act1175	2015-10-20 03:14:33	Thank god for tea..seriously my go to response in any situation..so I'm still reaching for a drink in times of stress, just better for me!!.
274535898	act1175	2015-10-20 02:21:13	Need a couple of days off but I also know that come tomorrow morning I'll just push myself again..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-20 02:20:20	Stupidly went to work and struggled through the whole day..mood up then crashing down..need to accept I'm not well & making myself worse..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-19 04:30:22	Have slept most of the day but needed it..fever has broken and managed some food so having a hot bath then back to bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-18 18:36:32	Temperatures are much harder for me as I can't take paracetamol so I'm relying on honey and lemon tea and lots of sleep to fight it off..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-18 18:34:53	Lovely to wake up to get well messages, thank you, but still feeling rough..have a temperature now too so it's another day in bed for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-18 03:42:30	Briefly up to have something to eat then back to bed for me..sorry to miss #columbotv but just too unwell today..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-18 03:41:38	@LithiumLibGirl thank you..x
274535898	act1175	2015-10-18 01:29:05	Feeling quite sorry for myself..would like someone to come and look after me, it's such an effort to even make a cup of tea..back to bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-17 18:39:12	Blissful lie in but have woken with no voice..knew it was coming after working all week with a cold..thankfully can rest this weekend..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-17 02:25:21	@LithiumLibGirl thanks, it helps to hear that!
274535898	act1175	2015-10-17 01:57:02	First week done and it's not been great if I'm honest but hoping things will get easier as I get used to it..very tired so time for tea..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-16 01:06:56	Think he heard in my voice I was frantic I wouldn't be getting there today either but even so it was a lovely touch I thought..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-16 01:05:59	Was too late to collect my meds yesterday so had none last night..I called pharmacist today and he kindly offered to deliver them..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-16 01:04:48	Another stressful day..I just had too much to do and it needed to be done..late lunch and barely no fluids again..happy to be going home..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-15 03:00:56	@karen12steps not stupid at all..one of the joys of sobriety..enjoy it!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-15 01:40:11	@beatrix_christ was thinking this myself, 18 tears ago today I got married. It was awful & didn't last but with right person someday..yes..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-15 01:07:17	Wednesdays are nice as I get to go off site for a meeting at the hospital..so I get a break from the office and it's a nice walk there..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-15 01:05:46	Work was very busy again but I had a much better day..mood was stable and steadily did one thing at a time..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-14 01:15:56	High levels of stress easily tip me into hypomania as has happened at work before &, on top of a cold, I'm not sure I'm can deal with that..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-14 01:09:50	It eased after some very late lunch and when I reduced my self imposed limits on how much I had to get done today..but I need to watch this.
274535898	act1175	2015-10-14 01:06:12	Got really stressed today, had to check in with myself and hadn't eaten or drank anything for hours and was clearly trying to do too much..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-13 03:36:27	@LithiumLibGirl thank you!..lots to learn but I'll get to the point where I feel comfortable again soon I'm sure..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-13 02:00:24	First day done!..I was very busy all day and getting my head around the new role felt a bit overwhelming at times but I did it!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-11 21:33:16	@LithiumLibGirl thank you!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-10-11 21:33:00	Home from shopping just in time to catch a Columbo, not seen one for ages so that's my ironing viewing sorted!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-11 19:25:53	Feeling marginally better today but still going to rest in between shopping and ironing for the week ahead..full time job starts tomorrow!..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-11 05:05:16	Another day of doing nothing comes to a close..really need to start feeling better soon..not a good start to new role if I can't go in!..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-11 05:03:22	@bwhatyouwant2b just seen your news, congratulations!!..a big welcome to the world Matilda, she is beautiful..x
274535898	act1175	2015-10-10 19:45:36	@KittenInChaos oh that would be a shame!..let me know new account if you move..do what's best for you..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-10 19:42:54	I feel worse today, totally stiff neck and aching all over with a very chesty cough..definitely another day in bed for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-10 02:03:53	Had a whole day of reading in bed..still feeling ill but hoping all this rest will help somewhat..that & soup, which I only eat when unwell.
274535898	act1175	2015-10-09 00:45:48	I've had an afternoon of watching Father Dowling..utterly mindless but perfect to have on in the background while curled up on the sofa..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-08 18:28:40	Still in bed with coffee and my book..having a not getting dressed day..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-08 02:24:59	Well I've worked my last day in the part time role!!..have worked hard this week with a cold so going to rest up for next couple of days..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-07 02:39:12	Sniffled my way through the day and of course I was rushed off my feet on the day I could do with a quiet one..only just home so teatime..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-06 02:13:02	Work was fine but I've not been feeling great, coming down with a cold for sure..aiming for a hot bath and early night..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-05 04:08:24	Had a day of not doing much of anything..it's been nice..now an early night to start the week rested..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-04 02:29:41	We're off out for dinner to celebrate the new job..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-03 21:30:30	@LithiumLibGirl Spain again!..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-03 21:13:11	@LithiumLibGirl that's always a nice feeling, I booked next years 2 days after I got back from holiday..something to look forward to..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-03 19:29:23	Lazy morning watching telly together..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-03 00:39:28	Meeting was good, then treated myself to some new jeans and a couple of tops..now quick stop at home before getting my boy for the weekend..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-02 19:20:33	A very lazy morning of being absorbed in a book but now heading out to a meeting..bit late but I'm collecting my 5 year chip..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-02 02:36:24	@karen12steps look after yourself, maybe get home so you can let it out..you will feel so much better if you do, emotions are hard..x
274535898	act1175	2015-10-02 02:13:57	@karen12steps yes! And usually once I let it out I sleep really well..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-02 00:24:59	But I did what I could to point out my concerns and she understood well enough..was quite tiring so well deserved cup of tea now!..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-02 00:23:40	Well that was long but a thorough assessment, although as I suspected she can only offer advice that dad then won't follow..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-01 19:06:40	We've been in this position before and all that happens is he gets annoyed at me and then tells them all the right things to be left alone..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-01 19:05:42	And while he still has capacity he can make his own decisions..and yes they are bad decisions but that is his choice..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-01 19:04:43	I have told them that while I can do this today I can't be there regularly so it doesn't alter things long term..he doesn't want any help..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-01 19:03:45	Not looking forward to this, am off to my dad's house with social services for a visit as he won't open the door to him and I'm a keyholder.
274535898	act1175	2015-10-01 04:51:32	Feeling incredibly grateful tonight..so much has changed over the last five years and those promises really do start to come true..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-01 03:23:12	@LithiumLibGirl it's really rewarding and I love it..I'm very lucky!.
274535898	act1175	2015-10-01 03:04:04	@LithiumLibGirl so I would assess people at the local hospital and try to source housing if they are homeless on admission..
274535898	act1175	2015-10-01 03:03:10	@LithiumLibGirl thanks!.I'll be doing a similar role of advice & support but full time and different client group, it's more health related.
274535898	act1175	2015-10-01 01:16:44	Well I formally accepted the job and start a week Monday..was lovely to sign a contract that more than doubles my current salary!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-30 03:38:01	@SuzeLikes it's okay, just a sore hand..we were all lucky none of us were more hurt, it was quite full on!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-30 03:35:26	So now I have this evening to think before formally accepting tomorrow..it's just all come out of the blue but it is a great opportunity..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-30 03:34:30	Then I was offered a years full time secondment..it's what I've been waiting for but never expected to be offered it without interview..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-30 03:33:47	What a day!!..got hurt during the course of an incident trying to separate two people..not badly hurt but a bit shaken..more damaged pride!.
274535898	act1175	2015-09-29 01:33:51	Going straight to work wasn't much fun but I then met a new client and my whole focus shifted which worked wonders..helping others helps me.
274535898	act1175	2015-09-29 01:32:27	It felt like another letdown though I hold some hope that between her and my g.p the team will pay some attention and act accordingly..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-29 01:30:58	...to present my need for therapy to the local team who said I needed to wait 18 months. So I see her in 2 weeks to find out more..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-29 01:29:24	The assessment was okay, thrre were tears inevitably..she can only offer short term therapy but feels I need more than that so is going....
274535898	act1175	2015-09-28 15:28:55	I'm meeting my new psychotherapist this morning..it was all organised quite quickly while I was away but now it's here I'm really anxious..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-28 01:00:37	@mycuriousmind @LithiumLibGirl join in!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-28 00:54:01	@LithiumLibGirl it's lovely!..enjoy your evening on the sofa..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-28 00:25:48	@recovered2006 congratulations!! Happy Birthday..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-27 23:23:19	Now plan is to get into trackies, make tea and curl up on the sofa..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-27 23:22:23	Happily back home, my friend was great, she knows my mood varies so we just spent some time together then she walked me home..am lucky!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-27 20:28:57	Reluctantly going out to see a friend..mood is low and just want to stay in but was already arranged and I would feel bad for cancelling..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-27 03:52:18	Really good meeting then had a long chat with someone I've not seen in a long time so a lot to talk about!!..now home, it's teatime..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-27 00:32:42	Completely chilled out day, reading, bits of shopping and coffee with a friend..all very nice and now heading to a meeting..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-26 04:00:21	@jadiepye @IanBaxter55 @PickledBaloney @Antonio_Bay @AmyLouiseBond @emmakinzle @emmamheard @explodingwalrus excellent!!..thanks Stuart..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-26 01:07:14	Training was good, learnt some new techniques for incident management..skipped going to the pub to come home and have tea with my feet up!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-25 15:23:06	A day of training for me, on managing challenging behaviour..should be interesting!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-25 00:33:55	I had a lovely afternoon..lunch then a long walk to a meeting..had a great catch up and it's always a pleasure to spend time with her..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-24 19:36:57	Quiet morning reading which was lovely..now off to see my best friend for lunch..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-24 04:20:32	Now home and feet up with a cup of tea feeling much lighter..looking forward to a couple of days of rest with plans to see friends..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-24 04:18:07	Went to a much needed meeting after work so late home but it felt really good to be back and share about the past couple of weeks..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-23 01:38:32	I had a much better day, still not quite myself but aware I'm still tired & that affects my mood..only one more day at work then I can rest.
274535898	act1175	2015-09-22 02:25:35	I've been in a foul mood all day with no idea why..it just is what it is..having a hot bath, early night & hoping for a better tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-21 03:53:01	It's a peanut butter on toast for dinner kind of night..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-21 02:22:36	Had a nice afternoon then put my son back on a train..still really tired so an evening of lazing on the sofa for me..with tea of course!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-20 21:31:25	Well I vacuumed and that's enough for today..the sun is out so I'm off to sit by the river and read..catch the last of the summer rays..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-20 19:18:20	Well my son has gone out training and I'm meant to be doing housework but instead am curled up with the cat reading..it is Sunday after all!
274535898	act1175	2015-09-20 04:04:57	@_ck_supergirl oh god the wait must have been awful but I'm so glad you loved it!..supergirl got to fly!!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-09-20 03:34:26	@_ck_supergirl how was it today??
274535898	act1175	2015-09-20 03:17:20	Only just home and we're both shattered but all shopping done..plus I treated myself to a new Bench coat so I'm happy with that!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-19 21:23:30	Very lazy morning spent on the sofa watching telly..now it's the dreaded Oxford St for school shoes and raincoat shopping..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-19 04:44:21	Now I have my boy here, missed him loads..he loves his presents from Spain and already has the football shirt on!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-19 04:40:03	We ended up bowling instead of rounders..scored top of my team at work!!..who knew I could bowl without a drink..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-09-18 18:59:25	Now I need coffee, and plenty of it, before going to play rounders as part of a work away day..should be fun!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-18 18:54:39	Just over fourteen hours sleep!!..I knew I was tired but wasn't expecting that, although I feel heaps better for it so all good..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-18 03:43:12	Lots of late nights and early mornings are catching up with me so I'm in bed before 9pm..bliss!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-17 22:42:05	@BimSooz thank you!..I had a brilliant time, very relaxing and hot!..just what I needed..waiting for the fairies to unpack my case now..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-09-17 20:02:03	@SuzeLikes hiya!..yes I did thanks, didn't do much but that was the aim so all good..will post more pictures as I sort through them..you ok?
274535898	act1175	2015-09-17 19:21:22	I had a blissful week of sun, sea and fellowship..it's always nice to see old friends and meet new people..recovery in the sun!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-17 19:08:59	Got back late last night and already I'm missing this view I had every morning.. pic.twitter.com/iPgdOAT7K0
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 19:18:29	On the plane so time to sit back and relax..see you all next week..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 19:15:10	@SuzeLikes thank you!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 18:22:20	@BimSooz thank you!..she wasn't fussed unsurprisingly!..nearly time to go now..thanks for all your support..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 18:21:01	Fighting through med induced sedation, took them too late last night and not slept off enough..but having a coffee before gate opens..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 15:47:46	Ready as I'll ever be so time to say hoodbye to the cat and lock up..anxiety is high but I know it will reduce as I'm on my way..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 15:09:56	Now time seems to be flying by!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 14:13:02	Not a great nights sleep but fairly sure adrenalin will keep me going..anxiety is there but not too bad..yet!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 06:45:09	Few bits to do in the morning but I'm done for tonight, really need some sleep now..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 04:50:54	@BimSooz @SuzeLikes thank you both!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 04:07:16	@SuzeLikes @BimSooz tomorrow morning, leaving home at 9am so I know I will have time in the morning for last minute bits..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 04:02:10	@SuzeLikes @BimSooz I have no doubt!..thank you both for keeping me company..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 03:40:30	Decided to take a break to eat, just realized how hungry I am and I'm sure that's not helping..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 03:37:36	@BimSooz @SuzeLikes airways was very appropriate though!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 03:37:14	@SuzeLikes @BimSooz it's very reassuring to know it's not just me!..I always take stuff I don't wear so trying not to but it's hard!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 03:08:33	I'm not doing very well here, can't make decisions so putting stuff in then back out of the case..stopped for a tea break..I hate packing..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-09 03:06:57	@BipolarBlogger excellent news!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-08 23:16:50	On the plus side I had a lovely chat with Matt from @MindCharity about an upcoming article he is writing..always a pleasure!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-08 23:14:30	Got home to find a pipe leaking, now I have a plumber here which means I can't try clothes on so anxiety rising..going straight to prn..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-08 21:13:17	Right that's it, handover complete so time to head home and pack..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-08 05:32:39	My list for tomorrow is scarily long..going to read in bed to unwind as anxiety is already on its way up..hate this bit before a holiday..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-08 03:21:47	Feel too drained to attempt to pack tonight so looks like I will be doing it last minute after all..but I have done a list so should be ok..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-08 02:51:37	@d3sk thank you, it does hurt..without a doubt it's the hardest part of the job..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-08 02:50:00	We, obviously, feel the loss and it was a sombre day..the average age of death on the streets is 43..it's just so wrong..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-08 02:48:01	First thing I hear at work is one of our clients died last Friday, waiting for post mortem to know why but homelessness kills..he was 42..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-07 04:45:32	Well I've not exactly packed but I have worked out what I'm going to pack so halfway there!..enough for today, it's bedtime for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-06 23:53:17	Not sure why I feel the need to clean the house before I go away but I always do..anyway that's done, time for a cup of tea before ironing..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-06 20:08:18	While I'm complaining about vacuuming I remembered my sister is doing an Iron Man competition today..puts things in perspective..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-09-06 18:15:52	Housework this morning before I attempt to get packing done..don't want to leave it till Tuesday after work to do..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-06 04:45:28	Dozed off on the sofa..have woken a bit disorientated and very hungry..tea and toast time..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-06 04:44:29	@MrsDalcoholfree yeh congratulations!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-05 23:54:13	Managed to complete all but one thing on today's list so I'm pleased with that..met my best friend for a coffee too so it's been a good day.
274535898	act1175	2015-09-05 18:01:31	Got up early to get some things done yet I'm still drinking coffee waiting to wake up!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-05 03:11:06	Having written lists I've had a quiet evening of comfort food and hot bath..in pjs and ready for bed already..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-05 01:52:41	@SuzeLikes me too!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 23:00:49	Going to write out what I need to do and then leave it for today..nothing like a list to help me to see exactly how much needs doing..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 22:59:18	Made it out to get toiletries and a new adaptor..that's enough for today, need to try and get a grip on this anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 21:13:08	@DastardlyDeano that is so kind, thank you!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 21:05:40	@SuzeLikes Spain on Wednesday, really need the break and some sun but I don't do the build up very well at all!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 20:59:31	Feeling really anxious, I always am before going away but I'm frozen with fear at the idea of going out to do things, which isn't helping..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 19:06:41	Lazy morning off but I'm going away in five days and I've not done a single thing to get ready so I guess I should start writing a list!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 19:05:21	@Fionaok thank you Fiona!!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 04:50:57	@BipolarBlogger Oh goodness Charlotte I'm so sorry to hear about Mr B, and the impact on you..will be thinking of you and sending hugs..x
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 04:29:47	Really glad I went out, was lovely to see people and share about my journey..full of gratitude tonight..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 02:25:02	Decided to come to a meeting and there is cake!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 01:07:49	@LithiumLibGirl thanking you!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-04 01:07:11	@jenpiedri thanks Jen!..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-03 23:45:53	5 years sober today..just amazing really, & all made possible by living my life a day at a time..don't always do it well but it's worked..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-03 03:54:58	I've had something to eat and a hot bath which has helped me unwind..now an early night and it's a whole new day tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-03 03:10:57	@Andy_15052012 thank you Andy..this too shall pass..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-03 02:17:04	There was nothing I did wrong nor could have done differently but like I said some days my job is really hard emotionally and that's tough..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-03 02:13:29	Wish I could elaborate about work but I can't..can just say I had a nasty experience today that has left me feeling fragile and emotional..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-03 02:10:59	Bad day at work..every now and then the awful things that happen to and are done to people just overwhelms me..I see so much of it..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-02 02:49:03	@Fionaok so lovely!!..thank you Fiona..x x
274535898	act1175	2015-09-02 02:24:03	Going to have a bath and an early night, oh and with no meds as I ran out and they couldn't sort it for today so have to collect tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-02 02:22:51	Good day back at work but mood has dropped significantly on the way home..feel heavy hearted and don't know why..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-01 14:05:56	Bit of a shock to the system getting up for work but coffee will do its job hopefully..
274535898	act1175	2015-09-01 14:04:21	@BimSooz hope you have a lovely time away!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-31 23:49:13	Made it out for a walk when the rain eased up..treated myself to some M&S meals for the next few days..now it's tea and telly time..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-31 21:06:28	@hm_custserv thank you! Just ordered..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-31 20:22:43	@hm_custserv oh brilliant could you send me the link please?. I can't find it on the website.
274535898	act1175	2015-08-31 19:49:32	The first day I feel like going out it's raining..typical!..oh well, online shopping it is then..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-31 19:48:44	@hm_custserv hi, trying to find this in a size 10 at a store in London..could you help? pic.twitter.com/GnGImGEawR
274535898	act1175	2015-08-31 00:02:29	Catching up with the new series of New Tricks..always a pleasure..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-30 20:47:14	@BipolarBlogger yehhhhh!!..so pleased you had a great day..looking forward to more pictures..x x
274535898	act1175	2015-08-30 20:23:54	Today seems to have become another lazy day..bit of online shopping for my holiday but mostly reading..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-30 02:37:41	It's been a lovely day of doing nothing..just lazed about reading or watching telly..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-29 22:11:51	I do so hope that @BipolarBlogger is having a great day..or Mrs B as she may be by now..x
274535898	act1175	2015-08-29 19:41:05	Having a quiet, pottering about kind of day today..hopefully I won't even have to get dressed..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-29 05:42:06	Meds have done their job, it's bedtime..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-29 05:35:03	@BipolarBlogger wishing you a fantastic day!!..x x
274535898	act1175	2015-08-29 04:33:32	Trying to be sensible and think the cat may be responsible or maybe, oh I don't know..I'm taking a bath and not thinking for a while..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-29 03:21:43	She wouldn't have any interest in any of my things..paranoia level has shot up along with intense anxiety..not what I wanted..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-29 03:20:29	Feeling quite unsettled, a few things have caught my eye as not being the same as when I left..only neighbour been in to feed the cat...
274535898	act1175	2015-08-29 02:40:47	And we're home..so happy to sit on my own sofa and have a cup of tea..never ever tastes as good anywhere else!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-29 02:38:57	@JourneyToPeace_ ha ha totally agree!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-28 20:17:33	Finally the sun is out here so we're going for a walk before starting our journey home this evening..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-28 02:11:31	@serpentgrr there is always something to look at and I love that there are no high buildings..glad you're back!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-28 01:41:42	We spent the day in Bath..beautiful place but I didn't take my phone so no pictures..was actually really nice to just look at things..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-27 02:39:30	@example Van's first bed?..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-27 02:38:26	@BipolarBlogger I will try to stop by!..am at my sister's house and being on my phone is a bit frowned upon..wishing you a lovely evening x
274535898	act1175	2015-08-27 02:36:49	@karen12steps ha ha so true, it's happened to me!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-27 00:44:12	Fish and chips for dinner tonight..not had in ages so looking forward to it!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-27 00:43:04	@BeckyGetsSober sending *hugs*..x
274535898	act1175	2015-08-26 21:41:20	Not done much today as lousy weather but it's nice being somewhere so quiet..happily reading..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-26 02:42:46	Very tired..worked this morning then straight to station and train journey to my sister's house..here now though so it's teatime!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-25 05:06:23	@SarahTheodorou ooh I'll look out for that!..it was much nicer than I anticipated..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-25 04:31:54	Early to bed for me, have a few chores to do in the morning before I get to work so need as much rest as possible..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-25 02:50:35	I bought Whole Earth peanut butter on the way home..no added sugar, what has happened to me!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-25 01:41:58	Be nice to see her and for my son to catch up with his cousins though I will miss being away from home, I'm not very good with being away..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-25 01:40:39	Good first day back at work..mostly catching up on emails!..only in half day tomorrow then I go to my sisters for the week..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-24 04:21:39	@Andy_15052012 yep!..great stuff..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-24 03:39:39	@Andy_15052012 I often find they can be the best shares, no time for our egos to get in the way!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-24 03:17:09	Beans on toast saved the day!..realizing I ate more sugar than I thought..especially missing biscuits today..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-24 02:54:03	@BipolarBlogger excellent!!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-08-24 01:56:30	I went to have peanut on toast then realized it has sugar in it..oh no!!!..now I don't know what to eat..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-23 23:26:03	Went from reading with the lights on to sitting on the balcony in glorious sunshine for a couple of hours..lovely lazy day for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-23 20:04:16	It's totally dark and the rain is lashing down..perfect conditions for reading in bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-23 20:03:09	Fell asleep.on the sofa lsst night and stirred 3am..missed #Columbotv and woke with a sore neck..rest of the night in bed and only just up!.
274535898	act1175	2015-08-23 04:25:12	@mysafebubble have sent dm..x
274535898	act1175	2015-08-23 03:59:43	@mysafebubble are you okay??
274535898	act1175	2015-08-23 03:20:24	@BipolarBlogger it's a tough one!..going to notice it more when back at work, I rely on Coke to get me through the afternoons..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-23 03:03:25	On my third day of not eating any sugar, I don't usually have very much anyway but I'm really missing it in tea!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-23 01:29:06	Had a blissful time sun bathing and there was a lovely breeze so it didn't feel as hot as it was..now home for tea and telly..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-22 20:52:30	Got up early and have done all my housework and chores so I can now go and sit by the river with my book and get some sun..

274535898	act1175	2015-08-21 05:22:10	@surelybutslowly ah okay, it's just the longer I've been sober the less I talk to mine and wondered if that was common..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-21 04:25:18	@surelybutslowly is there a reason you talk so infrequently, was it always that way?.hope you don't mind me asking..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-21 02:38:35	Feeling tired now, the walk did help and am less agitated..anxiety still up but taken prn and can have a quiet evening as my son is out..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 23:59:59	Last retweet made me chuckle, that was nice!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 23:59:14	Time to turn around and head home I think..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 23:58:49	I'm by the river having a peppermint tea..walking has helped a bit but feeling a bit paranoid now I've stopped, too many people about..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 21:40:53	Bath was nice but not really eased the anxiety and agitation..hoping some fresh air will help so heading out for a walk by the river..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 21:25:07	@jenpiedri thanks Jen, struggling a bit with life today..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 20:26:57	@BimSooz please do!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 20:21:17	@BimSooz oh good!..I'm picturing more of an amble by the river and taking my book in case I want to stop..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 20:08:09	@frogpondatdusk definitely keeping it simple today, not very good at focused breathing, something I need to work on!!..thank you..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 20:07:08	@BeckyGetsSober thanks Becky, it's horrible..going to be kind to myself though..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 20:05:43	@BimSooz thanks, definitely going to try a walk..not sure it will be fast though!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 20:04:41	Thank you for messages and suggestions, going to try a bath and then see if I can get out for a walk..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 19:35:43	Have woken up full of anxiety..feel shaky and unsure what to do with myself..too agitated to read so feel a bit lost..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 01:20:58	Three weeks till my holiday..was meant to be cutting out sugar but remembered half way through eating biscuits..whoops!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 00:41:30	@_ck_supergirl @RJ_Hinton great, thanks!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-20 00:17:40	@_ck_supergirl @RJ_Hinton is it sponsored Claire?..and yikes!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-19 21:55:00	Every day I've told myself I'll get up earlier and be more productive, but then I read with coffee & before I know it half the day is gone!!
274535898	act1175	2015-08-19 21:52:51	Being off work has meant I'm starting my days so much later..only just dressed and ready to head out at 3pm..wasting a lot of time..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-19 03:41:32	@jadiepye @kathyf1024 @mirry_mirry @kerryfrench77 @HollHox @bythesheetstore I can make the first one, and a great episode!..yeh!!
274535898	act1175	2015-08-19 02:41:47	I guess that never really ends when you're a parent, always wanting to know they are safe and happy..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-19 02:40:44	I can never properly relax when my son is out and about..I know he's sensible and with a good friend but it still makes me anxious..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-19 00:53:46	Not done much today, plans to do housework failed..instead I read and pottered about with no real results..time for some tea and t.v..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-19 00:49:09	@nikimummy13 sending condolences..xx
274535898	act1175	2015-08-18 21:21:40	@Fionaok *hugs*..be kind to yourself today..x
274535898	act1175	2015-08-18 19:31:45	Another quiet morning here which is nice..a lot of housework to do but delaying starting as long as I can..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-18 19:29:06	@karen12steps amazing, well done!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-18 04:45:29	@BipolarBlogger what a perfectly lovely tweet!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-18 02:16:08	been down that road before and he was found to not be unwell enough..therein lies the problem!!.. Rant over..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-18 02:15:22	It is just incredibly frustrating for us, as his family, to sit back and not do anything..she suggested we call social services but we've...
274535898	act1175	2015-08-18 02:14:22	She has set up numerous opportunities for him to seen but he just won't go, he doesn't want to look at himself at all..and that's his choice
274535898	act1175	2015-08-18 02:13:45	The problem lies, she & we believe, in undiagnosed mental health but he doesn't lack capacity so it's very difficult..he won't accept help..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-18 02:12:26	She was very aware he is missing appointments and the community team have tried to see him but he won't open the door to them..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-18 02:11:31	Bit of a busy day for me, returning stuff to Oxford Street then across London to see my dad's doctor to raise concerns we have about him..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-17 17:55:57	Quietly reading before my son gets up..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-17 04:17:33	@PaulHoward5 @jadiepye enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-17 00:29:12	He got quite a lot done in the end so has gone out with a friend..means I can watch some t.v of my choosing and put my feet up!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-16 20:55:21	@BeckyGetsSober isn't it just!..morning Becky..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-16 20:54:42	Hardest thing is him asking me if he'll ever use it in life, he probably won't, but that doesn't change the fact he needs to learn it now..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-16 20:49:52	We're back to doing Maths exam prep..I am next to useless at this and have no idea how I ever passed..even reading about it baffles me!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-16 02:38:20	Tried sending a DM to someone who I think has deleted their account and got this message..made me laugh!!.. pic.twitter.com/DbEeQIwt4j
274535898	act1175	2015-08-16 02:12:30	Finally have tea in hand and feet up..feel exhausted, I'm definitely still a bit ill, think it could be a virus as everything aches..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-16 02:10:36	@d3sk excellent!..I love tea now after many years of not drinking it, it doesn't go well with vodka, and it has to be sweet..cheers!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-16 01:12:11	We had a wander through Portobello Market then did some food shopping..just home and go to make tea to find there's no milk..back out I go..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-15 20:36:23	We're only really just stirring for the day..both sleeping a lot!!..we must need it I guess..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-15 20:34:01	@LithiumLibGirl pretty!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-14 23:14:43	Given that he did over 2 hours I've let him go out with a friend, for me to have a break more than anything!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-14 23:12:06	I know it's horrible having to do homework in the holidays but it is exam prep so important he gets his head around it!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-14 23:10:53	Feeling stronger today, though I could have done without the battle over maths homework with my son..he gets frustrated then I do too..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-13 20:04:06	Feeling slightly better but still having a day of doing nothing much..rest and more rest while my son watches daytime t.v..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-13 20:02:59	@jackwhitehall my son just turned 15 and is dying to see this as his first film seen legally!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-13 01:02:50	Well I've spent the whole day lying on the sofa..nausea has passed after I managed some food but otherwise feeling rough..another nap due..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-12 20:28:32	My son is being lovely giving me hugs and stroking my head but I've said he should go out with his friend and I can just lie on the sofa..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-12 20:26:04	Have woken up feeling awful..sweating, dizzy, nauseated and pounding headache..can't even drink coffee which means I'm really ill..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-12 06:20:52	...so feel a bit lonely if I'm honest..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-12 06:19:31	...it's that small step away from family that happens at this age but it still makes me a little sad..his friend is staying the night too...
274535898	act1175	2015-08-12 06:17:58	It's been a lovely evening..different this year as my son invited his best friend so was, rightly so, absorbed with him but it's a change...
274535898	act1175	2015-08-12 01:30:29	@LithiumLibGirl thank you!..and I hope your last few days at work are okay, not long now!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-08-12 00:17:41	And it's my son's 15th birthday today so quick stop at home then a family meal out..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-12 00:16:28	I made it!!..handover completed and all my paperwork up to date..now just under 2 weeks off to spend with my son..it's hometime!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-11 04:05:31	@d3sk yep it has definitely helped!..now to bed for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-11 02:57:17	But I'm home now, finding it a bit hard to unwind so running a hot bath while drinking sweet tea..self care..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-11 02:53:14	Busy day and I felt quite stressed trying to get ready to handover tomorrow before some annual leave..I'm off for two weeks so a lot to do!.
274535898	act1175	2015-08-10 01:53:15	@mysafebubble yep!..it's my number one coping strategy, escape to another place..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-10 00:10:45	I love this.. https:// twitter.com/SerenityVista/ status/630408912668389376 …
274535898	act1175	2015-08-09 23:16:31	Last bits of shopping today but I'm all done!..now the ironing to do then I can put my feet up..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-09 18:30:57	Up earlier today and most of the housework is already done..couple more bits to do then sun on the balcony for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-09 05:41:37	Just been hit by a wave of meds induced tiredness, bedtime for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-09 02:17:09	Managed to do most of the shopping for my son's birthday on Tuesday..also treated myself to a few meals from M&S so no cooking to do..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-09 00:01:52	Has anybody else been getting this flash up on their phone screen?..don't know how to tell if genuine or not?? pic.twitter.com/07fxb2R9Vc
274535898	act1175	2015-08-08 19:22:02	Wow twelve hours sleep, must have needed it!..a day of chores to do today but first things first it's coffee time!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-08 00:21:56	Have had a much needed day of doing nothing but reading and resting with the occasional doze..now moving to sofa for tea and some t.v..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-07 07:29:52	One thing I've noticed on both tube strike days is how much more people talk to each other..it's mostly to moan but more camaraderie too..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-07 07:24:19	Only just home after a total of 5 hours travelling..the work do was really nice but I'm absolutely shattered..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-06 20:40:35	@LithiumLibGirl thank you, I hope it does!..leaving now to be at work for 4pm..not looking forward to the journey..hope you're well..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-06 19:17:38	And I still have to attend a work event this evening and get there by bus whch was a nightmare last time..not enjoying this day so far..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-06 19:15:44	Was woken by drilling downstairs at 8am and it's still going..have had too much coffee so am grouchy as well as tired..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-06 01:56:38	Also made a plan, with one of the volunteers, to go to a meeting on Friday..it's been too long and I could really use one..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-06 01:54:21	@Glass1ncision that's an amazing picture!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-06 01:35:13	Another busy day but also productive so all good..tube was packed on the way home but now curled up under a blanket with tea and telly..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-05 03:30:17	The senior manager I had burst into tears with noticed my mood seems much better and was pleased too..just feel a bit lighter, it's nice..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-05 03:28:39	Busy but good day at work..mood still variable but to much lesser degrees so I'm coping better and that just makes everything easier..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-04 01:41:58	Was a relief to be back at work..around people I like and doing a rewarding job that I enjoy..feeling a lot of gratitude today..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-03 02:15:36	Really honestly though I'm not sure how much longer I can carry on living this way..something has to give, I just don't know what..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-03 02:14:42	I feel like I need to hide away in a corner and not talk to anyone for a very long time but that's not an option..so on I go..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-03 02:13:13	At mum's house there was a blazing row and being at dad's is just really sad..so altogether it's just been too much for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-03 02:10:51	I've had too much contact with my family this weekend..mum yesterday and dad today, both times with my sister and our kids..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-01 21:35:14	Me: Those swim shorts are cool. Son laughs. Me: What? Son: It's so funny when old people say cool. Old???
274535898	act1175	2015-08-01 03:28:58	Have definitely earned tea and feet up..quiet evening of watching Monk planned..
274535898	act1175	2015-08-01 03:20:23	Phew long day, lunch out then shopping but couldn't find what I wanted..straight onto a nurse's appointment then collected my son..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-31 18:24:08	Was nice to wake to the sun shining, had coffee in bed and now going to meet my sister for lunch..then some holiday shopping!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-31 05:00:37	To bed, with a new book and no alarm set, blissful!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-31 02:21:42	@LithiumLibGirl ultimate comfort food and frequently dinner for me too..enjoy..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-31 00:49:41	My Youview box had to be replaced so I lost all my recordings..but now I can watch Partners in Crime so settling down with tea & biscuits..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-30 23:47:16	Went out for lunch with a recovery friend..was really nice to catch up, and be able to share, as only one addict with another can..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-30 19:45:45	@serpentgrr good ideas!..might combine a walk with stopping for coffee and take my book too..enjoy your colouring!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-30 19:38:36	Not sure what to do with myself today..been aching for some time off and now I have it I'm bored already..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-30 04:19:50	Nutella on toast for dinner..because I can!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-30 03:05:36	I had a much better day today..mood stayed steady so I was very productive but in a calm sense instead of racing around..I'm pleased..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-29 05:02:34	I've had meds, something to eat and a hot bubble bath so I'm ready for bed..one more day before some time off..I can do that..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-29 02:56:56	Not in a nasty way but more she knows where it could lead, so she brought me home and made me tea and is staying for awhile..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-29 02:55:51	Probably shouldn't have gone straight to meet a friend but really wanted to see her and it was nice but even she said I should go home..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-29 02:54:16	And again my mood varied during the day, started low then back to high in the afternoon and I was chatting away and racing around..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-29 02:50:50	Very busy today so barely had any breaks, ate lunch walking back to work from buying it..struggling to fit all my work into my hours..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-28 02:32:31	I do know by now not to try & analyze my mood status too much or I become obsessed with wanting to know why rather than practice self care..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-28 02:31:08	Getting very tired of this but it also seems related to work so maybe I'm just not managing it properly..hard to try and think straight..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-28 02:30:17	And of course that elevated my mood and I found it incredibly hard to just stop for the day..only just home and still very high..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-28 02:28:33	Straight from that into work and immediately dealing with someone in real crisis so it's been all go go go..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-28 02:27:34	Today was busy, morning spent in court with a good result..didn't expect to have to speak myself but I did when asked directly by the judge!
274535898	act1175	2015-07-27 04:02:17	Just realized it's been a week since I spoke to my sponsor so quick call to her before bed is in order..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-27 04:01:04	Early to bed for me, want to start the week as rested as possible and travelling further in the morning to accompany a client to court..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-26 23:23:07	Brief trip to local shops which involved getting dressed but happily back in trackies now..cup of tea time I think!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-26 21:25:56	@realdealsober It will be worth it!!..I did a chapter a day alternating between the front and the stories at the back..enjoy!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-26 19:38:53	A lazy morning in bed listening to the rain while I read..lovely..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-26 02:37:30	My Youview box has frozen so settling down for an evening with Nurse Jackie..engineer coming Tuesday so it's dvds till then..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-26 01:39:39	@DastardlyDeano ooh pretty, thank you!..that's just what I'm doing..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-26 00:33:54	Very lethargic and a bit dazed today really..going to lie down to read and maybe have a doze..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-26 00:32:05	Well I've done my food shopping and had two loads of laundry service washed..lazy I know but I don't have the energy to do much..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-25 20:04:37	Have two concerns, one is reading about things I've forgotten & probably don't need to know..the other is fear I'll get obsessed & read all.
274535898	act1175	2015-07-25 20:02:13	My mum has suggested she could sit and rip them all up as she won't have the temptation to read them but I would have to sort them first..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-25 20:00:56	What I should be doing is clearing out drawers full of papers in front room but I'm anxious about what I'll find, all from my drinking days.
274535898	act1175	2015-07-25 19:34:51	Have had coffee in bed while trying to decide what to do today..mood is still low so don't want to plan too much but want to do something..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-25 04:07:47	@julieclarke884 thanks Julie, going well right now means not bursting into tears in public so that was good!..this too shall pass..x
274535898	act1175	2015-07-25 04:04:24	Right it's time to practice some self care, I don't have control over moods but I do have the ability to be nice to myself when they're not.
274535898	act1175	2015-07-25 04:02:25	Just looked back to when I was last out with work friends and it was only 3 days ago!!..feels like weeks, that's actually quite alarming..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-25 04:00:01	It's all very, very tiring..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-25 03:59:37	I guess I just feel like I don't have any continuity with my moods recently, very low to high in minutes & everything in between..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-25 03:56:47	That time I was hypomanic and this time I only managed basic conversation with the people closest to me as mood is back to low..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-25 03:54:26	The leaving drinks was a nice occasion but also a reminder of how different my mood was last time we were at the pub..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-24 20:56:25	Heading out to do some chores then going to work for someone's leaving drinks..don't really feel up to it but said I'd go..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-24 20:44:32	@DoctorChristian my 15 year old son wants to start going to a gym to do weights, is that safe or is he too young?.
274535898	act1175	2015-07-24 18:12:28	Another good rest and I'm beginning to feel the effect of it..or is that affect, they still confuse me..never mind, it's coffee time!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-24 04:05:42	Have spent the day reading and resting..it has been quiet and I stayed offline..just being able to do nothing has helped a bit I think..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 18:12:54	Had a good rest but have woken with the pounding headache I went to bed with..a day of doing absolutely nothing planned..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 05:15:07	Ended up reading for a bit too long, never mind I enjoyed it..definitely going to sleep now..goodnight..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 04:12:39	Eaten, bathed and ready for bed..taking book and hot chocolate with me..feel like I could sleep forever and free to with no alarm set..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 04:07:08	@LithiumLibGirl thank you, that's kind..and I enjoy yours!..just someone trying to kick me when I'm down..I suggested unfollowing..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 02:42:08	@_ck_supergirl thank you, much appreciated..x
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 02:11:50	@julieclarke884 that means a lot..thank you..x
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 02:11:17	To the person who dm me to say I tweet too much about tea..really, REALLY!!..now, when I feel in crisis, is the best time to tell me that???
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 02:07:53	@julieclarke884 thank you Julie, am already on the sofa with tea..I know it has to pass, just bloody hard being in it till it does!!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 01:48:32	Now my head is pounding, my eyes are swollen and I feel awful..no idea how to cope with any of this!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 01:47:36	Managed to get out despite people wanting me to stay, I think out of concern, only to sob all the way home on the tube..a new low for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 01:45:59	Another horrible day, started with exhaustion, then elevated mood again before it crashed and I ended up in tears at my desk..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-23 01:45:40	Thankfully by that time there were only 3 people left in the office but it was still really hard and I just felt so pathetic for not coping.
274535898	act1175	2015-07-22 05:44:37	I've never experienced such a sudden mood shift before and it has shaken me up a bit..really need rest now..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-22 05:40:12	Am finally home, extremely late for me..have taken meds plus prn to enable me to sleep..very very odd day..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-22 04:03:56	...colleagues and thinking I should probably go home to try and unwind but I really really don't want to..enjoying the high, for now...
274535898	act1175	2015-07-22 04:02:42	...feeling very low and dreading it to being the most enthusiastic person there..it carried on rest of the day & now I'm in the pub with...
274535898	act1175	2015-07-22 04:02:04	Oh lordy!..halfway through training in the afternoon my mood rapidly escalates and I'm suddely chatty and energetic..I went straight from...
274535898	act1175	2015-07-21 20:53:27	I also shared with the manager on site how I'm feeling and she has said I can absolutely call in if I feel I can't make it..that helped too.
274535898	act1175	2015-07-21 20:52:22	Am coping with work slightly better today..mostly by hiding in the back office but it's helping somewhat..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-21 00:56:04	@julieclarke884 that's a good idea, thank you!..will see how I feel tomorrow, for now it's hot sweet tea with mindless t.v to distract me..x
274535898	act1175	2015-07-21 00:52:52	@julieclarke884 I'm sure they would be fine with it but just don't want to have to reveal it, I would feel like everyone would then know..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-21 00:51:29	@julieclarke884 a couple of people do but don't think my line manager knows, I'm wary of calling in sick with mental health difficulties....
274535898	act1175	2015-07-21 00:48:43	Guess I can only deal with it a day at a time..going to try and practice self care this evening and face tomorrow when it comes..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-21 00:47:47	Though that only solves the problem for now..not sure how to face work when feeling like this yet have to go again tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-21 00:46:18	Decided to go to the doctor after work to make an appointment, made me feel less guilty for leaving work early..glad to be home now though..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-21 00:45:12	@julieclarke884 thank you Julie..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-20 20:44:20	Have already asked to leave early by lying and saying I have a doctor appointment and that's been agreed but makes me feel worse..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-20 20:42:56	I thought I was okay for work but this low mood is making my job really hard..I just don't want to talk and it's being noticed by others..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-20 01:30:50	Finally feet up with cup of tea time..mood has lifted slightly which is good but nowhere near myself yet..whatever that is!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-19 23:15:41	Have been productive today, all the housework and food shopping is done, now just the ironing to do then I can relax..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-19 18:29:47	Another very long sleep and had to force myself to get up or would have stayed in bed all day..unfortunately there is housework to do..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-19 18:27:48	@RJ_Hinton aww thanks Richard, hope you had a good time!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-19 04:39:13	Keep getting waves of tiredness coming over me so going with them and heading to bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-19 04:34:44	@RJ_Hinton sorry to miss #columbotv , can't keep my eyes open any longer!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-18 23:38:32	Have been to the library, was too warmly dressed so made it a brief trip and happily back home again..got a new Nikki French book to start..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-18 20:24:23	So far I'm still in pyjamas curled up with my book which is due back today..am nearly done so guess will have to face getting dressed soon..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-18 04:24:53	@BeckyGetsSober always a good choice!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-18 02:04:31	Interesting sky on my way home.. pic.twitter.com/ekyolzh87L
274535898	act1175	2015-07-17 21:53:54	I'm very aware that this constant reading is a way of not having to face how I'm feeling, which is pretty low, so I stay buried in a book..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-17 16:42:43	It is a lovely morning here so going to sit in the garden..shame my mood is still low but reading seems to be working as a distraction..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-17 02:01:45	Got here awhile ago but went straight for a nap after my eyes had been closing on the train..going to have some dinner then go for a walk..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-16 18:56:06	I think some time near water will be helpful for my mood..well that's what I'm hoping for!.
274535898	act1175	2015-07-16 18:54:58	I had a lovely lie in then read in bed with my coffee so only just stirring..need to pack as going to my sister's house for the night..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-16 03:51:30	I'm quite relaxed this evening, guess it's knowing I don't have to get up early tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-16 01:20:46	Today was better in that I didn't feel as low as yesterday but I'm still not great..looking forward to the next couple of days off..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 03:58:47	That's it for me, I'm going to bed..thank you for all the kind messages, they really helped me feel less alone..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 02:36:25	@GoogleGardener @nikimummy13 thank you..hot bath and early night planned..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 02:34:45	@SuzeLikes mood is still low but it's heaps easier to deal with at home than work..early night I think..thanks for kind words..x
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 02:32:25	@julieclarke884 thanks Julie..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 01:28:48	@nikimummy13 feel better just for being at home, thanks, I can manage it here much better than out there!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 01:26:15	@SuzeLikes thank you lovely..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 01:25:59	@conniegates628 thanks Connie..x
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 01:25:39	@frogpondatdusk thanks for your message, always nice to know someone relates though am sorry you feel it too sometimes..take care..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 01:23:07	Now I'm home it's time for some self care..straight into trackies and hot sweet tea is needed..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 01:21:24	She asked if anything would help, I could have gone home but I said I was okay to stay..I felt better for having cried and managed the day..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 01:21:12	I assured her wasn't work related but feeling low, she shared something about herself and I felt safe sharing about being bipolar..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-15 01:20:53	I sat in the garden after lunch and a senior manager came over..she very gently asked if I was okay and I burst into tears..she was great..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-14 20:52:19	I'm having a really hard day..my mood has plummeted & I'm struggling to keep it together at work..very close to just crying in a corner..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-14 04:41:22	Actually feeling a bit low and grumpy and would like to have a really good moan but I'm too tired..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-14 04:39:53	I feel like I only just got in yet I'm going to bed..it's that eat, sleep, work and repeat pattern that I don't like yet have to do..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-14 01:02:04	Did the early shift this morning so feeling really tired..should have left early but it didn't work out..never mind, home now for tea..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-13 04:03:33	@BipolarBlogger ooohh you can't beat a bit of crumble..*writes it on shopping list*..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-13 02:33:22	A very lazy day here..we both needed a day of staying in pyjamas and watching telly, he's knackered so close to end of term..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-12 20:51:09	Love this!!.. https:// twitter.com/rocks_recovery /status/620209150656577538 …
274535898	act1175	2015-07-12 04:28:50	I said we'll go back next month with his passport but it doesn't take away how he feels now and I remember that so well, it's horrible..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-12 04:26:57	I have a disappointed son, we tried to see a 15 film but he wasn't allowed, only one month away but we had no photo id..he's gutted..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-12 01:04:33	@jadiepye ooohh lovely!..only I don't want to go to this festival, hopefully they can find the owner and it can all have a happy ending..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-12 00:50:37	@jadiepye very good point!..thanks..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-12 00:41:02	@jadiepye that's an idea!..I thought one of the numbers on it might identify the buyer but don't know how to trace it..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-12 00:32:01	I've found a festival ticket worth a lot of money..anybody have any idea how I might get it back to its owner??..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-11 23:36:46	@LatitudeFest I have found someone's ticket for the weekend..is there anyway you could help trace it back to its owner?..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-11 19:38:12	Well I needed that lie in but now feel a bit disorientated from extra sleep..a quiet day planned..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-11 03:08:46	@SuzeLikes excellent!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-11 02:04:23	@SuzeLikes Happy Birthday!!!..hope you're having a lovely day..x
274535898	act1175	2015-07-11 02:02:18	Another very busy day at work and inside I'm happy the week is finished but my body is too tired to do anything more than laze this evening.
274535898	act1175	2015-07-10 03:41:30	Finally home..not a happy lady so going to have a bath and eat something then go to bed..today can't be over quick enough for me!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-10 03:01:42	@Lesism made me smile on an otherwise hellish day..thank you!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-10 02:53:27	Whoever decided to shut the streets in the City of London for a running event on the same evening as a tube strike wants sacking!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-10 01:51:08	Then had to wait an hour just to get on a bus so no idea what time I'll be home..very tempted to just scream and see what happens!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-10 01:49:47	In a really bad mood after a horrible day at work, too busy on not enough sleep and people in general just annoying me..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-09 21:05:47	Took me two and a half hours to get to work and I've been busy ever since I got in so now a well deserved lunch break!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-09 04:06:59	@jadiepye happy birthday!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-09 03:42:02	Late home and not long till I have to go to bed..very early start because of tube strike..will be a long day tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-08 01:33:02	Lots of small incidents throughout the day making it quite a stressful one..very glad to be home as I feel shattered..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-08 01:26:30	@FionaArt I find them tricky too, sending best wishes..x
274535898	act1175	2015-07-07 01:44:51	Work wasn't very busy so the day dragged on and on..tea and some old New Tricks this evening..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-06 02:54:07	Long chat with my sponsor has helped..so has a hot bath and some comfort food..getting ready for bed now, another full week of work ahead..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-06 01:01:08	A true test of sobriety day..before I would have drank with the first feeling so subsequent ones were numbed..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-06 00:59:57	Having one of those days where every feeling seems amplified, mostly bad thoughts causing bad feelings but painful to sit with none the less
274535898	act1175	2015-07-05 20:46:17	A morning of housework and laundry..now off to do food shopping..a busy Sunday this week!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-05 02:37:16	I've had a really lovely day, there was music, a funfair and lots of stalls to browse..loads of fun and got plenty of sun..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-04 18:02:51	Heading out to meet some work friends to go to a festival where one of our volunteers is singing..should be a good day!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-04 05:21:32	Probably not a good idea to eat an apricot danish pastry just before bed but it was delicious!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-04 02:36:32	@recovered2006 hang in there, this too shall pass..keep reaching out..x
274535898	act1175	2015-07-04 02:27:50	@capwell6 thank you, I really am!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-04 01:59:00	Feet up, telly on and tea in hand, I'm settling down for the evening..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-04 01:57:17	Been a long week..this working full time lark is exhausting..only one more week to go then back to normal hours..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-03 21:17:05	@_ck_supergirl that just made me laugh on my lunchbreak!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-03 14:13:30	Barely slept despite tiredness, bad dreams so kept waking with a start..coffee please...
274535898	act1175	2015-07-03 04:36:39	Beyond tired tonight so falling into bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-02 18:16:07	Having left my phone at work, again, it's been nice having ten minutes in the garden catching up..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-01 03:38:44	Bit dazed this evening, can't really concentrate on anything so watching mindless t.v with tea and toast before bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-07-01 01:46:14	Very glad to be at the front desk today, it's the only place in the building with air conditioning!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-30 04:34:45	@IanBaxter55 @jadiepye @columbophile that was my first one too!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-30 03:57:19	@jadiepye too late for me on a work night but enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-30 02:24:56	First day covering the front desk done, a lot more tiring but it's where I started in the organisation so was like old times!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-29 03:40:09	And I have a busy two weeks coming up working every day which won't help either..anyway for now some self care, hot bath first..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-29 03:38:49	Often for me small shifts, but all over the place, can be the beginning of a period of elevated moods..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-29 03:35:33	Feeling low this evening with some anxiety too..it's been a week of subtle mood changes and that unsettles me a bit..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-29 00:37:52	We've just finished No Offence..fantastic drama, already looking forward to more next year!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-28 18:59:08	Lazy day here..my son is catching up with telly he's missed and I'm reading..a perfect Sunday so far..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-27 22:50:29	Meeting was just what I needed!!..head is quieter and anxiety is easing up..also couple of book recommendations from a friend..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-27 18:18:51	Not been to a meeting for ages so heading out to one now..anxiety levels are still raised but not as bad as have been recently..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-27 01:25:19	@BipolarBlogger Excellent!!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-06-27 00:32:01	Well I did my chores and although it was highly uncomfortable I am glad I went..now time to curl up with tea and my book..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-26 21:43:35	Am going out despite anxiety..feeling the fear but doing it anyway..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-26 20:00:25	Spent the morning in bed reading and still feeling anxious whenever I think about going out..not sure what's going on but I don't like it..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-26 03:15:32	@BeckyGetsSober good to see you!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-26 02:21:38	@SuzeLikes ooh lovely..hope you have a fab time!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-26 02:16:44	@SuzeLikes where are you off to?..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-26 01:59:43	Had a bit of a doze but it was fitful..feel agitated and restless..would quite like today to be over soon..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-25 23:33:47	@Yah_Reed that's true!..thanks..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-25 22:39:24	I changed plans and just made it to local shop and back..anxiety sky high so taking myself to bed to see if reading will help..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-25 21:15:13	Suddenly really anxious at the idea of going out..only a few chores to do but finding it hard to leave the house..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-25 18:50:25	Blissful lie in and have had coffee in bed..ready to start the day now..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-25 03:12:26	An evening of catching up with Vicious..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-25 01:44:09	@realpigeon definitely, got a night out tomorrow planned!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-25 00:49:55	From work to the hospital..the cells from the biopsy are benign and the lymph node should go down with time..phew, big relief!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-24 00:30:54	The meeting went well and it was close to home so already in trackies with tea and biscuits..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-23 19:15:27	On the plus side my back pain is bearable today, still twinges but nothing like it was yesterday..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-23 19:10:30	No internet again at work so I have nothing to do..am pleased I'm leaving for a off site meeting soon..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-23 03:19:50	It's only four days since I did the injection for my back so it must be really inflamed to be hurting so soon..hot bath time..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-23 03:18:11	@_ck_supergirl am doing, hot bath then bed with hot water bottle planned..x
274535898	act1175	2015-06-23 03:17:34	@d3sk thank you!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-23 02:30:42	Long day and half of it with no internet again!..my back has been really painful so very glad to be home with heat pad on it..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-22 03:59:56	I'm sure it will take me awhile to get familiar with all it does but for now I'm really happy I did it and all by myself too!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-22 03:46:10	All done!!..new t.v set up and working.. very pleased..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-22 02:06:28	My neighbour is still not free so I'm sat watching old t.v and looking at instructions that look complicated..tempted to put off till tom..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-21 23:28:55	It could go the other way and I won't have a single idea what I'm doing but for now I'm being positive..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-21 23:28:15	Back home so into trackies and waiting for my neighbour to come help get t.v out of the box..after that I should be fine but let's see..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-21 20:45:43	A morning of housework and catch up chats with family..now heading out for a walk by the river before facing food shopping..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-21 04:55:38	Ready for bed by 10pm on a Saturday night..I really know how to live it up!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-21 00:35:19	Delivery finally here but I feel exhausted so I'm not setting it up tonight..going to curl up on sofa and have last night with old t.v..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-20 23:03:53	Having seen the traffic nearby, due to the demonstration in last retweet, I'm not surprised delivery isn't here!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-20 22:20:11	I'm so hungry I'm going to have to risk going out for 15 mins..will leave my number on the door and hope they'll wait for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-20 20:43:44	Done as much space prep as I can and now I'm bored of being indoors and hungry with no food in the house..hurry up delivery!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-20 19:28:46	Waiting for my new t.v to be delivered, could be anytime up till 5pm so I'm clearing space for it with lots of coffee breaks!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-20 06:56:21	@BipolarBlogger oh of course, I had pictured you doing it!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-20 06:54:20	Had a relaxing evening listening to music and chatting..was nice..tired now though so tea and toast before bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-20 01:57:39	@BipolarBlogger just followed wedding account..can't wait to watch the day via Twitter!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-19 22:46:21	Back home and noticeably hotter in London..time for a cup of tea before heading out to meet a friend..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-19 15:47:25	Beautiful morning here so coffee in the garden..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-19 05:24:51	@d3sk @jadiepye definitely!!
274535898	act1175	2015-06-19 05:21:58	@jadiepye @d3sk aww I'm away from home so can't make it..enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-19 01:29:54	Have travelled to my sister's house and spent the afternoon in the garden..lovely to get some sun!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-18 18:04:45	Had a lovely day off lie in and have been reading in bed but time to get ready and start the day!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-18 04:47:08	@queer_potato @oxymoronic82 fantastic news!!..wish I could make it, can't wait to see pics..and a big hug to you all..x
274535898	act1175	2015-06-18 00:58:26	We had no internet all day so spent a lot of time in the garden before a meeting all afternoon..but home by 6pm is lovely!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-17 03:51:35	Too tired to cook so it's peanut butter on toast for dinner..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-17 02:57:47	Finally home..half day training, then to an off site meeting, back for another meeting before leaving for a nurse appointment..tired feet!!.
274535898	act1175	2015-06-16 05:30:57	I get an extra hour in bed tomorrow because I have a training day so off to bed with a new Simon Brett book..a treat!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-16 02:42:26	Long day today because I wasn't busy so the day just dragged on..but got extra time with the cats so all good..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-15 00:04:32	Only walked to library and back yet I feel exhausted..too many hours on my feet yesterday..time for tea and feet up!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-14 19:53:02	@SuzeLikes my mum got me the same book for my birthday!..enjoy..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-14 17:43:40	We were both so tired yesterday but my boy is up and out with a friend already..I meanwhile am in pyjamas, drinking coffee and reading..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-14 02:01:19	It took hours of indecision but I finally chose a Samsung smart t.v, to be delivered next week..rest of shopping now done so it's food time!
274535898	act1175	2015-06-14 01:56:43	@marksandspencer great, thank you!
274535898	act1175	2015-06-13 21:05:54	@marksandspencer hi, I ordered something online and had it delivered to a store, want to return but does it have to be at same store?
274535898	act1175	2015-06-13 19:27:37	Heading to the dreaded Oxford St but am buying a new television so excited about that..not so much about the clothes shopping for my son!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-13 07:26:44	Late for me but finally bedtime..well, to bed with a book, sleep might still be a while yet..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-13 04:22:23	Now going to settle down with my boy and watch some Monk..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-13 04:21:40	But above all I feel a huge sense of gratitude for my life today..my actions & behaviours hurt people before and I'm not like that today..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-13 04:19:02	Got lots of chores and errands done then met a friend for a chat..was heartfelt and really interesting, has given me stuff to think about..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-12 19:13:43	Lazy morning of coffee and reading in bed..better get on with chores now though otherwise I'll read all day..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-12 04:36:47	Lovely afternoon in the park then went to meet people from work and we all went for a drink..was a really nice time..40 is okay so far!!..

274535898	act1175	2015-06-11 03:59:59	Am having a self care evening..comfort food, hot bubble bath and mindless t.v..feels well deserved..my last night of being in my thirties!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-11 01:13:36	Met my best friend as she wanted to give me a birthday present which was lovely but am done in now..feel fragile so time to curl up on sofa.
274535898	act1175	2015-06-11 01:12:10	@nikimummy13 much appreciated..x
274535898	act1175	2015-06-10 22:28:13	@KLENandSOBR @beatitude_road that counts for a lot and means loads to me..thank you..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-10 22:10:31	Just had a scan and biopsy done on my swollen lymph nodes..now feel nauseated and emotional..weeping on a bus..:-(
274535898	act1175	2015-06-10 04:15:39	Heading in for an early night..already looking forward to a lie in the day after!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-10 02:05:45	A much better day, calmer, so I got more done..now settling down with some CSI and tea..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-09 04:23:40	Bath helped a bit and now meds are kicking in so bedtime..today has felt really short yet I feel I've been awake for far too long..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-09 03:13:58	Knowing I want to just get to bed is making me really anxious..hoping bath will help the pounding heartbeat..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-09 02:34:52	Busy, busy day on not much sleep so feel shattered..plan is eat, bath and bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-08 04:40:39	@BipolarBlogger oh goodness you'll need rest for all that!!..hope it goes as smoothly as possible..x
274535898	act1175	2015-06-08 03:49:24	@LithiumLibGirl it really was!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-08 03:32:15	@littlerich007 it was delicious, and we had one of those each!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-08 03:10:29	@Andy_15052012 Thanks Andy!!..and I certainly hope so, I am looking forward to what's to come..

274535898	act1175	2015-06-07 20:52:23	Back home and starting to get ready for my birthday tea..anxiety still there but am managing it okay so far..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-07 18:18:37	Out with a friend having coffee, am anxious about this afternoon so it's helping to talk that through with someone outside the family..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-07 04:01:56	Sorry not to make #columbotv ..busy trying things on for tomorrows afternoon tea..out in the morning so have to do tonight..enjoy everyone!!.
274535898	act1175	2015-06-07 02:07:47	Finally home and I'm exhausted..got all I needed to though plus a new outfit for myself..now I need trackies on and feet up!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-06 22:10:16	Heading back out..as well as my birthday this week, it's also one of my sister's and my dad's so off present shopping..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-06 19:07:50	A bit of a lie in then straight to the gym..that done it's time for housework..well maybe a break for some coffee first..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-06 07:08:05	Lazy night in front of the t.v..now bedtime with no alarm set..it's the simple things that make me happy..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-06 04:13:22	Back home..tea in hand and cat on lap..all is well..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-06 01:28:23	Got some afternoon sun and now heading home..recently discovered Harlan Coben so am racing through one of his books..a good day..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-05 20:40:25	Spent the morning in the garden but the weather has turned to stormy so guess it's lunch time!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-05 16:38:55	Woke to the sound of birds and the sun shining..a good start to the day..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-05 00:18:31	Safely here and still warm enough to sit outside, so off to the garden with my book..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-04 19:32:26	Feel a bit more glam with new colour and cut!..now packing to go to my sister's house..looking forward to sitting in the garden in the sun..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-04 16:12:37	Woke up late so rushing to a hair appointment feeling very dishevelled..hopefully the opposite will be true after!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-04 03:38:19	Long day and had to stay late to finish up..it's what I hate about being part time is having to handover each week for days I'm not there..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-03 03:44:20	My voice is definitely worse on the days I work but not sure what to do about that..my job involves talking!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-03 03:43:17	Busy morning then an afternoon of training..got home and straight into long chat with my sister, nice to have a catch up but now no voice..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-02 04:09:39	I didn't realize just how much I need my glasses..can feel my eyes straining to watch screens so figure I'll stop!..night..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-02 02:39:36	@SuzeLikes pretty!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-02 02:14:29	@_ck_supergirl @RJ_Hinton you're both doing an excellent job!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-02 01:30:02	Work busy but good..stupidly forgot my glasses though so it's going to be hard watching telly or reading..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-02 01:28:10	@_ck_supergirl between you and @RJ_Hinton it's like having personal chefs on Twitter, informing us of what not to eat!..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-01 05:06:51	All ready for the week ahead, bedtime now with herbal tea and my book..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-01 01:40:42	@LithiumLibGirl sending *hugs*..x
274535898	act1175	2015-06-01 00:33:54	I'm very grateful to be making it to 40, as I so nearly didn't, and I love that my family are thinking of me, I just find occasions hard..
274535898	act1175	2015-06-01 00:32:09	Bit of a mood crash, my family are making a fuss for my 40th and I'm beginning to dread it all..I just hate being the center of attention..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-31 21:43:23	Phone crashed again last night..another trip to Oxford Street and it's working again..gutted to have missed #columbotv though..:-(
274535898	act1175	2015-05-31 01:14:50	@_ck_supergirl happy birthday Libby!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-30 22:42:14	Managed to go to the library and do some food shopping but my enthusiasm ended there so back home..time for trackies and more reading..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-30 20:06:17	I've got loads of chores and errands to do yet am still in my dressing gown reading..motivation levels very low..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-30 18:30:34	Saturday morning in bed with coffee and a book..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-30 03:19:24	@jadiepye @mathonwy @floweroflondon @djellicon @emmamheard @realpigeon Yeh!!..I can make it this time..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-30 01:52:04	A day of paperwork but have completely caught up so it felt good leaving, knowing I'd be starting afresh on Monday..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-29 01:58:22	Home now, knackered, so feet up with cup of tea much needed..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-29 01:57:18	Work was so busy, I barely sat down all day..meeting with clients and on assessment duty means I have a lot of paperwork to finish tom..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-28 03:46:17	Back to work tomorrow, with all the things I've had to do it doesn't feel like I've had a week off..never mind, at least I enjoy my job!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-28 02:36:37	@LithiumLibGirl thanks, yes it's unsettling me a bit and I have a 2 week wait till tests so going to use a lot of distraction techniques!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-05-28 01:23:00	I feel reassured that it's not something serious, that they know of yet..obviously need to wait for the next set of tests though..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-28 01:21:40	He also discovered I have a 2cm hole in my septum from my past cocaine use that I had no idea about..could be contributing but not sure..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-28 01:20:37	Dr couldn't find any immediate reason for my hoarse voice, swollen lymph nodes need further tests as show infection somewhere..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-27 21:22:31	I feel really anxious and got here too early so now a wait ahead of me as well..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-27 21:21:33	Hospitals don't usually bother me as I have spent so much time in them but different hospital and not knowing what's wrong is unsettling me.
274535898	act1175	2015-05-27 19:10:35	Not looking forward to a camera going down my throat but hopefully I'll have some explanation for it all by the end of the day.. .
274535898	act1175	2015-05-27 19:09:13	Had a much needed lie in and coffee has done it's job nicely..getting ready for an appointment with specialist about ongoing laryngitis..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-27 03:46:10	Shouldn't have napped, have somehow ended up more tired..time for hot bath and back in to dressing gown..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-26 23:39:34	Back home and that's me done for the day..in dire need of feet up and sweet tea with some mindless t.v..just soooo tired..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-26 22:53:53	@BipolarBlogger congratulations!!..x x
274535898	act1175	2015-05-26 22:38:38	Huge taxi demonstration has brought London to a standstill..amazing sight!! pic.twitter.com/F0HFesPI4h
274535898	act1175	2015-05-26 21:35:08	Realized I have to collect a prescription so have grudgingly got dressed..feel totally dazed from tiredness so going to take it slowly..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-26 19:08:15	My son was up and out early to see friends but I'm still in my dressing gown, drinking coffee and reading..lazy day for me today..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-26 02:40:24	We're a very odd mix when all together and I find that constant talking and socialising quite hard so it drains me..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-26 02:38:41	Out early to meet various family at train stations then lunch at my uncle's for his 80th birthday..was all very nice but tiring too..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-25 05:30:50	We discussed apostrophes and the misuse of less and fewer..may sound boring but it was very funny by the end..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-25 05:25:43	Cheered up considerably and it was actually a really nice evening..lovely dinner and my sister liked her pressies so all good!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-24 23:29:22	Heading off to my mum's house to have a birthday dinner for my sister..not in a great mood, a bit grumpy but I will try not to show it..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-24 21:14:14	I hate housework..that is all..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-24 04:48:35	I'm not watching #Eurovision so therefore Twitter makes no sense at all to me right now..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-24 04:17:08	Nando's has been eaten so both stuffed..now going to catch up with Empire..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-24 01:17:51	We spent the whole afternoon shopping for birthdays and then food..while I'm shattered and need tea he's off out to see friends!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-23 18:44:13	A lazy morning here, my son isn't even up yet!..so I'm having coffee and reading a new book..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-23 04:33:32	@_ck_supergirl I am thanks, all good!..x x
274535898	act1175	2015-05-23 04:10:42	Couple of tonic waters for me before collecting my boy for half term..now we're continuing with Monk..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-23 04:08:39	Away day was really good, nice to spend time as a team out of the centre..treated to lunch out as well then of course the pub after..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-23 04:06:05	@_ck_supergirl that looks fabulous!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-22 14:55:55	Morning!..I've got a work away day at a posh hotel today..quite looking forward to it!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-22 01:50:58	@SuzeLikes enjoy!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-22 00:24:38	Now it's time for tea and to catch up with No Offence..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-22 00:23:09	Busy day, shopping for upcoming birthdays, dropped in to see a friend at work and then on my way home my best friend texted so we met too..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-21 04:06:37	Lovely hot bath with a cocoa butter bomb in it..didn't want to get out!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-20 23:39:56	Finished work at lunchtime to get to an appointment but now home before 5pm..how lovely, I can have a proper evening..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-20 02:05:13	A productive day but still a lot to do in preparing handover, as after tomorrow morning I'm off for a week..but now it's tea time!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-19 03:09:59	Just so cute!!.. https:// twitter.com/Fascinatingpic s/status/600376371114815488 …
274535898	act1175	2015-05-19 01:59:41	A busy day but made good progress with a couple of clients so all good..my back is much better so pain free too!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-18 02:18:06	Still feeling much more alert with mood steady which is lovely..small voice wondering how long it will last but mostly enjoying it!!
274535898	act1175	2015-05-18 02:15:37	Tried to have a walk but my back still hurting too much for it to be enjoyable so have settled for sofa and t.v instead..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-17 22:42:20	@nikimummy13 okay, remind me!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-17 21:23:38	@nikimummy13 well done!!..must have missed this, can I still sponsor you?..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-17 20:21:57	And it cost me nothing except a trip to Oxford Street..and while there I got some new jeans and Converse so wasn't a bad trip at all!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-17 20:19:11	My phone completely stopped working last night and I felt very lost!!..but thanks to the Geek Squad it's all working again..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-16 23:38:11	There's a fly in the flat and the cat just can't manage to catch it but won't give up..free entertainment..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-16 22:41:40	Was up and out early to a meeting then lunch with my sponsor..not seen her in ages so it was great to catch up in person..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-16 05:48:58	@Andy_15052012 congrats Andy!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-16 01:13:21	A much quieter, calmer day which was much needed, so I managed to get on with some casework..and home with feet up by 6pm!!..lovely..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-15 03:01:15	Am back to a 'cut and paste' routine, work, eat, sleep and repeat..never mind, my mood is still positive and it's nearly the weekend..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-14 22:14:41	And throughout it all my AS is playing up so I'm in constant pain..just grabbing a 10 minute break which feels sorely needed..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-14 22:12:21	It's all being dealt with quickly and efficiently but it does change the atmosphere for staff and clients alike..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-14 22:07:02	Another hectic day here, incidents, police and paperwork with a general overall feeling of unrest so we're all on high alert..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-14 02:11:16	What a day!!..we had multiple incidents almost one after the other..then of course all the paperwork that goes with them..very tired..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-13 04:27:58	@Lesism I'm so pleased for you that you have them!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-13 01:17:44	Ironing for the week done as it's back to work tomorrow..now though it's tea and biscuits time, with some telly..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-12 22:15:17	Sitting in the sun reading..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-12 15:25:39	Whatever is happening I'm going with it!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-12 15:24:40	Morning!..didn't sleep very well but feel surprisingly focused and ready for the day despite that..have I turned some kind of corner??..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-12 04:23:56	Have had a really good day..nothing amazing has happened but am feeling really good in myself and that makes it a great day..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-11 23:07:46	Feeling incredibly brighter and clearer in my head than I have done for some time..little things are falling into place and it feels good..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-11 17:41:38	Ooh it's nice waking late on a Monday..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-11 17:40:52	@jennyeclair yep you've done it!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-11 05:33:11	Just remembered as I got into bed that I'm not working until Wednesday this week..so no alarm set on a Sunday night..bliss!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-11 02:43:48	@BimSooz Happy Birthday!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-11 00:35:56	And having a plan makes me feel better, now I just have to stick to it!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-11 00:35:27	Nothing major, just a couple of things I've been thinking about recently..I have a plan now as to how I'm going to tackle them..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-11 00:33:23	Had a really lovely walk..dodn't take my phone so concentrated on what was around me..cleared my head and made a few decisions..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-10 19:12:33	Feeling a bit brighter today..have had breakfast in bed and now going to do the housework before having a walk..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-10 05:11:25	So I continue to do nothing about it which makes me feel worse, and too much time in my own head is never a good thing..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-10 05:10:22	Couple of hours home alone and I begin to feel isolated..there is one person I really want to reach out to but am scared of response..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-10 00:55:51	Had a lovely afternoon and meeting was great..just not getting to enough of them but today was a start..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-09 19:14:02	A Saturday morning of coffee and reading in bed..now getting ready to meet a friend for lunch and a meeting..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-09 01:49:28	@Fionaok same here..can't believe I still have the heating on in May!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-08 23:57:50	Just feel a bit disconnected, like I'm not really present..can often mean, for me, the beginning of a low episode so must keep track of it..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-08 23:55:35	Had a good day, the training was interesting though my ability to retain information wasn't very good today..thankfully we got handouts!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-08 16:05:11	@BipolarBlogger exactly how I feel!!..closest I got was, oh for gods sake..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-08 02:35:26	I usually stay up for elections but on training tomorrow so going to have to wait till morning..no idea what I'm going to wake up to!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-07 22:20:01	Treated myself to new pyjamas and slippers..I love new nightwear!!..now heading home for tea and feet up..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-07 19:18:39	Hospital appointment done and all is well with Crohns still in remission..now off shopping, feel the need for some retail therapy..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-07 03:03:46	Phew another long day and just one day off then training on Friday..still learning every day and enjoying it too..but it is tiring..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-06 14:57:58	Aaarrggghhh I've woken late..cue mad rush to get ready!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-06 05:09:44	And to bed..falling in tonight..zzzzz..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-06 02:38:02	Straight from work into an hour long chat with my sister..all good but I feel talked out now!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-05 20:44:02	Busy day so far and an afternoon of meetings ahead..even so I feel better being back at work and doing something..and anxiety is down..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-05 04:06:05	Early night for me..alarm will be a bit of a shock in the morning!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-05 02:19:32	Feel a bit anxious about going back to work tomorrow, was barely there last week and it seems like ages ago..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-04 23:33:44	@_ck_supergirl Happy Birthday lovely!!..hope you're having a great day..x
274535898	act1175	2015-05-04 20:36:47	@surelybutslowly happy 4th birthday!!..congratulations..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-04 20:15:38	Having a day of reading on the balcony..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-04 00:34:34	Had a nice walk and met a friend for coffee..always feel better after a good chat..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-03 20:56:09	Housework done and the rain has cleared so off for a walk to the library and to do some shopping..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-03 02:33:53	And..if you don't want your future to look the same as your past, you MUST change the present.. I needed to hear both..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-03 02:33:03	Two little gems of wisdom from my sponsor..if you don't go to meetings you, you don't hear what happens to people who don't go to meetings..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-03 01:27:01	@JourneyToPeace_ thank you, will be ordering that!!..really suits you..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-03 01:17:02	@JourneyToPeace_ ooh what lipstick is that?..love the colour!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-02 23:50:44	Another lazy day but at least now it's the weekend so feels acceptable..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-02 02:53:35	Was nice getting out, went to see Fast and Furious 7, enjoyed it and was a fitting tribute to Paul Walker..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-01 18:23:51	Yeh!..first night of unbroken sleep in a week..feel rested though mood still a lttle low..hope going out today for a walk with him helps..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-01 02:20:00	Noticing my mood dropping a little, accumulated tiredness and lazy days with no exercise at all not helping..
274535898	act1175	2015-05-01 00:31:43	When I eventually made it to the shop, winning £25 on the lottery made it a happier experience!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-30 22:45:09	Second day of not going out and I feel anxious about having to go to local shop..but we need some stuff so going to have to face it..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-30 18:56:39	My boy seems on the mend, no fever last night though still waking in pain..another quiet day for us ahead..am getting lots of reading done!.
274535898	act1175	2015-04-29 23:04:06	@Fionaok lovely picture!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-29 19:54:39	Another bad nights sleep so we both slept late..think he's improved though, fever seems to have broken..a quiet day ahead with naps I think!
274535898	act1175	2015-04-29 03:37:27	@LithiumLibGirl well done!!..you've worked hard for that..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-28 22:09:02	Now she has gone and he's fast asleep so going to try and nap myself or at least lie down for a bit..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-28 22:08:10	Came home to find my mum and son watching Black Books, can't remember the last time I heard my mum laugh out loud..was lovely to see!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-28 14:50:22	Another broken nights sleep so feel shattered..mum covering me half day so getting coffee in me to be able to function at work..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-28 02:52:27	So at least now he has antibiotics but he'll be off all week..only just sitting down now..hate seeing him unwell so hope they kick in soon..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-28 02:51:07	Tired at work so not much done then mum called to say his fever was 39.4 so I raced home and got him to g.p in a cab..it's tonsillitis..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-27 15:41:52	My poor boy is still unwell, fever up again in the night so I'm staying home till my mum can get here then I'll head into work..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-26 20:36:46	@BipolarBlogger Happy Birthday!!!!!..x x
274535898	act1175	2015-04-26 20:03:16	Lazy day here, my son not moved from the sofa, with his fever going up and down he feels awful..paying him lots of attention..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-26 05:40:35	Thanks for messages #Columbotv family..I'm there in spirit..enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-26 05:09:07	Sorry to be missing #Columbotv again..poorly son to take care of so it's his choice of t.v..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-26 05:08:15	@nikimummy13 ha ha, we've done some of that!!..poor thing has a fever so early night for both of us as he may be up in the night..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-26 00:15:25	My son came home early feeling poorly so he's curled up on sofa watching telly while I read..no cinema for us tonight..:-(
274535898	act1175	2015-04-25 22:03:38	Laundry and some housework done so treating myself to a nap..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-25 19:30:31	My son was up and out early so didn't get as much rest as I wanted or needed..but I can have a lazy day till we go to the cinema later..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-25 06:04:49	Ready for sleep in my own bed..hoping for a good nights rest and a better day tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-25 03:22:51	I've said it before but so true that tea tastes best when at home..I make the same tea at my sisters but never as nice..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-25 03:21:11	Annnd I'm home..greeted by the cat and my boy here too..feel better for being back, just need to be around my own stuff when feeling low..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-24 23:01:21	But seeing as I can't, train it is..will read and distract myself with outside scenery..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-24 23:00:22	Took me ages to get myself ready, mostly building up strength forvthe train..would love to be able to teleport myself and avoid people..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-24 20:12:47	Time to get up and get ready to go home..don't want to face a journey today but I really want to be at home so hoping that will get me thru.
274535898	act1175	2015-04-24 17:09:04	Dragged myself out of bed as I'm hungry but so wanted to stay there..coffee and croissants then I may go back to bed to read..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-24 05:29:59	Taking my book and hot chocolate to bed..feeling low and just want to sleep now..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-24 04:44:04	@Ghoulgirl happy birthday lovely lady!!!..hope it's a good one for you..x x
274535898	act1175	2015-04-24 03:28:19	My mood has plummeted, suddely feel very dark and homesick and filled with anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-24 01:50:59	Sat in the garden as soon as I got here and it was lovely to catch some rays..now it's a bit chilly so teatime..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-23 18:17:25	Late to stir but really needed the sleep..now coffee and readings before getting ready to head to my sisters..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-23 03:41:55	Got home and realized I'd left my phone at work so had to travel all the way there and back again..exhausted now but my working week done!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-22 04:13:58	@BipolarBlogger going to print mine tomorrow, really like the choice..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-22 03:42:14	@LithiumLibGirl yep carbs and protein, followed by cereal for some vitamins..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-22 02:37:08	Late home again after another busy day..all good for my learning but am tired..no energy to cook so it's peanut butter on toast for dinner..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-21 03:05:38	@SuzeLikes oh yes of course, well I hope you manage it so something good can come out of your recent ill health..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-21 02:48:03	@SuzeLikes yeh!..I'm aiming to stop altogether by my birthday in June, have you set a date at all?..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-21 02:29:32	@SuzeLikes I haven't totally quit yet but have reduced how many by using an electric cigarette..down to about 5 a day from 25!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-21 02:11:47	It should clear in time..made it a long day though so happy to be home with a well deserved cup of tea..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-21 02:10:00	But I saw g.p after work and chest xray is totally clear, which is amazing after years of smoking, so it's a nasty type of laryngitis..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-21 02:08:54	Busy day working with a client with multiple agencies involved so a lot of talking..which means I have no voice again..very tiresome now..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-20 03:58:19	Time for bed with fresh sheets to look forward to..yeh!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-20 02:39:54	@SuzeLikes I do those sometimes but usually in the daytime as a type of meditation..yours are pretty..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-20 02:29:45	All ready for bed but feels too early even for me..bit of mindless telly and online games needed..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-19 23:13:52	Got my writing done and quite pleased with it..also finished all the ironing so all that's left to do is drink tea and eat biscuits..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-19 19:44:25	@SuzeLikes thank you, hope you enjoyed your twix..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-19 19:37:27	Decided to head out to a coffee shop to write..if I stay at home there's too many distractions..this way I can treat myself to lunch out..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-19 19:35:21	@johna19402 congratulations!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-19 18:22:12	A lovely Sunday morning lie in..coffee and reading in bed now before I attempt to write a blog for work..hoping it doesn't take all day..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-19 01:30:27	Oh I do love a good chat with my sponsor..feel lighter for having shared some stuff that I just couldn't with anyone else..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-18 22:25:27	It's actually not warm enough to sit outside, the sun is deceptive..instead I'm choosing sofa and telly..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-18 18:40:47	Sun is shining and I'm doing housework..figure if I do it now I can then sit on the balcony and finish my book..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-18 02:56:11	@SuzeLikes aww sorry to hear that, get lots of rest and hope you feel better soon..x
274535898	act1175	2015-04-18 01:54:26	Well this is a new one, crossed paws!!.. pic.twitter.com/fUARK13Wkr
274535898	act1175	2015-04-17 22:49:50	Had a short walk, now happily back curled up reading..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-17 19:02:35	Having started a new book, I'm torn between staying in to read and going out to get some sun..just one more chapter and then I'll decide..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-17 05:02:06	Been grazing on snacks all evening and now suddenly feel full which I really dislike..going to bed to read..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-17 03:16:53	@jadiepye I don't have Sky, I did watch them all but would like to rewatch, might order them..glad you're enjoying!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-17 02:40:03	Watching last episodes of Death in Paradise..wish there was more than one series a year..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-16 23:57:36	Appt went fine and straight home to nap..didn't mean to sleep 3 hours but feel much better for it!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-16 14:34:48	Up early on a day off for a hospital appointment..it's definitely going to be an afternoon nap day..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-16 02:34:18	Finally got round to paperwork mid afternoon so only just home..my working week done, it's tea and biscuits in front of the telly time..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-16 02:32:40	Was one of those days, where from the time we opened there was so much going on that we were all busy managing behaviour and incidents..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-15 04:06:29	Couple of good phone calls, catching up with my sister and a friend..evening has flown by so it's bedtime again..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-14 23:48:46	Which is also true but mostly I didn't want the after effects of sobbing in the afternoon..that done, I'm homeward bound..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-14 23:47:25	I was acutely aware of not wanting to cry so kept answers brief and didn't elaborate on anything..he questioned that so said I was tired..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-14 23:46:27	Meeting with psych went okay..was quite brief..settled onto higher dose well and it has helped stabilise mood so not much more to say..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-14 04:00:33	Bedtime already, not keen on early shifts but I do get to finish earlier too..looking on the bright side..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-14 01:24:23	@BipolarBlogger we've been encouraging all our clients to register, lots of homeless people think they can't so their voices are never heard
274535898	act1175	2015-04-14 01:01:15	In all honesty I also just don't want to see him..didn't really click last time and find it causes me to feel awful afterwards..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-14 00:59:04	Not going to be very helpful when I see my psychiatrist tomorrow afternoon do tempted to rebook but will see how it goes..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-14 00:58:23	Nice steady day at work so got a lot done..still losing my voice mid afternoon so spoke to dr today and referred to ENT specialist..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-13 03:13:17	Super early night for me, not caught up on rest at all this weekend..very glad I only have a three day week ahead of me..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-12 23:20:28	Feel better after a nap, almost collapsed from tiredness after shopping..now Law and Order with tea and the cat on my lap..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-12 20:16:59	Finding it really hard to completely wake up today..drowsy and sluggish..but have to get shopping done so off I go..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-12 18:31:45	Lovely sunny Sunday morning and I have housework and laundry to do..going to have coffee on the balcony before I make a start..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-12 04:08:44	Just been very aware of having to sit with feelings which are really uncomfortable and trying to tell myself this too shall pass..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-12 04:06:52	Feeling a bit heavy hearted about my sisters and my mum being together while I'm alone but going to have a bubble bath and early night..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-12 02:54:51	Spent the afternoon with dad who seemed to enjoy the company..nice to see him a bit perkier than last time..now home for tea and feet up..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 18:33:04	@_ck_supergirl thank you lovely..x
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 18:19:01	@_ck_supergirl it is sad, half hour ago I was fine, now I'm in tears..bloody families!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 18:13:18	Instead I'm the one who is going to see our ill dad this afternoon..something very messed up about this..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 18:12:12	Seeing as they both live out of London it would have been nice to see them..trying not to take it personally but very hard not to..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 18:10:27	Just found out both my sisters are invited to my mums for dinner but not me..hurtful?..yes!!..reminder of drinking days when never asked..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 17:41:19	Coffee in bed listening to the rain..nice way to start the weekend..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 16:57:25	@capwell6 thank you!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 16:56:24	@nikimummy13 thank you!!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 04:35:36	Lovely chat with my sponsor, hot bath and I'm ready for bed..no alarm set..yeh!!
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 03:21:51	@MiracleTraining thanks Matt..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 03:21:34	@_ck_supergirl I like that, yes hurray!!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 02:57:47	@jadiepye thank you!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-11 02:54:27	Good news today..got a years contract, promotion and a pay rise..staying at 3 days a week but that works for me..I'm very pleased..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-10 14:55:05	And I have a meeting with my manager today about what I'll be doing after my contract ends at the end of April so fingers crossed please..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-10 14:53:43	Last day of covering annual leave and a lot to get done but then it's the weekend!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-10 04:19:01	After doing two early morning shifts tomorrow will feel like a lie in!..to bed with nighttime tea..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-10 02:34:59	Phew a busy day but all good..home now so tea and biscuits time while I catch up with online games..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-09 20:34:28	Left my phone at work yesterday so felt totally lost last night!!..very pleased to be reunited with it..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-08 14:36:16	Feel exhausted this morning..dragging myself to work though and picking up strong coffee on the way..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-08 02:38:48	Decided to take my meds early and it's starting to help..hot bath now in the hope of unwinding further..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-08 01:30:28	Whilst it can mean I've been productive, now I've left work I'd quite like it to just stop now please..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-08 01:29:21	Think I can safely say I spent the day hypomanic..got loads done but spent more time buzzing about and chatting than I should have..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-08 01:24:46	On an early tomorrow so was fine to go but now still can't unwind..want to go keep going with nowhere to go..and want to talk..to everyone!!
274535898	act1175	2015-04-08 01:23:16	Ooh I got close to being too enthusiastic and chatty this afternoon, to the point of it being noticed, before I decided to leave..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-07 20:29:32	@BipolarBlogger looks lovely!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-07 20:29:11	I'm very go go go today..feels quite nice for now as not had for ages and being productive..not sure how I'll feel it it keeps on though..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-07 14:52:17	Feel really aware and alert..ready to leave for work earlier than I need to so going in to do some paperwork before we open..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-07 01:26:44	Feet up with tea time..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-06 22:41:57	Quiet day pottering around..housework all done and nearly all ready for the week ahead, just the dreaded ironing to do then I can relax..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-06 19:12:31	Another bank holiday lie in..have had loads of rest this weekend..looks like Spring is finally here so going to read on the balcony..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-06 02:15:34	@Fionaok she is amazing!..she knew me in my last months of drinking and has stuck by me ever since..I'm very lucky..Happy Easter to you!..x
274535898	act1175	2015-04-06 01:48:20	....the help of her and her partner to come during the summer and help me to do it..buying the paint for my birthday present..feel blessed..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-06 01:47:11	Spoke to my best friend a while ago about how much I want to redecorate my flat but how overwhelming it feels and she has just offered....
274535898	act1175	2015-04-06 00:39:59	Feel heaps better for having been out..nice to just walk with no chores to do..settling in for an evening of telly now..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-05 22:03:25	Today I am feeling stifled being at home so heading out for a walk by the river..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-05 18:09:24	Happy Easter!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-04 23:27:46	Taking a break from reading to curl up and watch some t.v..sometimes feel stifled when I stay in all day but loving it today..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-04 21:46:03	Am reading The Shock of the Fall which has had me gripped from the start..in between text chats with friends I'm ploughing through it..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-04 19:51:01	Another lazy morning and think today will be a staying in dressing gown day..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-04 05:13:07	Completely lazy evening which has been lovely..off to bed with a new book and hot chocolate..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-04 00:29:36	This makes me happy..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-04 00:29:24	Going to try not talking for the next three days in the hope of getting rid of this laryngitis so I predict lots of reading and t.v ahead..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-04 00:28:22	Really nice afternoon, now as the bank holiday weather predictibly gets ready to rain all weekend I'm hibernating for the rest of it!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-03 20:24:11	Blissful lie in then coffee and finished my book..heading out to meet a friend and go to a much needed meeting..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-03 04:37:29	Had a long busy day and fell asleep when I got home..now I need tea and some toast..soooo looking forward to a lie in tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-02 03:28:47	@rabbitsoup_zola I've got mine!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-02 03:14:28	Phew, another long day but got a lot done..getting really bored with having no voice by the afternoon but long weekend coming up..yeh!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-01 14:29:47	One good thing about coming into work early is getting a seat on the tube..makes it a much nicer journey..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-01 04:13:03	So an early night for me..feeling in a bit of a cycle of work, brief evening, sleep and repeat..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-01 04:07:17	Tomorrow I'm trying going to the gym after work for the first time..am on an early shift so can finish at 4..got to try it sometime..
274535898	act1175	2015-04-01 02:02:50	My workload has increased significantly which is challenging in a good way but also very tiring..only just home and am exhausted!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-31 04:06:58	Today hasn't been special but it's been great when I compare it to yesterday..now into bed at 9 with my book..all is well..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-31 02:02:48	Then we had a nice catch up chat..she saw me at my lowest and always makes a point of telling me how well I've done and how far I've come..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-31 02:00:57	Popped in to try and make a dr appointment after work and luckily was seen by my g.p straight away..laryngitis should clear on it's own..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-31 01:59:51	First day in a slightly different role to cover someones annual leave and I was bored by mid afternoon..but time eventually passed..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-30 14:16:48	Not a great nights sleep but I've woken in a much better mood, thankfully..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-30 04:52:07	Skipped dinner so going to bed..tomorrow has to be better..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-30 04:51:17	@julieclarke884 getting into fresh sheets is one nice thing..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-30 03:34:41	Will be happy when this day ends..it's just been one long foul mood and only just getting home so my whole evening routine running late..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-29 21:32:11	Would quite like to do nothing but I can't..and have to get my son to my mums as well which involves travelling and in no mood to do so..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-29 21:31:04	Not having a good day, woke late then it was an hour later..have housework and ironing to do and I'm in a foul mood, snappy and miserable..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-29 19:42:00	@SuzeLikes sorry I missed your hosting last night, bet it was great..I had time off my phone so completely forgot about it!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-29 02:12:26	Seven hours later and I've successfully updated my phone..now I really need some time off screens..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-28 23:27:34	I desperately need a laptop..trying to back everything up to cloud storage solely using my phone is taking ages..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-28 19:57:34	Trying to clear space on my phone for a software update..tedious and I never really know what I'm doing!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-28 07:21:58	Eyes are closing while watching t.v..definitely bedtime..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-28 06:22:33	@BipolarBlogger there has to be!!..it's such a lovely idea and really nice seeing all the pictures..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-28 06:03:19	@BipolarBlogger I'm sorry to miss this one..don't have a printer at home and a bit tied up with my son..looking forward to next one!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-28 01:18:54	@_ck_supergirl not bad thanks, I have laryngitis so no voice but my son seems to like it..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-27 23:40:06	Nice quiet day reading and popping out when bits of sun came..now getting ready to head home..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-27 23:39:04	@_ck_supergirl glad you're back..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-27 19:06:48	Lovely lie in and it's a beautiful day here so coffee in the garden..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-27 03:38:19	Pizza for dinner and a catch up..though not much talking on my part..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-27 00:47:37	Still have next to no voice but no time this week to see the doctor..it's definitely laryngitis though, that much Google helped me with!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-27 00:45:15	Long wait at the hospital but all is well..then travelled straight to my sisters, so now time to put my feet up..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-26 16:36:23	Up early on a day off and feel a bit dazed but have a hospital appointment to get to..coffee please..then some more..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-26 05:12:54	A headache has kept me off screens this evening..it has been quite nice..now off to bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-26 01:52:28	He has given me an extra days work a week though which is great..feel better for having asked as well..so now hometime..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-26 01:50:21	Met with my manager but he's still waiting to hear if they have the funding for the role so will tell me as soon as he knows..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-25 04:46:00	And change is so hard..might go back to basics and make a weekly schedule again then stick to it..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-25 04:44:52	The evenings seem to fly by..feels like one minute I'm home, next minute it's bedtime..don't really like it but only I can change it..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-25 02:25:29	For now, it's feet up with cup of tea time..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-25 02:16:24	My manager replied and said no problem to meet tomorrow so I'm going to be proactive and just ask what's happening..take it from there..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-24 21:23:55	...if any I'll be filling..I've requested a meeting with my manager but he hasn't replied to that either..hate feeling so uncertain..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-24 21:22:53	Busy, busy day and I still have this underlying anxiety over what I'm doing next month..noone has said anything more about what role...
274535898	act1175	2015-03-24 05:22:51	Falling into bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-24 04:44:17	@DastardlyDeano @richardkhornsey local college/uni?..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-24 02:56:27	@rabbitsoup_zola aww that's lovely, thank you..that is how I will remember her..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-24 02:55:03	I also lost my voice totally mid afternoon so maybe I am just under the weather but it's only a sore throat with no other symptoms of cold..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-24 02:53:57	Bit of a crappy day at work, the work was fine but I felt moody and people were getting on my nerves which is very unlike me..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-24 02:51:40	@rabbitsoup_zola no thanks for letting me know..bit of a shock..she was so very kind..will be missed..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-24 02:33:24	@rabbitsoup_zola oh god when did that happen?..was wondering where she was just over the weekend..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-23 04:35:00	@BipolarBlogger oh that is blissful..enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-23 04:33:38	@_ck_supergirl hope you're okay lovely..come back soon..x x
274535898	act1175	2015-03-23 03:52:37	@LithiumLibGirl ooh yum, enjoy!!..and happy birthday..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-23 03:36:53	I've done nothing all day but I'm really tired..hot bath then bed I think..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-22 23:11:42	@BimSusy ooh my favourite, their raspberry and almond bake..enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-22 23:10:50	It's funny that they've said I need to rest my voice then gone on to have long chats!..going to need a silent evening..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-22 23:09:53	Seems to be a day of family phone calls, one sister and my mum done..now other sister..none of this is helping my voice..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-22 19:06:21	Late start but it is Sunday..coffee time..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-22 03:22:16	@BipolarBlogger mandalas are always good but I also like geometric patterns.. #colourtogether
274535898	act1175	2015-03-22 02:34:20	@BipolarBlogger ooh I like the sound of this!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-22 02:33:19	@blackcat3119 sorry you're hurting..this too shall pass..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-22 00:15:18	Happily back home, going to watch last episode of Mapp and Lucia..with tea of course..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-21 22:11:32	Finally ready to leave the house and as much as I don't want to, off I go shopping..looking forward to being back home before going out!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-21 19:53:18	Lazy morning of coffee and reading in bed..but suppose I better get dressed and do the shopping at some point!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-21 06:25:08	Bed for me..book and night time herbal tea coming with..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-21 05:10:24	I've got a sore throat that has been lingering on..it seems better each day then by the evening it's bad again..lost my voice this evening..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-21 02:31:16	Finally watching Mapp and Lucia and thoroughly enjoying it!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-21 02:18:00	@LithiumLibGirl enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-21 00:54:28	Went to work but didn't have to do a statement after all as they now have video evidence they can use instead so back home for tea..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 23:05:43	Really good meeting, someone celebrating 49 years sober, someone else 24 hours..great atmosphere..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 18:33:48	But for now, coffee....
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 18:33:30	Then I have to go into work to give the police a statement after an incident earlier in the week..so it will be a busy day all round..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 18:32:13	Bit of a late start but well rested..going to a lunchtime meeting today with a friend..it's been too long since I last went to one..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 08:00:43	Time flew by playing games..late to bed for me!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 06:31:52	Cat keeps licking my hair..very odd..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 05:00:43	Well I survived..pleased with the result which is the main thing..now I need food, am really hungry..toast and peanut butter it is!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 02:22:45	Anxiety is right up..off I go to the dreaded hairdresser..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 01:19:35	@RJ_Hinton hope you get well soon..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 01:18:32	@_ck_supergirl @nikimummy13 I have tried that, she just chats away at me!!..last time I read & it was better so going to try that again..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 00:44:57	Going to try tea and mindless t.v and hope pain relief kicks in before hair appointment..in no mood for small talk right now..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-20 00:43:14	Not a very successful nap..woke with a headache and a bad mood..want a bath but know then I won't leave the house..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-19 22:30:22	@sobermommabee yeh congratulations!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-19 22:27:28	Now I'm tired so going to have a snooze before getting hair done..shouldn't have made a late appointment but it was all they had..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-19 22:26:19	Feel good for having made it to the gym and back but felt anxious when there..very self conscious..sure it will pass, it did before..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-19 18:28:25	Nice lie in, now coffee and reading in bed..not much planned for today so a quiet one, until hair appointment this evening..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-19 05:57:27	Ahh bliss..bed with no alarm set..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-19 03:42:33	Tea, toast and cereal..I'm having a breakfast food night..all comfort foods but going to the gym tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-19 01:59:32	and seeing my longest friend in recovery on Saturday so am doing something about it..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-19 01:58:40	for my recovery recently and I miss just being around others who get it!!..made plans to go to a meeting with a friend on Friday...
274535898	act1175	2015-03-19 01:56:44	Bit of a quieter afternoon which was nice, took 15 minutes off to sit in a recovery group which was really helpful..haven't done enough...
274535898	act1175	2015-03-18 21:35:31	Haven't stopped all day..been sooooo busy..well deserved lunch break now..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-18 05:35:22	Irritable and discontent I think best describes my mood..hopefully sleep will help..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-18 05:34:27	Have felt a bit zoned out this evening, barely paying attention to the t.v..might as well go to bed and read..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-18 02:19:38	Whatever the reasons I need to sort it out..when if feels overwhelming I do nothing so need to start back with baby steps..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-18 02:18:16	care habits that I spent a long time building up..really have to turn this around..connected to not going to many meetings?..probably..2/2
274535898	act1175	2015-03-18 02:16:52	Beginning to realize that I'll never get to the gym if I don't do it after work some days..have really let it go, along with other self 1/2
274535898	act1175	2015-03-18 02:14:24	Much better day at work..busy with assessments then a staff meeting so time passed more quickly..now tea and feet up..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 16:02:17	I'm ready to leave 10 minutes early which leaves me wondering what I've forgotten!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 05:54:44	Taking hot chocolate to bed tonight..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 03:45:38	@djellicon @_ck_supergirl @richardkhornsey goodness they're still there!..always liked Karl and Susan, might even give it a watch..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 03:19:39	@djellicon @_ck_supergirl @richardkhornsey I haven't watched it in years so.probably wouldn't recognise anyone!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 03:18:03	@SuzeLikes @richardkhornsey June..eekk..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 03:16:52	@_ck_supergirl @richardkhornsey we can support each other through it!!..supposedly life begins so who knows what's in store for us..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 03:14:46	@SuzeLikes @richardkhornsey yeh!!..that makes me feel better..when is yours?..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 03:05:32	@richardkhornsey no it really doesn't!!..I'll be hitting the dreaded 40 this year so everything is making me feel old..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 03:01:54	@richardkhornsey that makes me feel old, I remember it starting!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 03:01:09	@jenpiedri fantastic!!..congratulations..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 02:46:20	I need to practice patience and acceptance that things will work out as they are meant to, but it is really hard sometimes..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 02:06:52	My contract has been extended till the end of April and I know that's a good sign but a sense of general uneasiness about it I don't like..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-17 02:04:18	Quite a boring day back at work..had nothing to do so time dragged on & still, no idea what they're thinking of offering me causes anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-16 05:04:59	Bed at 9pm, not done that for awhile!..it's lovely..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-16 03:05:04	Think I'm all ready for work tomorrow, time to eat something and unwind for an early night..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-16 01:03:03	And again, truth is, I've not been eating enough..wondering if something I said made her question if I was alright?..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-16 01:01:13	Truth is no I haven't been to enough but really threw me for her to mention it..she also asked about eating but that's not unusual..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-16 01:00:11	Lazy day, long chat with my mum who, very strangely, asked if I was going to enough meetings..something she has never asked before..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-15 20:39:21	pic.twitter.com/eQTNAO1mHA
274535898	act1175	2015-03-15 20:39:02	I always find Mother's Day hard but lovely gift from my boy cheered me up..I am nowhere near marvellous but nice he thinks so!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-15 04:15:41	Really looking forward to going back to work..I've had too much time with nothing to do..boredom lowers my mood..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-15 01:15:32	Food shopping done, treated myself to chicken fajitas for dinner..now I need a heat pad on my back and feet up..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-14 21:51:37	@mycuriousmind that's the bit I dread!!..good luck and hope the end result is worth it!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-14 21:08:36	Wanted to get my hair done but no appointments till Thursday so I guess it's food shopping time..although that involves getting dressed..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-14 19:38:44	Coffee and reading in bed..what weekends were made for..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-14 05:42:15	@anhedonia11 yes you will be okay!..nice to see your face back in my timeline..was restful but a bit boring..glad to be going back..x
274535898	act1175	2015-03-14 05:00:22	Oh god, Twitter has gone and changed again..cue mistakes and favouriting things I didn't mean to!!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-14 04:58:35	@anhedonia11 hello!..good to see you back, sorry you've been through a rough time..hope things improve for you..my back is bad but am ok..x
274535898	act1175	2015-03-14 03:56:29	Now for tea which always tastes better at home!!.. And finally succumbed to emojis..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-14 03:54:17	Back home, done injection for my back and have a heatpad on..much easier to implement self care in my own space..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-13 22:56:21	It's a beautiful day but walking is tough..journey home won't be easy..going to rest now before I set out..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-13 20:20:22	Going to try a slow walk down to the village..have to get my back moving if I want to get home today!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-13 17:59:32	Morning..back still sore but bearable..coffee and croissants to start the day..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-13 06:33:25	And off to bed..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-13 04:29:32	It's been a long time since it hurt this much and I forgot just how bad it can be..so yes, am feeling sorry for myself..but justifiably..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-13 04:26:54	Have definitely triggered my AS..very painful in my lower back, curled up with a hot water bottle and have taken pain relief..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-13 02:14:03	Just leaned into the fridge and back flared with pain..brought tears to my eyes..*hobbles back to sofa*..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-13 01:02:12	Safely at my sisters and curled up with a book and tea..daydreamed the whole journey here..I live a whole different life in my head!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-12 18:04:17	Morning!..it's a lovely bright day and I'm heading to my sisters later for an overnight stay..be nice to sit in the garden..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-12 06:59:39	A helicopter circling is not very helpful when trying to sleep..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-12 05:19:27	@BipolarBlogger oh I'm sorry Charlotte..sending condolences..x
274535898	act1175	2015-03-12 04:32:01	@Sectioned_ my electric cigarette arrived today!..trying it out from tomorrow..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-12 04:27:19	@LithiumLibGirl *hugs*..x
274535898	act1175	2015-03-12 01:55:52	I have noticed that my mood has evened out..a little on the low side but stable..guess meds increase has helped after all..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-12 01:54:34	Walk was good and enjoyed being out..not done very much with my time off work but needed the rest I've managed to get..evening of t.v now..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-11 22:35:10	It's a lovely day so heading out for a walk..clearance can wait and book can come with me in case I stop somewhere along the way..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-11 21:08:53	Partly it's because these drawers have some stuff I need to return to someone and that brings up memories of the past..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-11 21:07:56	Well so far I've opened and looked at drawers I want to clear but then went back to reading..all feels a bit overwhelming..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-11 19:19:11	Really should get on with tasks I set myself but my body says curl up and read..hmmmm..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-11 19:18:01	I was meant to be seeing my dad today but he has cancelled, again..so a whole day free to get on with sorting through clutter..or reading..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-11 05:34:05	Good catch up with my sponsor before she flies to India for two weeks..she is 70 and goes away yearly somewhere new on her own..amazing!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-11 02:43:10	Neither of us get to as many meetings as we used to but we're okay..we've crossed that bridge to normal living..all good!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-11 02:40:55	Only needed a check up after all so minimal expense..yeh!..met a friend for a late lunch which was lovely, been too long since we last met..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-10 20:58:26	Time to head to the dentist, first time since started working so god knows how much it will be!!..will have to go on credit card..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-10 19:38:25	A very late start for me but must have needed the sleep..coffee please..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-10 05:04:19	@julieclarke884 I find that really hard so end up running myself down..heading for a hot bath now though..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-10 04:45:39	Trying not to berate myself for having done next to nothing all day..clearly I need some rest and self care but it feels indulgent..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-10 04:08:34	@GoogleGardener @jadiepye @RJ_Hinton neither is mine!..started and ending the day with tap talk, just never know what will come up here..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-10 01:34:35	After an hour of distracting myself with online games I feel a bit better but exhausted..tea and telly time..Death in Paradise I think..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-10 01:33:02	Really did not enjoy being out at all..one of those days I looked at the floor and avoided all eye contact before scuttling home..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 22:39:04	She said it can take a couple of weeks to get the levels back up so very glad this week is free for me at least..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 22:38:15	Doctor called and my vitamin D levels are very low which probably explains the tiredness I've had..off to pick up a prescription for some..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 22:28:58	@BipolarBlogger sending *hugs*..x
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 21:18:13	@BeckyGetsSober enjoy it!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 20:21:12	@GoogleGardener oh that is strange..maybe it's down to plumbing as opposed to a blanket rule..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 20:14:10	@GoogleGardener what country are you in?..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 20:13:29	@RJ_Hinton @GoogleGardener that is odd!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 19:57:20	@GoogleGardener left..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 19:04:25	Nice lie in, coffee and readings done..now I feel a bit bored..lots of ideas of things I want to do but no energy to do them..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 07:00:47	Falling into bed tonight with the pleasure of no alarm set..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 05:29:30	Feels odd not getting ready for work on a Sunday night..a week of annual leave ahead in which to continue my clearout if I have the energy..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-09 04:16:21	" @SuzeLikes : “ @ThatsOurEarth : Penguin Pair, Antarctica pic.twitter.com/o86YbslYH3 ” Awww!" Just lovely!..

274535898	act1175	2015-03-08 20:24:25	Nice lazy morning and now getting ready to go to my mums..not really in the mood for socialising but needs must..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-08 07:20:38	@bipolarkimmie yeh another fan!!..my son and I are working out way through them..saw them years ago but still ace..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-08 07:10:27	Dinner at Nandos followed by a night of Monk..all nice but I am barely keeping my eyes open..bed soon..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-08 01:53:07	@SuzeLikes how exciting!!..enjoy..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-08 00:17:03	In fairness I have moved twice for cups of tea but she jumps straight back on me when I sit back down..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-08 00:16:17	Have decided to buy mum flowers for her birthday so can get them tom on our way to see her for tea..so I'm reading, still with cat on lap!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-07 20:46:22	Dusting and vacuuming done..sat down and now have the cat on my lap..that's a good reason not to move again right??..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-07 19:23:59	Going to get some housework done while I have some energy then go shopping hopefully before my energy levels crash sometime mid afternoon..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-07 06:15:57	Bedtime!..definitely my favourite time of day recently..have to shop for mums birthday present tomorrow so need as much rest as possible..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-07 06:13:34	@columbovillains @IanBaxter55 my pleasure..great idea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-07 05:05:53	@nofearkat great!!..well done you, hope I can do it..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-07 04:29:47	Just ordered starter electric cigarette kit..feels like the right time to try and stop smoking..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-07 02:19:05	*Good even..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-07 02:18:44	@queer_potato ha ha classic Sophie..say hi for me, she is missed..x
274535898	act1175	2015-03-07 02:14:57	Goid nap but still tired..quiet evening of telly planned..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-06 23:46:27	So now I'm home, it's naptime!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-06 23:46:05	And I do have times where it's better..this is just not one of those times and am sure it's contributing to lack of energy..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-06 23:45:04	Have had 'issues' with food since my teens but it seems as it doesn't fit an eating disorder category, it's down to me to sort out..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-06 23:44:02	Told him about poor eating..his reply "can you not eat more?"..I said a bit more complicated than that and he did apologise for flippancy..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-06 23:42:22	Doctor took blood tests as well so a bit punctured!!..have to have chest x ray too..he's checking thyroid, iron and vitamin D..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-06 18:04:43	Lovely sleep and feel rested, for now at least..coffee and reading before quick stop at hospital for blood tests then g.p appt..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-06 04:09:14	I've barely done anthing today but I'm exhausted..glad I'm seeing doctor tomorrow..bed with hot chocolate for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-06 00:23:21	Ran into a friend so went for coffee and missed the plant stall..never mind..now it's early for me to be with feet up but happily so..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-05 20:38:41	Heading out to buy some new plants for the garden..well window boxes and pots on the balcony but it's my garden!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-05 20:36:52	@JohnnyStep2 that's fab!!..well done..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-05 17:58:53	I'm enjoying a Lawrence Block book I've not read before so my plan is to finish that with maybe a nap thrown in this afternoon..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-05 17:57:20	Dr called and has booked me in to see him tomorrow afternoon..now seeing as it's #WorldBookDay day it would be rude not to read all day!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-05 17:17:10	Now I've called I await a call back so it's coffee time!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-05 17:16:17	And think I need to be honest about how bad my eating is..am fairly sure that accounts for some of how I feel too..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-05 17:15:02	Up earlier than I wanted but need to see g.p..not sure this constant tiredness and breathlessness is meds related so want a check up..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-05 02:49:12	My head hasn't stopped pounding all day but at least now I'm home and my annual leave begins..definitely tea and feet up time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-04 15:22:25	Woke with a pounding headache but it's a new day..painkiller with coffee and hope it kicks in before work..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-04 04:50:49	I feel absolutely exhausted..it's been a long emotional day..falling into bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-04 03:12:24	how I planned but the idea of doing my current role perhaps full time would make me much happier than the role I applied for..life hey!!.:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-04 03:11:01	what it is they can offer me..will get back to me asap..I love this idea and I won't be jobless at the end of the month so not worked out...
274535898	act1175	2015-03-04 03:09:37	said they want to keep me in the organisation in my current role and increase my caseload, they need to look at funding to see exactly...
274535898	act1175	2015-03-04 03:07:47	Well I didn't get the job..they said the interview was good but someone with many years experience got it, quite rightly so..but they...
274535898	act1175	2015-03-03 21:20:16	@nikimummy13 thank you lovely..will know this evening..x
274535898	act1175	2015-03-03 21:19:49	Quite glad I'm at work so at least I'm keeping busy..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-03 21:19:14	Don't feel it went very well, my mind went blank and I forgot to mention a couple of important things but nothing I can do now but wait..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-03 16:30:13	Off I go..just realized I'm also four and a half years sober today..never could have done this when drinking so holding on to that thought..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-03 16:28:59	@individual35837 thank you, am already doing the job in a trainee role..applying for fully trained position..eeekkk!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-03 16:28:09	@julieclarke884 thank you!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-03 16:27:46	@SuzeLikes thank you!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-03 15:35:43	It's interview day and I'm very nervous..trying to tell myself it will all be over soon but need to get through it first..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-03 04:09:39	I've read and revised as much as I can..need to unwind now so hot bath then bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-03 02:35:57	I feel more anxious about knowing the people interviewing me as well..scared I'll freeze and not know anything then still have to see them..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-03 02:34:19	Finally home..anxiety rising over interview tomorrow..it's for a fully trained role so going to have to draw on all I've learnt so far..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-02 21:36:15	Crazily busy morning on my own at the front desk..spilt my coffee everywhere and got very snappy so glad to get out for a lunch break..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-02 02:54:47	@BipolarBlogger oh lovely, sending loads of *hugs*..x x
274535898	act1175	2015-03-02 02:10:01	Can feel a sore throat starting..having lemon and honey tea to soothe it..can't be ill just before an interview!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-02 00:44:38	@julieclarke884 thank you!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-02 00:18:50	Nice walk and then a good catch up with my mum..she wished me luck for interview on Tuesday and said I can only do my best..very true!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-03-01 21:12:54	Feel really tired but it is too nice a day to stay in so going to have a gentle walk by the river..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-01 18:23:11	A lovely bright spring like day..only down side is it shows up the dust so it's housework for me this morning..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-01 05:36:10	Sorry #columbotv family, I can't keep my eyes open..hope you all have a great time, sounds like you're in for a treat!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-01 05:35:08	@jadiepye sorry not to be able to make it, I'm sure it will be great!..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-01 04:08:32	@Lababup can relate to that..*hugs*..
274535898	act1175	2015-03-01 02:15:22	Feel totally zoned out..tea and biscuits in front of the telly but barely able to pay attention..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-28 23:24:10	Judt noticed I hit 6000 tweets and didn't acknowledge it..better make 6001 a good one..oh damn didn't think this through..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-28 20:53:48	But although I feel sedated somewhat, I feel at ease also to just sit and watch the world go by..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-28 20:53:01	Stopped for a coffee and to do some people watching..not done for awhile as I need to feel safe to do..people often scare me..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-28 19:22:21	Have had a quiet morning of reading with coffee..now off for a walk and then food shopping to be done..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-28 07:13:35	Bedtime..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-28 04:47:48	Just given the cat a new catnip mouse..what fun for both of us, she is hilarious!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-28 04:08:32	Not being reviewed till April so have to push on through catching up on rest on my days off..for now though it's tea and telly time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-28 04:07:21	I dozed off again..it's definitely the meds, taking longer to adjust than I've experienced before..maybe need to reduce again..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-28 00:17:38	Good session and then had lunch out..now heading home for a quiet evening..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-27 19:22:11	I'm bored so I'm going to the gym..not the best reason but it gets me there..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-27 17:00:55	Had woken me up so I was a bit snappy on the phone but now I'm just confused why I was being asked..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-27 16:59:54	8am phone call from g.p surgery asking me to explain my medication dosages to a doctor I never see???..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-27 06:01:19	Then I think I went years without being able to follow a book due to alcohol so I guess I'm making up for lost time..and enjoying it!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-27 05:59:12	Moving from sofa to bed, still with book..reading is such a useful distraction for me but sometimes wonder if I read too much?..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-27 03:04:10	Ended up having an accidental nap..surely allowed on a day off..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-26 23:07:28	Had lunch with a friend and went to a meeting together..excellent sharing and a couple newcomers..all good stuff!..now back to reading..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-26 18:17:27	Morning!..slept well and feel rested..coffee and reading in bed to start the day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-26 05:59:54	To bed with my book and no alarm set..so looking forward to a lie in!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-26 05:55:42	@RJ_Hinton ha ha that's brilliant!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-26 03:55:21	Feel wiped out..as soon as I sat and relaxed I didn't want to get back up..it's a nutella on toast for dinner day..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-26 02:32:40	Busy all day then our Internet went down and suddenly none of us could do anything!..so I spent time with the cats until I could leave..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-25 04:06:11	Lovely chat with my sponsor..she's very pleased for me and we're going for tea and cake on Saturday for another step 9 chat..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-25 03:25:58	@_ck_supergirl love it!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-25 02:33:30	Busy day and will have to go in tomorrow after all to finish up..but on the plus side I got shortlisted!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-24 15:54:51	Finding mornings are tough recently, really aware I'm fighting through meds sedation..just need to get through today then a few days off..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-24 04:08:05	Eaten, bathed and ready for bed..lovely..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-24 02:15:43	Very busy day and on my own covering front desk all afternoon so am tired..planning an early night but first tea and a twix..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-23 21:40:59	Spoke with office manager and application is all fine..now I just wait to see if I get shortlisted..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-23 05:26:57	And to bed..only two days at work this week but want to be rested..still feeling a bit sedated in the days so extra sleep needed..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-23 03:42:37	@BimSusy I bet!!..hope the move goes as smoothly as possible..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-23 03:03:40	Tea and Father Brown with the rain lashing outside..perfect Sunday evening..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-23 03:02:31	@BimSusy what heaven for cats!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-22 23:30:47	Have been quite productive doing all my housework and going shopping in the pouring rain..now I need to warm up before facing the ironing..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-22 20:43:39	Spoke to mum who then sent me document in Word as opposed to rtf..it's all fine!!!!!..no need for anymore worry..such a relief..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-22 19:29:38	Would like to get on with housework just as a practical distraction but my son still asleep after we had a late night..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-22 19:28:22	Major anxiety about work tomorrow and whether or not they will accept amended version of application..hard to think of anything else..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-22 06:18:41	End of rant..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-22 06:18:31	....that are a year away and me for being so particular about the application as well as telling me how ill I look which wasn't helpful..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-22 06:17:01	....for error in the first place..wasn't ideal conditions with son resentfully doing revision and mum having a go both at him about exams...
274535898	act1175	2015-02-22 06:15:25	....went straight on to see Selma which we enjoyed but felt plagued by mistake I had made..finally home and still beating myself up....
274535898	act1175	2015-02-22 06:14:21	....early on Monday, edit and reprint then give to the office manager before she gives original one sent to the panel..hope that works....
274535898	act1175	2015-02-22 06:13:02	Long day..managed to finish and send application only to realize after I'd made an error..a lot of stress before thinking I can go in....
274535898	act1175	2015-02-21 19:08:01	Quiet morning coffee before heading to my mums to finish and send application..will be glad when it's done..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-21 08:03:59	Bedtime..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-21 04:56:45	Lovely dinner..now time to settle down and watch Monk..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-21 02:27:22	Time to meet my son for Nandos..becoming a tradition and one I like!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-21 01:46:41	Sounds simple but I can miss the obvious when left in my own head..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-21 01:45:58	I'm worried about getting a job I've not yet applied for..break it down into applying, if shortlisted great, if not make next choice..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-21 01:44:07	Had a lovely nap followed by a good catch up with my sister..she's very good at helping me talk through anxiety and right sizing it!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-20 22:33:36	Went from hospital to a meeting to fit one in..now it's naptime..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-20 19:34:30	@sobermommabee ooh flowers!!..thank you..hope you're well..x
274535898	act1175	2015-02-20 19:11:15	Son is up and out for the day and I'm off to the hospital for blood tests..didn't sleep very well so afternoon nap planned today..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-20 03:35:07	Scrap that my son doesn't want to watch it..recording it so guess I better avoid Twitter for a while..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-20 03:17:39	Haven't watched Eastenders for years but been reading so much about it so going to watch it tonight..will I get hooked again??..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-20 00:57:56	Chores done, time for tea and feet up with the sound of rain outside..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-19 21:33:27	Horrible dark day here but must go food shopping..comfort food will be bought..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-19 19:42:01	Just booked my September holiday..no idea how I'll pay for it but now it's booked I'll find a way!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-19 18:23:10	Blissful lie in..now coffee and reading in bed..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-19 04:25:51	Watching Waiting for God..definitely lasted the test of time!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-19 04:24:00	@Mattjohnsons could put that in your bio..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-19 03:45:24	Trying really hard to accept if it's meant to be, it will be..did much better with this when applying for current post..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-19 03:43:53	And am sure I'll feel embarrassed during my remaining time there if unsuccessful..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-19 03:42:02	This underlying anxiety around the full time job is really uncomfortable..real fear I won't get it now I've decided to go for it..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-19 02:39:01	Have felt exhausted all day..meant to go to mums to finish application but I couldn't do it today..only just home and I need tea..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-18 05:09:12	Feeling very tired..appointments always drain me..one more day of work then some lie ins planned..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-18 02:48:23	@BeckyGetsSober great, thanks!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-18 02:26:54	@BeckyGetsSober do those machines get into the corners?..very tempted to get one myself!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-18 01:47:54	Throw into that mental health issues and no wonder I feel overwhelmed a lot of the time..was reassuring to hear..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-18 01:46:18	He was very good at recognizing that after drinking my entire adult life masking underlying issues it can and will take time to feel stable.
274535898	act1175	2015-02-18 01:43:32	Though no talking therapy until at least 6 months after last lot finished and more likely a year..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-18 01:41:55	Will review in April..he thinks I need more talking therapy as the meds can only treat symptoms and I clearly have had a difficult life..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-18 01:40:32	Straight from work to consultant psych appointment..he was very good, still at sedated stage so hard to tell if increase is helping at all..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-17 15:21:33	Uh oh have woken up late..cue mad rush to get ready!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-17 06:00:14	Bedtime..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-17 06:00:02	@blackcat3119 it's a tough one, sorry you get it too..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-17 04:55:25	I've had a hot meal and an apple..sounds minor but after living on toast mostly for ages it's big for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-17 02:06:57	What I'd really like is a holiday somewhere hot but definitely can't afford that..aiming to get away in September, if I get another job!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-17 02:05:45	Booked some time off..still have 15 days to take before contract ends at the end of March so can't take it all but a break will be nice..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-17 02:03:30	Work was busy but got through, slightly less sedated but still noticeable to me..settling down to Father Brown with tea..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-16 05:00:22	Early to bed so hopefully won't feel sedated at work..past two days have been tough..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-16 03:44:45	I hate ironing..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-16 01:43:03	What I would like to do is go to bed for a few days and not have to think or do anything..not felt like that for quite some time..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-16 01:37:48	Walked a bit and stopped for coffee..tried to focus on just one foot in front of the other..still feeling sedated so quiet evening for me..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 22:54:28	Not in a good place at all, mentally, physically or emotionally..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 22:53:39	Heading out for a walk..need some time to just be as my thoughts are racing and it's too difficult to deal with stuck at home..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 21:54:37	I feel full of worry and anxious when I was hoping for a quiet stress free day..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 21:53:40	But the problem is that he lies to us and says he is doing things despite us knowing from the COPD team that he isn't..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 21:52:18	My sister and I will go and see him this week but not really sure what we can do..he not attending medical appts or leaving the house at all
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 21:51:17	Had a lovely rest but then straight into phone calls with concern about my dad again..only just stopped talking after 3 hours..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 06:15:42	That's it for me..been a very long day and bed beckons..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 05:07:18	Tea, peanut butter on toast and the cat for company.. #joinin
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 05:05:32	What a lovely idea!..reading some of these has cheered me up a little..:-) #joinin
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 04:04:28	I have been sleeping but not enough, and definitely not been eating enough..feel like I'm falling apart a bit and not sure what to do..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 04:03:21	My mum said I look like I haven't slept or eaten for a week..said in the nicest possible way but made me realize I must look awful..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 04:00:43	And feeling so sedated it's difficult to think straight..my answer as with most things is hot sweet tea..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 03:58:19	Finally home and exhausted..doubting everything I've done is good enough, for a job I don't even know if I want..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-15 01:16:13	Still at my mums writing out application..head hurting and I feel like I'm trudging through wet sand mentally and physically..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-14 18:15:14	Decided to get it all written then choose whether or not to submit, so lots of coffee before heading to my mums for some help..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-14 18:14:07	Final meds increase last night and feeling it today..not the best way to feel when writing an application form..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-14 07:15:12	Off to bed with hot chocolate and yep, a new book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-14 04:18:53	I feel like I just keep churning it over in my head but not actually getting anywhere..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-14 04:17:56	Meant to be going to my mums tom for help with application but feel very unsure about going for full time..want someone else to decide..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-14 04:16:27	Woke groggy but sweet tea has helped..didn't mean to sleep so long but I must have needed it..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-14 00:13:16	Mansged to get a few things done today but sudden wave of exhaustion is telling me it's naptime..so going with it..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-13 21:21:17	Pushed myself a bit but feels good to have worked out..going to treat myself to lunch out now before shopping..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-13 18:05:54	Morning!..coffee and croissants before hitting the gym..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-13 06:52:38	Book finished so off to bed..aiming to be more productive tomorrow..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-13 04:43:13	Nearly finished my book..I'm sure to others mine would seem a dull day..to me it's blissful..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-12 23:00:33	Having decided to apply I'm now doubting that decision..going back to reading before I start over thinking things and get myself in a state!
274535898	act1175	2015-02-12 22:59:17	Very lazy day of reading and drinking tea..really enjoying a book so my aim is to finish it..would miss these days if I worked full time..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-12 17:05:46	Morning..feeling a bit sluggish so easing into the day with coffee and readings..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-12 05:18:29	@queer_potato don't spend it all at once!!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-12 03:55:23	Think my default setting of I'm not worthy or good enough is scary to go against..it's that feeling the fear and doing it anyway..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-12 03:53:53	Actually I feel much calmer for having made a decision..will have to put work into the application and maybe interview but I did it before!.
274535898	act1175	2015-02-12 03:10:04	Long day but I decided to apply for the full time job..anxious but if I don't try I'll never know is what I'm going with..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 05:03:20	@drinksinthedark absolutely right!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 05:02:49	Great chat with my sponsor, such a calming influence she has..told me to read step 11, get some sleep and see how I feel tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 02:34:51	@julieclarke884 have decided I can't do any more thinking tonight though so zoning out with some mindless t.v..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 02:34:10	@julieclarke884 ah I see..yes my sister advised the same, just don't want to mess them about after they've been so good to me..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 02:18:45	@julieclarke884 thank you, been holding it in all day so it's a relief to let it out!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 02:17:57	@julieclarke884 if I apply and get it I would then feel bad if I didn't accept it as I still work there..not sure what you mean by younger?
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 02:06:36	But I can't know in advance how I'll feel doing it so how on earth do I decide whether to apply or not???..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 02:05:41	Which is all why I just want to hide away and cry..it's too much for me to work out and people I've asked have said only I can decide..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 02:04:15	And no idea how regular outreach shifts would impact on me long term so don't know how to make the decision..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 02:03:19	What I wamt is someone else to make the decision for me..I could use the money but not sure I'm ready for full time..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 02:02:08	A full time position has come up and no idea if I should apply as it requires regular outreach shifts and they don't work with my meds..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-11 02:01:07	Really tough day..full of anxiety and racing thoughts..am exhausted and just want to curl up and cry..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-10 04:53:41	Into bed before 9 with my book and hot chocolate, calm and content..completely different to yesterday..thankfully..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-10 01:48:57	Nice to leave on time and already home with feet up!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-10 01:48:27	Slow day at work but time still passed fairly quickly..had a nice meeting about a blog I'm writing for the website so got more ideas too..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-09 15:47:22	Morning!..bit of a shock getting up to alarm but ready for another day after much coffee..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-09 05:32:41	@SaveLifeworks thank you, I'm trying to do just that and it's helped a little..looking forward to bed now..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-09 04:41:09	So have managed to trigger anxiety that there was no need for..trying to tell myself right now all is well but it's bloody hard..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-09 04:39:36	Got myself in a bit of a state projecting about a possible situation that there is no evidence is actually going to happen..all in my head..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-09 03:14:31	@queer_potato ha ha, that's what I miss!!..One Week AS could only have been an @oxymoronic82 idea..noticeably missed..x
274535898	act1175	2015-02-09 02:16:56	Bit stressed now as my evening routine is running late but I'm also too tired to do anything..keep forgetting the increase in meds effects..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-09 02:15:30	Quick trip to oxford st to get some thermal tshirts for my son was the plan..of course it all took longer than planned..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-08 20:15:04	Lazy Sunday morning here..watching Rush Hour while doing the ironing..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-08 07:52:26	Bedtime for me..no alarm set..this makes me happy..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-08 07:50:47	" @EmrgencyKittens : sssh don't say anything! https://twitter.com/EmrgencyKittens/status/564203238988468224/photo/1 pic.twitter.com/IL3EzwGp9v " Would love to see what they were looking at!!..

274535898	act1175	2015-02-08 05:11:42	@BipolarBlogger I'm using normal release to increase dose but otherwise all XL..only way I can function..when on all normal I was useless!!.

274535898	act1175	2015-02-07 18:37:27	My son is already out for the day so quiet coffee for me before going to a meeting..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-07 07:40:29	Anxiety eased and it's bedtime..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-07 04:31:37	Sudden wave of anxiety so going to have a hot bath and try to settle down to watch some Monk with my boy..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-07 01:49:51	@MiracleTraining they were in Deri..not been for years though..

274535898	act1175	2015-02-06 04:18:58	Continuing my self care day with a hot bubnle bath..it's been nice having a day of looking after and treating myself..:-)

274535898	act1175	2015-02-05 21:57:44	Off for a gentle walk to the library and then to pick up some nice food for dinner.. #selfcareday ..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-05 21:56:28	@Transformental hit the edge of the lid of the jar on the side of a surface such as a kitchen counter and then try..works every time!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-05 18:46:22	Morning..really needed that sleep..woke still feeling a touch anxious so having a self care day today..starting with coffee & reading..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-05 06:14:35	Bath has helped a bit but want this day to be over now..tomorrow has to be better is how I'm trying to look at it..switching off is hard!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-05 04:14:58	All fine but I just feel like enough already!!..can't take in any more information or talk to another human being..I just can't..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-05 04:13:09	Had to then phone sisters to work out what we do next with him and pacing around the flat..next people at the door for a tenancy check..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-05 04:11:57	Straight from work I had phone calls about my dad who.is now not leaving the house at all or letting people in..kicked off the anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-05 04:10:45	Majorly busy today with casework and meetings..full of anxiety with elevated mood..I just want to unwind but can't..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-04 05:19:44	@serpentgrr like my bed too much now for that..:-)

274535898	act1175	2015-02-04 04:13:31	Feeling really spaced out in the evenings..guess it must be the meds after all..nice chat with my sponsor, this too shall pass..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-04 02:38:48	Very glad to be home, was a tough day..cherished having the work cats today, lots of cuddles and one fell asleep in my arms..really helps!..

274535898	act1175	2015-02-01 03:14:03	@oxymoronic82 @queer_potato sorry I did know that, my phone predicted it after I put your name in!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-01 02:55:40	@BipolarBlogger I remember it was kept in the piano stool that doubled as a music book holder..not thought of that for years!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-02-01 01:40:41	@BipolarBlogger blast from the past!..
274535898	act1175	2015-02-01 00:16:45	All my housework done!..feet up now with Death in Paradise..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-31 21:27:09	Was going to go shopping but don't feel like being out in the rain so doing housework instead..and it's an excuse to order takeaway..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-31 19:42:40	A morning of coffee and reading a new Inspector Montalbano book..will get to the chores at some point, just not yet..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-31 19:41:22	@oxymoronic82 @Nikkers09 Happy Anniversary to you both..wishing you a lovely day..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-31 07:25:05	@conniegates628 that is so sweet!..:-)

274535898	act1175	2015-01-31 04:46:52	Home and within 10 minutes I have tea in hand and cat on lap..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-31 00:20:54	Had a lovely walk, now I need to warm up before setting off home..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-30 20:39:58	Off down to the village for lunch..it's a beautiful crisp day so may walk to the sea..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-30 18:18:56	Wrapped in a blanket having coffee and croissants..nice start to the day..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-30 04:49:15	@oxymoronic82 oh what a lovely idea Sophie..you will be sorely missed..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-30 02:25:26	@NotSoNormalLife I related to all of that!..been an issue for me since I first lost weight from Crohns..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-30 02:08:47	Yeh it's snowing..went out in it for a few minutes..just lovely!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-30 00:49:55	Train was a bit delayed but was quiet so I quite enjoyed reading & watching the world go by..cold here so time to make a fire and curl up..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-29 20:38:15	@Tez_mum thanks Vicki!..I'm not very good with being away from home but I'll be back tomorrow..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-29 20:10:22	Packed and ready..anxiety up as it always is when I'm going away but doing my best to manage it..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-29 18:16:36	Lovely lie in but still feel a bit sedated..off to my sisters today so coffee and readings before I start packing overnight bag..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-29 06:08:04	@serpentgrr sounds lovely!..enjoy..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-29 06:04:26	Off to bed with hot chocolate and no alarm set..just what I need..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-29 05:18:49	@BeckyGetsSober that's pretty..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-29 03:54:10	@anhedonia11 oh sorry you're struggling..hope it eases soon and be nice to yourself..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-29 03:53:16	The cat is on the back of the sofa gently snoring near my ear..it's oddly comforting..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-29 02:36:50	I know from previous times it will level itself out but I really don't like not being able to perform to my full ability..whatever that is!.
274535898	act1175	2015-01-29 02:33:40	Long day today..busy at work and I'm sure the increase in meds is slowing me down and upsetting my tummy..hate going through this bit..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-28 15:12:38	Really bad nights sleep and a struggle to get up..not a great way to start the day..but onwards and upwards..it can only get better!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-28 06:22:26	Finally bedtime..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-28 05:04:26	My whole evening routine is thrown by getting home late and that makes me anxious then it's harder to unwind..vicious cycle..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-28 05:02:09	@oxymoronic82 excellent!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-28 03:25:56	Met my oldest fellowship friend after work for a lemonade..shared our troubles and our joys with complete honesty..very grateful for that..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-28 03:21:22	@oxymoronic82 glad you like it!..hope you all enjoy the story..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-28 03:20:06	Work was a bit sombre, a client died last night from a heart attack..only saw him yesterday & he was fine..a real reminder to seize the day.
274535898	act1175	2015-01-27 15:06:56	Didn't sleep very well but am up..not sure if I feel tired from that or the meds..trying not to analyse, just letting coffee do its job!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-27 04:20:30	Early to bed as first night on slightly higher med dose..goes up over 4 weeks..a little anxious but will see how I go..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-27 01:42:51	Good day at work, steady, so time passed quickly..g.p called again and finally got prescription sorted so collected that..now teatime..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-26 05:08:16	@BipolarBlogger so sorry Charlotte, horrible even if you know it's coming..pleased you got to say goodbye..take care..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-26 04:05:00	Lazy afternoon watching Monk..son lazed more seeing as I also had the ironing to do, but all in all a nice Sunday..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-25 21:25:46	A Sunday morning of reading and coffee..now onto the dreaded housework..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-25 06:08:25	Sorry to be missing #Columbotv ..my son didn't fancy it..hope you all enjoy!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-25 06:07:23	@BipolarBlogger sending *hugs*..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-25 02:39:23	Nice little deleting emails spree..457 gone and still 1200 to go!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-25 02:00:50	@anhedonia11 @Mariska she is great..some episodes tug at the heart strings though!..doing okay mostly, how about you?..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-25 01:26:48	@_ck_supergirl @richardkhornsey @cineworld oh brilliant reply Claire!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-25 01:06:42	Have ended up watching Law and Order with tea under a blanket..great programme, awful theme music..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-24 22:46:06	@JustForToday_x congratulations!!..happy first birthday..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-24 21:54:53	Not in the mood to do anything but also bored..kind of wish I was tired enough for a nap but had far too much coffee for that..ho hum..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-24 21:14:25	Did some shopping and now looking at how much housework I need to do but feeling very unmotivated to do any of it..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-24 21:13:43	Tried to collect new prescription but wasn't there so have to chase up on Monday now..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-24 18:13:43	We ended up watching Monk till nearly midnight but my boy is up and out for the day already..I, meanwhile am in pjs with coffee..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-24 03:37:30	Peanut butter on toast for dinner..craving comfort food so it will be cereal next..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-24 00:49:21	Settling down to read now with some lemon and ginger tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-24 00:48:36	Paid bills and did some shopping..as soon as I got in I realized I forgot to collect new prescription..will have to do tomorrow morning..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 22:23:03	A little anxious about a change in meds but that's natural I think and it is being increased gradually so hopefully less side effects..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 22:21:38	I was quite impressed with him seeing as it's the first time I've spoken to him and I feel better about the whole thing..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 22:18:10	He was interested in what I had to say about the report and it's him I'll be seeing next month to go over it in more detail..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 22:16:21	Consultant psych called me..I'm not to reduce the med I said had helped and he explained how to increase other one..was very helpful..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 21:41:04	Yet in the report she wrote I had said that med wasn't helpful at all!!..anyway have called them and a duty worker will call back..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 21:25:56	She recommended I call them in regards to the content of psych report and to question why reduction in one med I clearly stated had helped..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 21:24:41	Have spoken to g.p, she also was given no guidelines as to how to increase meds but we worked out a schedule together..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 19:37:41	Even the lady I spoke to said it's not clear what I'm meant to do so have again requested the g.p actually call me..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 19:36:36	Had a call from g.p receptionist saying new script ready but with no instructions as to how I increase it..all at once doesn't seem right..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 19:29:08	Stirred later than I meant to so only just having coffee..woke feeling a bit low which is probably why I went back to sleep..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 05:45:53	Nice quiet evening curled up on the sofa watching t.v with the cat for company..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 03:02:55	@oxymoronic82 also spoke to my sister about it and she said the same, pointing out 'come down' is not a medical phrase..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 03:01:17	@oxymoronic82 I looked back over other letters and they've done the same thing..got myself in a tizz though for awhile!..thank you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 01:03:27	@Tez_mum very true!..she is great so I know that will help..going to unwind now with tea and biscuits..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 01:00:18	Reading it over and over isn't helping so have highlighted the bits I disagree with and am putting the matter aside until I hear from g.p..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 00:59:01	I have to see the consultant psych in a month so at least I won't be seeing the same young one..didn't feel she understood me anyway..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-23 00:56:33	Have requested a call from g.p to help explain report and issue the new meds..she's better placed than I am to interpret it..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 23:24:01	@BeckyGetsSober that made me laugh!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 23:18:18	Most infuriatingly though I am referred to as a middle aged woman!!!!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 23:17:19	Yet they are increasing Quetiapine by 150 mg and reducing Mirtazapine..am confused..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 23:16:07	Really not happy with psych report, contained things I didn't say and seems to attribute all my mood changes to anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 23:14:27	@oxymoronic82 okay thanks, it was a single word I used to describe a mood state written in a psych report..I felt like they disbelieved..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 23:02:34	@oxymoronic82 I know you are good with grammar, do you know the answer to my last tweet please?..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 22:52:09	If someone writing something you've said puts a single quotation sign around a word does that mean they doubt what you've said??..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 21:44:07	@PeacefulRecover sorry for your loss..thoughts and prayers to you..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 21:43:26	Gym was tough but managed 4k on the treadmill and 3k rowing..going to have to build it up again gradually..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 18:32:58	Lie in then coffee and readings..now off to the gym, it's been awhile again so trying to get back into the habit..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 06:46:43	Been a busy work week so looking forward to a little lie in tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 06:22:53	@aaireland congratulations!!..all one day at a time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 05:01:12	@jadiepye @jaq1979_jacqui @doc42 @mathonwy @floweroflondon @djellicon @emmamheard @antenabu @SuzeH75 Really hoping I can make it!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 02:08:05	Feel neither high nor low..just settled and dare I say content..going with it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-22 02:07:24	Better day at work today..felt calm and managed to get a lot done..have noticed my mood has evened out again which makes everything easier..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-21 04:02:01	@NicsVoice you just reminded me I should do one again..find it helpful but not done one for ages!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-21 02:54:18	Another day late home but have so much to do at work recently I have to stay on to get it done..happily home now though so it's teatime..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-20 21:17:18	Paperwork and more paperwork..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-20 05:55:22	Falling into bed..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-20 05:53:36	Haven't watched Corrie for years but always liked Deirdre..rest in peace..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-20 02:56:52	@_ck_supergirl definitely not my best!..but enjoying a much needed cuppa and feet up now..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-20 02:55:45	@littlerich007 1st person was asked to leave..2nd filled out complaint but doubt it will be upheld..it is hard sometimes but great overall!.
274535898	act1175	2015-01-20 02:33:06	shouting at me..went onto deal with a very difficult case I can't even share on here but required a lot of careful attention so am drained..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-20 02:29:48	What a day!!..in first hour was told to go f**k myself by one client and another made a complaint about me when I asked him to stop 1/2
274535898	act1175	2015-01-20 02:26:42	@Tez_mum nothing!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-19 15:06:02	Slept badly but up and about..letting coffee do its job!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-19 04:23:27	Ready for bed by 8.30..I like it!!..time to read and get a good nights sleep..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-19 04:22:17	@AnxietyTracker ha ha..that made me chuckle..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-19 01:46:48	@BipolarBlogger some people clearly have too much time on their hands!..glad you're okay..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-19 01:36:46	Walk was nice but raised my anxiety being amongst people at times..cup of tea to warm up before facing ironing pile..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-19 01:34:56	@BipolarBlogger just read it, what a horrible and bizarre way to be plain nasty to you..hope you're okay..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-19 01:32:44	Reading a conversation on here and accidentally hitting favourite..hate that..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-18 23:17:58	Dressed and off for a walk, feel the need for some fresh air..and maybe a hot chocolate somewhere..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-18 22:12:11	Housework done!..now do I read or go for a walk..will attempt to get dressed and decide from there..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-18 19:59:01	Didn't mean to sleep for quite so long but hey ho..coffee then housework to be done..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-18 06:38:04	Bed with new Tess Gerritsen book and hot chocolate..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-18 03:21:56	Still catching up with xmas telly..have got far too much recorded but trying my best to get through it!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-18 00:06:11	Coughing a lot but my chest is definitely less painful..finished my book so onto watching Death in Paradise..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-17 21:45:33	Keep thinking I should get dressed but not sure what for so staying in pjs..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-17 21:44:46	@JLcustserv okay will try them, thank you..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-17 20:22:59	@JLcustserv bought at Oxford Street store..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-17 19:45:51	@johnlewisretail tiny plastic part in pedal bin broke so now useless..have had less than 2 years but no receipt..anything I can do?..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-17 18:19:16	Quiet Saturday morning with coffee and my book and the cat for company..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-17 04:41:25	@chinorossioc pleasure Jamie..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-17 02:51:28	@julieclarke884 I normally can, think feeling unwell makes everything seem worse because I'm not doing anything!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-17 02:18:39	So many things I want to do and things about myself I want to change but all feels overwhelming so nothing changes..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-17 02:17:33	Feeling a bit low..partly because I don't feel well I guess but just a sudden wave of bleakness too..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-16 23:48:45	Got antibiotics as I have a chest infection..ran into a friend from the rooms so had a coffee out which was nice but now I need rest..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-16 18:57:28	Woken by a hungry cat but it meant I made g.p appt for today before falling back asleep..coffee time now..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-16 05:00:09	@BipolarBlogger that sounds good..take care..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-16 04:55:01	@BipolarBlogger I can relate to that!..can you have some you time soon?..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-16 03:34:09	Takeaway curry for dinner was delicious, now just bath and back to bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-16 01:12:33	Ooh I dozed again..chest is really hurting, must set alarm to see g.p tomorrow..know I'm ill when I sleep this much..really thirsty too..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-15 21:53:39	Ended up falling back asleep..time for some soup and telly..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-15 19:21:37	Coffee and reading in bed after a lovely lie in..I'm declaring today is a pyjama day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-15 07:01:04	Bed with hot chocolate, book and no alarm set..bliss..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-15 05:05:09	@BeckyGetsSober ha ha that must be funny to watch!!..mine just keeps her ears back and stares at the windows..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-15 04:54:40	The wind is whipping round the building..the cat won't go outside, just sits at the door sniffing the air..they are clever..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-15 02:21:28	@chinorossioc well done for setting it up!!..hope it helps you and others..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-15 02:18:44	Definitely going to see the dr tomorrow..horrible cough has set in and it hurts when I cough..looking forward to a few days resting..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-15 02:08:41	Now it's tea and biscuits with Father Brown..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-15 02:07:59	Finally home, supervision went well, my probation finishes at the end of the month and I'm doing the job well so that's all good..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-14 21:19:34	Should have stayed off but felt I'd be judged if I did and paying the price for that now..listen to my sponsor and myself is lesson learned.
274535898	act1175	2015-01-14 21:18:17	Stupidly ended up coming to work and now I just have to get through supervision and then I can go home..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-14 05:26:33	I feel like I'm weak to have to call in sick as opposed to thinking I'm ill so I need to..not been working well due to it anyway!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-14 05:24:45	So so tired, both from the day and I'm still not feeling well..sponsor advised I call in sick tomorrow..too much burning the candle..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-14 01:46:14	@LithiumLibGirl I do too!..hope they are minimal for you and it helps in the long run..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-14 01:22:38	Keep going over the appt in my head, did I say all I meant to but also what did she think of me??..so ingrained in me to care about that..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-13 23:51:09	I cried throughout so feel totally drained and in dire need of sweet tea and quiet time..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-13 23:50:28	She is thinking a change in meds but will write to tell me what they decide..first for me, in the past he's decided at appt what to do..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-13 23:49:23	plenty of time to answer..I find it so hard describing mood states but think I got my main concerns aired..will be taken to a team now..2/2
274535898	act1175	2015-01-13 23:48:01	Busy half day at work then straight to psychiatrist appt..hour and a half later I'm exhausted!!..she was very thorough and gave me 1/2
274535898	act1175	2015-01-13 04:37:03	In pyjamas having eaten cereal and toast..it's like a repeat of the morning minus the coffee..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-13 02:26:43	Will also show the graphs from emoods, find it helpful to refer to as I can too easily forget how I was feeling and when after the fact..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-13 02:25:02	Not sure what they can do, I can only describe as best I can the changes in mood and frequency and take it from there..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-13 02:23:45	Sniffled and snuffled my way through work so very pleased to be home..half day tomorrow so I can go to psych appt..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-12 15:02:16	@JustForToday_x thank you, you too!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-12 14:38:32	Alarm was harsh but am up and having coffee..not feeling great but will get to work and see how I go..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-12 04:37:29	Heading to bed feeling lousy..so not looking forward to early start..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-12 01:36:39	Dozed badly so having some lemon and honey tea..times like this I really miss Lemsip..can't have paracetamol so have to go the natural way..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-11 23:10:24	Naptime..bit concerned I may not be well enough to go to work tomorrow so getting as much rest as possible..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-11 20:57:47	My mum is seeing a friend near me so is bringing me lemon and honey..thank you mum..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-11 18:37:48	Have woken up feeling ill..can't taste coffee properly which is a certain sign..back to bed with my book..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-11 04:50:03	@_ck_supergirl it was, liked seeing more of the chief too!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-11 04:39:13	@realpigeon it is fab..wish it was on more than once a year!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-11 02:36:39	Under a blanket watching Death in Paradise..cozy evening..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-11 01:59:21	@nofearkat they are funny!!..she never normally does it so it was a real surprise..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-11 00:42:03	Had a doze and woke to the cats face right in mine..made me jump which made her jump, quite amusing..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-10 22:03:48	I'm just no good at being outside..anxiety rises, convinced I'm being looked at and major palpitations..safer being at home so staying put..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-10 20:34:24	Spent the morning catching up with family phone calls and now I need some fresh air so heading out to walk by the river..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-10 07:04:40	Off to bed in clean sheets with a book..I may be some time..;-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-10 03:53:22	Definitely a slight improvement in my mood..feel a bit lighter, it's hard to explain properly..just going with it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-10 00:24:56	Getting a little tired, scrap that a lot tired of being controlled by my moods..really hoping psych appt next week can help a bit..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-10 00:23:53	Well I'm pleased I made it out but very self conscious, verging on paranoid so it was tough..need tea and a sit down now to unwind..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-09 22:16:04	Heading out to do some shopping..feeling really anxious about going out but also feel I need to, even if only for a short time..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-09 20:08:31	@kathrynstinton2 @FollowBDT I use emoods..find it very helpful..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-09 19:30:48	Vaguely hopeful that's a sign of my mood lifting..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-09 19:30:19	Nice lie in and coffee in bed..nothing planned for the day which I usually like but feel like I need to do something today..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-09 05:22:42	Hot bath with shea butter bath bomb..now catching up with Miranda..self care..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-09 02:35:31	Ended up falling asleep while reading..I do like an afternoon nap..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-08 22:57:12	Tree out and loads of vacuuming done and that's me done for the day!..exhausted so feet up with my book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-08 20:08:17	@MiracleTraining so pretty, one of my favourite flowers..and you too!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-08 18:55:49	Quite pleased it's raining as I'm having a day in to put decorations away and get the tree out..then the inevitable tidy up..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-08 06:13:02	@TummyHug that's kind, thank you but I don't feel up to facing people much at the moment..sounds like a good idea though!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-08 05:50:51	I think, feeling low, I'm really just looking forward to having no plans or demands on my time for a few days..that's sad..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-08 05:49:22	Have had a very quiet evening and looking forward to a bit of a lie in tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-08 04:05:19	@JourneyToPeace_ you should be!!..I'm aiming to quit by my birthday in June..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-08 03:19:50	@JourneyToPeace_ well done!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-08 02:09:15	Busy day but I feel like I coped with it better..very glad to be home with tea and Father Brown..got psych appt next week too..finally!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-07 15:05:36	Slept badly so feel dazed and sluggish..just have to get through today then 4 days off..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-07 05:09:40	Tea, toast, bath and I'm ready for bed..been a long day..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-07 03:05:04	He had been one of two who quietly said I don't seem myself and am I okay..just said I was a little down but he still made me cake!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-07 03:03:44	The chef presented me with a slice of freshly baked French almond pie in the afternoon and it was such a nice gesture I almost cried..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-07 02:39:06	I've been there myself and when she was describing the control he has but can't see it as control herself it was so reminiscent it hurt..2/2
274535898	act1175	2015-01-07 02:37:59	Worked late to get a woman suffering from violence at the hands of her 'partner' to a place of safety tonight..very hard emotionally as 1/2
274535898	act1175	2015-01-07 02:36:21	My hardest day at work mood wise..was told to cheer up twice which really didn't go down well but I got through it!!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-06 16:09:58	Off to work feeling like I don't want to..high anxiety and low mood not a great combination..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-06 03:44:04	@drinksinthedark thanks, me too!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-06 03:43:19	@BipolarBlogger thanks Charlotte, really need it..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-06 03:42:31	@nikimummy13 hello!..long time no see..hope you're well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-06 03:41:21	Getting into bed to read..early start again tomorrow and dreading work in this mood..who knows, could change by morning..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-06 01:59:06	@queer_potato *hugs*..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-06 01:08:10	Made myself do the ironing for work tomorrow..now back on sofa with tea and online games..feeling lost and weepy..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-05 21:44:35	I would really like to be able to just snap out of this mood but I can't..feel like I'm being dragged downwards and it's beyond my control..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-05 21:43:04	Hospital done and all fine..a check up for my AS which is managed okay for now..homeward bound..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-05 17:27:08	A day off work for me as I have a hospital appointment..still feeling low and really don't want to have to go out at all..time for coffee..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-05 04:06:57	Just haven't participated in life at all today..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-05 04:06:24	Meant to take the tree down and do the housework today but I've done nothing..now I look at it and think I've failed..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-05 01:44:45	This is a real drop in mood, completely low and weepy and no appetite at all..another cup of tea and more t.v is all I can manage..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-04 22:34:46	Keep having to look back at what I've just read as I can't concentrate so giving up and moving from bed to sofa for some mindless t.v..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-04 21:07:52	@queer_potato unfortunately no, feel low and anxious and really fearful though not sure why..having a duvet day..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-04 20:01:38	@EvieM9 thanks Evie, unfortunately today not started well either..duvet day for me..hope you're well..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-04 20:00:50	@queer_potato thank you Nikki..much appreciated..x
274535898	act1175	2015-01-04 20:00:26	Woke with feelings of anxiety, dread and fear..nasty way to start the day so am taking coffee back to bed..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-04 06:24:26	Going to bed feeling really quite low..hoping for a good sleep and a change in the morning..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-04 04:03:13	Feeling a bit low and weepy..just came over me suddenly..could be tiredness but feels more like a mood drop..going to read quietly..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-04 01:06:39	Dentist all fine much to my sons relief!..lunch out and only just home..been a horrible damp day so hot baths needed..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-03 18:21:43	I love that my son is as happy in a bookshop as I am..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-03 18:21:17	We got up early to get to dentist..thoroughly miserable weather and now a 2 hour wait so we're hiding out in Waterstones..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-03 05:15:30	Sausage and mash for tea and now settling down to watch Monk..been a nice evening..:-)

274535898	act1175	2015-01-02 07:35:45	In bed with hot chocolate and the wind whistling outside..I like it, makes inside feel cozier..:-)
274535898	act1175	2015-01-02 06:00:54	My son is watching Naked Gun 2 for the first time..ideal humour for a 14 year old..

274535898	act1175	2015-01-02 04:31:18	Can't believe we went on this!!..first year we've been brave enough and it was great.. pic.twitter.com/b3sl5zNIQ8
274535898	act1175	2015-01-01 21:16:51	Son: Do you know 92% of people have t.v volume on a 0 or 5 number? Me: Yes I'm one of them. Son changes volume from 45 to 47. Teenagers!..
274535898	act1175	2015-01-01 19:41:31	Morning!..quiet coffee and readings while my son is still asleep..today we're visiting work cats again then going to Winter Wonderland..:-)

274535898	act1175	2015-01-01 05:44:02	@DastardlyDeano me!..wishing you a happier 2015 Deano..:-)

274535898	act1175	2015-01-01 01:01:24	Had a brief walk to get a couple of chores done but very cold so glad to be home..now time for tea and reading curled up on the sofa..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 21:59:15	@MiracleTraining through pain comes growth popped into my head when I read that..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 21:18:42	@MiracleTraining thanks Matt and you too!!..sounds like you've been through a tough year so here's hoping 2015 will be brighter..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 19:27:18	@MiracleTraining @crisis_uk thank you!!..please spread the word..so close now to reaching the target..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 19:26:05	@oxymoronic82 no no no no..don't want you to go!!!!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 19:24:18	Please sign @crisis_uk petition to change the laws regarding single homeless people..everyday at work I see how much this needs to change..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 19:19:47	The law is leaving homeless people out in the cold. Sign @crisis_uk 's #NoOneTurnedAway petition to demand change: http://www. crisis.org.uk/nooneturnedawa y-tw …
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 18:30:30	Morning!..my son is out for the day so I can do whatever I want, but no idea what I want to do!!..*twiddles thumbs*..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 07:41:55	@oxymoronic82 for sure!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 06:41:27	@EvieM9 thanks Evie, will give it a go..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 05:14:01	But also increased thirst that doesn't seem to be satisfied by anything I drink..can't work this one out..any advice welcome..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 05:13:05	I've had a level of nausea for days..I put it down to meds increase but have noticed it goes away when drinking hot drinks..seems strange..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-31 03:39:48	We had a lovely time with the cats, my son didn't want to leave..was happy sat in my chair!..afternoon doing chores but nice time together..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-30 20:07:12	We're off to visit the cats at work and to show my son the centre as I can't do when it's open..be odd to be there when noone else is!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-30 03:56:31	Night at the Museum was not as good as the others but nice to see Robin Williams in his last film..home now for pizza and another movie..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 22:13:57	Having lunch at lunchtime which makes a pleasant change to last few days..son has had haircut then we are going to the cinema..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 19:33:12	@blackcat3119 yes my g.p upped anxiety meds but only for short term..not a permanent solution!..hope your appointment goes well next week..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 19:21:28	@blackcat3119 that's just it!!..clearly though stable now what I have been feeling is enough to see a psych with a duty worker..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 19:19:15	@blackcat3119 I do know she's right, just very odd describing myself when not in those states feels weird..feel like a fraud..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 19:08:59	Like I shouldn't be bothering people now I've had a few stable days..but I need to remember how quickly that can all change and does..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 19:08:04	Never had a CPN involved before and felt odd talking about myself and my moods..also a sense of wasting peoples time??..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 19:05:42	Very odd experience talking to a stranger who knew so much about me yet has never met me..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 19:04:35	Feel guilty partly because I'm okay at tgethe moment but her concern was how I had been and doesn't want that to return..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 19:03:38	Called out of the blue by a CPN who was very nice but it caused tears describing how I have been..she is recommending review by a psych..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 18:24:10	Up earlier so readings done, now more coffee before waking my son..feel better for getting up earlier as I knew I would..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 05:03:15	Hot bath has done wonders for my aches but still don't feel fully well, feel like I'm trudging..definitely earlier night needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 03:10:59	@bipolarkimmie ha ha that made me laugh..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 03:10:16	@trying_2_cope great, let me know how you get on!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 02:55:03	@trying_2_cope I use emoods, find it really helpful..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 02:00:36	Getting up halfway through the day doesn't work for me anymore..and that's a good thing I think..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 01:59:28	Need a normal day now of getting up earlier and doing something constructive..guess for now just more telly..with tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-29 01:58:20	Very lazy day..mostly background telly while doing gentle household chores..dazed and not able to focus totally..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-28 20:31:48	We've stirred late again today and I feel off kilter from it..need to turn it around and start setting alarms..coffee & more coffee please..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-28 20:30:29	@GregMcCambley very hard to watch, sorry you have the same or similar..all a part of life but a very painful part..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-28 06:47:00	Feel exhausted and very heavy hearted..hard to see dad aging and unable to fully care for himself but also not wanting us to help..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-28 06:44:09	He let us change his sheets but only just so my sister and I left it at that..had dinner out together and we only just home..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-28 06:42:07	Dads was really difficult, house has slipped back to being in a state and he gets very anxious when we try to help..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-28 00:11:06	I'm in a really miserable mood but at least I've warned my son so he doesn't take my snapping personally..on way to my dads now..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-27 21:57:31	Still in pyjamas, just finished reading Gone Girl and would highly recommend..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-27 19:16:42	Strong temptation to cancel all and stay at home but if I can get through today I can have a couple of days not leaving the house at all..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-27 19:15:40	Good nights sleep but still not feeling great..have to do food shopping today and see my other sister and my dad..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-27 08:09:45	Zoned out a bit this evening..we watched Brooklyn 99 and time flew by so only just getting to bed..I sense another lie in tomorrow..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-27 02:37:43	With not feeling well I just wanted to come home today..want to be around my own things and in my own bed!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-27 02:36:31	Made it home with all the bags in the rain and only a brief stop before collecting my son from the cinema..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-26 22:36:09	Feeling rapidly more unwell yet my mum insisting it's because I had a lie in!..her way of chastising me for sleeping..heading home soon..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-26 20:52:35	@_ck_supergirl Happy Boxing Day and Happy Birthday to your boy!!..have a lovely day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-26 20:10:04	Only just stirred and feeling a bit unwell..scratchy throat and sniffly..luckily don't have to do much today..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-26 06:51:31	Well it's been a thoroughly lovely day..food eaten, games played, telly watched..all without any major drama..successful xmas!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-25 22:40:28	Lots of lovely pressies, beautiful art therapy book from my boy that I love..nearly ready for chestnut soup..let the eating begin!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-25 17:40:48	@BipolarBlogger and wishing you a Merry Christmas of course!..x
274535898	act1175	2014-12-25 17:40:02	@BipolarBlogger ha ha I'm the same, son still fast asleep..guess he's officially a teenager when he sleeps past me on xmas day!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-25 17:38:37	@oxymoronic82 Happy Birthmas Sophie!!..it's been amazing following your journey..wishing you a wonderful day with your family..x x
274535898	act1175	2014-12-25 17:18:51	@Andy_15052012 thanks Andy..you too and hope it's a good one for you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-25 17:17:42	Merry Christmas to everyone!!!!..

274535898	act1175	2014-12-25 06:06:45	@capwell6 and you!..and Merry Christmas..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-25 06:06:06	Unsurprisingly mum is going on about how much she dislikes Christmas while we sit and look at the presents chatting..how cheerful!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-25 06:04:23	Xmas eve dinner done and I'm stuffed now but overwhelming tired..waiting for son to go to bed to do his stocking and then crash..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-25 01:21:45	We got out a bit early so am packed and getting ready to head to my mums..anxiety up but always is when leaving home so taking it slowly..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-24 15:03:46	Happy Christmas Eve!..full days work for me, then a lot of getting ready and travelling but now I know tomorrow I get a lie in..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-24 05:54:56	Got last of wrapping done but will pack tomorrow..need bed..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-24 02:28:52	Allowing myself a short break before starting next task..really looking forward to the break now, so badly want to lie in then do nothing..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-24 02:27:34	Another very busy day so am shattered..meant to be wrapping sons presents and packing for mums, instead I'm on sofa drinking tea..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-23 04:44:27	Feeling a bit spaced out which is probably increase in meds mixed with tiredness..bedtime with hot chocolate and a book sounds good..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-23 01:59:57	Am very glad we're going to my mums this year so I don't have the worry of getting all the food when I'm working till Wednesday..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-23 01:52:01	Was on my own at reception today so incredibly busy..meant to do some shopping after work but too tired so home for tea instead..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-22 05:51:47	Dozed off on the sofa and woke with a start..quick bite to eat and then to bed I think..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-22 03:05:31	Had a nice time with mum, not seen her for ages so good to have a catch up..feel so much brighter than I have been so enjoying it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-21 21:49:22	Wrapping done and off to my mums to drop off the presents so I'm not carrying everything on xmas eve..and to help her carry a tree..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-21 19:40:27	Watching Death on the Nile while I wrap presents..feeling calm and even a bit Christmassy today..nice change from past few days..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-21 17:01:49	Slept really well and no anxiety when I woke up..going to enjoy quiet coffee and readings before facing the housework and wrapping tasks..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-21 04:56:47	Early into bed for me with my book..very tired suddenly so going with it..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-21 02:58:22	I gave the cat a new catnip ball..fun for both of us, she's hilarious to watch..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-21 00:57:33	@EvieM9 I'm having high anxiety recently but trudging on as best I can..enjoy Strictly, I've never seen it!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-21 00:24:29	Time for tea and t.v to unwind a bit before tackling the wrapping..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-21 00:21:40	@EvieM9 sorry you're having a tough time, can you do something nice for yourself?..here if you want to chat..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-20 22:50:26	Went straight to a meeting & had a chat with a good friend after..she is my longest AA friend so share everything with her and her me..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-20 22:46:41	Well Dr sent an online urgent referral so should hear from them Monday..otherwise upped my anxiety meds, not much else she could do..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-20 17:54:25	Off to the doctor trying to feel hope she can do something but knowing there's little she can do without a psych report..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-20 16:45:40	Bit of a struggle to get up and anxious upon waking..don't need this today..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-20 06:00:20	@_ck_supergirl they are tough!..that means a lot, thank you and you are a friend for sure..x
274535898	act1175	2014-12-20 05:54:39	@_ck_supergirl thank you lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-20 05:54:04	In fairness this is the longest I've ever waited, never been longer than 10 days before..maybe a busy time for them..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-20 05:50:01	Had enough for today, anxiety exhausts me..g.p appt tomorrow for follow up from psych appt I've not had..guessing she won't be happy..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-20 04:10:28	Lost track of time playing games..sometimes wonder what I did with my time before smartphones existed!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-20 02:06:38	Declined going on to the pub though as that would have been too much for me today..happily home with tea and feet up but still very anxious.
274535898	act1175	2014-12-20 02:04:54	Not quite sure how I got through that but I did..sat with two people I know well and apart from pouring water all over my jeans I managed!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-19 20:31:40	On my way to work and anxiety is high..again..feeling nauseated before Christmas lunch is not ideal..yet alone facing people..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-19 20:30:03	@sobermommabee that's brilliant..congratulations!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-19 18:07:03	Bit of a lie in which was nice..the last of my online shopping has arrived so now just have to get ready for xmas lunch do at work..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-19 08:08:12	Falling into bed..been a long day..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-19 05:57:51	@oxymoronic82 oh lots of hugs lovely..x
274535898	act1175	2014-12-19 05:40:25	@Hippychick1987 thanks, I know you understand..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-19 04:29:50	Hairdresser was bearable by reading my book and her being busy with two people which worked out well for me even if it meant it took longer.
274535898	act1175	2014-12-19 04:27:52	Only just home but have managed everything on my list for today despite having anxiety..well deserved cup of tea now..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-18 23:15:19	Anxiety is still high..have cards to write and presents to wrap and still not decorated tree..all feeling a bit too much for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-18 23:14:28	Meeting went well..she has a very calming influence on me..done some shopping now a lunch break before food shopping then hair appt..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-18 23:13:02	@serpentgrr cut my own once and never again!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-18 20:34:50	@serpentgrr I dyed it myself for years but like it done professionally now..a friend doing it would be fab!..lucky you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-18 20:03:04	Also have a hair appointment this evening and that always fills me with dread..I like the end result just hate the social side of it all..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-18 20:01:59	Feeling really anxious on my way to see my sponsor..not sure if it's related to that or about everything else I have to do today..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-18 18:22:40	@_ck_supergirl @tenfourzero it's @d3sk with Forgotten Lady..no date yet..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-12-18 17:20:15	Set my alarm forgetting therapy had finished..now feel a bit sad I'm not going..seeing my sponsor though so hoping that will help..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-18 05:29:15	Think I've probably given myself too much to do again over the next couple of days..will I never learn..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-18 04:29:01	Made a coffee date with my oldest friend in the fellowship and meeting my sponsor tomorrow for another step nine chat..topping myself up..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-18 02:22:17	Anxiety eased up thankfully because I had a really busy day..very pleased to be home with feet up..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-17 15:22:24	Trying to bring it back to today and focus on getting through that before I worry about the day after..sometimes that's hard..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-17 15:20:59	Feeling sluggish this morning with a touch of anxiety thrown in..thinking ahead to what I need to get done before xmas..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-17 02:41:06	Realized today I've still not had psych appointment..thankfully my mood has evened out again but they don't know that!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-17 02:37:44	Well the new database didn't work this morning so everything done by hand..finally fixed after lunch so caught up before leaving..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-16 05:34:53	Been quite nice not watching telly tonight, read instead as eyes are sore..forgot my glasses for work so a real strain on them today..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-16 02:24:57	Long day today, 3 hours training on an update to.our database that goes live tomorrow so a lot to take in..need a bit of a screen break!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-15 14:50:48	Slept in the end but badly..never mind, new day, new week and looking forward to being back at work..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-15 05:56:43	Not tired but going to read in bed and hope to fall asleep..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-15 04:09:02	This anxiety is really uncomfortable..knowing I've got an early start is not helping..just want to be able to relax..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-15 03:25:19	Ironing done so it's hot bath time..can't seem to unwind at all..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-15 01:35:13	Feeling increasingly anxious about returning to work tomorrow after a week off..no idea why but it's there..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-15 01:33:43	Was nice to just wander for a while without thinking about shopping..lonely though..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-14 23:03:19	Achieved quite a bit in my clearup campaign..I can see surfaces in the bedroom again!!..now time for a walk, need some fresh air..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-14 20:29:59	Sitting here reading with coffee thinking of all the things I need to get done today..maybe just one more chapter then I'll start..;-)

274535898	act1175	2014-12-14 03:24:45	Lights done but then I got involved in family phone calls so not got around to decorating it yet..happily sitting staring at lights tho..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-13 23:43:47	Going to attempt the tree lights, they have to be just right so this will take some time..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-13 22:21:39	Been to a meeting and was really nice to.just sit and listen and be calm..some tears, some laughs but it's all life on lifes terms..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-13 18:12:12	Coffee and readings with the smell of a Christmas tree is just lovely this morning..hopefully I'll get round to decorating it today!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-13 04:34:00	@Fionaok here's hoping this one will be better for you..sending best wishes..x
274535898	act1175	2014-12-13 03:31:05	Forgot how much my arm aches after flu jab..not doing anything with the tree tonight..enjoying watching the cat explore around it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-13 00:11:13	Now I need a break before attempting to move furniture to fit it in the front room..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-13 00:10:37	So tree is in the house after kindly being delivered by guy who owns the stall..refused a tip and asked me to donate to a charity instead..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-13 00:09:32	Flu jab done and lunch with a friend was lovely..she helped me choose a tree as I'm very fussy about them so helped having her with me..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-12 19:54:26	@BipolarBlogger that made me laugh!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-12 18:16:34	Bit of a lie in, now coffee and readings..seeing a friend for lunch then buying my tree..my favourite part of Christmas is the tree..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-12 18:15:07	@JourneyToPeace_ it really was!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-12 06:16:17	Bed, book and hot chocolate..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-12 04:25:07	@BipolarBlogger ha ha I do the same when it goes up..tomorrow for me..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-12 01:48:49	Feel exhausted now, this morning was emotional and that has caught up with me..quiet evening planned with self care, starting with tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-12 01:47:01	Had a coffee with my sister then more shopping..I think, said tentatively, I'm done..just tree left to get now and doing that tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-11 19:58:02	I will really miss her but won't forget her or the work we've done together..onwards and upwards now..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-11 19:57:09	Also to try not to believe others know best for me and to trust in myself to deal with situations and people..very kind words..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-11 19:55:57	Well that was tearful..she said it was a privilege to have worked with me and sressed to trust my intuition about my needs as usually right!
274535898	act1175	2014-12-11 17:05:28	Last therapy session today though doesn't seem real that it's ending..fearful of not having it there and how I'll manage without it..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-11 16:35:12	@Fionaok @annamb1 @xtraspirit @Rachel_EDJ aww thanks Fiona, I'm enjoying my week off work before run up to xmas, hope you're well!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-11 03:23:27	@nofearkat that's lovely!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-11 03:22:15	@richardkhornsey oh I definitely couldn't name songs but I do have a teenage son so, without choice, I end up learning these things..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-11 03:02:10	Bergerac with a cup of tea & a gym day cookie because I forgot to have it yesterday..or because I'm going again tom..either way it's yummy!!
274535898	act1175	2014-12-11 02:57:53	@richardkhornsey bit sad but I know this!..McFly merged with Busted to become McBusted..very odd in my opinion but teen girls love them!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-11 02:10:31	Then went to see an old friend I've not seen for ages..one of a few people who can make me genuinely laugh so was lovely to catch up..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-11 02:09:12	New pair of Timberlands which I'm very happy with..travelled a bit to get them at a discounted price but worth it!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-10 20:10:51	Have done a bit more clearing but not getting as far as I'd wanted to this week..never mind, going boot shopping instead..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-10 17:33:58	Morning!..slept well after exercise but have woken up very sore, though it feels good as well, a sign of having used my muscles again..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-10 03:28:57	Picked up a curry on the way home and now I'm stuffed but it was lovely..treating myself to little things is nice..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-10 01:15:43	Picked up a few more bits but not getting far with shopping this year..think I'm going to give up for today and head home..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-10 01:12:05	@oneyoufeed congratulations!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-09 22:47:18	@BeckyGetsSober thanks Becky..once I got myself there it felt good to be back..now I just have to keep at it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-09 22:42:53	Straight onto Oxford St to get it done..going with the energy I got from exercising otherwise I'd just flop on the sofa..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-09 22:41:12	Managed 4k run, 3k rowing and half hour cross trainer..pleased with that though I'm going to ache tomorrow!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-09 20:14:04	Managed to get here..now back on that treadmill..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-09 19:18:57	Strangely nervous about going to the gym..bag packed so trying to summon up the strength to just go..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-09 18:23:01	Stirred a bit later than I meant to but can still do all I planned..I think..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-09 06:29:09	Bed with book and hot chocolate..hoping for a good rest to face shopping tomorrow..have walked a lot today so sure that will help..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-09 05:47:38	@jadiepye @jaq1979_jacqui @doc42 @mathonwy @floweroflondon @djellicon @emmamheard @antenabu @SuzeH75 Great, thanks for the reminder..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-09 01:26:22	So it's tea and telly time now..tomorrow is back to gym and more shopping..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-09 01:25:33	Ended up doing some Christmas shopping, mostly chocolates and decorations..I'll work out later who they're for, with some for me of course..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-08 21:48:17	Browsing books at Southbank then treating myself to lunch out..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-08 20:35:01	Okay I don't feel like being at home but I don't feel up to facing shops or people either..ho hum..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-08 20:33:35	@BipolarBlogger yeh!..*claps*..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-08 20:04:43	@BipolarBlogger absolutely!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-08 19:32:34	Think I'll stop for a coffee and take it from there..very odd not being at work I have to say..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-08 19:31:51	Appointment went smoothly and all is well so back in six months..now don't know what to do..xmas shopping or back to clearing up the flat..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-08 15:19:13	It's only a check up for Crohns, which is still in remission, so at least the appt will be short once I'm seen..I hope anyway..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-08 15:17:46	Not looking forward to the hospital, always a long wait to be seen but needs must..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-08 06:03:03	Doesn't quite seem fair on my first day of annual leave but at least I get the rest of the day off afterwards..positive thinking..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-08 06:02:05	Two long family phone calls and I'm ready for bed..early hospital appointment tomorrow so up the same time as if going to work!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-08 01:49:11	Pleased with my progress today so time for feet up and CSI..with tea of course..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-07 22:55:22	Some things I used to wear make me cringe now..glad to get rid!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-07 22:54:47	Three black bags of clothes so far to go to charity..if I haven't worn it since I got sober I'm not going to so out it goes..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-07 19:40:17	@DominicW7512 have fun!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-07 19:34:39	Slept over 12 hours!..must have needed it..now coffee and readings before operation clear out begins..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-07 01:11:01	@BeckyGetsSober very pretty!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-06 23:37:50	Fluffy socks on, cat on my lap and tea with biscuits to hand..all is well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-06 23:03:14	Really good meeting.. a few newcomers and lots of old timers made a great mix..onto food shopping and now home for some quiet time..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-06 18:26:18	Morning!..quiet coffee then off to a meeting..feel energised and ready for the day..good start..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-06 07:43:02	Bedtime..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-06 07:41:41	@DastardlyDeano just read this, so sorry..sending love and best wishes..x
274535898	act1175	2014-12-06 04:32:25	Can get to lots of meetings and back to the gym as well as seeing some friends..realizing that's a lot to fit in but going to give it a go..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-06 04:30:49	Ahh back home with feet up..tea only tastes right at home!!..now 9 days off work to clear up the flat and do xmas shopping..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-05 23:07:34	Thoroughly enjoying working my way through the Elmore Leonard books..time well spent..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-05 18:15:27	@SaveLifeworks it was lovely!..thank you and you too..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-05 17:03:30	Stirred to the sound of birds and now enjoying coffee and doing my readings..a quiet day planned..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-05 05:24:53	@SaveLifeworks enjoy it!..it's a good feeling..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-05 04:47:54	Time to move on and create an environment that reflects me as I am now..a big job but exciting too..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-05 04:46:31	Been holding onto too much stuff from my past that I no longer have any need for but it's felt comforting to keep..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-05 04:44:27	Having lots of ideas about work I'm going to do in my flat next week..major clearout planned that is much overdue..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-05 01:03:07	Safely at my sisters and warmed up..did a lot of writing on the train which has helped clear my head so now some reading with tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-04 19:43:52	Now though it's a quick coffee at home and then off to my sisters for the night..looking forawrd to some time out of London..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-04 19:42:33	Reaching out to friends is going to be paramount and I'm guessing there will be more of my ramblings on here..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-04 19:41:44	I've tried to not really think about it but we explored today how it could impact on me and what I can do to help myself..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-04 19:37:23	A lot of tears from sadness that therapy finishes next week..it feels like a huge loss and bit unsure of how I'll manage without it..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-04 16:56:47	Slept deeply and didn't want to get up but it's therapy day, so it's coffee and readings time..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-04 04:54:19	Right back to bed to catch up a bit..I know I'll have no trouble dropping off tonight thankfully..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-04 02:20:44	Managed a nap but feel very groggy..sweet tea and some food I think..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-03 23:32:17	Work done for the day, was tough towards the end I could barely type or see what I was doing..home now and heading straight to bed!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-03 12:09:45	Took ages to get to sleep so it was a struggle to get up but coffee helping me along nicely..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-03 04:18:12	Bedtime with two alarms set..not done an outreach shift on a day I work before so tomorrow is going to be long!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-03 02:29:01	Starting back at gym next week and I know that makes me feel better too..just want to be back to feeling myself..whatever that is!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-03 02:27:28	Mood wise I seem to have stabilised a bit this week, not quite as low so hoping that continues..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-03 01:39:13	Earlier home from work thankfully as I'm on early tomorrow so alarm goes off at 4am..bit of tea and t.v before very early night!..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-02 03:50:04	Everything done and ready for bed by 8pm..yeh!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-02 02:06:02	Busy day but all good and managed to get a lot done..aware I'm on leave next week so have to be up to date and handover by Wed..
274535898	act1175	2014-12-01 14:53:54	Morning!..feeling quite chipper for a Monday, hope it lasts the day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-12-01 03:21:41	Anxiety has eased a bit over the course of the day and just had a lovely chat with a good friend..winding down for an early night now..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-30 21:56:25	Lazy Sunday here but anxiety is up..managing it okay for now..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-30 07:34:08	A night of Monk and now reading in bed.. it's been a nice day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-30 01:06:33	And one my son took..:-) pic.twitter.com/TP95DsDlJH
274535898	act1175	2014-11-30 01:05:35	Beautiful sky over the river tonight.. pic.twitter.com/zM0J378GnA
274535898	act1175	2014-11-29 20:11:19	Off to get my boy then going to the Christmas market on the Southbank..a tradition of ours that usually involves marshmallows & choc sauce..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-29 18:05:15	@Andy_15052012 thanks Andy, you too!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-29 17:52:13	Coffee and readings in bed..nice gentle start to the weekend..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-29 05:55:29	Bit of a retweeting spree in between online Scrabble games..a nice quiet evening..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-29 02:48:04	@Bobby_Steps just spoke to my sponsor..she's being very firm with me..need to sort myself out..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-29 02:19:42	Actually that's not fair, I have been a bit better this week but still nowhere near looking after myself as well as I was not long ago..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-29 02:17:36	Fell asleep reading and woke with a headache..feeling low and moody..still no appointment with psych and still not doing much to help self..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-28 22:36:43	This is the first year I've noticed that black Friday even exists here..when did that happen??..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-28 22:35:25	Some housework done which is more than I thought I'd do today..would like to go out but reading about hordes of people in shops puts me off.
274535898	act1175	2014-11-28 20:07:00	Twelve hours of deep uninterrupted sleep..must have needed it!!..feel refreshed and ready for the day..what's left of it anyway..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-28 06:28:47	Yeh it's bedtime..with the added bonus of no alarm set..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-28 04:47:03	Spent the evening glued to the sofa watching telly but not really paying attention..very tired and it's been an emotional day..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-28 03:10:33	Happy Thanksgiving to my U.S friends..enjoy your day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-28 01:36:35	@AllooCharas @Yah_Reed nope not the only one!..everyone should treat themselves to things..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-28 00:55:44	Then went to a meeting and managed food shopping so now I feel I deserve to have my feet up with sweet tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-28 00:54:40	More tears over lunch while explaining why there had been tears earlier but my sister is also in therapy so always very useful chats..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-27 19:54:14	Really I just want to curl up and ignore the world but pushing myself today so I can do just that tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-27 19:53:14	Cried loads so absolutely drained but only quick stop at home to reapply make up before back out to see my sister..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-27 19:51:29	Therapy quite hard, talking about it ending in 2 weeks time and all that that brings up..feeling abandoned and wanting to be looked after..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-27 16:57:24	Good nights sleep thankfully as I have a few things on today..therapy, lunch with my sister and a meeting planned..hope I manage it all..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-27 02:51:27	Found myself a few times not really doing anything yet had stuff to do..almost like I felt a step removed from myself looking down..odd..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-27 02:50:11	A complex client and another long staff meeting means I'm shattered..been a bit vague all week at work, not my usual self..tired and low..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-26 05:31:32	Knackered..bedtime..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-26 02:59:36	@BipolarBlogger sounds like a good plan after today..really hope this leads to a change for you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-11-26 02:24:01	Quiet day at work yet I feel more tired..very pleased to have feet up and tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-25 15:00:00	"Change occurs when one becomes what she is, not when she tries become what she is not" Ruth P. Freedman
274535898	act1175	2014-11-25 04:52:32	Rice Krispies before bed..perfect night time snack..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-25 01:46:07	My idea of just waiting to see what psychiatrist says is crap..I need to be proactive with my own mental health..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-25 01:45:11	Need to restart daily check ins with my mood and record changes..which I've let slide along with all the other self care I'd built up..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-25 01:43:57	Think my mood dropping has taken the edge off the elevated mood states I was having..all guesswork I don't have a clue what's going on..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-25 01:41:25	Made a connection today between drinking Coke at work and finding it hard to unwind in the evening..well that only took me 4 mnths to see..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-24 15:27:42	Morning!..and a cold one today..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-24 05:05:07	Ironing for the week done and it's an early night for me..into fresh sheets as well..blissful..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-24 03:23:44	@BeckyGetsSober that's it exactly!..looking forward to work to get me out of myself for that reason..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-24 00:57:49	Like there is some comfort in spending all day in with the curtains closed but aware that means my mood is low..trying not to think much..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-24 00:56:43	Have spent the day reading and playing online games..pleasant enough and have felt quite content..though also low if that makes sense..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-23 21:25:46	Meant to do food shopping today but not going out in this weather..I declare today a pyjama day!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-23 19:30:42	Coffee and readings in bed listening to the rain..very peaceful..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-23 02:59:33	I do like dark winter evenings..suits me to be in pyjamas by 7pm..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-23 01:43:23	@conniegates628 congrats Connie!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-23 00:45:37	So mood has gone from anxious with elevation in the past few weeks to lethargic, calm and the desire to hibernate..it's all tiring..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-23 00:08:22	Had a nice enough time but also glad to be home..low in mood so tea and Being Human for me..I will finish this box set one day!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-22 19:52:36	Heading out for a meeting and a good catch up with a friend..headachey and grumpy but hoping that changes..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-22 17:48:03	Bad nights sleep with vivid dreams and waking often..coffee please and plenty of it..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-22 04:50:14	By arranging to go with someone I can't tell myself I'll have a nicer day alone..again..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-22 04:49:26	Have planned seeing a friend tomorrow and going to a meeting together..really need to, it's been too long without one..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-21 23:58:21	Had a nice wander round the shops now settling down for the evening with tea and my book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-21 20:15:09	Heading out for first look at what is in the shops for Christmas and a walk..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-21 18:28:37	Nice lazy start to the day with coffee and readings..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-21 05:37:31	For now I'm off to bed in the hope tomorrow will be more productive..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-21 05:36:56	Replacing it with gym until they decide what happens next..was meant to see psychiatrist this week but it's not happened..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-21 05:35:52	Part of me is looking forward tp Thursdays being a day off as opposed to the day I'm broken after therapy..three sessions left..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-21 02:59:15	Woke from nap grouchy so tea and reading and waiting for day to end..miserable I know, but it's how I feel..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-21 00:15:55	Combination of headache and exhaustion is sending me for a nap..much needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-20 22:19:19	Therapy was emotionally draining so I'm curling up with a book and hiding from the world..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-20 17:54:00	Stirred late so frantic rush to get to therapy..hate hate hate having to rush, it really unsettles me for the whole day..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-20 05:23:30	Wave of exhaustion after a hot bath so going with it and heading to bed..nice early night..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-20 05:22:15	@_ck_supergirl well done!..now put your feet up..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-20 03:10:47	Now time for sweet tea and toast with nutella..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-20 03:10:17	Only just home but all my paperwork is up to date and I've booked a a week off in December so something to look forward to..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-19 15:33:02	Kept waking in the night so feel slightly dazed as I head out to work earlier than usual to use the quiet time to get paperwork done..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-19 03:26:14	@Joe20140518 congratulations!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-19 03:15:03	Not sure if my not paying attention to my self care has impacted my moods or vice versa, either way I think review with psych is good idea..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-19 03:10:31	Received refferal letter though so need to call tomorrow to make the appointment..glad it won't be long now..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-19 03:09:10	Really busy but got great results for two clients so well worth it..straight into long chat with mum, nice but again struggling to unwind..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-19 03:01:20	@sobermommabee@BeckyGetsSober @NextLifeNOKids@bunnyhunter_ @SoberCourage @nofearkat @NotDrunk1124@PeacefulRecover @5araSmiles@MooreReva hi!

274535898	act1175	2014-11-18 03:51:38	Going to try peppermint tea and a hot bath..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-18 03:47:50	I'm finding it increasingly hard to unwind after work..fine when there, well sometimes elevated mood, then it doesn't ease up..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-18 03:43:30	@drinksinthedark sounds ideal..enjoy!!
274535898	act1175	2014-11-18 02:51:37	Only just putting my feet up after a busy day at work with another busy one tomorrow..time for tea and t.v to unwind a bit..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-17 15:12:46	Morning..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-16 23:35:48	@_ck_supergirl I only did to go out and get some lunch otherwise wouldn't have bothered!..enjoy your pyjama day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-16 23:08:02	So we're only just getting dressed..but it is Sunday so quite impressed we're dressed at all!!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-16 19:52:33	But on the flip side I had one of the best nights sleep I've had in a long time so am thankful for that!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-16 19:51:18	Fell asleep on the sofa during t.v and only just woke up!!..missed #columbotv ..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-11-16 04:45:34	Borrowed season one of Monk from my dad so having had pizza for tea we're settling down to watch that..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-16 02:08:14	Enjoying feeling quite relaxed..still an underlying anxiety but the most relaxed with it I've felt in a while..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-16 00:40:50	@PaulstreetP absolutely!!..x
274535898	act1175	2014-11-16 00:03:11	@PaulstreetP that made me smile..maybe we all need L plates!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-15 20:44:57	She also made a point of telling me how well I am doing in comparison to my past and need to hold onto that in low times..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-15 20:41:42	No immediate answer for anxiety but feel reassured that I'm taken seriously and something will be done..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-15 20:40:30	Doctor was great and has made referral back to psychiatrist as not seen him for ages..will be seen within a week..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-15 17:57:17	@PaulstreetP thanks Paul, I usually don't go and see her but it's been too unsettling for me to ignore recently..sorry you're having it too!
274535898	act1175	2014-11-15 17:42:39	Alarm again for g.p appointment to discuss high anxiety and mood swings..just all getting a bit too much so I'll see what she says..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-15 01:23:23	@ItsJackOk oh tonsillitis is awful..get lots of rest and ice cream!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-15 01:22:34	@BipolarBlogger oh that would be lovely!..and you've made me feel like getting Lego out..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-15 00:57:58	Having some quiet time with tea and a book before my son arrives..he got an A in Chemistry so I bought him a special dessert..very proud..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 22:35:37	It's always lovely opening Twitter and seeing #Columbotv family notifications..look forward to seeing you all on Saturday..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 22:34:19	@_ck_supergirl @Antonio_Bay @tenfourzero @JamesHailey1 @SuzeH75 @floweroflondon @GoogleGardener @richardkhornsey thanks Claire..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 22:33:50	Am all over the place with anxiety, elevation in mood and lows that I need to do what I can to get back to feeling more stable..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 22:32:38	We're also going to encourage each other to get back to the gym..clear from my mood charts I need to make some changes..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 22:31:27	Lovely to catch up with my sister who is going to send me text reminders re looking after myself better and practicing self care more..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 22:30:27	Assessment went well, he'll continue to have carers coming in and a personal alarm for emergencies so we feel reassured..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 15:51:47	On the plus side I get to see one of my sisters and have lunch with her after..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 15:50:33	I so dislike alarms on days I'm not working but off to dads this morning for a social services assessment of his needs..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 02:19:15	@UnstrungZero great that you've got her to do that..things generally less fearful when shared!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 02:17:35	Feel like I've just been soldiering on and having a bit of quiet time to myself has made me see how little I've done to help myself lately..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 02:15:30	And with low mood the past few days I feel a bit thrown by suddenly realizing I've not been paying attention to my moods at all..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 02:12:25	Therapist did point out I have a lot going on so anxiety is natural but that doesn't make it any easier to live with..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 02:10:52	Whilst physically relaxed still churning with anxiety inside..getting really exhausted with it now but it won't seem to ease up..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 02:07:52	@UnstrungZero yeh you got through it!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 00:57:58	@UnstrungZero I know how unsettling these phone calls can be..*hugs*..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-14 00:54:46	@UnstrungZero fingers crossed for you..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-13 23:17:55	Shopping done, trackies on, tea made and under a blanket watching Cagney and Lacey..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-13 21:32:01	Okay choice made, I'm going to do some food shopping then curl up under the duvet..will do a meeting tomorrow..need some self care time..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-13 19:52:47	So back home to write a bit then debating between a meeting or a duvet day..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-13 19:51:32	I've clearly not been practicing self care for awhile now so need to sort that out..anxiety and low mood to discuss with g.p on Saturday..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-13 19:50:12	Therapy really helpful in the end..lots of crying so drained now but was also good to get it out..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-13 17:10:31	And it's therapy day again..feel tired and a bit resentful that I have to go when all I want to do is stay in pyjamas and do nothing..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-13 05:27:29	@BeckyGetsSober that is so lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-13 04:02:02	@jadiepye @jaq1979_jacqui @doc42 @mathonwy @floweroflondon @djellicon @emmamheard @antenabu @SuzeH75 @GregMcCambley yep will be there!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-13 04:01:38	@studioLonline brilliant!..got me thinking I need to treat myself to some new ones so thanks for that!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-13 03:16:58	@studioLonline what a lovely treat!..I'd be excited too..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-13 02:50:41	Definitely my busiest day yet, thought at one point I'd never get it all done but I did..extremely tired and still quite low so sofa time..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-12 05:47:16	@serpentgrr sorry you're feeling it too..chatted with my sister so shared it but hasn't changed it of course..your high life matches mine!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-12 03:44:47	Really feeling quite low..no appetite and sat in front of telly with tea barely registering what I'm watching..bath and bed I think..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-12 02:19:38	Today was hard and had a meeting that ran late so only just home and remembering things I forgot to get done..need sweet tea and t.v..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-12 02:17:09	@oxymoronic82 was a struggle but made it..home again where I actually can shut the world out!..hope your day been okay & *hugs* too..x
274535898	act1175	2014-11-11 15:47:13	Not feeling at all ready for work..in a mood where I want to go back to bed and just avoid the world but I can't..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-11 03:43:25	@Talk_Out congratulations!!..wishing you a wonderful day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-11 02:43:48	@conniegates628 yup won't be making that mistake again!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-11 02:26:05	@conniegates628 thanks me too!..was a bit scared when it happened but it was controllable..just awful mess after and all with no coffee!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-11 02:04:26	Came home and the flat reeks of fire..that horrible smell that has got into everything so all windows open while I stay warm under a throw..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-11 02:00:12	Sadly though, more frequently people can't access the help they need as due to funding cuts there are simply not enough places of safety..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-11 01:57:47	Training was really interesting about mental capacity..looking at how and when we can intervene with rough sleepers if concerned for them..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-10 16:13:45	Panic is not the best way to start the day I discovered..anyway it's dealt with now and off I go to training..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-10 16:12:30	Morning..running late after a minor fire in the kitchen, some papers too close to the hob..flat stinks of smoke and my anxiety up..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-10 03:23:29	Have a Mental Health Intervention training day tomorrow that I'm really looking forward to so aiming for another early night..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-10 03:22:43	My cold doesn't seem to have come to much so maybe it was exhaustion and I've slept it off..bit sniffly but otherwise okay..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-10 01:55:48	@BeckyGetsSober ha ha enjoy your lunch and have a pleasant evening!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-10 01:21:48	Nice catch up chat with my mum and now settled down for the evening with tea and telly..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-09 23:20:29	Went to Westminster Abbey to plant a cross..each one representing a life lost..very moving.. pic.twitter.com/Uq0nXX6Hn6
274535898	act1175	2014-11-09 18:59:43	Today is all about remembering those who fought for our freedom..including my great grandfather who died having never met his daughter..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-09 18:58:01	Over eleven hours sleep!!..must have needed it..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-09 03:24:50	Whatever the cause bed by 8pm can't harm..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-09 03:24:02	Sponsor said it could be my body's way of dealing with all the emotional crap I've been dealing with..saying slow down and get some rest..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-09 03:22:02	Looking forward to an early night after a hot bath..hoping to get enough rest to stop this cold before it gets too bad..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-09 01:27:13	@nofearkat took me a long time to find a couple of people I trust completely..sure you'll find some too..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-09 01:25:29	Managed to doze but not very well..I've got a cold with a headache and feel miserable..date with the sofa I guess..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-09 01:24:15	@nofearkat not long ago I realized the same thing!..was only me that could rescue me, with a lot of help from good friends..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-08 23:25:09	Enjoyed the meeting and had coffee after with a couple of friends..feeling a bit poorly now though so it's nap time..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-08 18:12:39	Anyway am up now so coffee and readings before a meeting..and a planned afternoon nap!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-08 18:11:59	Slept badly again, can't seem to get through a night without waking several times which is very unusual for me..then cat meowing at 7am..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-08 07:56:03	@conniegates628 you too!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-08 07:47:55	Even one night away makes getting into my own bed extra nice..and no alarm set is an added bonus!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-08 04:46:40	Home with fluffy socks on, tea in hand and cat on lap..all is well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-08 00:52:55	Homeward bound..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-07 22:56:40	The sun is trying it's best!!.. pic.twitter.com/fgozfqAKTM
274535898	act1175	2014-11-07 21:51:46	Made it to the village and back but soaked..however I do have lunch and cake so can't complain..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-07 21:50:18	@BeckyGetsSober morning Becky!..hope coffee has done it's job..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-07 21:33:21	@Transformental happy birthday!!..hope it's a good one for you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-07 20:29:31	Whilst I love listening to and watching the rain I'd quite like it to stop now so I can go out for a walk..the local bakery awaits me..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-07 17:32:28	Woke to the sound of heavy rain so am curled up with coffee and Elmore Leonard..having a 'do nothing' day..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-07 07:03:06	In bed reading while the wind howls around the house..very calming..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-07 03:10:00	@bipolarkimmie one of my favourite things to do..enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-07 02:36:27	I can relax in a different way here..because I don't have my usual routines linked to being at home I just sit and read..and love it..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-07 00:15:01	Safely at my sisters with a fire roaring, tea and a book..lovely!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-06 22:03:33	@SaveLifeworks thank you that really helps and such kind words..on my way to the seaside for a night, I find water very soothing..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-06 20:52:19	Still have very high anxiety that just won't ease up but perhaps that's part of the process, as unpleasant as it is, that I have to go thru.
274535898	act1175	2014-11-06 20:49:41	The fact that I've gone from emotional to angry is a good thing apparently so that's reassuring to know..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-06 20:48:03	Good session looking at my reactions to dads behaviour and how I need to detach to protect myself..whilst understanding that's not easy..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-06 17:13:24	Morning..much better sleep so ready to face therapy, I think..6 sessions left which unsettles me but am okay for now and that's all I have..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-06 05:57:24	@EvieM9 change is so hard..but always worth it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-06 05:56:14	@0713Sc5 @conniegates628 absolutely, feel I've done all I can in a situation I can't change..time to let go..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-06 04:33:05	Reminded me that the only person we can change is ourselves which is just what I needed to hear..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-06 04:32:15	Great catch up with my sponsor..advised me to go to al anon to help me detach emotionally from dad who isn't going to change..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-06 02:04:18	Took on my first two clients today which is quite exciting..looking forward to working with them..knackered though so glad to be home..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-05 15:02:54	Slept badly and so wanted to stay in bed but up now and coffee is doing it's job nicely..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-05 01:53:44	Very busy today and my feet are so sore because I barely sat down..makes it extra nice to have them up now with tea and biccies..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-05 01:51:38	@PRoachpunk a lot going on at the moment so anxiety high but otherwise I'm well..hope you are too..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-05 01:49:52	@PRoachpunk it's a fantastic source of support and so pleased you feel the same..thanks for reading and hello!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-04 14:53:22	Coffee please and plenty of it needed to get going on this cold morning..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-04 04:44:27	@BeckyGetsSober hope she gets better soon..*hugs*..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-04 04:10:28	My anxiety has remained high after the whole dad saga..I feel like a coiled spring..maybe it will take time to ease up but it's horrible..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-04 04:03:47	Really missing my sponsor while she's on holiday..had a lot of contact with fellowship but still noticing her absence..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-04 03:59:29	@andyholl this is lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-04 02:05:26	And I'm getting tired of doing it, I really am.. Rant over..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-04 02:04:46	But then complains about not being able to do anything when he can but won't..it really is like bashing my head against a brick wall..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-04 02:03:26	What do you do with someone who left to his own devices does nothing to help himself because he's caught up in guilt and self pity..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-04 02:01:52	Busy day at work but managed okay..fuming at my dad who has gone straight back to doing nothing he's been advised to and lying about it too.
274535898	act1175	2014-11-03 04:52:26	All ready for bed in clean sheets by 9pm..that's a successful Sunday night for me..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-03 02:28:08	Tea and New Tricks now knowing I'm completely prepared for the week ahead..a good feeling..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-02 23:10:20	We've had a day of telly while I iron and change sheets..boring jobs but I feel better for having got them all done..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-02 18:43:56	Coffee and readings while listening to the rain..perfect Sunday morning..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-02 04:23:36	@oxymoronic82 we're watching Bad Neighbours..teenage sons choice of course..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-02 03:10:40	Reading away happily with blanket over me on the sofa and my son on his way home for pizza and movie night..simple things make me happy..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-02 03:09:22	Only been a week since I first went to dads but it's felt like a month so really nice to have a day doing what I wanted and no phone calls!!
274535898	act1175	2014-11-02 01:44:38	@GregMcCambley can't make tonight but will be there on the 15th..hope you all have fun!.. #columbotv
274535898	act1175	2014-11-02 01:42:33	Gentle walk and coffee by the river has left me feeling calm for the evening..just lovely!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 23:00:50	" @ClassicPict : pic.twitter.com/GzSiMRIhQL " Love this!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 22:13:55	She has been so supportive this last week with daily phone calls and texts that helped so much..fellowship in action..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 22:13:05	Sunny day showed up dust so had a bit of a cleaning spree..now off to see a good friend for a walk and a catch up..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 19:47:00	@conniegates628 morning!..wishing you a lovely day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 19:11:03	Coffee and readings after a lovely nights sleep..can't say I'm fully rested but am getting there..and son still asleep so all is quiet..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 08:14:00	And finally it's bedtime with no alarm set for first time in ages and all phones silenced..bliss..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 08:12:49	@conniegates628 thanks Connie..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 06:11:25	@mycuriousmind 24 hours..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 04:54:32	@BeckyGetsSober @conniegates628 the best kind!!..happy Halloween..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 04:35:39	But I'm home now and we've done all we could for him..really need some unwinding time so it's teatime..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 04:33:49	And it does pain me to say that but it's the truth..he thinks of noone but himself and never has done..and I find that hard to be around..
274535898	act1175	2014-11-01 04:32:10	Very long day but dad is home..none of it was easy, I really struggle to spend time with him..he is just not a very nice man is the truth..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-31 19:59:16	@sobermommabee thank you!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-31 18:56:16	But I am as my sisters are both out of London so need to focus and get on with it..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-31 18:55:35	So am restarting my day with my readings to ground me before I set off to get him home from the hospital..wish I wasn't on my own with this.
274535898	act1175	2014-10-31 18:54:04	Crazy morning of phone calls..none of the services in place to help dad seem to be talking to each other..very frustrating..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-31 02:24:27	@BeckyGetsSober it really was..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-31 01:31:23	@Fionaok thanks Fiona, I don't think I am so it was an unexpected pleasure to hear him say it..and mean it!!..x
274535898	act1175	2014-10-31 01:20:27	As tired and emotionally strung out as I am being with him always lifts my spirits..my mini me..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-31 01:17:53	My son told me I was an awesome mum today..totally touched and surprised me..love him too much for words to describe..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-31 01:16:20	Dad not discharged because they're still putting together his care package so ran around doing lots of chores I've neglected..now teatime..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-30 16:56:19	Just feel like I'm in a sort of dream world where I've gone beyond tiredness and am emotionally drained in a way that makes me almost numb..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-30 16:52:47	Alarm again today and up for therapy then getting my dad home from the hospital..already looking forward to bed again with no alarm set..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-30 05:50:04	Footloose is being watched and songs are being sung..much to the embarrassment of my son..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-30 03:36:56	I have tea and am reading..finally my feet are up..yeh!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-30 01:15:18	Busy day and straight to get my boy from the train..now we need to shop before going home..need tea so hope I get it soon..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-29 04:58:01	Another early night, still feel physically exhausted..longing for a day I don't have to get up..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-29 02:31:12	Our concerns have all been taken seriously and followed up on..the NHS at it's best!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-29 02:29:47	Am really impressed by the care and aftercare he is getting as a result of us being honest with the hospital about the state he was in..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-29 02:28:07	Phew busy day today but all good..dad is doing well and he will have someone coming in every day to make sure he is looking after himself..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-28 15:23:53	Still having broken sleep so not fully rested but feel better than yesterday so happy with that..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-28 03:28:14	@jadiepye ha ha!!..that made me smile for first time this evening..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-28 03:13:57	Have eaten a hot meal, bathed and in pyjamas already..bliss..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-28 01:04:01	Spoke to my manager at lunch and left work early..just too tired to function properly so got some shopping and now curled up on the sofa..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-27 14:36:32	@Ken153 thanks Ken, he should be out in a couple of days..hope all is well with you and the boys..x
274535898	act1175	2014-10-27 06:52:39	Off to much needed bed..have never been this unprepared for work before so a lot to do in the morning but rather that than staying up now..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-27 05:43:03	Aware I've been running on adrenaline all weekend with no regular meals and not even drinking enough..really need some self care..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-27 04:34:46	Have barely been at home and really feel the need to just sit on my own sofa but have ironing and dinner to do when I get in..so tired..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-27 04:31:40	Dads house is transformed after many hours work though still more to do..visited him and he's doing okay so now heading home..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-26 19:48:17	Have called the hospital and dad is okay, lots of oxygen needed during the night but he's resting..back to his house with my sister now..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-26 09:04:41	Had a cup of tea and the sugar has helped a bit but desperately need sleep to face unbelievable amounts of cleaning tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-26 09:03:25	@mycuriousmind thanks Dani..long time no hear, hope you're keeping well..its still processing I think and tons more to do in his house tom..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-26 08:18:49	And I'm so grateful I had one sister with me and the other on the phone for support..it's been exhausting but we propped each other up..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-26 08:17:23	In a way it's been a blessing that we were there and were able to raise our concerns with medical staff about his general welllbeing..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-26 08:15:36	hours of just waiting but he has been admitted..we had to return to his house for some bits then back to hospital and finally home..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-26 08:14:19	What a day!!..my dad in a bad way with copd, we began to clean when he had an episode of not being able to breathe..ambulance, a&e and
274535898	act1175	2014-10-25 20:41:06	Repeats to self on way to my dads..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-25 20:40:39	Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change..courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-25 19:30:46	Finally stirred for the day..time for coffee and toast before going to my dads with one of my sisters..not looking forward to this at all..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-25 09:36:15	Home safely and going to bed with hot chocolate!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-25 08:39:44	Well I made it out in the end and actually really enjoyed myself..definitely odd being out sober but did it!!..now heading home to bed..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-25 01:04:26	Meant to be there but still at home gripped by anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-24 23:25:08	Home now..am shaking with anxiety and fear about going out..really want to relax and enjoy it but my body not having it..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-24 20:50:52	I've called a fellowship friend who is going to come over and help me with choosing what to wear and hopefully right size things for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-24 20:48:10	On the train home and anxiety is really high about tonight..a black tie event that is filling me with horror at the moment..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-24 17:23:12	For today there is no more I can do and I have a work night out tonight to get through..heading home soon to work out what to wear..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-24 17:22:14	Slept deeply and feel rested..immediate anxiety upon waking that I think will only ease once we've seen my dad and know where we stand..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-24 05:03:30	Am totally talked out for today and mood changes have made it extra tiring..sleepy time..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-24 02:36:44	@oxymoronic82 *hugs*..x
274535898	act1175	2014-10-24 01:16:55	Tea and talking..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-23 23:43:26	Good journey here and did a lot of writing on the train which has helped..now a bit of down time with a book..I'm still not great but am ok.
274535898	act1175	2014-10-23 23:40:56	@BeckyGetsSober thanks Becky..at my sisters now and just being here has helped a little..I'll be okay..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-23 19:50:07	My temptation at the moment is to just scream and scream and that concerns me..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-23 19:48:59	I'm heading to my sisters as I need some contact with another person and it gives me something to do..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-23 19:47:55	Therapy was good and obviously issues with my dad are hitting me emotionally..anxiety still sky high and slipping into mild hypomania..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-23 16:12:07	Woke with anxiety that feels like it has the potential to develop into a panic attack..therapy this morning which I hope will help..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-23 15:56:51	@PaulStreetPerth thanks Paul..we're seeing him on Saturday though he won't be happy about it..hope all is well with you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-10-23 05:23:21	I can't do anymore today..feel completely drained emotionally and physically..bedtime..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-23 03:03:06	Taken a break to eat before last call with one of my sisters to arrange a visit to dad..none of this is going to be easy..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-23 03:01:39	Very busy day and I was exhausted..nonstop phone calls with family since, we could really use a conference call!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-22 14:15:54	So I woke with a heavy heart today but will get through work and talk more after to come up with a realistic plan to help him..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-22 14:14:28	but his neighbour who keeps in contact with me said he definitely is not fine and she has been helping him everyday..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-22 14:13:20	My sisters and I are going to have to talk to his doctor and see what help we can get him but all very difficult when he tells us he's fine
274535898	act1175	2014-10-22 14:11:04	Am exhausted..late night after phone calls re my dads health which has deteriorated to the point he may not be able to care for himself..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-22 03:25:34	Tea, toast and a hot bath have helped me unwind a bit..need more food but really don't feel like eating..cereal seems easiest option..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-22 01:00:02	Finding it a bit hard to unwind though so going to try tea and mindless t.v as distraction..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-22 00:58:45	Very busy day with new clients and two meetings re my progress..all positive feedback though and new training to attend which is good..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-21 14:10:55	Slept much better and feel rested and ready for the day..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-21 04:04:51	Can happily say I'm in bed already..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-21 00:54:51	@Fionaok my son knows I see people on here as friends but don't think he gets it either..never mind as long as we know..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-21 00:42:47	Very busy morning and really struggled through the afternoon..sluggish and sleepy..aiming for a very early night..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-20 13:43:23	Didn't sleep at all well and have dragged myself out of bed when I so wanted to stay in it..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-20 13:42:06	@Fionaok oh sorry!..your role reversal with your son with you being happy and skippy..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-20 04:26:21	Glad to be heading into bed early..not really enjoyed today so here's hoping for a brighter tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-20 03:03:01	@jadiepye congratulations!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-20 02:59:03	@SarahTheodorou not tonight..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-20 01:43:38	@Fionaok ha ha brilliant!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-20 01:42:14	Anxiety not helped by helicopters circling above my flat..trying to be calm and peaceful is already a struggle this evening..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-20 00:05:58	@sobermommabee yeh!!!..well done..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-20 00:04:43	@BeckyGetsSober yes I might!..and already have an exit plan, was first thing I thought of..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-20 00:03:12	Shopping did not go well, I was far too anxious to make sensible decisions so didn't get anything..feel better back home but not great..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-19 20:35:23	But for now the anxiety is around choosing what to wear..have to do today as no free time before next Friday and don't like that pressure..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-19 20:33:56	Very anxious about my first proper night out since getting sober..not that I'll drink but that I won't enjoy it because I'm not drinking..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-19 20:31:38	Housework done and I'm off shopping for a work night out next week..black tie event and I have no idea what to wear!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-19 17:56:31	Much better sleep and dozed for awhile after waking..after all it is Sunday..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-19 05:40:25	Heading to bed to finish my book..hoping for a better nights sleep tonight..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-19 05:19:39	@richardkhornsey oh wow I loved that!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-19 03:52:05	@oxymoronic82 oh I think.it's lovely..motherhood has so clearly done wonders for you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-10-19 02:54:37	@Anthillmob74 amazing!..brilliant news..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-19 01:17:41	@drinksinthedark enjoy it!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-18 23:42:21	Managed to curl up with a book for awhile now it's tea time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-18 20:39:05	Somehow ended up starting laundry and getting dressed..finding it hard to do nothing despite being tired..hmmm..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-18 19:09:44	@EvieM9 sorry you had it too, hope you can enjoy a quiet day as well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-18 18:18:23	Bad nights sleep, kept waking suddenly with a sense of panic..going to have a very quiet day in with lots of rest and reading..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-18 06:03:24	Been a bit spaced out this evening..just feel a bit blank..anyway time for bed though don't feel sleepy..book and a hot chocolate I think..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-18 02:25:19	Over 3 hours on the phone to my sister and mum..all just catching up on each others lives so nice but also a bit tiring..t.v time..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-18 02:22:43	@jadiepye @antenabu @Antonio_Bay @ana_m_q @box5angel @BrieLime9939 @djellicon @doc42 @d3sk @Donahuetroy thank you! And you too..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-17 21:12:15	Tried a new meeting and really enjoyed it..refreshing to hear new people and found myself really listening..very uplifting!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-17 17:59:17	Going to a meeting so I don't feel bad lazing around for the rest of the day..odd logic but it works for me..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-17 16:39:13	Really achey legs this morning..and tired, very tired even though I slept well..need a quiet day today..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-17 03:50:44	@mycuriousmind thank you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-17 03:43:24	Feeling very calm this evening..a sense of being at peace with myself..not often I get it so savouring it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-17 02:36:33	@PaulStreetPerth excellent!..I like the idea of a class for those reasons and could help with social anxiety too..facing what I fear..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-17 01:37:55	@soberbill34 glad you made it back!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-17 00:49:16	Lovely meeting and good chat walking there and back..am exhausted now though so tea and t.v time..New Tricks tonight..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-17 00:47:41	@PaulStreetPerth that's a good idea!!..how was your class?..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-16 19:43:49	@sobermommabee thank you!..you too..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-16 19:12:46	Still lots of work to do so feel relieved I won't be left to do it on my own..now quick coffee and off to a meeting..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-16 19:11:44	I used to drink and take drugs to excess now I struggle with self care like nourishing myself..like I'm not deserving of being kind to me..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-16 19:09:40	Cried throughout though at my inability to be nice to myself and to stop punishing myself as I've always done, it's just in different ways..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-16 19:07:34	Feel better about it now as I thought it was ending because they thought I was ready to not have any but that's not the case..phew..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-16 19:06:31	Apparently therapy not ending because they think I don't need anymore but due to her availability so more will be offered after a break..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-16 16:41:34	@PaulStreetPerth thanks Paul..could use the time to get back to the gym but still feel it's too soon..guess it never feels like 'right time'
274535898	act1175	2014-10-16 16:10:25	Really good nights sleep and I'm ready for therapy..need to discuss what help I'll get when it ends so it may be a tearful session..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-16 03:00:04	@BipolarBlogger so sorry you're struggling Charlotte..thinking of you and sending hugs..x
274535898	act1175	2014-10-16 00:55:34	Still feel very uneasy when given any kind of praise but it is nice to know I'm doing well in their eyes..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-16 00:53:32	Long busy day today and started to flag in the afternoon but dealt with an incident and the police brilliantly according to a manager..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-15 14:16:50	Some days coffee tastes so good I want my first cup to last and last..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-15 03:34:29	Very lazy evening..even had nutella on toast as I couldn't be bothered to cook..early night needed I think..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-15 01:01:19	Good day and now happily curled up with tea and Cagney and Lacey..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-14 04:30:03	Probably shouldn't have eaten chocolate cake before bed but god it tasted good..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-14 01:09:20	Came home to a letter about a debt and managed to work myself up about how a possible conversation *may* go!!..really need to unwind..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-14 01:02:04	Work was fine but didn't feel great..not taken one of my meds all weekend as I ran out and really felt the loss of it today..got more now..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-13 13:48:56	Seems it has rained all night and still going..not looking forward to travelling to wotk in it!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-13 03:55:05	@KymmieHPeace lucky you!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-13 03:54:32	@KymmieHPeace thank you!..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-13 03:54:21	@KymmieHPeace yes Polzeath, love it there..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-13 03:38:59	Lots of people on my timeline having a hard time at the moment..my thoughts go out to you all..x
274535898	act1175	2014-10-13 00:59:45	@PaulStreetPerth sadly I know, sending lots of best wishes..x
274535898	act1175	2014-10-13 00:45:04	@PaulStreetPerth sorry it's been hard..glad you're home and hope it eases soon..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-12 23:16:15	Had a nice gentle walk and a good catch up..glad to be back in the warm now though..and I do believe it's tea and biscuits time!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-12 20:01:55	Having put all the cat toys on surfaces while I vacuum it took her 30 seconds to knock them all to the floor again..our Sunday ritual..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-12 19:02:12	" @planetepics : Sup pic.twitter.com/0q3ryvw5dq " @BipolarBlogger to add to your collection..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-12 18:19:57	Lovely Sunday morning lie in..housework today and a walk with a good friend..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-12 05:35:37	Bedtime..first time in winter pyjamas..snuggly..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-12 05:24:34	Sorry to be missing #Columbotv again..too tired to stay up..hope you all enjoy..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-12 04:04:41	@Natalie_Oxford @oxymoronic82 might aim for that tomorrow..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-12 02:23:12	In pyjamas before 7.30..lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-11 22:18:17	Not able to nap so settling for tea and t.v instead..feel all out of sorts and want the evening to hurry up and arrive..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-11 22:15:06	@PaulStreetPerth sorry you have it too..well done for battling on, sometimes I can but accepting today I can't..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-11 21:08:48	Feel safer being at home so that's where I'm staying..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-11 21:06:07	Felt like my early days with me thinking everyone was looking at me and knowing my thoughts..should have shared but felt I couldn't..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-11 21:04:43	Was a good meeting but I'm feeling very self conscious and paranoid so have scuttled home to curl up and have a nap..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-11 18:01:39	Bad nights sleep tossing and turning..off to a meeting then afternoon nap planned..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-11 05:22:03	Heading to bed to finish the book I started this morning..that's a sign of a good day to me..and so looking forward to a meeting tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-11 04:00:46	Back home and although not done much I'm quite tired..when my back is playing up I tire much more easily..going to have hot bubble bath..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-10 23:10:50	Have spent the day reading and looking out of the window..it's been just what I needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-10 17:04:37	@PaulStreetPerth thanks Paul!..can't beat a good bookshop, definitely one of my favourite places to spend some time and money!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-10 15:48:38	Nice quiet morning in the countryside..perfect for coffee and readings..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-10 03:21:59	Wind is howling and lots of lightening but no thunder..sat in the garden for awhile and can't hear anything but the weather..it's lovely..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-10 00:40:07	Good journey here and now curled up with tea and a book..back and legs are really aching so going to have a quiet evening and early night..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-09 19:47:06	@BeckyGetsSober I know I love it!!..thank you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-09 19:14:49	Packing to go to my sisters overnight..get to see the sea..always helps with my moods to be near water..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-09 18:56:44	Made it through a whole therapy session without crying..that's a first..so I feel less drained though still feel tired and grouchy..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-09 15:34:29	Woke up feeling resentful that I had to get up for therapy..coffee and readings to try and turn that around..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-09 03:25:23	@Lesism good to hear..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-09 01:49:18	At times when I'm about to moan on I have to be grateful that family even talk to me as for a long time they didn't..positive thinking..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-09 01:45:50	Busy day today and straight into a family row afterwards..wasn't directly involved but listened to both sides..now I need tea and biscuits..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-08 03:27:56	Totally lazy evening so lovely..nice catch up with my sponsor who gently suggested I get to a meeting soon..she's absolutely right..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-08 00:47:27	Had a really good day today..I really get on with the volunteers who work Tuesdays so had an afternoon of chatting with a bit of work..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-07 04:01:17	@BipolarBlogger hope you manage it too..it's lovely..x
274535898	act1175	2014-10-07 04:00:06	Bed at 9pm..what a treat!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-07 01:39:23	@Lesism some places use reflective plastic but glass can be used as a weapon or to self harm so not allowed..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-07 00:59:58	@johnmoloney66 I read that just before work and it helped so much..thank you..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-07 00:59:12	Work was fine, nobody said anything or looked at me strangely so I worried for nothing..there's a surprise!!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-06 14:20:42	Feeling better this morning about facing work..what will be will be..now just need to dig out some Autumn clothes as it's really cold..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-06 03:54:54	Am aware I am probably over thinking it all but still have a sense of dread..will just have to wait and see..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-06 03:53:44	For the first time I'm not looking forward to work tomorrow..worried my slight elevated mood last week will be mentioned..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-05 22:24:27	"@LivinwithBATman: How wise! pic.twitter.com/IJbvt3JRN8 " @oneyoufeed thought you'd like this..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-05 21:06:03	A Sunday of laziness and Modern Family..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-05 04:05:23	Beverly Hills Cop 3 tonight with Oreo ice cream..back hurting but bearable with feet up and heat pad on..so really all is well..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-05 00:18:04	Back home..trackie bottoms and fluffy socks on..time to curl up with tea and a book..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-04 22:53:45	Having to go out for food shopping though really don't want to..guess sooner I go sooner I can be back..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-04 18:31:22	Dark, rainy morning here..perfect for coffee and reading in bed..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-04 04:00:49	Me and my boy with Beverly Hills Cop 2 equals a happy Anna this evening..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-03 23:43:35	Interesting retweet..not sure I ever remember being who I was..though I must have at some point..I see glimpses today so that's progress..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-03 23:13:42	Quiet time reading with herbal tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-03 21:17:55	Not what I wanted to hear but that's life when you live with chronic illnesses..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-03 21:16:23	As I suspected my inflammatory markers are sky high..have to start doing daily exercises again and manage the pain as much as possible..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-03 17:47:39	Hard getting out of bed due to back pain, off to the hospital for blood tests now..allowing myself extra time to get there..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-03 00:28:45	@NotDrunk1124 thanks, me too!..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 22:42:10	I have scheduled blood tests tomorrow in AS clinic so if it's a flare up they will show it..not really what I need right now..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 22:40:27	My back is causing a lot of pain this afternoon..got a heat pad on and my feet up but it's still throbbing away and making my legs tingle..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 20:51:05	@PaulStreetPerth that sounds really positive!!..hopefully there will be some support for me after I finish with her..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 20:33:29	@PaulStreetPerth and she announced it right at the end so just a bit shell shocked for now..will see what she says and go from there..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 20:32:36	@PaulStreetPerth not sure we're going to talk about it more next week..was originally told 2 years so hadn't even thought of it ending!..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 20:13:38	Feel exhausted physically and mentally so going to read though should really be going to a meeting..just don't feel I can face one today..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 20:12:09	Found out therapy finishes in December whuch was a bit of a shock..only just feel we're getting somewhere..too tired to process it now..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 16:17:10	Woke a bit late so quick coffee and off to therapy..don't really want to today as I know I'll cry but guess that's part of the process..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 03:47:54	Tea, toast and t.v have helped a bit..keep thinking I didn't cope very well today but have no basis for that..just my default setting..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 03:45:42	@johnmoloney66 @stoney_utd @recovereveryday @manda_wilkins @GodPhotos @GodIsFaithfuI @mssginbottle @MotherRose1 aww god bless you all too..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 01:55:04	Rest in peace Alice..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 01:12:15	So I'm having trouble unwinding and letting it all go..need some mindless t.v and online games I think..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-02 01:10:15	Had a busy day and got myself a bit strung out at a couple of points..was trying to do too much and found it hard to stop and leave..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-01 04:08:34	Early to bed with a book..just what I need..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-01 03:20:48	Suddenly ferl very sad, sure it's because I'm so tired but it's still horrible..feels like I'm aching inside..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-01 00:14:52	Anyway nothing I can do so feet up with t.v..was odd starting and finishing early..definitely more tired so early night planned..
274535898	act1175	2014-10-01 00:13:39	Left work early but skipped job centre as housing officer called and they have now started processing my claim..back to waiting for post!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-30 04:04:57	@BeckyGetsSober looks blissful!!..hope you had a good time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-30 03:22:52	Trying to get into bed for an early start but not going quite as planned after losing track of time online..so easily done!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-30 00:58:03	Now it's tea and biscuits time..my favourite part of the day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-30 00:57:26	By going back to the person who made the mistake I hope she can be the one to sort it..or can advise me how to..at least I'll know then..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-30 00:55:58	Feel much less anxious about it now I know I'm doing something myself to help sort it..can't stand waiting around putting no action in..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-30 00:50:14	Quite a good day for a Monday..usually very busy but was steady which I like..7am start tomorrow so I can leave early to deal with housing..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-29 00:25:48	Had a really nice walk just taking in what was around me..feel so much calmer than yesterday..settling in for a quiet evening now..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-28 21:42:15	Long chat with my mum catching up and got some crying done that needed to come out..now heading out for a walk by the river in the sun..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-28 18:13:49	Lazy Sunday morning with coffee and Elmore Leonard..lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-28 04:08:42	@_ck_supergirl thanks lovely..have a good one..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-28 03:03:53	@_ck_supergirl going to try but I am tired, been a bit of a rough day..I am sorry if I miss it..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-28 01:23:58	Feeling much calmer after practicing some self care including a nap which thankfully I woke less anxious from..now a quiet evening..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 22:54:47	@johna19402 a chat with a good friend has helped a little..aware it's me worried about extremes so trying to right size..not easy for me!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 21:23:03	@johna19402 all I can do today is curl up and try not to think..not obsessed with self but am very very anxious..it will pass..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 20:17:38	@oxymoronic82 I wish it had..going home to practice self care..ie read, drink tea and eat biscuits..worth a try!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 20:16:15	Been to a meeting which has helped a bit..everyone saying all will work itself out..message not filtering through to my feelings though..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 17:33:58	@oxymoronic82 sounds blissful!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 17:31:24	@oxymoronic82 thanks Sophie..much needed..x
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 17:12:30	As soon as I was awake anxiety flooded in..a horrible way to wake up..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 05:22:19	@rapid_cycler welcome back..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 03:34:05	Makes me see it in a different way..and all delivered with complete honesty..it will all be okay and just for today I'm fine..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 03:31:35	I love my sponsor..she says absolutely nothing I can do till Monday so hand it over and then let it go..or drive myself crazy..my choice..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 02:58:38	Going to call my sponsor then have a hot bath..should help..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 02:58:02	Trying to tell myself worry gets me nowhere..it's serves no purpose..and can't do anything till Monday anyway..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 01:19:20	My biggest worry is it being her word versus mine when I know I'm in the right..but have no way to prove that..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 01:18:30	But not sure what if anything I can do about it..housing officer said today waiting for DWP so who knows how long it will all take..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 01:17:02	Still no news from housing is causing me anxiety..sure it's because of the lady signing me off later than I started work to "help me out"..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 00:18:47	Hair cut and coloured and I'm pleased with it..still feeling very go go go though so attempting to unwind is difficult..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-27 00:17:47	@jadiepye @SuzeH75 @djellicon @stevemy @littlerich007 @antenabu @BrieLime9939 @box5angel @Antonio_Bay @DomJBrown @d3sk cheers Stuart!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-26 20:52:23	Feeling all out of sorts today..tired but also bit elevated in mood..off for an impulsive hair appointment..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-26 16:34:54	Didn't sleep at all well..awake more than asleep..feel tired and grumpy..coffee please and then some more..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-26 05:44:16	@oxymoronic82 interesting point..sadly I think the latter is true..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-26 02:42:47	Time for fluffy socks and a fleece in the evenings..actually quite like it, feels cosy..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-26 00:58:56	Really nice afternoon..walked through Green Park to and from meeting..even got to see Princess Anne leaving the palace!..now teatime..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-25 20:20:11	Time to head out..looking forward to a good catch up on the way to a meeting..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-25 20:19:26	@NotDrunk1124 was lovely!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-25 19:01:12	@thesoberdiary well done!!!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-25 17:52:24	Lovely lie in..quiet time with coffee and readings before meeting a friend for a walk..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-25 05:21:33	Bedtime for me with no alarm set as my therapist is away so a completely free day tomorrow..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-25 02:33:54	@mylaststand_org @sobermommabee yeah me too!!..at the time my sponsor said it was their issues and to do what my psychiatrist told me to..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-25 01:56:20	@mylaststand_org 2/2 need to take medications..thankfully it wasn't in my early days as it could have taken me out the rooms..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-25 01:55:12	@mylaststand_org really liked that..as someone with 'outside issues', which I also dislike, I have had a couple people comment about my 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-09-25 01:25:32	Mixed day at work and time flew by..treated myself to a new pair of Converse and now home with tea, feet up and Bergerac..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-24 03:46:57	@BeckyGetsSober that must have challenging and yes I expect a lot of similar behaviours..definitely need for laughter..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-24 02:40:46	@BeckyGetsSober they are!..what do you do?..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-24 00:49:04	And we do laugh a lot at work too which is good..think we almost have to, to balance out how much misery we see..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-24 00:48:09	All go again at work today..think I'm handling it better and today a few of us sat around late after an incident and it helped loads..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-23 03:46:46	Sponsor said it's important to stay very close to the fellowship so upping my meetings this week..doing what's suggested has worked so far..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-23 03:44:42	Made a phone call to arrange to see someone on my amends list..first one..really fearful about this step..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-23 00:22:28	Nice calm day at work..adding lots of upcoming training and shadowing to my calendar so new stuff coming up soon which is all good..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-22 14:47:29	Bit hard to get moving this morning but off to work I go..still feels odd saying that!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-22 03:51:38	Getting into bed early to unwind with a book..looking forward to work, being kept busy leaves less time to think..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-22 00:55:21	But that of course doesn't have an immediate effect on the actual anxiety already present so stuck with that till it eases..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-22 00:54:21	Just don't feel I can face trying to work things out tonight so putting it off as I can't deal with the anxiety it provokes..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-22 00:52:07	Sudden surge of anxiety when working out finances..knew it would be tight working part time but not realized it would quite this tight!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-21 20:39:56	@NotDrunk1124 it is!!..and I am!!..wishing you a nice day too..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-21 18:47:54	Bits of housework done but not in the mood for it today..son is out with a friend so I get to read with coffee..yeh!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-21 17:39:00	One hundred percent sleep quality according to Sleep Cycle..first time I've had that and I do feel rested..wonders of modern technology..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-21 05:00:55	We watched Beverly Hills Cop..a classic..now bedtime..not getting much rest this weekend but hopefully willl get a good nights sleep..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-21 00:34:38	And finally it's home time..tea and reading while my son is out of the house..my feet are so sore, times like this I wish I had a foot spa..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-20 23:14:42	As per usual that all took longer than I intended and I'm knackered now..still food shopping to do before I can relax as well..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-20 15:52:26	Morning..up earlier than I would like to face some Oxford St shopping..better to get it done early to have the rest of the day free..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-20 04:41:54	My boy is home for the weekend and apparently we're watching Friends..from the beginning..not seen it in years!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-20 01:33:57	@sobermommabee that's brilliant congrats!!..enjoy your meeting..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-20 00:29:00	Quick trip to the shops then it's sofa time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-19 22:17:24	Also have four mosquito bites that have gone very red and itchy..generally in a bit of a moaning mood but guess that's allowed..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-19 22:16:23	Really good meeting and chats with people after..still feel exhausted though so am sure I have some kind of virus..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-19 17:10:30	Twelve hours sleep and now I feel hungover..can't seem to win..never mind, strong coffee then a meeting should help..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-19 03:11:24	Feel evened out after the meeting today..and another one planned tomorrow..time well spent when not working..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-19 00:53:15	@Joe20140518 excellent!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-19 00:49:54	Lovely afternoon, great meeting and a good catch up during walk there and back..now feet up with tea and CSI..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-18 19:29:58	But without looking at it I can't begin to understand how it affects me still..it's all interesting but also really hard going..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-18 19:28:09	We're unearthing a lot of stuff from childhood that is still influencing me today and that can be hard to look at..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-18 19:26:29	Quick stop at home after another tough therapy session but glad I'm going back out so I don't end up dwelling on it all day..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-18 16:20:49	@queer_potato hope she settled before too long..and Happy Birthday to you!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-18 16:19:44	Morning..very tired and still not over this cold but off to therapy and then seeing a friend for a meeting..really need one!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-18 05:19:24	@queer_potato lying down with her for awhile and see if she cries herself out?..hoping she settles soon..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-18 05:12:47	Herbal tea, book and bed..lovely..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-18 02:06:18	@SaveLifeworks thank you!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-18 00:43:42	Just planned a walk and a meeting tomorrow with a good friend so something to look forward to as well..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-18 00:42:26	So kind of watched it all play out from the safety of my desk..my working week done and I'm looking forward to a quiet evening..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-18 00:41:04	Crazy day at work..at one point two lots of police for two clients but at the same time!!..thankfully though I wasn't directly involved..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-17 03:23:31	I don't know how people fit in doing stuff before or after work..maybe I'm still adjusting to it but I just couldn't do anything else..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-17 03:21:47	Am finding on days I work that the evenings fly by and before I know it I'm getting ready for bed again..feels very repetitive..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-17 00:56:59	Finally a quiet day at work..caught up on paperwork and generally felt calm and at ease..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-16 04:00:50	Early to bed for me..been a long day..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-16 01:19:49	@Fionaok oh yes I saw you're looking into taking some classes..great idea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-16 01:18:54	@PaulStreetPerth all happened very quickly but was visibly shaky after it..much better now thank you..good old cup of tea doing its job!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-16 00:58:56	@Fionaok thanks Fiona, it's often the nature of the work unfortunately..cup of tea and t.v now to relax..hope you're well doing well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-16 00:57:27	@BeckyGetsSober yes I radioed for assistance and it was there in seconds..supported through the afternoon by my manager which was great..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-16 00:55:57	I've seen it happen before but first time it was aimed at me..very happy to be home and able to unwind from it all..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-16 00:55:03	What a day!!..verbally and physically threatened by a client so an afternoon of police and incident forms to fill out..was a bit shaken..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-15 14:46:08	Managed to get up and dressed but today is going to be a struggle..and Mondays are always busy..hey ho, it's off to work I go..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-15 04:22:29	Bed calling..need as much rest as possible to face work tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-15 00:29:13	Lovely nap followed by tea and biscuits..much needed energy to face the ironing..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-15 00:26:18	@oxymoronic82 and rightly so, she is beautiful..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-14 21:33:57	@oxymoronic82 ha ha I remember saying the same and doing the opposite!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-14 21:17:32	Brief walk and I'm exhausted from it..my legs just didn't want to take part at all..off for another nap..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-14 19:25:27	Testing myself by going for a little local walk..need some fresh air after what feels like ages indoors..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-14 17:19:02	Twelve hours sleep and I'm finally feeling less achey..though still sniffly and coughing..but think worst has passed, hope so anyway..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-14 00:14:54	@oxymoronic82 yeh!!..wishing you a lovely first night in with your family..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-14 00:13:41	@BeckyGetsSober you are absolutely right, thank you!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-13 20:43:21	Just bluurgghh..trying not to worry about being ill on Monday as I don't want to take time off work..but feel really rough..nap time..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-13 18:12:54	@oxymoronic82 lovely picture Sophie..you look so happy!!..x
274535898	act1175	2014-09-13 17:38:27	Really long deep sleep but still feeling lousy..guess it's another quiet day of resting for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-13 04:11:26	Aware I've barely been online but really knocked by this cold so mostly resting and reading..early night now too..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-12 20:18:52	Made it to local shop and back but has totally drained me..tomato soup for lunch now then back to sofa..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-12 18:14:24	Realized I have to go out for food but attempting to get dressed is draining me..so achey and just miserable..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-12 16:02:58	Morning..still full of cold and aching..another day on the sofa needed..plus side is getting lots of reading done..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-12 00:27:21	@LithiumLibGirl thank you..am curled up on sofa under a blanket with a book..resting lots..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 20:52:01	Not feeling at all well..could feel it coming on during the week but kept going for work..now I need to rest with lemon and honey tea..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 19:01:35	Therapy hard going again but nobody ever said change was easy..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 16:04:48	I've woken with a full blown cold..sniffly, sore throat and achey..will get to therapy then have a quiet day reading..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 04:14:34	@queer_potato oh she's beautiful and such a pretty name..so pleased for you all..enjoy these precious moments..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 01:38:51	@BipolarBlogger that would be nice yes..I only know two people on here in 'real life'..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 01:36:18	@BeckyGetsSober it's great you're recognizing which bits work and being honest, which you've been, is really hard..so keep going..x
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 01:32:28	@BipolarBlogger I had someone recognize me from the Mind article!..was work based but still a bit odd..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 01:29:42	@BeckyGetsSober how are you doing?..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 01:29:26	@BeckyGetsSober yes he is very understanding that working with our clients can be difficult at times and aims to help me manage that..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 00:46:53	And I am now probably over thinking it all..time for tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 00:46:05	Immediately though my head went to it being a bad thing..probably because that's my default setting as he hasn't pulled me aside at all..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 00:44:56	2/2 overwhelmed last week..which I was a bit but thought I'd covered it..don't think he meant it in a bad way, more concerned I was okay..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-11 00:43:41	Home and feet up..feel exhausted and a bit worried that it's tiring me this much..my boss asked if I'd had a better week?..said I seemed 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 20:11:43	@recovereveryday congratulations!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 20:11:08	@sobersometimes that's brilliant!!..congratulations..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 14:58:16	@queer_potato congratulations!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 13:57:03	Especially tough getting up this morning and first coffee not done much as eyelids still very heavy..more coffee needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 13:35:36	@oxymoronic82 Congratulations!!!!..so pleased for you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 04:29:10	@PauMusico have followed the dogs to stay in touch..there's a sentence I never thought I'd write!!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 03:40:05	@oxymoronic82 so sorry you're having such a difficult time..sending love and hugs and hope it's not much longer for you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 03:21:33	Can imagine if I told mum she'd still question my watching it even now!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 03:19:34	Watching old episodes of Bread..had to watch it sneakily when it was 1st on because they didn't speak 'properly' according to my mum..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 02:06:38	@jadiepye no worries, thanks for asking!..had my first supervision last week and I'm doing very well in their eyes so all good there..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 01:50:20	@jadiepye oh no the job is going fine..mistakes over my housing benefit claim that I'm trying to get sorted..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 01:46:42	@jadiepye which bit are you questioning?..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 01:04:28	Now it's back to waiting for the letter with a decision..but until then it's out of my hands so time for feet up and a bit of t.v..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-10 01:03:20	Another busy day but I coped better..took more regular breaks by just leaving my desk for a bit which helped..and benefit office done..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-09 05:08:33	@oxymoronic82 Just caught up!..wishing you loads of luck and will be thinking of you..will check in at work now to see the progress!!..x
274535898	act1175	2014-09-09 04:45:45	I remember my dad saying if we had been in the states my hospital stay would have bankrupted my family.. #withoutthenhs
274535898	act1175	2014-09-09 04:39:42	#withoutthenhs I would have died 4 years ago..they kept me alive for 3 weeks and have monitored me ever since..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-09 03:38:23	@ccbaxter so much cuteness..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-09 02:12:18	Peanut butter on toast for dinner because I'm craving comfort food..will follow with fruit to feel healthy..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-09 01:16:55	For now I'm practicing self care with sweet tea and a hot bubble bath running..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-09 01:15:59	Did get a bit stressed today and moved into elevated mood which still there so need to look at how to avoid that in the future if possible..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-09 01:14:46	Very busy day so missed benefit office but boss going to help me write a letter and letting me leave early tomorrow to get it done..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-08 13:49:22	Morning..bit of a struggle getting up but coffee is doing it's job nicely while I do my readings..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-08 04:13:10	Early night so I start the week rested and ready to face benefit office after work..going to be a long day..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-08 03:08:07	@thesoberdiary that's great!!..I too have boxes and boxes of tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-08 01:47:38	@Fionaok beautiful picture..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-08 00:27:14	Now I tackle the ironing pile..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-08 00:24:38	Nice walk over to the Southbank where we sat in the sun and chatted away..love having genuine honest friendships..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-07 20:59:00	Feel sad he rarely leaves his house but also will not allow us to visit..it's his choice I know but wish he knew how much it affects others.
274535898	act1175	2014-09-07 20:56:30	Housework done and as predicted dad has cancelled..sun is shining so I'm going to meet a friend for a walk..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-07 18:05:02	Quiet housework day today..possibly seeing my dad later but he usually cancels at the last minute..if he does I'll have a walk by the river.
274535898	act1175	2014-09-07 17:12:21	Waking to the sad news that someone has been arrested for murder in the #findalice case..thoughts and prayers are with her family..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-07 16:53:46	@Ghoulgirl @nikimummy13 @_ck_supergirl excellent choice!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-07 04:51:06	@thesoberdiary well done for getting through it..that's a huge achievement!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-07 04:04:07	@PauMusico sounds lovely..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-09-07 01:50:15	Currently curled up with tea and biscuits watching New Tricks..much, much calmer thankfully..

274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 23:14:24	At the end of the day this is not my fault and so I have to calmly explain situation then let it go..repeats to self all will be okay..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 23:12:45	Coffee with sponsor who reassured me all will be okay if I just do the next right thing..seeing as I can't do that till Monday just relax..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 23:11:29	Lovely meeting and everyone very pleased about my 4 years..they, of course, can see much more change than I notice myself..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 18:10:01	Heading out to a meeting and coffee after with my sponsor..really need it today..she will be able to right size things for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 17:46:30	@BipolarBlogger which is I'm sure how they will see it..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 17:45:55	@BipolarBlogger I don't want to grass her up, as it were, so will go talk to her Monday..but I also don't want to be seen to be lying..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 17:17:57	@BipolarBlogger 2/2 housing benefit can see difference between dates and I have to explain..burden of proof on me so feel a bit lost..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 17:16:31	@BipolarBlogger thought I had finished!..lady at job centre knew I'd have no money for August so delayed signing off but of course now 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 17:14:38	And I have a horrible feeling the blame will be placed on me when I've done everything absolutely correctly..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 17:13:29	Already been served a notice of seeking possession so I have very little time to get this sorted..I hate bureaucracy with a vengeance..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 17:11:46	Palpitations and I feel nauseated at the thought of having to go back to job centre and then supplying more info to housing officer..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 16:57:10	Aaarrrgggghhhh...
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 16:56:54	Was due to worker at job centre delaying signing me off to help me out but in fact she has caused more problems!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 16:55:59	Woke to the post arriving..discrepancy between date I started work and date ESA stopped which I have to explain..immediate anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-06 16:53:56	@jadiepye @antenabu @mirry_mirry @SuzeH75 @nikimummy13 @Ghoulgirl @DomJBrown @realpigeon @richardkhornsey @kerryfrench77 thanks Stuart!..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-09-04 18:59:17	Going to treat myself to a bunch of flowers then head to a meeting..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-04 18:58:17	Therapy was good but cried loads..feel we're really getting to the root of some things but that's bloody painful..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-04 06:36:18	@anhedonia11 thank you lovely!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-04 05:29:57	@FlamingSarah thank you..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-09-04 02:22:10	It's amazing that 4 years ago I was in a coma on full life support after liver and kidney failure and massive internal bleeding.. #blessed
274535898	act1175	2014-09-04 02:20:33	Thanks to everyone who has taken time to congratulate me..all done one day at a time.. pic.twitter.com/JPnAV8muTh
274535898	act1175	2014-09-04 02:17:48	Long day at work with first supervision session but got all good feedback so was worth it..

274535898	act1175	2014-09-03 14:11:14	Yet here I am..sober, working the steps and very very grateful to be alive..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-03 14:10:25	Morning..four years sober today..always have mixed feelings as I was so close to death that even doctors held little hope of my survival..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-03 04:23:54	Aware I'm still feel like I just want to be quiet and alone..glad I can have early nights with a good excuse..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-03 01:26:01	Caved in at lunchtime and took some pain relief but it's only just kicking in..not a great day at all but I got by..very happy to be home..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-03 01:24:13	Complicated database work and headaches don't mix well..throw in someone shredding all afternoon as well and that was my day..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-02 14:06:02	@nikimummy13 thanks!..enjoy your session..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-02 14:04:49	Can't call in sick this early in a job so will have to muddle through, though I really want to go back to bed..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-02 14:03:45	Woke with a headache and sore throat..not sure if mental state affecting physical or other way around..doesn't really matter I guess..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-02 04:12:28	But for now it's cereal and toast in front of the telly..lazy comfort food..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-02 04:11:13	Really need to get back to the gym..not been and have low mood..could be connected..will make myself go on Thursday..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-02 00:41:37	Having sweet tea and watching some CSI to unwind..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-02 00:40:52	Got through the day but acutely aware wan't really taking things in as well as I normally do and the day dragged on..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-01 14:06:02	Morning..my mood is still a little low but I'm glad I have something to do today that will get me out of my head and helping others..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-01 04:19:36	@BipolarBlogger will do!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-09-01 03:40:16	Not eaten enough but not hungry either..want to get today over with..tomorrow is a new day and back to work so hoping for a lift in mood..
274535898	act1175	2014-09-01 03:38:16	@Fionaok take care of yourself..x
274535898	act1175	2014-09-01 02:03:23	Very quiet day trying not to worry about feeling low..accepting it is what it is and it will pass..chat with a fellowship friend helped..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-31 20:39:43	@BeckyGetsSober thanks Becky..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-31 20:28:05	Thank god for books..I can lose myself in someone else's world rather than thinking of my own..a cop out maybe but it feels safe..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-31 18:51:22	Managed to get up but really want to go back to bed..feeling lethargic and sad..have housework to do but it feels too overwhelming..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-31 04:50:27	I'm here for Columbotv but mostly in spirit..feeling a bit low so will probably head to bed at some point..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-31 03:05:27	@RibenaRat ha ha they're lovely aren't they?..I never wear tights, use the hold up ones..love them!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-31 02:48:07	Mood has taken a plunge..feel sad and just want to sleep..can't identify why though..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-31 01:58:36	@Fionaok that's a positive way to look at it..he's very lucky to have you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-31 01:23:08	@Fionaok sounds like a nice day!..until the ironing that is..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-30 23:13:35	@Fionaok have seen it advertised but not sure when it's released..having a lovely day thanks, hope you are too!..x
274535898	act1175	2014-08-30 22:11:15	Am reading Before I go to Sleep and am gripped by it..wanted to read it before I see the movie..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-30 22:10:15	Great meeting..chat with my sponsor and lunch was lovely too!!..good catch up with some dear friends..now going to settle down with my book.

274535898	act1175	2014-08-30 02:39:01	Peppermint tea and a hot bath..lovely relaxing way to end the day..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-30 01:22:01	@jaq1979_jacqui @jadiepye @AnnaLouiseMagee @jacqt64 @columbophile brilliant, welcome!!..it's Death hits the Jackpot..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-30 00:56:51	@LithiumLibGirl mine doesn't very often so lovely when she does..cat therapy..hope yours helps you too..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-30 00:25:24	Blissful nap followed by tea and biscuits..now a quiet evening planned with cat on lap..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-29 21:44:40	Good meeting which I really needed..exhausted now though so it's nap time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-29 19:37:40	@BeckyGetsSober thanks!..though not even lunchtime yet, was on an early shift!..meeting now then a well earned nap..hope you're well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-29 15:51:11	Shift done and I've walked 6.2 miles this morning..going to stay up to get to a meeting then crash this afternoon..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-29 15:49:00	@johna19402 @peterwoolf57 @RichAA2303 @JoannieCo @freexer @J2RDave @SianEWest @5araSmiles morning!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-29 11:13:24	Slept through alarm so have half an hour to get ready before the cab arrives..awful start to the day..hope it improves..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-29 03:18:59	Going to attempt to sleep as the alarm is going off at 3.15am..so not looking forward to it..but I'm paid to do it so hey ho..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 22:48:32	I had forgotten just how wiped out I feel after therapy..happily curled up on sofa with Bergerac..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 20:29:58	Off to get local chores done before trying to get a very early night for another 5am shift tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 18:45:17	Was actually really good to have the space to talk about things I had been trying to deal with myself..successful therapy session..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 15:51:29	Morning..back to therapy today after a month off & I don't really want to go..feel settled and almost like I don't need to go..but I will..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 06:17:27	Bedtime..yeh!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 05:31:59	@JohnnyStep2 2/2 and bring the perpetrators to justice..we hope..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 05:31:32	@JohnnyStep2 no the people resigning were responsible for area involved, local councillor & senior police officer..now they investigate 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 04:34:06	It's been a long day but a good one too..a real sense of accomplishment and dare I say I feel quite proud of myself..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 04:30:35	@JohnnyStep2 yep it's all come out today..senior people resigning but that does little to help the victims..my thoughts are with them today.
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 04:20:56	Winter pyjamas in August..think that's a first for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 02:20:34	@BipolarBlogger so sorry to read what happened to you today..hope you're taking care of yourself..x
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 01:36:26	@Fionaok Thank you!!..x
274535898	act1175	2014-08-28 01:18:40	Another days training done and I have two certificates..huge for me, only ever had ones from school days so really feel I've earned these!!.
274535898	act1175	2014-08-27 15:00:46	Morning..more law training today and thankfully I feel rested for it..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-27 04:45:48	@nikimummy13 sounds like a fantastic day..enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-27 04:16:33	Problem is on days off I sleep later so it's harder to turn around again..maybe I'll start getting up earlier every day..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-27 04:14:54	Fully warmed up and fed..almost time for bed..evenings are definitely shorter now I'm working and still adjusting to early nights..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-27 00:53:33	I had wet feet all day after stupidly wearing Converse so am very happy to have fluffy socks on and hot tea to hand..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-27 00:51:38	2/2 to be able to challenge this using lots of case law..a lot to take in but hopefully will be so useful at work..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-27 00:50:16	Homelessness law is very complex..what is shocking is the lengths councils go to to avoid housing vulnerable people..we're learning how 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-08-26 14:58:31	@PauMusico thanks, I'm looking forward to it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-26 14:16:03	Morning..start of two days of homelessness law training today..back to using my brain after a few days off!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-26 01:32:18	Am soaked but thoroughly enjoyed my walk..needed some fresh air to feel like I'd done something today..also stopped for tea and cake..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-25 23:12:17	Feeling antsy at being in all day..going to have a walk in the rain..I may regret this..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-25 19:16:33	I love the rain as long as I don't have to out in it..which I don't today so yeh!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-25 00:22:47	Have read most of a book and that's about it..so a successful Sunday in my opinion..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-24 19:10:15	Lazy Sunday with coffee and a book in bed..lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-24 04:32:21	@DastardlyDeano @djellicon @d3sk @GregMcCambley @CitizenScreen @Dene71 @DomJBrown @echidnabot I'll be there next week..enjoy!!..

274535898	act1175	2014-08-23 03:26:04	My son is now an hour late home and I had to ring him to find out why!!..there will be words..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-23 02:50:14	@BipolarBlogger ah okay, my modified release is always Seroquel on the script bit the normal release changes..wonder why?..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-23 02:31:21	@BipolarBlogger why not Seroquel?
274535898	act1175	2014-08-23 02:00:14	@oxymoronic82 oh I bet you are!!..your going to be such a fantastic mother, speckle is very lucky to have you both..x
274535898	act1175	2014-08-23 01:50:22	@oxymoronic82 just too exciting!!..can you dm your address when you have a chance..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-23 01:21:49	@BeckyGetsSober hot tea..a very British thing..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-23 00:45:30	@BeckyGetsSober I love my tea!..I leave teabag to brew for a few minutes, add teaspoon of sugar and milk..perfect with biscuits/cookies..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-23 00:28:38	Nap went wrong with a phone call and door buzzer waking me, each time just as I was dropping off..having sweet tea instead to perk me up..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 22:24:05	Nap time..zzzzzzzzzzz..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 20:14:19	Okay I am now too tired to think straight yet have things I have to do..plan is to get them done then have a very long afternoon nap..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 19:10:46	@Fionaok thanks Fiona, yes it feels great!!..hope your day goes well too..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 18:37:52	@oxymoronic82 indeed!!..now have to make it last a month..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 18:32:25	First pay cheque has hit my bank account!!..how exciting..we're having Nandos tonight to celebrate..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 16:45:47	@BeckyGetsSober it will pass!!..if you can, try and have a nap or just some quiet time..you're doing great!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 16:27:59	@BeckyGetsSober isn't it just!!..I've already worked 5-8.30 am..no way on earth I could have done that when drinking..have a good day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 16:08:07	Very bizarre coming home as others are going to work..not done that in years!..feel like I have jet lag without the enjoyment of a holiday..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 10:33:14	Slept badly, I think because I knew I had to be up at a ridiculous time..eyelids heavy as I attempt to wake with coffee..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 03:58:41	@BeckyGetsSober thanks!..nearly there now..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 03:31:36	I know a lot of the anxiety is doing something new and unknown but could do without it for sure..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 03:30:47	Taken meds early but still waiting for my son to come home before I can go to bed..bath has helped a little but not feeling great at all..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 02:18:13	Trying to unwind for an early night but anxiety seems to have other plans..mixed with a touch of elevated mood not sure what's going on..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 02:05:18	@jadiepye it's happened to me too..don't like it, and it's always someone with thousands of followers..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-22 00:40:37	@sobermommabee thank you..will be a couple of weeks before I hear back..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 22:45:38	Meanwhile all paperwork now with housing office and picked up a hc1 form in hope that I qualify for it..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 22:44:06	I have my first outreach shift tomorrow..starts at 5am so I need to be up at 3.15am..going to be tough but at least a cab takes me in..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 22:41:47	@LithiumLibGirl will do..thank you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 20:12:25	@LithiumLibGirl I don't no as just started work trying to work it all out..think I may be able to get help with a hc1 form so trying that!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 18:32:23	@_ck_supergirl now that is an emergency!!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 18:31:52	@charlotteb297 that's brilliant Charlotte well done!!!..x
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 17:31:11	@PauMusico true, I've managed years on very little £ but had help with prescriptions etc..all that going is quite scary..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 17:29:13	@BipolarBlogger that's why I'm drafting a letter to my M.P to say I've been given no support at all..It's all been made very hard for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 17:19:46	@PauMusico that's a good idea..thanks will try that..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 17:19:02	@BipolarBlogger exactly!!..there is no in between support at all..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 17:14:47	@PauMusico @CitizensAdviceD tried them and can get housing benefit but that's all..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 17:14:07	@BipolarBlogger no I don't work 30 hours a week so can't claim it..that's the one I thought I'd get but alas no..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 17:12:42	I don't meet requirements for p.i.p but would have for dla before they abolished it..prescriptions alone will cost me nearly £100 a month!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 17:09:39	I knew working part time would be hard but thought would be entitled to some benefit other than housing but apparently not..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 17:08:33	Woke feeling quite anxious about how little money I have to live on and how I'll manage to get by..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 01:32:47	@BipolarBlogger I know!!..with knowledge I have power..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 01:31:37	@drinksinthedark been discharged?..I was seen for a year by a psychiatrist for him to monitor me over time!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 01:28:57	I knew I was entitled to some element of help with rent but was told I wasn't..now I can show them the exact law that states I am..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 01:27:25	Got some good advice from the trainer for myself too..can now quote law to my housing office which I will take great pleasure in!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-21 01:25:17	Another really good days training on new housing benefit laws..a lot to take in and get my head around but will help so much at work..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-20 04:18:12	Course leader has kindly agreed to see me early tomorrow for advice on my situation before the training starts so early night for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-20 01:05:53	I need tea and mindless t.v..an episode of Diagnosis Murder should do the trick..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-20 01:04:45	A full day of welfare benefits training and I cannot take in any more information today!!..brilliantly run though and learned loads..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-19 14:32:38	Was nice to have an extra hour in bed as I have training days today and tomorrow..but it's cold so could happily have stayed in bed!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-19 04:26:27	Treated myself to a london cheesecake and now I'm stuffed..worth it though..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-19 00:53:13	And I still almost want to pinch myself to see if it's really me doing all this..but it is!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-19 00:51:34	I really enjoy going to work & the sense of satisfaction when I sit down for the evening..also my moods remain stable so all is well..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-18 13:43:01	Morning..have been using Sleep Cycle and it definitely helps with not feeling like I'm being dragged out of sleep..though still need coffee!
274535898	act1175	2014-08-18 03:06:47	Son staying with a friend so curled up watching Law and Order..lovely sunday evening..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-17 21:10:25	Jeans, long sleeve top and boots in August!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-17 17:56:22	"Nothing will ever be attempted if all possible objections must be first overcome" Samuel Johnson
274535898	act1175	2014-08-17 16:48:57	Wow it's cold this morning..taking coffee back to bed to do my readings..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-17 05:44:02	Tokyo Drift my least favourite so far but that could be because Paul Walker wasn't in it..I embarrass my son by drooling over him..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-17 03:16:16	@Lesism no worries!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-17 03:10:27	@Lesism unfollowed?..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-08-17 02:14:08	We've done barbers and had a walk and now settling in for the evening..spaghetti bolognese and Tokyo Drift tonight..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-16 17:21:06	Morning..good sleep but could have done without being woken to the smoke alarm going off for no reason..coffee time..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-16 06:04:46	Making spelling mistakes..definitely need sleep..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-16 05:44:38	Goibg to bed in the hope that another good sleep will help me feel back on track..hate feeling so exhausted..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-16 04:43:54	Tired, have a headache and feeling quite sorry for myself without any real reason to be which makes me feel worse..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-16 03:28:42	@BipolarBlogger me too..only fluffy socks do the job for me..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-16 02:15:33	@sobermommabee brilliant!!..well done and enjoy your well deserved treats..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-16 01:37:09	Tea and a new Elmore Leonard book while my son swims with a friend..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-16 01:00:38	Meeting, library and shopping done..otherwise been spending time with my boy..bit emotional today but think still a little tired..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-15 17:24:47	Lovely long deep sleep..much needed..todays first priority is a meeting as not been for nearly two weeks..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-15 17:22:40	@jadiepye @SuzeHarkin75 @rust_dave @_ck_supergirl @mirry_mirry @RJ_Hinton @DomJBrown @OuttaWays @kerryfrench77 @nikimummy13 thanks Stuart!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-15 04:47:43	@BeckyGetsSober thanks..heading to bed now..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-15 02:25:46	Thought I was just very tired and maybe that's all it is but it's really floored me today..guess will only know after a good nights sleep..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-15 02:23:35	Really don't feel very well..absolutely exhausted and having hot flushes..definitely something up..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-14 22:49:38	Lots of things done but I am so tired I feel shaky..time to put my feet up for a bit..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-14 16:10:50	@Living608 absolutely!..a natural buzz from being amongst your own..can't beat it..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-14 16:07:57	@Living608 I love conventions..hope you have a great time!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-14 16:05:46	Lots of little chores to get done today before an evening event at work..feeling a bit of anxiety so easing into the day gently..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-14 16:02:32	@Living608 @mylaststand_org @SecrtSlayrPearl @ChelsieCharmed @RichAA2303 @KLENandSOBR @TheMethMaze morning!..have a great day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-14 05:42:20	@MariesVoicexoxo welcome to London!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-14 04:43:23	@EvieM9 okay that's good..took me awhile to work it out too..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-14 04:40:18	@Living608 best of luck!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-14 04:00:11	@EvieM9 hi Evie didn't realize it was out yet!..happy to chat if you need..here or by direct message..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-14 03:11:40	No energy to cook so peanut butter on toast for dinner..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-14 00:46:02	Busy, busy day juggling clients and two meetings with senior staff..but got through it all!!..time for tea and some mindless t.v..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-13 03:10:57	@BeckyGetsSober you can't possibly disturb them!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-13 01:46:32	@LithiumLibGirl sounds lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-13 00:36:09	Another days work done..a busy one with some quite challenging clients but it went well overall..time for tea and biscuits..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-12 19:41:45	@Living608 @mylaststand_org @SecrtSlayrPearl @studioLonline @ChelsieCharmed @BlueOctoberPA @AlcoTodd @Recovering_Alch @RichAA2303 afternoon!
274535898	act1175	2014-08-12 13:49:35	Had more sleep so feel much better..not quite ready to face the world yet but coffee doing it's job nicely!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-12 13:48:06	@oxymoronic82 was wonderful!..definitely doing that again..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-12 04:03:36	Bed at 9pm..bliss..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-12 01:52:24	@Natalie_Oxford lovely picture..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-12 01:51:32	Fourteen years ago today I became a mum..I thought I couldn't possibly love him more than when he was born but I love him more every year..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-12 00:51:22	Today was hard..clear indicator that I need more than seven hours sleep before work..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-11 20:24:57	Struggling today..very, very tired..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-08-11 14:05:21	Tired this morning but knew I would be..bit irritable too and hoping that will pass before I get to work..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-11 13:39:04	@queer_potato yes you won't be able to eat the garlic after but it will remove the dried bits..then washed throughly can refill again..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-11 04:54:42	Hard coming home late and trying to unwind as I know I have to sleep to get up for work..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-11 04:51:50	@queer_potato soak with vinegar..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-11 04:05:37	I'll be saying some prayers tonight and tomorrow is a new day..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-11 04:04:32	Bit sad that it didn't go quite as I may have hoped but it's out of my control..one day they may see the error of their ways..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-11 04:00:49	Been a long day but mostly lovely..bit of tension at my mums but not caused by me so stayed out of it as much as possible..home now..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-10 16:58:42	Lovely waking to the sound of the rain but hoping it eases up before we go out..cinema then birthday tea for my son at my mums today..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-10 03:15:20	Pizza for dinner with new Modern Family dvd..all is well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-10 02:20:10	We've had a lovely day just hanging out and catching up..I treasure these times..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-09 19:05:57	@Fionaok thank you Fiona!!..hope you have a lovely weekend..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-09 18:11:43	Morning..today will be a few chores but mostly relaxing..lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-09 06:46:13	Finally it's bedtime..been a long week..but got my boy with me now so all is well..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-09 01:39:09	@karen12steps happened to me couple years ago when Dad was in hospital..I was very surprised for same reason..they see us change..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-09 01:14:07	@sobersometimes it's a great place to be honest so use it just as you are..usually always someone around so you feel less alone..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-09 00:43:25	@sobersometimes then you are definitely going to the right place..take it minute by minute if you have to..sending love and support..x
274535898	act1175	2014-08-09 00:40:30	@oxymoronic82 thank you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-09 00:08:04	Last few bits of shopping done so going to curl up on the sofa with tea and my book..feeling very tired today so need some quiet time..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-09 00:03:56	Interesting day..training was, by their own admission, badly organised but picked up what they were trying to get across..just..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-09 00:01:07	@BeckyGetsSober @sobersometimes glad we're helping even if it's just by getting up!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-08 16:47:16	@sobersometimes ha ha I like that answer!!..:-) Hope you have a good day..x
274535898	act1175	2014-08-08 16:45:56	@jadiepye true!..yes thanks it's all going really well..I enjoy it so much it's just a bonus being paid for it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-08 16:17:35	Morning..woke feeling a bit anxious about training afternoon today..and also about fitting in a bit more shopping..can only do my best..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-08 05:41:07	The cat has been staring at the floor in pounce position for 10 minutes..I can't see anything there!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-08 04:25:32	I haven't been able to get to a meeting this week but fellowship kicked in and had contact at least twice a day with solid members..lovely!.
274535898	act1175	2014-08-08 02:15:22	It's not that I've never worked before, I've just never done it sober so this is all new territory for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-08 02:13:34	Definitely a sense of satisfaction in signing off benefits but also a little scary..I'm responsible for me now..how grown up!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-08 02:06:01	Anxiety still quite high but am better equipped to deal with it at home..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-08 02:05:13	At one point I really thought I was going to have a panic attack but got off the main road and sat quietly focusing on breathing..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-08 02:03:40	Horrible day running around in the heat..but am signed off benefits and got my son some pressies so it's been productive..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-07 17:42:58	Too much to do so not doing any of it..time to write out a list of what I can realistically do and go from there..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-07 16:38:15	Morning..nice to get a little lie in before a busy day ahead birthday shopping for my boy..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-07 05:32:21	This feels like a late night now..how quickly things change..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-07 04:04:15	Well enjoyed that but predict there will be tears before the series is done.. #GBBO
274535898	act1175	2014-08-07 03:07:32	@oxymoronic82 hee hee..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-07 02:34:28	@oxymoronic82 oh dear and I'm about to watch it for first time too!..probably won't tweet about it though..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-07 02:19:31	@LithiumLibGirl thank you!..it's trainee project worker with people who are homeless..I'm really enjoying it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-07 01:02:32	Got through the day though I was flagging after lunch..but that's work done for this week..training day Friday but for now it's feet up..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-06 14:07:56	Morning..fell asleep on the sofa last night and woke at 3am so only got 3 hours in bed..feeling very sleepy..today might be tough..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-06 02:30:12	@_ck_supergirl thank you!..I feel vaguely like an adult now..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-06 02:29:40	Another bonus is we have 2 lovely new kittens at work..they are meant to be mouse catchers for the garden but in reality are being spoilt..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-06 02:24:47	@_ck_supergirl it's all really good..settling in well and everyone very welcoming..knackered though!!..will take awhile to get used to it..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-06 01:45:14	@_ck_supergirl @BritishBakeOff I hope I like it as my work week ends on a Wednesday so I can stay up for it!!..needing early nights for now.
274535898	act1175	2014-08-06 00:58:11	In quiet moments I do find myself being surprised at just how much my life has changed in nearly 4 years..I'm incredibly grateful for that..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-06 00:38:11	Another busy day..Tuesday is cake day so clients make them and staff get to buy them for 50p mid afternoon..I like this job!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-05 13:44:39	Morning..one thing I do like about being up early is how quiet it still is..ideal for coffee and readings..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-05 04:16:17	Goodness tired already, guess it's another early night for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-05 00:52:27	@jadiepye thank you..sure you'll hear more about it..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-05 00:47:39	Also one of the volunteers newly in the rooms so spent lunchtime chatting about recovery..bonus!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-05 00:46:43	@sobersometimes thank you!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-05 00:46:21	@jadiepye trainee project worker with people who are homeless and sleeping rough..same area I've been volunteering for awhile..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-05 00:45:04	I can tell already I'm really going to enjoy it all..but now I have definitely deserved a cup of tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-05 00:43:07	First day done!!..lots of computer stuff, setting up e-mail and calendars but was good..lots of training booked for me so going to be busy!
274535898	act1175	2014-08-04 13:59:32	@_ck_supergirl thank you!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-04 13:28:05	Bit of a shock to the system but I'm up..less anxious than yesterday..my biggest fear was not waking to alarm so all good so far..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-04 13:23:46	@jadiepye thank you!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-04 04:43:14	Early night so I'm as well rested as possible..can actually say I'm going to work tomorrow!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-04 03:08:21	@anhedonia11 thank you, and you are very welcome..you deserve a lovely day..x
274535898	act1175	2014-08-04 02:34:22	I've done all the preparation I can so time for tea and t.v to help me relax..still quite anxious but it's bearable now..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-04 02:33:18	Just had a visit from an old boss I've stayed in touch with..she gave me £50 in vouchers to get some new clothes for work!!..very kind..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-04 01:01:47	Walk and a chat has helped a bit but also accepting that starting a new job is bound to cause anxiety so trying to just allow it to be..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-04 01:00:34	@BillieGledhill hi Billie..I'm September 2010 and learning every day..look forward to your book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-03 22:30:22	Anxiety has been rising all day and feeling very shaky now..hoping a walk will help..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-03 21:15:25	@BeckyGetsSober that's a good feeling..well done you!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-03 20:58:43	@Fionaok Happy Birthday!!!!..wishing you a lovely day..x
274535898	act1175	2014-08-03 20:47:49	@oxymoronic82 ah fair enough!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-03 20:09:16	@oxymoronic82 buy a handmade cake and pretend you made it..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-03 19:47:43	Laundry and housework done..quick break for online games before facing a pile of ironing..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-03 17:33:47	Morning..a day of sorting clothes for work and meeting a friend for a walk..woke in a panic thinking it was tom and I'd slept through alarm!
274535898	act1175	2014-08-03 04:29:46	@sobersometimes yeh!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-03 01:24:28	@serpentgrr ah of course..a huge coping mechanism for me is reading..always slows my breathing down after a bit esp helpful on transport..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-03 00:52:41	Had a sort of doze and headache has eased a bit but not gone..sweet tea and Bergerac time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-03 00:51:49	@serpentgrr alternatives are good but don't be too hard on yourself..getting a grip can take a lifetime!..take each day as it comes..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 22:30:07	Good meeting and chats with a few people after..head still pounding though so heading for a lie down with my book..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 22:28:57	@serpentgrr thank you!..just downloaded it so will let you know..it's new so bound to come with anxiety..practicing acceptance helps too..:)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 17:28:15	Pounding headache so going out for a walk before a meeting..think some of it is tension about Monday..closer it gets, the more nervous I am.
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 16:33:07	Morning!..woke to the cat having a howling session..no idea why but wish I could get her to do it everyday..it's a great alternative alarm..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 05:45:10	@sobermommabee and such a change..when I was drinking my mum wouldn't have given me a pound as she knew what I would spend it on..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 04:58:01	Curled up on sofa with peppermint tea..it's been a long day today..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 04:15:26	@sobermommabee 2/2 very very lucky I have mum to help out but no idea what people who don't have support networks do!!..it's crazy..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 04:14:22	@sobermommabee yes worked out really well..the government here stop my welfare day I start work so no money for a month till I get paid 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 03:36:32	Have had a lovely dinner with mum and she has assured me she will help me get through the first month..huge relief and gratitude..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 00:06:23	Not a happy bunny right now..has put a real dampener on things..my head instantly going to panic mode..quite fairly I think!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 00:05:07	So that leaves me with no money for 4 weeks..It's madness..how am I meant to even get to work with no money..they push you to work then this
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 00:03:48	Housing benefit continues for a month as they understand you don't get paid till then..DWP doesn't care..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-02 00:01:31	CAB very helpful..but ESA stops the day I start work!!..how do they expect me to live through August??..no provision at all to help..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 20:19:44	@BeckyGetsSober thanks..you too!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 20:12:20	Now having a quick break for lunch before CAB appointment to find out about moving from benefits to work..all feeling very real now..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 20:08:05	Lovely catch up with my best friend and it's great we're both in good places with our lives..coffee and carrot cake together..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 16:07:30	Morning..lots on today..coffee with best friend, meeting, then seeing mum for shopping and dinner out to celebrate my new job..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 02:36:51	@serpentgrr sorry you had the same..and exactly!..even though I know what it is and where it comes from, it's very hard to change it..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 02:18:51	My sponsor always says it's none of my business what others think of me but it's still something I really struggle with..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 02:17:40	Still not at the point where I don't care, in fact far from it..was drilled into me as a kid that what others think matters most..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 02:15:40	One thing I'm really hoping work will help with is my self consciousness..when I'm busy I'm less aware of what people may be thinking of me.
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 01:58:09	Cat is teasing a spider..letting it go a little before shopping it again with her paw..she will do this till she is bored then eat it..
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 01:03:04	@oxymoronic82 pretty!..I do like a scatter cushion..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 00:44:30	@RJ_Hinton ha ha yes I did!!..was hoping noone would remember that..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-08-01 00:28:22	Feeling sleepy so treating myself to choc chip cookies for a sugar boost..I did go the gym so I'm allowed..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 21:36:51	Okay gym done though was a bit of a struggle seeing as I just didn't want to be there..can grab some lunch and read on the balcony now..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 18:27:05	@bythesheetstore only just getting back into it and the hardest part is leaving the house to go!!..enjoy your book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 18:25:19	@sobermikey @sobermommabee hi Mike..welcome to twitter..great recovery support here..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 18:23:49	The temptation to stay at home and read is great but to the gym I go..not in the mood for it but that's probably the best time to do it..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 16:32:39	Morning..no therapy today or for next 4 weeks for her summer break..could have done with it today but never mind..gym instead..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 05:19:24	But I will adjust..maybe need to write out a new weekly schedule to fit in gym and meetings..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 05:18:38	I do find it hard to unwind on the days I work..always ends up being a late night..going to be hard doing it days in a row..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 03:39:56	Having not so healthy nutella on toast but am going to the gym tomorrow so it balances out in my head..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 03:15:55	@oxymoronic82 mothers prerogative to tickle I say!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 02:30:30	@oxymoronic82 hee hee..fun!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 01:52:39	I start work next Monday!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-31 01:52:17	Bit of a long day in the end but home now with feet up..everyone congratulated me and was nice to feel appreciated for my time there..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-30 14:00:15	Last day of volunteering today..hugely grateful for the chance they gave me to help rebuild my confidence in a workplace..fond memories..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-30 02:04:49	Also good to start now as soon I'll be having to get up for work!!..still feels really odd to know I'm employed..been a long, long time..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-30 02:03:48	Trying to do everything earlier to get an early night..been staying up too late and waking late..that doesn't work for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-30 01:08:02	@cloud9point1 @TownFish_London British Heart Foundation are great and all over London..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-30 00:55:55	@MariesVoicexoxo so sorry Marie..x
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 22:40:52	Feeling much better..restarted my day at a meeting and now all is okay..going to have an afternoon read..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 20:08:37	@BeckyGetsSober thanks Becky..not always easy doing the next right thing, but when I do I really benefit from it..hope you have a good day!.
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 19:50:59	@Lesism thinking of you Les..everything will be okay in the end, if it's not okay, it's not the end.. One of my favourite quotes..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 18:59:43	Have changed plans for the day which makes me feel a little better..going to head to a meeting instead of lunch out..self care..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 18:37:29	Irritability is sky high..trying to read to bring it down but feel all off kilter so can't even concentrate on a book..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 17:36:04	@oxymoronic82 it really is!!..now I'm agitated and full of resentment and want to shout at the world!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 17:10:08	Startled awake by the phone ringing then having to talk..not my favourite way to start the day..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 02:50:25	@_ck_supergirl it is!!..though doesn't quite seem real yet without a start date..but will be so nice to rejoin the working world..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 02:06:49	@_ck_supergirl not sure, waiting on references and criminal record check..find out more Wednesday..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 00:41:20	@_ck_supergirl aw yes you've had a lot going on, pleased to read you're coming out of it now and looking forward to the future..x
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 00:31:29	I know some if them won't be at all easy or in anyway comfortable to do but through pain comes growth..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-29 00:30:23	Felt really good to get sorted direct, indirect and living amends..quite keen to get on with this step..feels like the right time..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 21:42:00	Now off to meet my sponsor so reading step 9 on the bus!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 21:41:12	3.5k uphill run and 3k rowing..felt good to be back and was sensible about not over doing it..will reintroduce weights on Thursday..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 19:21:50	Okay it's gym time..not been for ages so have to take it easy to start with..with part of me knowing I'll push myself that won't be easy..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 18:36:09	@johnmoloney66 it's a fine line between enough to wake up and function and too much which feeds anxiety..got it right..just for today..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 18:28:14	@johnmoloney66 yes I'm not very good at reducing coffee intake but have today only as I'm going to the gym..have stopped at 3..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 17:15:31	Not sure if anxiety is carried over from yesterday or if I have another rough day ahead..for now it's coffee and readings time..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 17:14:15	Morning..slept deeply but woke with anxiety palpitations..aiming to go to the gym before step 9 meeting with my sponsor..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 06:06:16	It's been a long tiring day so crawling into bed hoping for a better one tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 04:22:28	@BeckyGetsSober thanks Becky..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 03:12:44	Meds have kicked in and feel much calmer..have eaten and going to have a long soak in the bath..self care..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 02:16:05	@SarahTheodorou noted!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 02:07:00	@SarahTheodorou that's true..hadn't thought of it that way..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 01:25:16	After a long period of feeling stable todays high mood has really thrown me..spent too much money and not done that in a long time..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-28 01:03:40	Home having sweet tea whilst waiting for prn meds to kick in..today has gone nothing like I planned..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-27 23:53:23	Coffee on the southbank after book shopping at Foyles..spending money not yet earned..heading home after this though..need to for self care.
274535898	act1175	2014-07-27 23:51:58	@BeckyGetsSober yep..really affected by high mood today but it happens..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-27 22:44:03	Really should get home and attempt to bring myself down but am also enjoying myself to a degree..very conflicting feelings..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-27 22:42:48	Food shopping somehow turned into clothes shopping..buying things I'll never wear and very chatty with shop staff..all bad signs..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-27 20:15:54	Fuzzy head cleared and housework done..now food shopping..feeling a little too energetic for my liking and it's not coffee induced..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-27 18:15:23	Woke early but kept dozing and now I feel rough..fuzzy head and sore throat..strong coffee needed and plenty of it!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-27 06:40:56	While it's been a nice day it also feels like it's gone on forever..bed with a book time..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-27 05:12:04	@sobermommabee that sounds amazing..enjoy!!!!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-27 04:24:59	@sobermommabee happy birthday!!!..hope it's a great day for you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-27 03:46:51	@Natalie_Oxford I saw it last week..let me know what you think..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-27 02:25:14	The cats favourite new toy is a tennis ball..after she chases it though, she licks it!!..very odd..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-26 21:19:32	Don't usually do food tweets but lunch from local Italian deli is yummy!!.. pic.twitter.com/sB3lCYdwVB
274535898	act1175	2014-07-26 21:10:52	Really good meeting and catch up with my sponsor..looking forward to seeing her Monday for a talk through step 9..now balcony with book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-26 17:39:42	Morning..really good sleep, feel refreshed and ready for the day..coffee and readings then a meeting planned..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-26 07:23:12	@queer_potato you should be okay..maybe it dozed off then remembered it needed to be awake..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-26 07:00:41	@queer_potato my sons did once..no reason but nothing changed..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-26 05:41:58	@andyholl that is stunning!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-26 04:43:28	@FitHubCG absolutely!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-26 04:22:11	Not been keeping up with the healthy food very well this week and feel sluggish..need to get to the gym and turn lazy eating habits around..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-26 01:54:32	Had to go back out to pick up new glasses so t.v much clearer again!!..time for tea and some CSI New York..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-25 23:03:21	Really good meeting and people really pleased about the job for me..nice catch up afterwards but then soaked coming home..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-25 18:26:20	Heading out to a meeting..anxiety not abating so hoping getting out and being amongst the fellowship will help..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-25 17:43:25	@LilMissFeelings thanks and hope it passes for you too!..beauty of twitter is knowing you're not alone..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-25 17:07:39	Morning..feel a bit off kilter, didn't sleep very well and anxiety is creeping in..I feel like I've done something wrong but not sure what..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-25 04:19:25	An evening of phone calls and everyone is really happy for me, saying it's well deserved..still awkward receiving praise but it is nice..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-25 03:17:01	@Fionaok it's in the city so about 45 mins door to door..it is really nice to get good news and I put a lot of work in so feels earned..x
274535898	act1175	2014-07-25 02:17:52	@nikimummy13 thank you!!..still can't quite believe it..It's a great opportunity..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-25 02:16:39	@Fionaok thank you!!..it is very rewarding but also different every day which I love..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-25 01:26:46	@_ck_supergirl trainee project worker, working with people who are homeless..been volunteering there awhile and I love the work..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-07-25 00:56:56	@_ck_supergirl thank you!..bit overwhelmed..x
274535898	act1175	2014-07-25 00:54:53	They just called and offered me the job!!..said it was close but the life experience I could bring to the role was the deciding factor..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 23:51:51	It's my responses and thoughts that have changed gradually over time and that has a knock on affect to my attitudes..promises coming true..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 23:49:43	Feel really proud of myself for getting through today..no way I could have done that even 6 months ago..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 23:16:47	Well I think that went well overall..I answered the questions and my nerves didn't take over..will hear by Monday..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 17:42:30	Okay I'm off to interview..can only do my best and what will be, will be..*repeats to self*..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 15:50:17	We cannot fail in whatever we try today. The outcome of any task attempted is just as it should be. Just what I needed to read!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 15:47:33	@Living608 thank you!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 15:31:02	Morning..have to miss therapy today for job interview..not nervous yet but am aware I need to really manage anxiety as much as possible..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 05:32:17	@BipolarBlogger oh brilliant thanks!!..in that case I'm okay I think..one public disorder fine but otherwise only arrests..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 05:24:38	@BipolarBlogger by any chance, do you know if an enhanced crb check shows all arrests or only convictions?..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 05:19:28	@BipolarBlogger thank you!..x
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 01:54:40	@BipolarBlogger actually doing really well..stable mood wise and getting a sense of peace..even applied for a job!..interview tomorrow..

274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 01:25:38	@nikimummy13 thank you!..interview tomorrow..can only do my best..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-24 00:31:30	Good day volunteering and was told my job application was very good..only 5 shortlisted from 34 and I'm one of them!..eeekkk..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-23 01:49:34	@_ck_supergirl oh sounds fun!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-23 01:49:06	I'm sure my cat can hear me chewing..miraculously appears beside me whenever I eat..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-23 01:13:14	@_ck_supergirl not a baker I have to admit but I'll give it a go..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-23 00:59:46	@_ck_supergirl I've never seen it!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-22 23:29:08	Home again..time for tea and Bergerac..trying not to think about job interview as it pushes my anxiety up..what will be, will be..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-22 18:30:39	@johnmoloney66 @Living608 and you too!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-22 18:15:54	@Living608 hope you have a good day!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-22 15:58:14	Morning..nice start to the day here so coffee and readings in the garden..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-22 05:15:28	Just watched Woman in Black and undecided how I feel about it..no real acting involved but I liked the ending..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-21 23:01:12	@aasteppin that's lovely!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-21 20:50:39	On the train and usually this causes high anxiety but I'm feeling okay today..not going to question it, going to enjoy it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-21 17:02:56	Morning..quiet coffee and readings before heading to my sisters for the night..will be nice to be near the sea again..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-21 01:08:50	Mums advice for job interview was wear suitable clothes and believe in myself..the first I already had sorted but lovely to hear the second!
274535898	act1175	2014-07-21 00:46:04	Went to an afternoon meeting and have caught up with family phone calls..feeling quite organized recently, getting a little done each day..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-20 18:35:54	@drinksinthedark adorable!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-20 17:37:19	Sunday morning coffee in bed and reading..it's the little things that make me happy..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-20 06:18:55	Not done a lot but today has been a good day both mood and feelings wise..off to bed content and grateful..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-20 00:01:53	This sort of thing would usually really frustrate me but I've been surprisingly calm..and in fact I've done very well..*pats self on back*..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-19 23:59:20	Spent most of the day trying to get laptop to connect to internet..it now will but not all websites and I can't work out why..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-19 19:18:33	@johna19402 I'm mostly okay on my own but find a whole day with no contact with others a bit isolating..but am enjoying life more and more!.
274535898	act1175	2014-07-19 18:34:28	@johna19402 have just sent a text inviting a good friend for coffee!..and will go to an early evening meeting..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-19 18:01:21	Slept through alarm again..took meds too late last night..never mind am up now but with no plans for the day so feel a bit lost..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-19 04:07:14	Suddenly gone very dark and the cat has gone behind the sofa..definitely going to be thunder..this pleases me..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-19 03:51:52	@nikimummy13 ahh, first night back in own bed..blissful..enjoy!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-19 03:49:15	@nikimummy13 welcome back!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-19 02:26:51	Was pleased to get a phone call from manager offering me a choice of interview times..means I can go to therapy before it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-19 02:24:44	Had a lovely lunch with my sister and a good catch up..then afternoon spent reading on the balcony..nice and relaxing..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-18 22:37:34	I've been shortlisted and have an interview next Thursday..exciting and nerve wracking at the same time..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-18 17:55:02	Bit of a lie in that wasn't intentional but hey ho..couple of coffees and then meeting my sister for lunch..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-18 03:15:50	@oxymoronic82 and they have memories attached..bit soppy..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-18 03:12:31	@oxymoronic82 I have a couple pairs I still wear!!..14 years later..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-18 01:14:43	Had a lovely afternoon and now happily home for the evening..therapy still wipes me out so but prepared for it now so just give in to it..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-17 21:05:35	Time for a walk and a meeting..far too nice a day to be sitting indoors..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-17 19:39:28	Guess this is what just living life feels like..and it's okay..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-17 19:38:34	Feeling more stable and calmer mood wise for some time means I'm not so focused on how I feel so filling time with other things..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-17 19:37:26	Therapy interesting..definitely feeling, as I describe it, blank..not really thinking or feeling anything..but not in a bad way..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-17 16:34:24	Therapy day again, seems to have come around quickly..not sure what I want or need to talk about but guess something will come up..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-17 02:56:19	@serpentgrr I know..*hangs head*..think I've been forgiven..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-17 02:18:02	Cat decides to headbutt my arm just after I reached for a cup of tea, then bites me for jumping up quickly as it has disturbed her!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-17 00:28:37	Busy, busy day but it meant the time passed quickly..am very tired now and my feet ache..so putting them up!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-16 13:51:43	Early start for volunteering and it was hard getting up..I've never been a morning person so these days do throw me..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-16 05:11:11	Have spent the evening online, either reading stuff or playing games..what did I do before smartphones?..guess I actually watched the t.v..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-16 04:34:11	Watching Diagnosis Murder and wondering why..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-16 01:28:31	Had a lovely long walk along the river and a good catch up with a friend..now cup of tea feels well deserved..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-15 19:46:13	Lots of boring phone calls made..booked dentist, eye test and meds review..that done I'm off to meet a friend for a walk..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-15 06:08:45	@anhedonia11 oh that's awful, I'm sorry..I'm away from my son a lot and I know how hard it is..try to be kind to yourself..xx
274535898	act1175	2014-07-15 05:52:10	@anhedonia11 yes thanks a lazy one!..ate really healthily when away and felt well for it so seemed right to continue it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-15 05:19:07	Snacking on apple, melon and cherries..ate more fruit in Spain and have carried on at home..trying to eat healthier all round..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-15 04:23:31	@SammieMariaox great thanks!..only recently started mine so not many pictures yet..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-15 04:20:12	@SammieMariaox just requested to follow on Instagram..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-15 01:57:33	Good chat with friend I've known longest in the fellowship and coffee date set..feel loads better and able to relax into the evening..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-14 23:56:40	Settled on the sofa with tea and CSI..been a lovely lazy day but also a bit isolating..time to call another alcoholic..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-14 21:49:41	Okay some housework done so going to sit on the balcony and soak up the sun..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-14 20:15:21	Today feels like a Sunday..maybe because all I've done is drink coffee and read..really should get dressed at some point..just not yet..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-14 03:05:35	@jadiepye @bythesheetstore @DastardlyDeano @realpigeon @nikimummy13 @RJ_Hinton @floweroflondon @richardkhornsey sounds good!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-14 00:59:46	A whole day watching Modern Family with my son..love the way we sit exactly the same way on the sofa..two peas in a pod..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-13 18:08:59	Sunday morning lie in and a new Donna Leon book..happy..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-13 06:42:08	Banana cake before bed..yum..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-13 04:58:00	Okay seems we're watching the football tonight..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-13 02:31:24	Had to do my own shopping but back on sofa with pizza cooking..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-12 22:11:24	Quiet day so far..still in a bit of pain so quite happily lazing on sofa watching t.v..trying to persuade my son to go shopping for me..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-12 18:03:46	Slept for 11 hours but feel so much better for it..now coffee and readings while my son watches Srar Trek..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 23:59:56	@ClareInvents yeh!!..how exciting..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 21:59:32	@MooreReva thanks!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 21:59:19	@Fionaok thanks Fiona..sorry your day not going as well as yesterday..be kind to yourself..x
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 21:28:02	I know that's not possible with chronic conditions but I still really resent things happening to me..like that's going to change anything!!.
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 21:26:03	I am so tired of going to hospitals for various issues..been doing it now for 25 years and I would quite like to never have to go again..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 20:51:08	Early hospital appointment has left me achey and cramping after removal of a polyp from my cervix..need a lie down before my son arrives..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 06:02:24	@Lesism @ClareInvents congratulations to you both!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 05:19:25	@oxymoronic82 won't lie it is hard work but the feelings when you hold them in your arms makes it all SO worth it!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 04:59:09	@oxymoronic82 oh plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty more..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 04:08:50	@richardkhornsey thanks!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 04:08:17	@_ck_supergirl so sorry to hear that Claire..I'll be thinking of you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 04:02:33	@richardkhornsey happy birthday Richard!!..hope it's been a good one..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 03:58:51	@SarahTheodorou thank you!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 03:15:38	@johna19402 yep me too..applying for a job filling me with fear and that's all around me not being good enough..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-11 02:12:27	Job application done and sent!!..took a long time with supporting statements as to why I've not worked in years..now I can relax..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-10 19:16:39	Off to my mums for some help with a job application form..fearful, yes but won't let it stop me from doing it..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-10 19:11:04	@PauMusico hope you have a lovely time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-10 18:24:52	Although each time I achieve something I realize fear was irrational in proportion to issue at hand..progress not perfection..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-10 18:22:28	Therapy really helped though cried throughout..a lot of change happening in my life and it all terrifies me..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-10 18:21:05	@johna19402 truth was I didn't want to cry but obviously needed to so got a lot out with her..all comes back to fear as so much does..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-10 15:57:05	Back to therapy this morning and really don't want to go..not sure why but I'm feeling very private recently and just don't want to talk..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-10 02:44:17	Blissful 'dinner' of peanut butter on toast..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-10 02:43:41	@mirry_mirry thank you :-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-10 00:21:13	Only just home..feel good for getting through the whole day but very tired..now well deserved cup of tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-09 13:32:08	Shock to the system being up this early for volunteering..not sure I'll be able to do a whole day but I'm going to try..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-09 01:50:59	Oh blurghhh..still nowhere near feeling myself..exhausted and nauseated..post holiday sickness maybe, though never had before..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-08 20:23:22	Walked down to village for lunch..two rolls and packet of crisps for £3.30!!..would just about buy one roll in London for that..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-08 15:26:29	But seeing as I'm away from home it will have to be a quiet reading day today and see how I go..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-08 15:25:29	Woke to the sound of birds which is lovely but am still tired..think maybe I need to see doctor, can't remember ever feeling this tired..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-08 05:13:10	That's enough online browsing..bedtime..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-08 05:05:30	@jadiepye great episode..enjoy!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-08 04:14:25	Can't understand why I still feel so tired..my whole body aches and everything is an effort..think an early night is on the cards..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-07 23:43:23	Going to sit in the garden and read..also attempt to find some peace within which seems to be eluding me today..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-07 20:41:02	@officialroycey whitehall around 3pm..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-07 20:39:41	Trying my best to practice acceptance but god it's hard sometimes..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-07 20:38:58	Really resenting tgat my life isn't as I want it to be..living with the consequences of drinking nearly four years later is bloody hard..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-07 17:36:43	Normal life resumes today..off to my sisters for a couple of days so travel anxiety creeping in..I want to be back on holiday!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-07 04:44:33	Changed from one pair of pyjamas to another..very odd..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-07 01:30:49	A day of doing nothing has helped rest wise but I feel agitated now for not having gone beyond the balcony..can't win!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-06 20:08:24	@RJ_Hinton not sure what you're referring to but if someone looked rough then yep that's me!!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-06 18:54:18	@_ck_supergirl so sorry you're having a hard time of it..sending lots of hugs..x x
274535898	act1175	2014-07-06 17:38:33	Have decided today is a pyjama day..not going to make myself do anything other than read and rest..sounds lazy but it's what I need..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-06 04:37:51	@nikimummy13 really sorry I'm not going to make it tonight..not feeling well so heading to bed..enjoy it!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-06 02:53:34	Another long nap today and still feel exhausted and achey..definitely not quite myself..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-05 21:56:43	Still feel very tired and sluggish..laid out on bed reading and hoping to doze so I can make #columbotv tonight..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-05 17:41:34	Blissfully long sleep..much needed..coffee and readings now before a meeting..looking forward to seeing some people I've missed..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-05 05:14:56	Overwhelming exhaustion..the price to pay for late nights and late flights..never mind, I'll catch up soon..bed with a book time..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-05 03:01:38	@HollHox ha ha mine was three hours!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-05 02:41:54	Ended up napping but still tired..will take couple days to catch up on late nights..tea time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-04 21:51:38	So happy it's hot..I get to wear shorts and show off my tan!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-04 19:52:19	Will post some pictures later after unpacking and readjusting to city life..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-04 19:50:45	Feeling very grateful for time away but also for some amazingly deep chats with someone who can see in me things I can't see in myself..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-04 19:41:17	Got back in early hours of the morning..had a wonderful time, lots of lazy beach days with great company..very tired but all good!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-07-04 19:39:57	@nikimummy13 thank you!..had a lovely time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-07-04 19:39:36	@jadiepye @OuttaWays @mirry_mirry @nikimummy13 @_ck_supergirl @richardkhornsey @RJ_Hinton @Italia2929 @Ghoulgirl @digbydude thanks!..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 11:53:54	@DomJBrown cheers Dominic!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 10:58:46	Well I've made it to the airport..waiting to drop bag..anxiety almost completely gone and looking forward to the flight and getting there..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 10:06:53	Cab didn't show and none available so had to walk to Victoria..this not helped but am on my way to the airport..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 08:48:22	Getting stuff done quietly but not very calmly..palpitations and feeling flushed..less than an hour till cab is here..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 08:15:36	Managed 2 1/2 hours dozing and my whole system is wanting more..coffee at this time feels all wrong but need it..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 08:14:09	@jadiepye @mirry_mirry @_ck_supergirl @Ghoulgirl @realpigeon @RJ_Hinton @nikimummy13 @floweroflondon @richardkhornsey thanks!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 04:05:47	Finally sleepy..thankfully..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 03:22:27	@realpigeon @nikimummy13 oh thanks not heard of before..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 03:21:52	@serpentgrr yep that too!..going to Majorca and looking forward to being there, it's the hours leading up to it I find so hard..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 03:10:43	@serpentgrr thank you..have to be up at 2.30am to make a flight and day not gone as planned..it will pass, just have to ride it out..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 03:09:26	@nikimummy13 thanks lovely..going to lay down and try to read and see what happens..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 02:49:46	Really, really anxious..need to get some sleep but feel wide awake and quite frankly obsessional about lack of sleep and how I'll cope..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 01:11:55	My plan to be unwinding and headed into bed soon hasn't quite worked out..anxiety building so stopped for tea..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-28 01:10:42	@realpigeon @floweroflondon @FanForumsTV @nikimummy13 @RJ_Hinton @Mr_A_Sleuth thank you!!..see you all next week..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-27 18:35:24	Heading to a meeting and then a walk..if I stay home all day anxiety will rise faster so trying to manage it sensibly..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-27 16:09:08	Applaud others when they run, console if they fall & cheer when they recover. As water is to a flower so is praise to the heart of another.
274535898	act1175	2014-06-27 15:50:55	Woken by a hungry cat meowing in my ear..like she hadn't been fed for days..get up, feed her & she just walks away from it..cats!!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-27 07:13:37	Deliberately stayed up late so I'll be tired and sleep earlier tomorrow..not sure it's going to work but worth a try..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-27 03:04:39	@Fionaok thank you!!..looking forward to it now, I fly early Saturday morning so still around till then..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-27 02:25:38	All packed!!..can't guarantee I won't recheck it a dozen times but for now it all fits with some room to spare so I'm pleased..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-26 22:40:13	Ironing done and piles of clothes set out ready to pack..allowing myself a break for tea and biscuits before seeing if it all fits in..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-26 19:05:31	Therapy so helpful today..now home blasting music and trying to get jobs done calmly and efficiently..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-26 16:14:54	Morning..therapy today then attempting to complete my list of chores for holiday..aim to be mostly packed by the end of the day..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-26 04:59:00	Her calmness and reassurances that everything will be fine always help to calm me down snd right size things for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-26 04:57:41	Great chat with my sponsor..she has had an operation so first talk in a week..accept my anxiety and feel the fear but do it anyway..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-26 01:00:10	Sweet tea and Bergerac..my evening has begun..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-26 00:53:56	@oxymoronic82 it is beautiful..here's mine, my sister bought me for my 20th..smaller but very treasured..:-) pic.twitter.com/vXPM1P9qRv
274535898	act1175	2014-06-25 23:50:39	@oxymoronic82 @queer_potato I have the same picture!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-25 20:53:33	Lunch break and it's really nice to be busy today so not fretting over what I need to be doing at home..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-25 14:25:59	I slept through alarm so running late for volunteering..now going to have to rush around which is my worst way to start the day..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-25 03:52:24	@SarahTheodorou yah I've checked off that list!!..now just clothes to sort and not doing that till thursday so now it's time out..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-25 02:40:38	Back home and CSI New York is keeping me company..tea in hand and doing nothing for the rest of the evening..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-25 02:33:30	@SarahTheodorou that much I have!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-25 01:16:18	I've given up being at home and headed out to a coffee shop to read..am working tomorrow so that will be fine..will restart packing thurs..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-25 01:14:57	@nikimummy13 I do have a list just not sticking to it!!..will be fine when I'm on my way, it's like I know the cycle but still struggle..x
274535898	act1175	2014-06-24 23:16:20	All feels very over whelming and I'm not dealing with very well..I pace from room to room not actually doing anything..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-24 23:15:27	Nice relaxing day but as soon as I'm home my anxiety over holiday is back..head fills with packing and getting euros and what to wear..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-24 19:11:43	Off to a meeting and then lunch with a friend..taking a day off holiday preparation..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-24 06:34:00	@columbophile your knowledge is second to none Sir..well deserved..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-24 06:10:53	Been totally absorbed in my book so just moving from sofa to bed..still with book though..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-24 01:15:55	Elmore Leonard and a cup of tea on the balcony is working wonders..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 23:43:45	I'm going home with most of what I needed so that is something..need some quiet time not thinking so will lose myself in a book..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 23:42:02	I know I get anxious before going away but this is getting silly..need to take a step back and try to pull myself together a bit..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 23:40:25	I spent half an hour choosing suntan lotion!!..it's like I've lost all ability to trust my own choices..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 19:17:11	@oxymoronic82 whoop whoop!!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 19:16:26	Okay I'm fully awake and ready to hit the shops for holiday stuff..the shopping before a trip away is part of the pleasure for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 18:32:33	@MicheleWMiller_ ha ha!!..of course..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 18:27:34	@MicheleWMiller_ huge congratulations!!..and all just one day at a time..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 04:40:34	@jadiepye thanks..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 04:19:42	@jadiepye saw my mum today who was in a foul mood and she said some quite nasty things..it's her issues but really affected me..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 04:18:04	Finally feel a bit calmer though still a bit hurt..it will pass as everything does..only a few days till I fly away and have a break..

274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 00:11:21	I know it's her issues but I've been left feeling useless and worthless..really horrible feelings..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-23 00:10:32	Wow mum was really agitated and tense and it's rubbed off on me..I couldn't seem to say anything right..now I'm wound up and want to cry..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-22 20:38:39	I sometimes wish I could just favourite texts rather than bothering to reply..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-22 19:41:34	Housework in the heat is not fun..but it's nearly done!..then meeting my mum for lunch..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-06-22 17:52:33	@acowming it's happened to me before too so I know how it feels..tweet was out of character for you so didn't open it anyway..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-22 17:50:17	@jadiepye I didn't look at my notifications till it was done, just focused on following the hashtag..then replied later, was all good..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-06-17 17:20:17	@AlnotsoAnon it's a hard one, acceptance that I feel as I do is easier in the long run than looking for reasons..but it takes practice!!..xx
274535898	act1175	2014-06-17 17:15:57	@AlnotsoAnon thank you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-06-17 03:48:46	Brought my whole evening forward so have eaten, had hot bath and taken meds..feel like I just want to get today over with now..

274535898	act1175	2014-06-17 01:10:06	Right now I need sweet tea and something to watch that doesn't require too much thinking..going for Law and Order..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-17 01:07:05	as I've discovered that makes it worse so focusing on distraction techniques..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-17 01:06:21	All my local chores done and meds collected..trying to unwind as I'm feeling a little panicky with palpitations..not examining why anymore

274535898	act1175	2014-06-16 20:59:16	Don't dare call back to change it to my mobile and also don't want to have the conversation somewhere public..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-16 20:57:54	Still awaiting call back from g.p and getting a little stir crazy being stuck in..stupidly requested she call me at home..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-16 16:42:05	Haven't been able to see or speak to my own g.p since January so got a little insistent and hey presto!!..now I can have coffee..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-16 16:40:37	I don't like having to do that but all new receptionists recently who haven't got a clue about anything as far as I can tell..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-16 16:38:50	Set alarm to call g.p only to be told again she not available..spoke with practice manager and suddenly she is available this afternoon..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-16 05:35:10	Sudden wave of exhaustion sending me to bed..was a late one last night so must need to catch up..

274535898	act1175	2014-06-15 08:08:38	Watched a film with my son and all I could think is I have to stop smoking so he never has to see me like that..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-15 08:06:42	He still smokes and listening to him cough is heart breaking..tonight again I offered support but he won't accept any help at all..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-15 08:05:24	Dinner with dad was hard..he's really ill with copd and also depressed..we've talked before of ways he could help himself but he won't..

274535898	act1175	2014-06-14 04:45:24	Being sensible and getting an early night..a few too many late ones have caught up with me..

274535898	act1175	2014-06-13 05:09:17	Finding it a little hard to unwind tonight and then it occurs to me I haven't taken meds..guess I'll still be up for a bit..annoying..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-13 05:00:00	@ItsJackOk good choice..hope it works!!..

274535898	act1175	2014-06-12 18:40:59	She is starting to get me to see that in fact when I do go with how I feel I'm doing okay..and to try and start believing in myself..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-12 18:39:48	Therapy very interesting..looking at my default setting is all negative and not having the belief I can my own decisions without approval..

274535898	act1175	2014-06-11 04:44:19	@_ck_supergirl then it's even harder..there is a saying "feel the fear and do it anyway"..almost always never as bad as we imagine..x
274535898	act1175	2014-06-11 03:09:03	@_ck_supergirl sometimes you just have to go with your gut instinct and hope for the best!..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-11 03:06:58	@HollHox Happy Birthday!!!..and yes you are awesome..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-11 02:54:41	@_ck_supergirl that's exactly how I felt yesterday!!..I'm not keen on this adult stuff like making decisions..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-11 02:24:38	Long nap but it's helped loads..still low level anxiety but can live with that..now it's tea and biscuits time..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-10 20:50:13	@nikimummy13 just in and better for being home..thanks lovely..x
274535898	act1175	2014-06-10 20:49:46	So pleased to be home..going to try and nap as I feel exhausted..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-10 18:08:10	Am actually shaking with anxiety and can't work out why??..on journey home but paranoia levels up too so not easy being on a train..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-10 16:43:57	Sun is out so having an hour in the garden before going home..feel the need to be in my own space today..feeling a bit fragile..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-10 14:52:25	Slept really badly, kept waking up in a state of panic with heart racing..finally seemed easier to get up but still very unsettled..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-10 05:24:06	Been a bit too much anxiety and thinking for me today although it's all worked out fine it has been draining..time for bed with my book..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-10 05:22:09	@columbophile 7/10..dog questions tripped me up..must try harder!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-10 05:14:45	I can't quite believe I'm getting such a cheap holiday..dad paid for flights as birthday present and no accommodation cost..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-10 01:40:39	@oxymoronic82 yep now I can start to get excited!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-10 00:43:03	Have spoken to the friend who has invited me to Spain and it's helped a lot!!..decided to go so now booking flights..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-09 20:43:13	For now going to read in the hope of slowing my thoughts down a bit..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-09 20:42:04	On way to my sisters..anxiety still high but have arranged to call someone when I'm there to help me talk through my racing thoughts..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-09 18:11:44	What I really want is someone to decide for me but as my sponsor said I have to decide and I have to live with my decision..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-09 18:10:47	I woke full of anxiety..partly as I'm travelling to my sisters today but also my last day to decide about going to Spain..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-09 06:23:19	Oops I've stayed up too late again..never mind, no alarm set..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-09 01:02:39	Finally doing what I should be on a Sunday..drinking tea and watching t.v..

274535898	act1175	2014-06-08 18:44:01	Just stirring for the day..late for me but I so needed the rest..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-08 05:45:39	@idiotboyarcher @DastardlyDeano @columbophile hi!..June 21st at 10pm uk time..episode Murder under Glass..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-06-07 16:40:10	Morning..feeling a little low so glad to be going to an all day convention today..

274535898	act1175	2014-06-07 04:57:21	@DastardlyDeano host is me!..June 21st..10pm..Murder under Glass..:-) #ColumboTV
274535898	act1175	2014-06-07 01:42:39	I'm tired already and my head is pounding again..generally feeling a bit sorry for myself and not sure why..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-06 23:01:07	Bben a lovely day..meeting then walk with a friend and a good chat..now time to sit on the balcony and catch the last of the sun..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-06 17:26:19	Morning..sun is shining and I'm going to meet a friend for a meeting then sit in the park with my book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-06 06:48:25	@NatalieOxford excellent choice!..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-06 05:37:21	@NatalieOxford that is SO nice!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-06 04:35:53	Have had a nasty headache all evening so been avoiding screens..looking forward to going to bed tonight..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-05 21:35:23	@Comfort_talks I wouldn't know where to start..;-) well done you and I look forward to having a look..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-05 21:33:26	@Comfort_talks exciting!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-05 19:43:01	But ultimately it has to be my decision and that's the bit I struggle with..still so unsure of myself and my ability to make decisions..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-05 19:41:44	Now I just have to make a decision about Spain..sponsor says I'm doing great and deserve a break and that helps hugely..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-05 19:39:10	Therapy went well..just feeling a sense of peace in my moods clearly reflects how I feel and think about things..still tears but much less..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-05 16:20:22	Morning..back to therapy after a week off and actually looking forward to it!..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-05 05:44:34	Got myself in a bit of a tizzy with over thinking and trying to to wind it down before bed..don't have to make any decisions today..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-05 03:54:54	I've been invited to Spain for a week only paying for flight..very tempted but also don't want to make a quick decision and regret it..hmm..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-05 02:23:34	Very long day volunteering..in desperate need of tea and mindless t.v..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-04 13:49:59	Bit of a shock to the system being up so early for volunteering..strong coffee needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-03 22:23:44	Was so nice to be back at a meeting, seeing familiar faces and feeling part of..just lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-03 18:55:05	The sound of rain was so soothing I didn't want to get up..must have been more tired than I thought..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-03 06:23:53	Lovely getting into own bed again..always a good feeling after being away..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-03 02:52:10	@_ck_supergirl great, I'm so glad you'll be there..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-03 02:31:17	@_ck_supergirl Murder under Glass..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-03 02:26:09	@_ck_supergirl yep first time for me..exciting..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-03 02:19:36	@_ck_supergirl oh brilliant, glad you enjoyed yourself!!..I had a lovely time thanks, a quiet cottage close to the sea..even got a tan..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-03 01:52:47	@_ck_supergirl how was your holiday??..
274535898	act1175	2014-06-03 01:44:48	My mood has continued to be stable with much less day to day anxiety too..I'm so grateful for that as I was able to enjoy every day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-06-03 01:36:03	@FanForumsTV seems June 21st works for most so will do then..will stick to 10pm and work out the time zones soon.. #ColumboTV
274535898	act1175	2014-06-03 01:33:57	Had a lovely restful time in Cornwall..lots of sea air and playing on the beach..nice to be home now with feet up, travelling tired me out..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-29 02:52:50	On our way to Cornwall..no phone signal at the cottage so I'll be back next week..take care everyone..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-28 17:38:06	@RJ_Hinton thanks Richard, I'll try, it's first time hosting for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-28 17:36:18	@GregMcCambley @columbophile yes a Saturday here in u.k..I'm away till beginning of June but will work out times when I'm back..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-28 17:28:04	@RJ_Hinton absolutely and if you can you could read the tweets!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-28 17:15:16	@columbophile true, and yes I think it is summer solstice..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-28 16:58:44	@RJ_Hinton oh that's a shame..sorry, it's hard to find a date that works for everyone..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-28 04:19:44	@jadiepye excellent!..it seems to be working for people so far..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-28 01:39:36	Hair done and I'm packed!!..all with minimal anxiety..quite pleased with myself..and it's not very often I can say that..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-27 22:02:19	@columbophile I'm thinking June 21st if that works for everyone?.. #columbotv
274535898	act1175	2014-05-27 19:23:18	Chores done..quick break for lunch before hairdresser..not my favourite place at all but needs must..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-27 16:52:55	Morning..busy day ahead with paying bills, collecting meds and having my hair cut and coloured..oh and packing too!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-27 06:20:32	@Fionaok good to hear!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-27 04:34:40	@NatalieOxford that's a shame, I hope you're okay..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-27 04:07:49	Healthy snacking on apples and cherries..my appetite is much improved and feeling the benefits of eating a bit more..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-27 00:40:40	I now have lots of piles of clothes but as yet nothing actually packed..that's enough for today, it's tea time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-27 00:38:51	@HollHox @richardkhornsey I live near the river but nothing beats open water..I find it so calming..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-26 23:37:40	Already tempted to pack tomorrow and just put my feet up now..must focus..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-26 23:36:26	@richardkhornsey ha ha..yes going to Polzeath for a few days..love being next to the sea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-26 23:21:06	Lovely time with my uncle now home packing..off to Cornwall on wed so lots to do!!..and I hate packing..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-26 18:54:06	Quiet morning now heading off to see one of my uncles for a coffee while he's in London..always a pleasure to see him..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-26 04:25:54	It still keeps catching me by surprise just how settled I feel recently..calm and productive without over doing things..feels good..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-26 01:43:44	Chat with my mum turned into 40 minutes of everything I'm not doing yet in life..never ever what I am doing..I find that sad..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-26 00:19:53	@realpigeon I usually do Pilates as I have arthritis in my spine but have lapsed recently..guess my back has noticed!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-25 23:53:46	Had a nice walk but back still aching so going to try a heat pad with feet up..and tea with biscuits of course!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-25 20:42:04	Housework done so I'm heading out for a walk..back is aching a bit so hoping some exercise will help it..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-25 20:40:07	@CarlBurkitt @OneActFestival how exciting!..hope it goes well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-25 17:49:17	Morning..coffee and readings in bed..perfect way to start a Sunday..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-25 17:46:23	@Fionaok thanks Fiona!!..got housework planned for today then maybe more relaxing in the sun..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-25 07:34:35	Bed too late again having done nothing but watch t.v and play online games..but every now and then that's okay..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-25 04:44:52	@PolCandid not weak, wasn't the right time that's all..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-25 04:30:45	@PolCandid how's the no smoking going?..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-25 04:18:32	@capwell6 it really is, interesting difference between u.s and u.k..u.s make a lot more deals before going to court..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-25 03:05:28	An evening of Law and Order with toast and peanut butter..bliss..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 22:25:14	Oh yeh it's a double Columbo day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 22:01:15	Feeling lazy today..still in pyjamas watching Columbo..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 19:24:44	Really late start but had a lovely long sleep so was worth it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 08:38:40	@Fionaok way past my bedtime..oops!!..nite..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 08:37:31	@GregMcCambley @nealmaidment @HollHox that sounds good to me!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 08:36:02	@Fionaok that's why they invented the block button..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 08:34:26	@Fionaok you helped me too, by sharing it I know I'm not alone!!..:-)..x
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 07:44:48	@FanForumsTV @nealmaidment @GregMcCambley I'm going to have to re watch them all I think and then rank..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 07:43:26	@Fionaok I often feel the same if that helps..not sure why..lack of confidence I think and fear of judgement even though anonymous?!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 07:07:53	@nealmaidment @HollHox @GregMcCambley sounds good!..maybe a weekend afternoon..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 07:06:27	@bythesheetstore @nealmaidment @HollHox @GregMcCambley wow!!..you are in for a treat if you decide to watch..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 05:11:30	@jadiepye @floweroflondon @realpigeon @GregMcCambley @TeamAndo180 @travelclairek @Italia2929 @KellyBridgwater @richardkhornsey thank you!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 03:48:28	Home!!..time for some catch up t.v with a good cup of tea, which never tastes quite the same anywhere else..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-24 02:10:43	Homeward bound and having spent most of the day in the sun it's nice to be on a cool train..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-23 20:43:48	Sitting in the garden reading with the sun shining and complete peace..lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-23 18:49:20	@GregMcCambley @nealmaidment I saw that in a cinema in South Wales..only 4 people there!!
274535898	act1175	2014-05-23 18:11:00	@nealmaidment he is great!!..and my son loves him too, went through an Indy phase with a hat he wouldn't take off..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-23 18:08:40	@GregMcCambley @nealmaidment my favourite as well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-23 18:02:12	@nealmaidment wow that makes me feel old, remember seeing it at the cinema!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-23 17:25:50	Morning..I do like waking to birdsong, very soothing way to start the day..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-23 00:24:09	Managed to do some writing on the train which helped collect my thoughts..at my sisters now with tea and my book..quiet evening planned..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-22 19:34:25	But no time to write it up as heading to my sisters for the night..anxiety over travel kicking in but know now it eases once I'm on my way..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-22 19:33:13	Tough therapy session looking at childhood trauma and realizing I'm going to have to talk it all through to be able to lay it to rest..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-22 16:23:17	@BipolarBlogger not today thankfully, had a low level headache until bedtime but am okay today..think the worst is over..x
274535898	act1175	2014-05-22 16:01:46	Morning..very pleased my eye hasn't blackened, though it's still a bit sore..anyway therapy this morning so coffee and readings time..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-22 06:11:37	And to bed..head only mildly throbbing but feel wiped out..it has been a long day..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-22 04:44:36	In case I'd somehow forgotten I have to vote tomorrow the conservatives just knocked to remind me..at 9.40pm??..not appreciated..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-22 01:40:36	Feeling a bit fragile..pain and shock are draining..having very quiet time and being gentle with myself..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-21 21:32:57	@BipolarBlogger yes it was a big ow!!..but they were great about making sure I was okay and nearly home where feet will definitely go up.:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-21 21:30:46	Little bit shaken and it will bruise but am sure a cup of tea and pain killers will help..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-21 21:28:40	Took a knock to my head from a heavy metal gate so after 2 hours of ice packs am in a taxi home..work insisted though am sure I'm fine..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-21 04:35:48	Nice relaxed evening in front of the telly and now early to bed for volunteering..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-21 02:46:15	@LadyAnanon that's really good..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-20 23:18:38	Another busy but productive day..starting to get things done as they need doing which is huge for me..lift in mood changes everything..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-20 17:36:34	@PolCandid they might!!..but just for today is enough for me..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-20 17:15:15	Morning..starting to wake naturally after 8-9 hours sleep..lots of positive changes seem to be happening..trying to enjoy while they last..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-20 06:21:22	As well as a lift in mood my appetite has picked up too..this both pleases and worries me..need to get back to the gym to even it out..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-20 02:37:32	@oxymoronic82 @queer_potato goodness I'm so sorry..best wishes to you both..x
274535898	act1175	2014-05-20 01:35:34	Ran into an old timer from my home group..so halfway through the day I had a chat like only two alcoholics can have..joys of sobriety..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-20 01:31:22	Busy day with chores and appointments so very happy to have my feet up now..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-19 21:21:31	@Transformental looks very peaceful..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-19 19:12:52	@oxymoronic82 sending *hugs* your way..x
274535898	act1175	2014-05-19 19:11:46	@PolCandid yeh!!..you okay?..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-19 18:15:55	Woke with a pounding headache and chaos in the kitchen where the cat had been locked in overnight..can I start the day again please??..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-19 05:48:42	@BipolarBlogger that's lovely..so pleased for you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-05-19 03:44:13	@AnnaLouiseMagee @jadiepye welcome!!..look forward to seeing you there..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-19 02:26:23	That feels a long way off but just catching moments where I can honestly say I feel okay is enough for me for now..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-19 02:23:53	Good chat with my sponsor, she's pleased I'm starting to feel at ease with myself..said it's the beginning stage towards peace of mind..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-19 02:19:04	@echidnabot we love them!!..finished new series now so waiting for more..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-18 21:18:58	@PolCandid should be..x
274535898	act1175	2014-05-18 19:29:08	Quiet morning here, son out playing footy so I'm catching up on housework before sun hits the balcony..then I can read outside..yeh!..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-05-18 05:01:27	Watching a Columbo so may be some tweets that would confuse if you're not watching it..bear with me..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-18 04:51:56	@Ghoulgirl going to try and watch but got my son here so may be a bit erratic!..

274535898	act1175	2014-05-16 23:28:26	Managed to get an hour in the sun..felt lovely!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-16 17:21:32	Morning..busy day ahead with chores to get done..but feeling quite uplifted..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-16 05:02:55	Oops I dozed off on the sofa..bedtime I guess..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-16 03:44:46	@PolCandid @jeesothesheep I'm aiming for June 1st to quit..be great to have some support..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-16 02:20:13	Really good meeting and a lovely walk through the park..now hit by post therapy exhaustion..tea with Law and Order time..simple pleasures..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-15 20:34:58	Heading out for a walk and a meeting with a good friend..feel like napping but know I'll feel better for going out..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-15 19:40:57	Therapy done and written up..a lot of tears today but, as always, a sense that someone is listening to me..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-15 16:12:25	Morning..therapy again today and after missing last week I feel a bit anxious about it..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-15 05:13:14	Have done nothing all evening but did work all day so it felt deserved..a good feeling..now bed with book. :-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-15 01:21:09	My heart dropped at the news of @_StephensStory passing away..a young man who did more than most in a whole lifetime..may he rest in peace.
274535898	act1175	2014-05-14 13:52:52	Up for volunteering though not fully awake..fuzzy head so waiting for coffee to do its job..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-14 13:48:49	@_ck_supergirl have a great time!!!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-14 04:03:30	Good chat with sponsor and advice was to leave the meeting..it's an ongoing problem that defeats the point of me being there..be sad to go..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-13 23:16:22	Other than that I've had a good day..got chores done and not noticed increase in meds..trying to let go of anger now with sweet tea and t.v.
274535898	act1175	2014-05-13 23:03:07	And she somehow manages in a passive aggressive way to make me feel bad for correcting her!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-13 23:01:59	2/2 this is at my home group where I do service so I really don't want to leave but can't feel like this anymore and no way to resolve.
274535898	act1175	2014-05-13 22:59:14	Am so angry I'm shaking..repeatedly one person keeps telling me how I MUST feel despite me correcting her that I don't feel as she says 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-05-13 14:55:51	Morning..woke early so got up and feel okay so far..obviously will know more after coffee!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-13 06:17:34	Off to bed with a bit of hope that tomorrow can be as good as today mood wise..just a slight shift can have a huge impact..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-13 06:15:33	Watched the first Amazing Spiderman and enjoyed it!..very rarely watch films as usually don't have the concentration for them..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-13 00:58:24	@officialroycey huge achievement!!..well done..and now rest..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-12 23:49:08	That's good enough for me as now is all I have..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-12 23:48:15	Managed to get a few chores done which I'm pleased about..med doubles in dose tonight so not sure how that will affect me..but am ok for now
274535898	act1175	2014-05-12 18:27:37	Feeling a little bit of a spring in my step..not getting ahead of myself but I do feel more alert and with it so far today..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-12 16:52:12	Woke up and got up instead of going back to sleep..good start so far..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-12 05:23:35	Bedtime finally..feel sad that I'm so looking forward to being asleep rather than looking forward to tomorrow..just the way it is right now.
274535898	act1175	2014-05-12 01:15:39	@_ck_supergirl yeh!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-12 00:47:14	@_ck_supergirl musketeers by any chance?..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-12 00:29:08	Am aware new meds can make me feel worse before better but not at all happy about how I feel..numb and distant from self at the moment..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-11 20:16:38	Having finally got out of bed am asking myself what now?..feeling sad and lonely and much rather be asleep where I don't have to think..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-11 04:44:51	@Fionaok I'm not either!!..waiting till it's over to come back on here..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-11 01:26:08	Managed to shop in between showers now back to the sofa for me..feeling vacant and detached and don't like it..tea and telly time..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-11 01:23:13	@officialroycey well done!!..must have been hard today, have a good rest..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-11 00:08:59	Venturing out much against my wishes but needs must..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-10 22:28:33	Oh dear I'm still not dressed..day not going as I planned but that's nothing new lately..really need to do some shopping though..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-10 18:32:43	For now it's coffee time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-10 18:32:03	Morning..plan is to get out to a meeting today..not feeling much better but if I don't do something it will be third day in pyjamas..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-10 04:57:20	@capwell6 I'm loving it!..watching one now..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-10 03:58:20	@_ck_supergirl not great at the moment but will snap out of it at some point..have a great weekend and well done on the 500!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-10 03:51:25	@_ck_supergirl @diddle11 @SonnieM @HollHox @bythesheetstore @l_murray @Syncriel @Antonio_Bay @jadiepye thank you lovely..x
274535898	act1175	2014-05-09 22:45:09	Another day of doing nothing..no desire to go anywhere or do anything that involves leaving the house..strangely enjoying isolating..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-09 18:05:47	Morning..slept badly and feel irritable..now to see if coffee improves my mood..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-09 18:04:45	@Andy_15052012 I always say to myself it's my story so I can't go wrong!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-09 05:54:58	Not sure if it's mood or new meds causing me to feel a bit low..off to bed in hope of tomorrow being a better day..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-09 03:15:40	@itsonlymetash very pretty..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-09 00:55:43	Questioning myself about why I feel as I do is pointless yet it's what I always do..hard work to just feel and sit with it..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-08 23:16:07	Feeling a bit unsettled and grumpy although not done much except laze around reading..just out of sorts really..maybe it's missing therapy..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-08 17:45:21	Slept through alarm so missed therapy..bit annoyed with myself but must have needed the rest..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-08 05:26:37	@officialroycey ha ha I'm sure I would too!!..hope you're enjoying it as well, must be some beautiful scenery..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-08 05:09:29	Have done nothing other than drink tea and watch telly..oh and snack..beginning to suspect it's new med so have to think before I eat..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-08 05:06:40	@officialroycey what's it like out there on your own?..hope you're doing well..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-08 00:44:46	Busy busy bee today..but all good..now it's my favourite time of day..it's tea time!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-07 14:12:43	Morning..when can I go back to bed!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-07 05:24:18	Had to have an apricot danish before bed..what is it with this snacking!!..anyway bedtime take two..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-07 04:39:34	Being sensible and having an early night for volunteering tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-07 04:19:57	@officialroycey yeh!!..well done you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-07 03:03:21	@HollHox oh not seen any criminal intent yet but I do like svu..very exciting having something new to watch so taping them all!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-07 02:48:15	I've only just discovered Law and Order..not sure how I missed it before but catching up now..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-07 02:41:17	Been a very relaxing evening..what a difference a day makes!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 22:57:48	@BipolarBlogger fabulous Charlotte!!..for me online friends are invaluable, for so many of the reasons you so wonderfully rhymed..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 22:13:38	@Transformental so pleased you're on the recovery journey, and clearly a lot has changed!!..all for the better..keep going..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 21:45:43	Rheumatology appt done and to continue with Humira..home now to hopefully have a quiet afternoon..book and herbal tea time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 16:39:21	@officialroycey good luck!!..hope the weather stays nice for you..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 16:37:47	Up way before I wanted to be but have a hospital appointment this morning..feeling a bit low as well..coffee time..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 05:04:32	@DastardlyDeano sending lots of *hugs*..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 05:03:20	Feeling vaguely better..meds kicking in helps..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 03:30:25	@richardkhornsey thanks..trying..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 03:14:25	Waves of really high anxiety out of nowhere..time to activate self care plan..bath running..hot sweet tea in hand..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 03:12:11	@richardkhornsey thanks for the warning!..will use that time to charge the phone..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 02:49:32	I have a busy few days ahead so trying to enjoy doing nothing but anxiety seems to have other plans..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 00:55:30	@karen12steps so true!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-06 00:22:32	Lovely lunch and a gentle stroll around Islingtons back streets..spotted this, so pretty!.. pic.twitter.com/FvlfZGM4fL
274535898	act1175	2014-05-05 18:58:11	Okay off to see my mum for lunch..heading to @Carluccioscaffe ..yeh!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-05 17:44:34	Morning..being woken by a hungry cat was not the best way to start the day..especially when I fed her and she walked away!..anyway, up now..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-05 05:39:56	Been snacking all evening..should probably go to bed..but with hot chocolate..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-05 02:01:36	@mssginbottle double congrats!!..what a way to celebrate as well!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-05 00:46:27	Walk and bit of shopping done..settling down with new Ironside..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 22:23:11	That's enough energy expended on housework..am off for a walk, though just a short one today..really want to curl up on sofa..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 20:43:00	I hate housework..really hate it..but I like the end result so hey ho on I go..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 18:52:22	Morning..just..housework today and hopefully seeing a friend later for a walk..for now strong coffee and readings..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 18:50:52	@_ck_supergirl Happy Birthday supergirl!!!..hope it's a great day for you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 06:05:48	As well as a feeling of achievement for going out walking, there is the added perk of feeling tired and knowing I'll sleep well..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 06:01:56	@DastardlyDeano always here Deano..x
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 05:44:26	@oxymoronic82 they are much of a muchness really, mattress more important than base from what I remember..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 03:43:19	@oxymoronic82 cot beds are slightly more but converts to first bed..worked out cheaper in long run!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 02:48:26	Watching New Tricks with peanut butter on toast..this makes me happy..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 00:33:09	@marksandspencer okay, thanks!.
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 00:13:08	@marksandspencer I have received an email from you asking me to reset my password to my account. Not sure it's genuine?.
274535898	act1175	2014-05-04 00:00:04	Had a lovely long walk..5.3 miles and on #WorldASDay too!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-03 19:55:43	Walk time..plan to go along the river and find a place to read my book with a coffee..although I'm guessing it's colder than it looks..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-03 18:06:53	Morning..lovely to wake to the sun shining in..today will be chores and a walk I think..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-03 03:21:25	Have just had a really nice day all round..rare but lovely..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-03 03:18:01	@LithiumLibGirl sounds like an ideal evening..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 22:46:19	Now for an episode of Endeavour with tea and biscuits..nice to be in and cosy when it's cold and wet outside..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 22:05:59	Great meeting..by sharing our lives honestly we connect at such a deep level..am quite moved by some things I heard today..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 17:54:05	Lovely long deep sleep..now coffee and readings before going to a meeting with a good friend..am actually looking forward to the day!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 05:47:14	Time for bed with hot chocolate and my book..and no alarm set..bliss..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 05:40:05	@officialroycey I do get glimpses and I have a strong belief everything works out as it's meant to..when it's meant to..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 04:58:56	@officialroycey thank you, means a lot..x
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 04:48:27	@officialroycey wow that's a serious challenge!! Doing it for such a good cause though, will follow your progress..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 04:19:36	@officialroycey what is the furthest you've cycled before?.
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 03:41:26	@PolCandid oh that's a good idea, will try to join you!..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 03:33:27	@PolCandid aw thanks!..still smoking but have cut down, maybe end of may?..was hard going looking at co-dependency but all interesting too..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 02:57:38	Still get hit by exhaustion on therapy days..self care really important so have eaten well and already in pyjamas..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-02 02:55:08	@PolCandid that's great news..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-01 23:20:59	Dozed off but not very deeply or for very long so now I feel crappy..tea and mindless telly needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-01 21:25:19	@Fionaok @chrisokane with pleasure!..stunning shot..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-05-01 20:05:25	Seeing as I don't feel depressed this bothers me..but that's the only option I've been given..too much for me to think about right now..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-01 20:02:28	Phone chat with dr about my messing up anxiety meds..back to her wanting me to take an anti depressant that is meant to help with anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-01 18:58:09	My only way to deal with this is to write about the session then try to leave it and do something else..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-01 18:56:28	Therapy sometimes feels very exposing, I lay everything out and we have 50 mins to talk then I'm left to deal all the emotions it stirs up..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-01 16:23:45	@PolCandid thank you!..x
274535898	act1175	2014-05-01 16:04:07	Morning..really didn't want to get up but it's therapy day again..seems to come around too quickly..all I want to do is sleep instead..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-01 05:24:50	Yeh it's bedtime..one of those days where I can't wait to crawl in..
274535898	act1175	2014-05-01 02:04:37	@EmmaK67 this is actually getting very worrying..don't think people realize the full implications of voting for them.
274535898	act1175	2014-05-01 01:57:33	Very long day with lots of time spent on buses..feel absolutely shattered..but at least now I have feet up with tea in hand..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-30 15:00:45	Morning..woke late for volunteering and have to get the bus today..aaarrrgghhh..so tired can barely move..this is going to be hard..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-30 03:30:37	Nice to be home though the cat is ignoring me..was only one night!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-29 23:47:12	Lovely day doing nothing but homeward bound now for volunteering tomorrow..just have to get through the journey..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-29 19:08:56	Woke to the sound of birds and had coffee in the garden..lovely!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-29 06:45:19	Very, very quiet here but ideal for losing myself in a book..goodnight..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-29 02:29:04	@Glass1ncision fab!!..well done..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-29 00:17:11	Safely at my sisters..sun is shining so going to sit in the garden and see if I can make friends with the local cats..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-28 20:49:01	On train and already annoyed at others who talk on the phone loudly..no quiet carriages on this route..going to try and read to relax..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-28 19:16:15	Heading off with plenty of time but anxiety high..as I get closer to leaving the flat am shaking and time speeds up..it's horrible..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-28 17:01:45	Morning..off to my sisters today so having some quiet time before I face train journey and people..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-28 00:57:44	Nice walk by the river and a good chat with a close friend..feel calmer and able to settle down for the evening..now it's tea time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-27 21:09:51	Glad to be heading out for a walk..feeling uncomfortable mood wise and be good to chat about it..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-27 20:23:57	Being very productive today, housework done, laundry on and still flitting room to room tidying..hmmm, not sure this is a good thing..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-27 19:57:23	@BipolarBlogger I find it ironic that my bank has a box to donate to local food bank..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-27 18:31:32	Morning..well rested after a deep sleep..plans to see a fellowship friend for a walk today..after coffee and readings..

274535898	act1175	2014-04-27 06:01:12	Oh bless Columbo is being very calm and patient.. #ColumboTV
274535898	act1175	2014-04-27 05:55:43	" @_ck_supergirl : @DastardlyDeano i know we cant do much but we are all here for you Dean #Columbotv :)" Absolutely..x

274535898	act1175	2014-04-27 05:09:23	@FanForumsTV Columbo might..;-)

274535898	act1175	2014-04-27 03:11:27	Amazing how quickly my head can go when I haven't spoken to another human being all day..time to call my sponsor..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-27 01:19:27	Three hour nap!!..and aside from a headache I feel much better..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-26 21:20:45	Chores done but feel nauseated with tiredness..time for reading and herbal tea in the hope of having a nap..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-26 18:47:01	The power of caffeine has done the trick..for now..going to get some local chores done then hopefully fit in a nap before #Columbotv ..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-26 18:03:47	Morning..feeling a bit dazed and unsettled because I slept badly..hope it passes..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-26 06:53:17	Spent the whole night scrolling through twitter but not tweeting..so now I have..night..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-26 04:02:12	@squishybear1999 thanks for the follow!!..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-04-26 02:49:21	How have I only just realized it's World Penguin Day??.. They are just the best!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-26 02:47:52	After hospital met a friend, seeing as I was out anyway, and went to a meeting..feeling a bit unsettled though and anxiety back up..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-25 22:55:40	That's what I get for paying more attention to my book than what I'm doing..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-25 22:54:30	Going to the right hospital may help..auto pilot took me to St Thomas when meant to be at Guys..lucky they are not too far apart..take two..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-25 21:07:41	Hospital called needing to do blood tests for anti tnf script to be released..stupidly said I was free today so guess I better get dressed!.
274535898	act1175	2014-04-25 17:19:45	Morning!..think today will be a pyjama and book day..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-25 01:30:00	@oxymoronic82 of course..sorry things are so hard for you recently..you are both in my thoughts..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-25 01:07:06	@_ck_supergirl only plus side to that is they should be fixing it quicker!!..fingers crossed for you..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-25 01:03:42	@_ck_supergirl is it just you or neighbours too?..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-25 01:00:44	@oxymoronic82 body is busy making little Sophnick..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-25 00:58:34	@_ck_supergirl oh no!..hope it's sorted soon..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-25 00:09:11	@ClareInvents sounds good!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-24 23:59:59	@oxymoronic82 lots of *hugs* lovely..x
274535898	act1175	2014-04-24 23:58:13	@ClareInvents ooh suspense..do we get to see a bit more each week?..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-24 23:57:11	For once, I had a nap and woke up feeling better for it..rested and relaxed for the evening..now sweet tea and my book and I'm sorted!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-24 20:26:54	..what I do with my anger..keeping it in or turning it into hurting myself somehow has to change at some point..more to think over..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-24 20:24:07	Therapy was less tearful as talking about things that anger me so a level of separation sets in..she finds that interesting as she wonders
274535898	act1175	2014-04-24 15:42:08	Morning..I really don't want to be up yet but therapy today so hoping strong coffee does the trick..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-24 03:19:38	Raisin toast for dinner..feet too tired to stand for any longer..and it's yummy..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-24 00:42:05	Busy day but so rewarding..an old client who is now housed came to say hi and it was amazing to see the change in him..just lovely!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-24 00:38:44	@LithiumLibGirl soooo pretty..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-23 14:06:26	Bit of a shock getting up early but back to volunteering today and looking forward to it as well..good start!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-23 03:27:39	Really hot bath and some comfort food and I'm feeling much better..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-23 03:26:06	@Alanonian absolutely!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-23 01:14:59	2/2 and I am powerless but it's really bloody hard sometimes!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-23 01:14:11	My blood is boling over behaviour of some family members..I feel helpless and that angers me more..others behaviour is beyond my control 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-04-23 00:01:41	Now will have to see doctor again to work out what to do..can't believe I didn't realize before as I have been reducing over last ten days..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-23 00:00:08	Realized I have been reducing anxiety med with idea of introducing new one that I decided against doing..explains the rise in anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-22 23:05:54	Been to home group and did a few chores but anxiety still high so at home trying to calm it down a bit..tea and reading should help..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-22 17:50:12	Morning!..woke with anxiety so trying to reduce by quietly doing readings and not overthink things that haven't even happened..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-22 05:15:06	Walked 6.8k today, no wonder my legs ache!!..hot bath helped now early night..quite glad the world comes back to life tomorrow..

274535898	act1175	2014-04-22 01:55:49	@MooreReva it was!..now I feel like I've done something..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-22 01:55:17	Nice walk and chat but we got meeting time wrong so stopped for coffee and met two other members..coincidence?..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-21 21:44:36	Okay I'm going..reluctantly, but knowing I will appreciate it later..maybe..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-21 20:36:49	Struggling to find the energy to get ready..but I know if I don't go out the day will drag on and can't face that again today..hey ho..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-21 19:05:41	Morning..just..seeing a friend for a meeting today..just what I need..

274535898	act1175	2014-04-18 17:46:37	We neither ran nor fought. But accept we did. And then we begun to be free. Bill W.
274535898	act1175	2014-04-18 17:35:38	Morning..lovely long sleep and I do feel a bit better for it..need coffee before I work out what I'm doing today, if anything..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-18 04:22:33	Very lazy evening and looking forward to an early night..not done much today but am achey and need to give in to being ill..

274535898	act1175	2014-04-18 01:05:38	@Fionaok aah now I know what DH means..always wondered..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-04-17 02:57:02	Oh now I'm feeling ill too..just hoping I don't get a temperature like my son as I can't have paracetamol..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-04-16 23:08:23	@DastardlyDeano sorry to hear that..hope you're okay..x
274535898	act1175	2014-04-16 23:07:14	Or maybe choosing to take it is self managing..not going to start a debate in my head..going to read with herbal tea..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-16 23:05:56	Not taken sedative med for two days but as son dozes on the sofa really feel I need to..still makes me feel guilty for not managing..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-16 21:30:09	Trudging through today not feeling much just doing..son is ill so he's tucked up on sofa while I wander room to room finding things to do..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-16 21:08:33	@John___Lemon thank you, still undecided but that helps..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-16 06:29:29	Finally bedtime with new book The Woman who went to Bed for a Year..this appeals to me..night.
274535898	act1175	2014-04-16 01:38:28	@LithiumLibGirl oh that's horrible..hope you can have a restful evening..x
274535898	act1175	2014-04-16 00:48:41	Laptop works as long as I don't want to online..can't do anymore myself..surprised I got this far really..time for a break..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-15 21:50:05	Son out with friends and I'm attempting to wipe clean my laptop in hope it will then work again..no idea what I'm doing!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-15 20:37:45	@Andy_15052012 congrats Andy!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-15 18:23:56	Morning..lazy start to the day..coffee and readings done and now catching up on the last series of Outnumbered..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-15 03:39:49	Watching Fast and furious 4 with pizza..it's funny when he's here, we end up sitting in exactly the same positions as each other..mini me..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-15 03:31:49	@_ck_supergirl thanks supergirl x
274535898	act1175	2014-04-15 00:09:09	I do feel a little like I'm looking down on myself..like me doing things isn't in fact me, I'm on the sidelines saying keep going..odd..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-15 00:06:00	Comic book shopping done and lunch out..now home for a bit of quiet time..son on ipad and I get to read for an hour..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-14 19:29:22	@BLpressoffice many thanks!..saved us the trip there..will definitely visit when it opens..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-14 19:12:10	Collected my son and we're off to the British Library to see comic book exhibition.. am feeling okay ish..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-14 05:27:32	You're never too old to eat Rice Krispies..perfect bedtime snack..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-14 03:16:36	@Yah_Reed that's very kind..thank you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-14 02:41:38	@spring_lamb @natasha_taiwan Natasha is right!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-14 02:39:16	@Yah_Reed no it never is, I just still get very anxious especially around family..and hate the physical symptoms of anxiety..it will pass..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-14 02:21:31	Sitting watching t.v and anxiety shoots up over me thinking that I know what someone is going to say to me tomorrow..hasn't even happened!!.
274535898	act1175	2014-04-13 23:48:40	@LadyAnanon thanks..x
274535898	act1175	2014-04-13 23:33:47	Actually that's not quite true, my head goes to places that upset me and then have to distract myself before I'm flooded with them..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-13 23:32:05	Am curling up with a book and mint tea..not feeling great after a little cry so may even doze..no reason for tears, they just come..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-13 21:27:27	Heading out to do some shopping..son home tomorrow so fridge needs stocking up..bit anxious about not quite being myself for him..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-13 20:28:36	Very annoying when people don't call when they say they will..nothing I can do but get on with the day..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-13 19:53:16	Time for some dusting with Columbo..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-13 18:30:56	Morning..another late start..am reading step 10 before what could be a hard phone call..doing what my sponsor says..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-13 06:57:47	Lost track of time lazing in front of telly..time for bed with book and hot chocolate..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-13 04:19:35	Have done nothing except sit on the sofa and have a hot bath..lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-13 01:00:52	Wandered for awhile but not really taking much in..home now and feel better for going but now want to hibernate..and that's okay..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 21:41:26	Heading out for a walk..for something to do more than needing to..feel a bit lonely after spending most of yesterday with someone..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 21:39:17	@xnadine1990x great mug!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 21:01:10	Well I've managed to get dressed just not sure what to do now..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 20:23:45	Feeling a bit unsettled and fidgety..don't know what I want to do..stay in or go out but neither is appealing..hmmmm..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 18:53:59	Morning..just..slept really deeply, was a struggle to wake but feel rested..not much to do today if anything at all..maybe a pyjama day..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 05:44:29	Bedtime is always lovely but even better when no alarm set..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 05:34:13	@NatalieOxford hope you have a great time!!..look forward to pictures..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 03:58:56	Sedation has definitely kicked in and is actually very calming without feeling drugged..think this might actually help..fingers crossed..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 03:56:38	Home now and very tired..been nice to spend time with a friend today who can relate to how I feel from personal experience..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 01:03:11	And not even sure I want to take anything else..but that could be my head playing tricks with me..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 01:01:17	I am very impressed with such a quick response although as with any new med I want to know a lot about it before I start it..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-12 00:58:40	Dr called after hearing back from psychiatrist and they want to me to start Mirtazapine..new one for me so any advice would be welcome..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 23:53:37	@MindCharity will have a look at that, hadn't heard of before..many thanks again for making me feel so welcome..it means a lot to me..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 23:37:00	Really good meeting and then a long walk with a friend..back home for tea before another meeting..quite touched by support I'm getting..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 23:34:01	@MindCharity brilliant!!..thanks Jess and all at Mind..am feeling very welcome and at a difficult time for me you've made me smile..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 18:11:09	Off to meet a friend and going to a meeting together..my instinct is to stay home so I'm doing the opposite..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 17:26:41	@oxymoronic82 I read that as sod slaw and thought of coleslaw..not awake yet!!.
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 17:13:20	Not a great nights sleep but got some rest..huge puffy eyes though that not even sure make up could sort..for now coffee and readings..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 05:57:27	Can't remember the last time I have looked forward to closing my eyes so much..bedtime..thanks for lovely messages and support today..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 05:52:24	@dannyyenson thanks Daniel, much appreciated!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 04:11:10	A few new, I still hate the word, followers today..hello!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 04:07:23	Hot bath and sweet tea have helped me unwind a bit..no noticeable effect from new med but so exhausted from crying not sure I'd know..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 03:34:57	@nikimummy13 thank you lovely..x
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 03:32:53	@PolCandid good luck with the move Paul..x

274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 01:58:24	@PolCandid @MindCharity made me smile for first time today..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 01:55:58	Not much more she could do today but she's contacted my psychiatrist as well..I feel supported which is so important to me right now..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 01:53:52	Doctor was good, listened, which I really appreciated..been given something to sedate me a bit so it's going to be a quiet evening..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-11 01:38:55	@MindCharity wow thank you!!..am proud to be a member of such a wonderful organisation..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 20:49:23	I feel uncomfortable seeing a g.p I don't know in regards to my mental health..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 20:28:26	Somebody spoke to somebody as doctor called back and although not my usual g.p I have an appointment at 3pm..progress..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 19:41:19	@_ck_supergirl thanks lovely..am trying again..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 19:16:23	@BipolarBlogger have sent dm..can't do on here x
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 19:08:26	Called surgery to see if could see g.p as am sitting here in tears..not a medical emergency so earliest appt 2 weeks!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 18:49:52	@MindCharity just joined!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 18:26:32	Therapist has asked me to see g.p about how low I feel..not sure how that will help so have come home..to do what exactly, I'm not sure..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 15:36:35	Morning..not enough sleep but up for therapy..in tears before coffee so guess I need it..feeling very low..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 05:12:56	Amazing how loving the cat becomes whenever I eat cereal..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 04:15:02	@tenfourzero @_ck_supergirl @FanForumsTV @DastardlyDeano @columbophile I think we are back to needing a host for April..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 00:49:46	@_ck_supergirl sure they'll be happy to see you..nursery staff are amazing in my opinion!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 00:44:15	@_ck_supergirl hugs and tissues for you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 00:12:24	@FanForumsTV @bhillsbert @DastardlyDeano @TheKevOrkian @Tsperlz @columbophile sounds fair to me!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-10 00:05:37	Good day volunteering after a bit of a struggle to get going this morning..definitely earned tea and biscuits..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-09 23:55:05	@bhillsbert @FanForumsTV @DastardlyDeano @_ck_supergirl @TheKevOrkian @Tsperlz @columbophile and episode!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-09 23:53:58	@bhillsbert @FanForumsTV @DastardlyDeano @_ck_supergirl @TheKevOrkian @Tsperlz @columbophile Kev has said he is, we're waiting on date/time
274535898	act1175	2014-04-09 05:26:36	Bedtime..hot chocolate and a book..am easily pleased..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-09 05:24:00	@Behappy_22648 the task there was nothing..was told I had built it up so much that expectations were I'd feel something..it's ok just to be.
274535898	act1175	2014-04-09 05:22:22	@Behappy_22648 first well done you!!..that's a huge step..I did some exposure therapy and often felt the same after the anxiety of doing 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-04-09 01:05:37	@PolCandid very young!..now I know why my mum used to watch them..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-09 01:02:23	Well I never knew Bergerac was in the rooms..an episode that includes a twelfth step visit..interesting it's openly referred to..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-09 00:57:02	@PolCandid ah a gratitude list..very good idea to help right size things..am having tea with Bergerac which is distracting me from me..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-08 23:50:31	Part of me has slipped into 'what can I do now' with an underlying sense of urgency so trying to avoid it developing further with self care.
274535898	act1175	2014-04-08 23:47:48	Had my home group then lunch with my mum before she heads off to Prague..so nice that we can do that these days..need to unwind now though..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-08 17:29:46	Morning..and a bright one!!..weather that is..although mood not bad either..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-08 04:32:33	@TheKevOrkian no worries, it's from @FanForumsTV ..when you've chosen episode and date tweet with #Columbotv ..thanks!..

274535898	act1175	2014-04-08 02:47:41	@TheKevOrkian while that sounds great have you read this.. http://www. fanforums.tv/threads/355-In tro-to-ColumboTV … it's a guide to hosting #ColumboTV ..might help..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-08 02:22:32	@TheKevOrkian hi Kev, have you chosen an episode for #ColumboTV ..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-08 01:21:35	@FanForumsTV @DastardlyDeano @_ck_supergirl @TheKevOrkian that was a good idea!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-08 00:59:15	@TheKevOrkian @FanForumsTV @DastardlyDeano @_ck_supergirl now I'm totally confused too..what has happened to #columbotv !!??..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-08 00:51:34	@LithiumLibGirl oh I'm so sorry..look after yourself..lots of love..x
274535898	act1175	2014-04-07 22:12:38	@GatorFOB yep I've curled up on sofa with my cat and a book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-07 21:49:15	Gym done..lunch done..now a bit bored indoors but also don't want to go back out..hmmm..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-07 03:55:25	@oxymoronic82 oops thought you were there!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-07 03:13:32	@oxymoronic82 @ArielHouse oh my that looks delicious..I've never had a proper tea..enjoy!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-07 00:47:43	Spent some time with my dad today..he's not well with copd and prefers to isolate so was nice he came to see me..now feet up time..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-06 18:37:41	@FanForumsTV @bythesheetstore combine the two and sleep on the sofa..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-06 18:36:30	Got up and ready for the gym thinking it was Monday!!..thanks Twitter for reminding me it's Sunday..back in pjs with my book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-06 02:52:16	Had a day of not being on my phone..been quite productive and also managed a bit of my ongoing cross stitch project..it's been nice..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-06 02:49:55	@leah_michal good to hear..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-05 02:51:58	of self care ie eating well is doing no good to anyone least of all me..she is right of course and that's why I don't like hearing it..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-05 02:51:02	Sponsor pulled me up for being self pitying..didn't like being told to nip it in the bud before it filters into all my thinking..and my lack
274535898	act1175	2014-04-05 01:13:28	@oxymoronic82 @Nikkers09 sorry to hear that..hopefully there will be a better one just made for you soon..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-05 01:10:56	Spent the afternoon trying to distract myself from thinking..read for a bit then managed to nap..just don't want to think or feel way I do..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-04 21:59:29	Felt totally isolated in meeting..having some very dark thoughts that are unsettling me and felt unable to voice them so left with them..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-04 17:33:44	Morning..slept deeply and feel so much better for it..need a meeting though so that's first on my list today..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-04 03:12:14	@_ck_supergirl I'm sure your visit perked him up!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-04 02:38:45	@_ck_supergirl that's great news..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-04 01:53:21	Dozed off and now I feel more tired..can't win..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 22:53:23	Drained from the morning and still not fully caught up on sleep I've declared it tea time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 22:33:17	@NatAccHelpline 2/2 and ask for my number to be removed from list having the phone put down on me.
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 22:32:21	@NatAccHelpline don't appreciate a call that states "I have information someone at this number has had an accident" & when I correct her 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 19:20:53	Home from therapy and written up..now have to wait for face to settle from crying before some local shopping..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 19:18:46	@mssginbottle hope you have a great time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 16:29:04	The present is distorted when the past shadows it.. Great readings this morning..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 16:28:26	Past experiences never let me go until I fully grieve those that need to be grieved or laugh over those that deserve the light touch..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 16:04:27	Yeh I slept!!..and could have continued but up for therapy..it's made such a difference to have some rest, may have a sneaky nap today too..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 05:03:42	Finally bedtime with hot chocolate and my book..so hoping I sleep tonight..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 04:59:47	@MariesVoicexoxo suspected it was picking up location..cheats!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 04:57:11	@MariesVoicexoxo it got my city right but said I love people and am as happy as a big red bus..hmmm..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 04:53:51	@oxymoronic82 my head went straight to they pick up your location..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 04:35:08	@oxymoronic82 I got 95% London, handy I'm already here too!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-03 02:37:11	Good bit of dark drama that..and much prefer being able to skip the ads..now I'm just waiting for bedtime..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-02 23:43:38	Started watching The Widower..am hooked..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-02 22:28:00	@Ghoulgirl gratefully received!!..thanks lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-02 21:56:23	Home and am so so tired..never normally have any trouble sleeping so feel really off kilter by a couple of bad nights..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-02 14:32:29	Another bad nights sleep but am up for volunteering..don't think I'll manage the whole day but will go in for morning..all I want is sleep..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-02 02:22:43	@MariesVoicexoxo yeh!!..well done..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-02 02:13:02	Hot sweet tea has given me a lift to get through till bedtime..and oddly just had my eyebrows licked by the cat..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-02 00:21:52	@marialex1971 good luck..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-04-02 00:20:19	I know it's from lack of sleep and that is fuelling my thoughts..just need to get through the evening now..think sweet tea needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-02 00:18:02	Home group was good but straight onto lunch with my sister was a mistake..too much emotional talk..now I'm home in tears..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-01 16:31:16	Lots of coffee and I'm awake but definitely not with it..today is going to be a struggle..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-01 14:21:55	What an awful night..just couldn't get to sleep then horrible dreams as I dozed..easier to get up but not slept off meds at all..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-01 05:14:13	@ItsJackOk yep a day of not knowing which tweets are real!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-01 05:13:36	So glad I have my home group tomorrow..heading to bed with my book, had enough for today..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-01 04:52:59	@painofaddiction always a pleasure Jim, hope you're well..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-01 04:25:56	Can't work out how to word how I'm feeling..shaky, lost, lonely, scared, are a few but still that's not right..a mix making me very wary..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-01 02:09:24	I only have a daily reprieve from an illness that tells me I'm not ill..must remember that!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-04-01 02:06:51	Need to slow my thoughts down..doesn't take this alcoholic head very long to make me feel like I'm the worst person ever..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-31 23:55:56	@BipolarBlogger pleased to hear that..was thinking of you today..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-31 23:35:13	More info in post from Open University..very tempted to try an access course..until self doubt slips in that I'll fail anyway so no point..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-31 21:04:53	4.5k uphill run..3.5k rowing and half hour weight resistance work..was tough but feels good too..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-31 18:41:24	Apparently it's my #Twitterversary today!!..3 years..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-31 05:46:27	@PolCandid sounds like a busy day..hope it all goes well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-31 02:29:48	@_ck_supergirl absolutely!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-31 01:45:02	@dev_2014 it's working wonderfully!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-31 00:19:45	Cagney and Lacey with tea and biscuits..bit of a funny day emotionally so this is just what I need..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-30 23:11:10	Nice walk but thoughts led to tears so better off at home..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-30 21:42:57	Going to have a walk along the river..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-30 19:14:12	Phone call to mum done..phone call from my son done..now time to do whatever I want..I just don't know what that is yet..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-30 05:34:17	@RecoverEd77 that's great..congratulations!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-30 04:00:20	@recovered2006 @natasha_tracy interesting question..not sure in my case, don't think I'll ever know..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-30 00:12:49	@oxymoronic82 totally relate to that..I really struggle with longer days too..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-29 22:52:50	Sometimes question why I vacuum when as soon as I'm done the cat rolls all over the carpet again..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-29 20:19:34	Morning/afternoon..must have been more tired than I thought!!..never mind..coffee and readings then the joy of housework..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-29 06:16:28	@MySoberPath he is gorgeous!!..and bet he knows it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-29 05:21:44	Starting the new series of Pramface..I may end up watching them all..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-29 04:46:54	Home..now time for tea, which never tastes the same anywhere else..and maybe cat cuddles..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-03-28 22:23:57	Finished one book and started another..moved from sofa and coffee to garden and herbal tea..may seem boring but I'm enjoying just being..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-28 17:22:47	Morning..rested and feel much better..no palpitations and anxiety low..going to have a reading day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-28 05:06:20	Still don't quite feel myself..not able to settle at anything and palpitations..but also incredibly tired..it's an odd mix..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-28 03:00:31	@PolCandid was lovely!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-28 02:24:42	Therapy went as well as it could..not much time to think about it as straight to my sisters..only now putting feet up with tea..very tired..

274535898	act1175	2014-03-26 02:43:57	Felt too panicky to sit with, paranoia even at home which is very rare for me..had to medicate so now slightly calmer but hate doing it..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-03-26 00:42:12	@_ck_supergirl pleased you're better..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-26 00:39:16	@_ck_supergirl sounds like a good day!!..how are you feeling?..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-26 00:36:34	Good meeting and felt ok but my anxiety levels have been steadily creeping up all afternoon..feel quite panicky so trying to stay calm..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-25 19:13:41	Morning..first lie in for awhile and it was much needed..home group today..also much needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-25 04:00:51	One person there had already been drinking and had a half bottle in his coat pocket..grateful that's not me today..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-25 02:49:50	@PolCandid it was!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-25 02:49:13	Well it has been a long day but glad I went..was a lovely service and finished with Sinatras My Way..a real celebration of his life..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-24 19:00:48	@PolCandid veering more towards going..have a place in the family car so my absence would be noticed..doing it for him as he would for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-24 18:32:08	Morning..it is my neighbours funeral today and my head is trying to find an excuse not to go..not sure I can cope with others grief today..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-24 04:04:27	@PolCandid I was 6 months old and flew to Chicago..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-24 03:14:26	@oxymoronic82 that must be a relief!!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-24 02:40:07	@LithiumLibGirl mine too!!..and she loves playing with potato peelings..odd creatures..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-24 01:46:35	@LadyAnanon mine says people come to aa to stop drinking and stay for their thinking..great minds think alike..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-24 01:43:00	@richardkhornsey it is really hard to believe that she says these things with such belief..absolutely deluded..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-24 01:00:08	Cooked a roast lunch and so much hassle I couldn't face eating it..guess it will be chicken sandwiches for tea..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-24 00:58:06	@LadyAnanon welcome to twitter!!..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-03-22 01:35:27	Bolognese sauce cooked and flapjacks in the oven..successful afternoon..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-21 23:22:37	@_ck_supergirl ha ha that is a little weird..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-21 22:50:37	Been to a meeting and nice to connect with people..now home for an afternoon of cooking..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-21 22:49:31	@_ck_supergirl very nice!!..and brave, I know on the spine is painful..but worth it!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-21 05:59:12	@Rozeup3 well done!!..huge achievement..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-21 03:35:31	Am hungry and did a huge food shop today but can't decide what to have..too many choices!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-21 02:04:20	Been a very emotional day..I'd never seen a dead person before and I found it almost surreal..feel the need to curl up and be quiet..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-20 21:31:38	Usually I make sure my day is clear after therapy..written it up but now meeting my mum and later going to see my neighbour at funeral home.
274535898	act1175	2014-03-20 17:24:54	@_ck_supergirl sping!!..your auto correct is at it again..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-20 17:07:16	Therapy day today..feel like I've cried enough this week already but gradually learning it has to hurt a lot before it can get better..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-20 02:53:40	@beatitude_road @SoberNobby that is great! Never heard that one before..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-20 01:26:45	Really good day volunteering..but on my feet all day so now enjoying well deserved cup of tea and feet up..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-19 03:42:21	@PolCandid thanks that helps..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-19 03:41:43	@nikimummy13 thanks..x
274535898	act1175	2014-03-19 03:40:37	Exhausted now but telly on and feel calmer..thinking hot bath and early night is the best plan..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-19 01:40:48	Grief is coming up a lot in therapy but when it hits and I'm on my own I just crumble..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-19 01:34:22	@MarkLH35 thanks Mark..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-19 01:33:38	@oxymoronic82 thanks lovely..just feel desperately sad..will stop when cried out I guess..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-19 00:08:54	Lonely and miserable..in floods of tears..and doesn't feel like they are going to stop..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-18 01:56:35	Gym done..chores done..now feet up with a book..noticing my mood lifting a bit so hoping that continues..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-17 17:32:06	Morning..gym today then all the chores I didn't do over weekend..oh what fun!!
274535898	act1175	2014-03-17 03:41:05	Something unnerving about the smoke alarm going off when nothing is on to set it off..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-17 02:27:05	My neighbours daughters cleared out his flat..they gave me two wooden black cats of his to remind me of him..and his money plant for luck..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-16 23:46:50	Sat by the river with a friend and we chatted away for 3 hours..was lovely..such power in one alcoholic talking to another..feel topped up..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-16 06:54:27	Haven't really woken up today so heading to bed and hoping for a fresher start tomorrow..just hope I don't read for too long..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-16 02:10:16	Pleased I've got a plan to meet a fellow member tomorrow..can't remember last time I had a coffee and a chat one to one..that's not good!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-16 01:47:04	Feeling bit dazed..slept too much..given in and curled up with tea and a book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-15 23:35:38	Coffee has had opposite effect of making me want to go back to bed..going to head out for some fresh air as much as I don't want to!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-15 22:35:49	Wow slept for 12 hours..must have needed it but body clock thrown now..coffee and breakfast time!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-15 08:08:48	@MariesVoice_MG definitely..take care of yourself..x
274535898	act1175	2014-03-15 06:49:30	@MariesVoice_MG I completely relate to that..my therapist says for now it's keeping me safe, until I'm ready to look at certain things..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-15 05:42:27	Finished book..am racing through Malin Fors series..now a bit of telly I think..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-15 01:07:49	Phone has updated software and now have to reinstall apps..not liking new twitter setup at all..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-14 22:29:45	@Fionaok good to see you back..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-14 22:27:04	I go outside and the sun goes away..hmmm..guess I'm staying in then..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-14 18:07:52	Slept deeply and headache finally gone..think a day of reading is needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-14 03:26:17	Had a lovely nap but headache not cleared..had to resort to pain relief so feel a bit spaced now..very quiet evening and early night for me.
274535898	act1175	2014-03-13 20:53:16	Therapy done..less tearful today but partly because my head is still pounding..going to eat then lie down..hurts to read..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-03-13 17:08:24	Morning..good sleep but woken with a pounding headache..coffee and readings before therapy and hope it passes..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-13 06:01:11	I've had a lovely relaxing evening..nice meal and hot bubble bath..now bed with hot chocolate and a book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-13 03:17:31	@PolCandid well done for managing the day!..I'm ok ish, still a bit low and tired today so early night..I'll give a try next week..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-13 02:56:53	@PolCandid I completely forgot about not smoking today!!..my head not ready yet..how about you?..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-13 01:06:30	Really good day volunteering..on my feet all day but busy so time flew by..now glad to be home with feet up..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-12 15:48:17	@blackcat3119 coffee is doing a good job right now!!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-12 15:11:00	Morning..tough getting up this early when didn't sleep well..feel like I'm trudging through wet sand physically and mentally..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-12 05:21:05	" @emmamarie1980 : https://twitter.com/emmamarie1980/status/443495364629651456/photo/1 pic.twitter.com/aYx6Cr3R5Y " Love it!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-12 02:55:12	Had a cry on the phone with mum..didn't think I'd be this sad but I am..used to chat to him several times a week and will miss that..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-11 23:20:06	Been to home group and it's such a good meeting..it always helps me to some degree..just someone saying hello can help me at times..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-11 17:30:35	@PolCandid thanks..I'm dreading telling my son, my neighbour was like a surrogate grandad to him..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-11 17:21:49	My elderly neighbour I helped with an ambulance has passed away this morning..it was peaceful and painless..really going to miss him..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-11 02:59:38	Home now so feet up and tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-11 02:57:34	She has worried so much about me for years that I try not to tell her when I'm low..as always I'm grateful we can do these things now..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-11 02:54:51	Saw my mum for an hour and it felt like 5..not her fault but I was so focused on making sure she thinks I'm ok that I'm exhausted..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-10 23:06:20	Got through gym but it was hard work..just didn't want to be around people..home for a rest before meeting my mum for a quick coffee..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-10 19:23:20	Coffee and readings done..heading out to the gym to see if it will help with my mood..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-10 02:16:02	@annabkrr I so often read your tweets and retweets and think the same thing!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-10 02:02:47	@MariesVoice_MG have a lazy rest of the day..what Sundays are for..x
274535898	act1175	2014-03-10 02:00:44	Cagney and Lacey with tea and a kitkat..that's me sorted for awhile..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-10 01:29:48	@MariesVoice_MG you must have needed it!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-10 00:50:03	@_ck_supergirl @d3sk thank you!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-10 00:12:51	I've lost all sense of time and dates..when is the next #columbotv ?..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-09 23:04:30	I feel like a vampire avoiding the sun..in my bedroom with curtains drawn reading..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-09 20:51:27	@oxymoronic82 I'll apologise to my fridge contents in that case..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-09 20:18:19	@oxymoronic82 I keep all chocolate and choc biscuits in the fridge..tastes better!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-09 19:51:12	Morning..only just..but a lovely long sleep and a lazy day ahead..hello sunday..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-09 06:20:58	@oxymoronic82 I don't know what I'd do without it!!..soon you'll be reading picture books..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-09 05:51:11	Spending most of my time reading..I know it's an escape from thinking but it's what works for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-09 02:43:49	Picked up the new Kate Atkinson book today..always a treat!!..Sainsburys are great for new books at low prices..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-09 00:34:54	@richardkhornsey only just seen they were on..never mind, I like this one..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-09 00:29:52	@richardkhornsey that is a great scene!!..I'm watching Troubled Waters now..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-08 23:19:27	Something very satisfying in unfolding boxes for the recycling..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-08 22:07:43	Good meeting and nice to see some friendly faces but scuttled home after..in no mood for real life conversations!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-08 18:08:56	@Yah_Reed thanks!!..and you. :-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-08 17:52:56	Morning..only one thing to do today and that is get to a meeting..not been getting to enough and need to keep them up especially when low..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-08 05:02:14	My 3k tweet goes to @oxymoronic82 who sent me my first twitter *hug* and never fails to make me smile at least once a day..thanks Sophie..x
274535898	act1175	2014-03-08 04:58:45	@PDunCandid great!..have a good weekend..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-08 02:48:45	@PDunCandid are you using anything to help?..I was going to try Wed for first day as I'm busy all day..be good to encourage each other..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-08 01:28:41	Also picked up patches and mouthspray today..now all I have to do is pick a date to quit smoking..it's my last vice but scared to give up..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-08 00:06:11	@oxymoronic82 @Nikkers09 that's fantastic news!!!.. sending huge congratulations your way..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-08 00:00:26	@oxymoronic82 I've missed something I think!!??..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-07 23:29:46	Or maybe the anxiety is linked with higher mood phases..I don't know..for now I'm home and hibernating..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-07 23:28:03	Not sure if they are linked or if when I'm low I just don't care so much about what people think which is a huge element in my anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-07 23:26:02	Missed the meeting as was waiting for a meds delivery but had a walk to the library..have noticed that when I'm low anxiety lowers as well..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-07 18:58:05	Really good long sleep..much needed..lunchtime meeting and library today..mostly taking it easy though..repeating to self "look after you"..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-07 04:08:48	Sponsor stressed the need for self care and reminded me of the miracle that as low as I feel I don't want to drink..I can forget that..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-07 02:04:13	@charlotteb297 well done!!!!!!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-07 01:38:51	Feel worse after a nap..could have gone on sleeping but hunger forced me up..going to have a very quiet evening and an early night..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-06 22:02:51	@PDunCandid I've finished writing it up and am going to have a lie down now..thanks Paul..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-06 21:53:13	Talked through how I need to look after myself and allow myself to feel how I feel without beating myself about it..easier said than done..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-06 21:49:49	Wow therapy was tough..therapist expressed worry about my mood and asked if I felt I needed to be contained..that's never happened before..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-06 18:03:39	Therapy today..and have made sure that the rest of the day is free..think an afternoon nap will be needed today..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-06 05:30:54	Going to bed without a book..I must be shattered..night..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-06 03:40:30	Tea and toast with nutella for dinner..was good..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-06 03:03:51	@HollHox thanks..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-06 01:45:41	Very very tired..found volunteering a bit of a struggle as feeling quite low..acted through the day which is draining..so glad to be home..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-05 16:49:03	Woke late and have had to rush through the morning to get to volunteering..not a good start to the day!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-05 03:25:19	@_ck_supergirl oh dear..at least you tried!!..glad you weren't flipping out the other way..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-05 02:27:25	@_ck_supergirl sorry..just realised you didn't mean pancakes..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-05 02:26:31	@_ck_supergirl good luck!!..and enjoy..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-05 02:03:05	Lovely welcome home from the cat..then the customary bite for having gone away..now curled up on my lap..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-05 01:16:32	Went straight to a meeting and so glad I did..really needed it but didn't know that till I was there..did the teas and felt 'part of'..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-04 15:45:44	Morning..cold here by the sea..but am snuggled under a blanket with my book..must save some of it for the journey home..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-04 04:49:45	@enchanted_poet no I haven't but I'll look out for him at the library..thanks!!..as you know I love reading..x
274535898	act1175	2014-03-04 04:29:48	Started a Tess Gerritsen book today..medically gory but can hardly put it down..love finding a new author who has written a series..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-04 03:13:02	Managed the journey well today..probably because hardly any people on the train..sadly that makes me more at ease..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-03 18:14:50	Morning..heading to my sisters today so having quiet time before I face travelling..coffee and readings essential..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-03 06:47:27	Phone keeps going from full battery to none and turning off..very annoying..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-02 23:39:56	Nice walk by the river but cold out there so now happily curled up on the sofa..tea and biscuits to hand..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-02 20:58:11	Book finished..dusting and vacuuming done..heading out for a walk so I can feel I've done something before I do nothing..makes sense to me..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-02 19:43:42	Nearly finished my book then I'll do the housework..honestly I will..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-02 05:59:48	@spring_lamb so pretty!!..happy birthday..x
274535898	act1175	2014-03-02 01:46:49	@Fionaok absolutely!..I'll cross fingers it continues for you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-03-02 01:41:40	@Fionaok that's great!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-02 01:40:09	Chores done and I have the rest of the weekend at home..still feeling a bit low so glad I have nothing else to do..time for tea and t.v..
274535898	act1175	2014-03-01 20:10:22	Morning/afternoon..Happy St Davids Day!!..always the first day of the year I buy daffodils..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-03-01 05:33:58	@oxymoronic82 love the new name!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-28 23:14:16	Have given in to a lazy day..bit of an emotional hangover I think..whatever it is I'm allowing myself a day off life..outside life that is..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-28 20:31:24	At some point I really should stop reading and get dressed..just not yet..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-28 17:59:40	Strong coffee..croissants and readings..good start to the day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-28 04:53:26	@BipolarBlogger that's exactly what it felt like..am grateful to have it but it is very draining..hot bath and early night for me..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-28 03:09:26	@PDunCandid wise words..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-28 03:08:45	Sobbed through therapy and at times barely spoke but that's okay there as I feel safe..spent rest of day quietly and gently..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-27 17:52:17	Morning..therapy day..feeling a bit disconnected but also quite anxious..odd mix of feelings..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-27 05:30:59	@Glass1ncision huge congratulations!!!..well done..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-27 04:40:06	@_ck_supergirl I know, even my 'I can do everything' 13 yr old couldn't do it so I gave up after that..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-27 03:55:30	@_ck_supergirl if it's the same as s4 you can't..can only choose from those on the phone..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-02-27 01:10:30	Feet up with tea and Death in Paradise..lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-27 00:28:37	2/2 in very difficult circumstances and I have to constantly think on my feet often making instant decisions..that bit exhausts me..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-27 00:26:37	Very busy day at volunteering..hard to explain how wiped out I feel..not tired physically but have been dealing directly with people 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-02-26 15:33:09	Got up for volunteering but struggling to find the energy to get ready..really want to go back to bed but will be annoyed at myself if I do.
274535898	act1175	2014-02-26 03:50:34	I think it's because I feel I can't settle down for the evening while it's still light..it feels wrong somehow..hard to explain..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-26 03:49:00	It's always around this time of year as it gets lighter that I feel lower..I like the warmer weather but I don't like the long evenings..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-26 02:59:59	I'm aware I'm feeling a bit low..spending too much time doing not much of anything..and enjoying being home alone..not sure why..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-25 23:25:13	Chores done..time for curling up with a book and peppermint tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-25 20:53:43	Apology made and accepted..neither of us were in a good place..have hugged and laughed about it..I feel better and ready for the meeting..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-25 20:12:44	Got to meeting early and ridiculously nervous over such a slight incident..just want chance to apologise then I can move on..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-25 18:48:20	Home group today and a bit of anxiety around seeing person I rowed with last week..but it will work out as it's meant to I'm sure..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-25 06:39:25	Have spent the evening reading and generally being quiet and calm..it's been nice..now it's hot chocolate and bed time..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-25 01:16:42	I watched a Father Dowling mystery last night..for mindless crap it was perfect..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-25 00:54:04	@MariesVoice_MG that's great news!!..well done you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-25 00:51:58	Really good gym session today then had a nurses appointment to check my breathing..lungs of a 52 year old..I'm 38..time to stop smoking..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 19:01:50	Morning!!..really well rested and ready to hit the gym..well after coffee that is..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 06:49:39	@nikimummy13 thanks lovely..had orange and almond cake my mum made..was very scrummy!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 05:59:59	Amazing what a hot bath and a cup of tea can do..feel much calmer..now I need something mindless to watch before bed..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 05:51:50	@Nikkers09 thank you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 05:51:26	@Ghoulgirl so kind..thank you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 04:38:54	@Yah_Reed thank you for the understanding..x
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 04:38:25	@enchanted_poet thanks lovely..x
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 04:37:06	@_ck_supergirl thanks supergirl..x
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 04:36:47	@trying_2_cope thank you..x
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 04:36:30	Finally home and I need a hot bath..feel exhausted from just trying to be..if that makes sense..and sadness that things are as they are..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 03:50:28	Smiled through tears to see hugs and others understanding how I feel..unlike people on this bus who are avoiding the crying woman..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 03:12:31	I see my sisters laughing and joking and all I think is why not me..why is everything so bloody hard for me..just want to get home now..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-24 03:08:34	On the bus home crying..hate the heightened state of anxiety I'm in and that I spent whole time feeling like I don't fit in..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-23 19:45:03	Mum so enjoys being with all three of her kids, especially now she doesn't have the daily worry of how I am..so I do this for her..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-23 19:42:10	Anxiety begins to rise as I'm on my way..wish these occasions could just be enjoyable for me but they rarely are..must focus on my mum..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-23 17:24:16	Morning!..family lunch today for my mums 75th birthday..I'm not great at these occasions but at least I get invited now!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-23 17:22:41	@AlnotsoAnon ha ha well in that case I hope to keep seeing you on here!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-23 05:16:17	@AlnotsoAnon will miss talking to you but well done for getting through all you have..take care..x
274535898	act1175	2014-02-23 04:40:33	@nikimummy13 haven't had those for ages..must add to shopping list..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-23 04:24:07	@nikimummy13 oh I wish!!..I had toast with nutella instead..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-23 03:08:17	Dozed off and now I have a headache and feel all dopey..strong sweet tea needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-22 23:17:38	@oxymoronic82 sorry terrible grammar..you're not alone..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-22 23:16:55	@oxymoronic82 your not alone..I really struggle when it stays light longer..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-22 22:48:13	3k uphill run..3.5k rowing..so gym done and got an appointment with the sofa now..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-22 18:12:19	@_ck_supergirl just what I'll want after the gym!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-22 18:11:06	Morning..no plans for today so going to the gym to at least get out of the house for a bit..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-22 05:19:55	@mr_andy_c no..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-22 03:34:06	@nikimummy13 ha ha..when followed by an apple I can tell myself I've covered all the food groups..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-22 02:52:03	Feeling really lazy..just about managed cheese on toast for dinner..now firmly rooted back on sofa..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-21 23:41:01	Good chat with a friend and good meeting as well..then library trip, shopping and home..that's enough for today, it's tea time!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-21 18:12:16	But I will remain calm and apologise for my part in it..that's all I can do..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-21 18:11:13	Morning..catching up with a friend today then going to a meeting together..may see person I disagreed with which provokes some anxiety..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-21 05:14:48	@LithiumLibGirl it's not, my son said it is because Benedict is making films now he is more expensive, but not sure how reliable that is..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-21 02:48:50	Catching up on the last series of Sherlock..shame there's such few episodes for a popular show..I love them!!
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 23:52:20	Luckily the second time practice manager was there who knows me well and assures me she will personally make sure it's ready tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 23:50:19	Two trips to g.p surgery today, neither time was prescription ready as I had been assured it was..have enough for tonight but annoying..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 21:31:48	Feel wiped out now so curling up with a book for a bit..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 21:29:47	@MariesVoice_MG got it!!..and a good idea I think..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 21:26:25	@MariesVoice_MG am I following your other account?..got confused..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 21:04:18	@MariesVoice_MG me too!!..as long as it's at a distance, not too good with real people..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 21:03:01	@jenjerfer Happy Birthday!!!..hope you have a great day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 21:00:47	@ukschizophrenic so pleased for you..Congratulations!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 20:39:43	Also by writing it out I can offload it to try and be able to move on with the day without it all whirling around in my head..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 20:38:00	Back from therapy and writing it up..I do it partly as a personal record and also in hope I can look back and see changes over long term..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 17:09:46	@PDunCandid I'm trying with that, still trying to identify feelings and the impact they have on me but do feel completely safe with her..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 17:05:46	@_ck_supergirl yeh!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 17:04:28	@PDunCandid don't mind at all!..one to one psychotherapy I started 5 months ago..still feels quite new but think it will help long term..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 16:30:44	Morning..therapy today and it feels like ages since last there when only been a week!!.
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 05:05:22	Feeling a bit vacant this evening..can't really concentrate on anything..think I'll just go to bed with a book, not fully caught up yet..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 01:43:38	Death in Paradise with tea and biscuits..It's the little things that make me happy..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 00:27:34	@quetiapineFella her way of wishing you happy birthday!!..hope it's a good one..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-20 00:07:08	Have tried texting someone today and it keeps saying failed..but works with other people..does that mean it's being blocked??..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-19 19:31:19	@oxymoronic82 glad it's not just me!!..you're the twitter queen, have a word..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-19 18:38:36	Aaahhhh..keep hitting follow or favourite by mistake..guess I should let the coffee do its job before I go online!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-19 18:33:54	Morning!..no volunteering today as it's half term so enjoying quiet time with coffee and readings..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-19 05:28:42	@MariesVoice_MG sorry you're struggling..hope you can get a good nights sleep..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-19 05:26:16	Feel so much better..but exhausted..bed calls..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-19 05:23:10	Great chat with my sponsor..will send a text apology for my part tomorrow so my side of the street is clean..and read step 10..that's all..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-19 02:30:55	@oxymoronic82 hope @Nikkers09 gets the help she needs soon..thinking of you both..x
274535898	act1175	2014-02-19 01:34:00	It was all over in a second but I know I need to apologise..I just don't want to..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-19 01:32:21	Not a great day..snapped at someone after the meeting and feeling lousy about it but also still feel justified..very rarely do I get angry..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-18 19:48:25	Off to home group..then hopefully an afternoon nap..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-18 18:41:06	Okay I'm awake!!..now what?..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-18 17:05:10	Am up physically but my head is very fuzzy..strong coffee please and plenty of it..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-18 06:09:09	Book..hot chocolate..bed..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-17 21:32:50	It now feels more like evening than afternoon..being jolted into waking really doesn't work when on meds..hey ho on with the day..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-17 16:52:46	@nikimummy13 might watch today instead and read the tweets!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-17 16:51:43	@PDunCandid think he will be okay he's in the best hands now..and thanks!! I didn't think really I just did what needed doing..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-17 16:30:23	Son managed to get back to sleep so now I can have coffee quietly but a very unsettling way to start the day..feeling fuzzy in my head..

274535898	act1175	2014-02-13 21:16:10	@nikimummy13 yes please!!..might have to buy myself one now..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-13 21:03:24	Therapy done and I feel exhausted..still have shopping and seeing my mum to do before I can relax..my fault for bad organisation..

274535898	act1175	2014-02-11 19:38:33	Slept through alarm again so another late start..not sure why at all..at least I have home group today to get me out of the house..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-11 04:56:20	@nikimummy13 thanks for that, I'll have a look..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-11 02:31:27	Have had a few times where I get very shaky and feel faint..it goes when I eat something but it's very odd and not had before?..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-11 01:36:57	Managed a few local chores and it was nice to get some fresh air but still feeling a bit low..just want to be at home alone..not good..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-10 22:36:13	@nikimummy13 yum yum..just heading out shopping and carrot cake now on my list..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-10 19:31:55	Another late start and lazy morning..I have to get out today..spending far too much time in my own head!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-10 19:18:21	@sportrelief please say she doesn't have any more to do today!!.. #Davina
274535898	act1175	2014-02-10 05:50:31	@oxymoronic82 look after yourself..x

274535898	act1175	2014-02-10 00:40:39	Realizing I've done next to nothing all weekend..no wonder I feel low and bored..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-09 20:06:29	Very late start to the day but so well rested I don't mind..coffee and readings time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-09 04:45:47	Catching up on t.v I missed when away but still feel really bored..kind of looking forward to going to bed now..just one of those days..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-09 01:18:53	Brief trip to local shops but pain in back means never sure what step is going to cause me agonising pain..heat wrap on now with feet up..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-09 01:08:26	@_ck_supergirl sounds fair enough to me!!..hope you have a good weekend..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-08 23:54:07	@_ck_supergirl you should be able to change your mind within 14 days..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-08 21:53:07	@ThisisDavina @sportrelief Go Davina!!..Go Davina!!..Go Davina!!..Go Davina!!..Go Davina!!..Go Davina!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-08 20:40:00	Copious amounts of coffee and lots of reading..still feel bored..think maybe a short gentle walk is needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-08 19:19:16	I'm bored already..back still playing up and no plans for weekend..with wind howling not sure that's a bad thing..but need something to do..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 23:09:09	Been to a meeting but the walking hasn't helped..still twinges of pain that reminds me to slow down..home now for quiet afternoon..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 18:34:56	Morning!!..back much improved which is a relief..still going to be careful today but feels like worst has past..yeh!!..

274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 04:34:11	@TwelveDrawings @Rozeup3 well put and certainly given me pause for thought..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 03:46:50	@charlotteb297 am trying..hot bath and early night with hot water bottle planned..hope you're having a good evening yourself..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 03:39:39	@Rozeup3 so am getting it out some way!!
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 03:38:49	@Rozeup3 that's exactly it..I keep thinking once I break through that I'll make more progress..but I share a lot one to one and with sponsor
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 03:34:23	@charlotteb297 thank you lovely!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 03:32:44	@Rozeup3 @TwelveDrawings I have trouble sharing too..don't like people looking at me..prefer to be quiet and listen..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 03:29:07	@DoctorChristian you know you're going to set off leg questions again don't you?..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 02:59:21	The doctor today referred me back to AS clinic so hopefully the wait won't be too long..this is just miserable..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 02:58:12	Really can't understand why my back is so bad after my injection..it's made no difference after working so well for months..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 02:08:30	Got to doctor, just takes a very long time to walk, more antibiotics as chest infection not fully cleared..now heat pack on and feet up..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-07 02:05:59	@oxymoronic82 they're all lovely, am so pleased for you both!!!..and welcome back..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-02-06 20:24:22	Therapy okay, still cried throughout but used to that now..back not easing up so a rest before dr appt later.
274535898	act1175	2014-02-06 17:31:50	Morning..therapy today and going to need extra time to walk with my back still hurting..feeling a little sorry for myself..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-06 06:17:23	Been a long day with chronic pain..bed with hot chocolate calling me..and hopes tomorrow will be better..

274535898	act1175	2014-02-06 01:48:46	@jennyeclair that's why I always leave the bags a couple of days and recheck them before they go..always change my mind about something!!..

274535898	act1175	2014-02-06 01:05:50	Home and injection done but not touched the pain..feels as bad as it used to..heat pack on it now and feet up..not much else I can do..

274535898	act1175	2014-02-05 02:01:52	Really bad back pain this evening..sitting with a heat wrap but spasms of pain at slightest movement..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-02-04 05:38:34	Not sure why but I never watch t.v when I'm here..it's so quiet it would be a shame to spoil it..so I'm reading with mint tea..just lovely..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-04 04:56:12	@Anthillmob74 be prepared to be driven to throwing your phone across the room!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-04 01:50:55	Finally made it to Hastings after 3 trains due to a landslide..but coped quite well and anxiety stayed low..definitely tea time now..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-03 18:13:36	Morning..travelling to see my sister again today..think I have it planned well enough to keep anxiety down, hope so anyway!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-02-03 03:20:29	Headbutted kitchen door, by accident, was stunned and then the cat came and bit me!!..I think she was checking I was okay in her own way..

274535898	act1175	2014-01-31 04:59:30	Been a bit spaced out today after therapy..wrote it up then just read and read..and been following Amanda Knox case too..interesting..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-30 17:35:19	I really don't feel like therapy this morning but I guess part of it is going when I don't want to..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-30 06:10:25	@james12step sounds like more going on than when I was there..keep enjoying!!..

274535898	act1175	2014-01-29 17:38:33	Woke with sore eyes so not volunteering today..waiting for doctor to call back to get eye drops..think I'm run down so a rest day for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-29 04:23:46	@_ck_supergirl hope you enjoy!..I'm recording to watch tomorrow..early night for me..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-29 00:58:09	As much as I hate to medicate anxiety, I also recognise the self care element of it being prescribed..and it's helping me to help myself..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-29 00:13:09	Feel like I'm going to have a full blown panic attack..at least I'm at home and alone..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-28 23:49:47	@bythesheetstore ha ha..made me smile..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-28 23:30:54	Home group, shopping and home..nothing really so why high anxiety??..guess no reason so try and manage not explain..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-28 18:49:21	Started day by spilling coffee over white sheets..so guessing it can only get better!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-28 05:28:10	@Renzo_Soprano not imagine, I know..and with no pain relief either!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-28 00:21:59	Had a nice walk and treated myself to some thermal socks..now feet up and telly time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 21:39:48	@nikimummy13 am pleased for you!!..and yes having a good day myself thanks..x
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 21:29:36	@nikimummy13 that's lovely..hope it lasts..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 21:27:11	Having done gym, 4k run and 3k rowing, am now fidgety..don't want to be indoors so heading out for a walk along the river..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 21:05:31	@oxymoronic82 in a silly mood..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 21:01:59	@oxymoronic82 euphemism??..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 20:59:48	@spursbythebeach let me know how you get on..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 20:52:52	@spursbythebeach but nothing like I used to get..I also do exercises though to strengthen core muscles..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 20:52:04	@spursbythebeach kicked in within 24 hours, I was amazed..I inject fortnightly and it usually lasts that long..I do still get pain sometimes
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 20:46:58	@spursbythebeach alternate sites on stomach avoiding directly around navel area..has made a huge difference for me, hope it does for you!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 20:42:21	@spursbythebeach is this for your AS?..I inject into stomach as well..but alternate sites to avoid irritation..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 20:41:03	@pinguinokx night Marc..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 18:09:34	@Fionaok good luck!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 18:04:21	Really good sleep but woken by a hungry cat..seeing as I'm up before I planned to be going to go to the gym..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-27 05:34:57	It's been a tiring last few days for one reason or another..early night and no alarm set..bliss!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-26 23:53:51	@oxymoronic82 beautiful!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-26 21:03:54	@charlotteb297 I still have all of my sons from year 1 to now..not sure why!!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-26 19:02:46	Quiet morning here..son watching Wrath of Khan and I'm reading..think it will be a pyjama day today..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-26 18:38:10	@_ck_supergirl Troubled Waters..my son wants to watch!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-26 18:05:40	@_ck_supergirl gym then Columbo at 2.40 on itv3?..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-26 06:40:57	Glad it's bedtime and looking forward to a better day tomorrow..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-26 06:39:13	@leah_michal he he..that made me smile..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-26 03:05:54	My son had a lovely time and we're going to spend the evening on the sofa with a film..I've calmed down a lot and hoping it stays that way..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 23:17:16	@Renzo_Soprano flashback to primary school at seeing that!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 22:42:08	Now I feel a bit sad that I'm missing the theatre but really I know I made the right choice by staying home..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 20:17:41	He is so good about it telling me to put my feet up and read while he's away..he knows this helps..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 20:16:43	Mum has kindly agreed to take my son to the theatre instead of me..no point in trying to pretend I'm feeling okay and ruin his day too..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 18:31:25	@MooseCracker that is true yes..just not sure I'll be able to face the fear today..a conflict between wanting to and also not!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 18:07:00	I need to be realistic about what I can and cannot do..I don't feel like I can face the outside world today..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 18:05:24	Broken sleep and woke to high anxiety and still rapid heartbeat..meant to be going to the theatre today and not sure I can..readings first..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 06:36:39	Thankfully meds have kicked in..bedtime..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 05:18:22	Have this urge to scream..just hate how I feel..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 03:50:56	Two hours on the phone with my sister..the only member of my family that understands my altering moods..her advice was self care..am trying.
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 01:02:54	Hate this as it comes out of nowhere and leaves me scared that I'm in for a couple of days of this..going by past experience that is..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-01-25 00:55:27	Have been bustling about doing lots of things all over the flat but not being able to settle at anything..heart is racing and won't stop..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-24 23:17:28	Good meeting but very self conscious, scuttled away after..done my chores but anxiety is up and finding it hard to unwind..don't need this..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-24 18:28:30	@BipolarBlogger oh I'm sorry to hear that..I do hope it improves soon and that you're looking after yourself..x
274535898	act1175	2014-01-24 18:13:37	@BipolarBlogger thanks!..after a few nights of sleeping badly it has made a real difference to feel rested..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-24 17:45:28	Morning!..coffee and readings then a lunchtime meeting today..and lots of little chores to do..at least I had a good sleep so feel better..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-24 02:07:47	@_ck_supergirl that's great!!..I'm doing okay thanks, feet up in front of telly so can't complain..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-24 01:59:21	@_ck_supergirl how has this week been? I hope better than last..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-24 00:51:47	It's always around this time of day, having cried throughout therapy, that the feeling of being utterly drained hits hardest..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-23 22:01:48	@moonshinehigh 2/2 and time to heal..may involve a lot of weeping..can all be quite overwhelming but hopefully worth it in the long run..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-23 22:00:28	@moonshinehigh interesting but also scary..she said we need to treat me like an open wound that needs looking after and tending to..1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-01-23 21:10:57	2/2 something to distract myself or I will over think things through all day..going to lie down and read, get lost in someone elses world..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-23 21:08:34	How I turn to self punishment as a way of dealing with things, she thinks may be anger turned inwards..for now though I need to do 1/2
274535898	act1175	2014-01-23 21:05:39	Therapy done but skipped gym..hitting on some painful stuff around childhood and feelings of abandonment but also a lot of misplaced anger..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-23 17:15:26	Managed to get a bit more sleep but still don't feel fully rested..therapy this morning and I hope gym too but will see how I feel..

274535898	act1175	2014-01-22 15:24:58	Morning!!..up early again for volunteering..it's going to be a struggle today as I'm sleeping badly for some reason..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-22 04:08:26	Not functioning very well at all..half asleep and my back is hurting..think bath and bed is in order..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-22 03:34:40	@BPDtainted that's lovely!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-22 02:00:49	Managed to doze but badly..woke with a craving for sweet tea, almost shaky like my blood sugar has dropped..hoping tea helps..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-21 23:39:30	Really good meeting..chair 29 years sober and 4 newcomers..feel heaps better and now it's definitely nap time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-21 19:44:09	More coffee before meeting..is it really not even midday yet??..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-21 19:28:51	@nikimummy13 managed 4k run and 3k rowing..skipped resistance today..definitely need a nap later!!
274535898	act1175	2014-01-21 19:05:10	@nikimummy13 well done you!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-21 17:32:17	Seeing as I'm up I may as well go to the gym before home group..see if it will help clear my foggy head..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-21 16:15:04	@nikimummy13 morning..though would rather still be in bed..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-21 15:40:23	Stirred by a bad dream I can't remember and couldn't get back to sleep..guess it's coffee time..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-21 00:22:17	Today has been gym, meeting and coffee after with couple good friends..quite busy but all in good ways..now feet up with tea and biscuits..

274535898	act1175	2014-01-20 06:47:02	@BipolaTimes @ukschizophrenic day centres offer the facility to charge phones, get post etc
274535898	act1175	2014-01-20 05:35:09	But I also have faith that it will work out as it's meant to..doesn't everything in the end?..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-20 05:32:54	Good catch up chat with my sponsor..meeting next week to look at step eight a bit more..in all honesty I'm a little wary of next stage..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-20 00:40:10	My sons new word..minfestation..a small infestation..we were of course talking about what to do in a zombie apocalypse..boys!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-20 00:38:30	Had a walk by the river and now snuggled up in trackies reading..a happy sunday..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-19 22:42:41	Housework done and now I'm bored..trying to decide whether to have a walk or curl up with a book..decisions decisions..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-19 22:20:45	@rickygervais didn't you have same thing last week?..just curious..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-19 20:43:19	Really lazy morning..now attempting to muster up energy for housework..bright day showing up dust and it's bugging me..

274535898	act1175	2014-01-18 05:02:09	@spursbythebeach thanks for follow!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-18 03:46:27	All I've done today is read, write and watch rain..it's been lovely!!
274535898	act1175	2014-01-18 01:06:21	@karen12steps that's fantastic!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 23:05:45	Have made a WordPress account..think will try writing a bit and see how it goes..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 22:20:51	Hasn't stopped raining here and not fancying that at all I've opted to curl up with a book and watch the rain out the window..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 19:20:59	@nikimummy13 housework counts as cardio in my book!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 17:04:13	Morning..slept deeply and am well rested..coffee and online readings then going to venture out..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 17:00:47	@charlotteb297 lots of luck!! Hope it goes well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 07:24:55	Have a feeling I'm going to sleep well after all the anxiety of the day..at least it has eased up now..bed with hot chocolate for me..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 04:42:55	@oxymoronic82 yep that's what I'm hoping for..sorry you're not having a great day..sending best wishes, as always..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 03:33:48	Wind is howling outside..looking forward to a walk on the beach tomorrow..I always find being near water very calming..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 02:29:11	@Glass1ncision ha ha mine knocks things down in the bedroom to wake me up..but second to be fed definitely won't be popular!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 02:10:48	@Glass1ncision beautiful colours so can get away with anything!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 02:05:50	At my sisters new house in Hastings while she is in London working..it's very quiet and cosy but so quiet it's a little scary..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-17 00:52:45	Relief to actually be here..but still need to spend some time calming down and acclimatising myself..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-16 22:38:13	To feel sad and apologetic for ones existence is not right..but it's so often how I feel..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-16 21:52:08	I've caught the train I thought I'd miss..I'm fine with trains it's just all the other people on it that I find hard..keeping my head down..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-16 21:18:34	Stress levels very high..I'm not very good at going away and leaving my space..really trying to hold it together here..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-16 20:51:10	Therapy done and don't really have time to think about it..am off to the seaside overnight so rush to get ready and catch train..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-16 17:24:05	Twitter seems to be following and unfollowing people for me..not helpful!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-16 16:54:44	Really good rest but woken with a headache..hope it eases with coffee and readings..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-16 06:12:30	Family member just managed to infuriate me in minutes..time to switch off phone..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-16 04:10:43	Hot bubble bath..bliss..

274535898	act1175	2014-01-16 00:28:06	@_ck_supergirl I knew!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-16 00:26:50	Long day volunteering but home with tea in hand..I take it for granted but the people I work with have no such luxuries..can be hard going..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-15 15:21:29	Strong coffee..yes please..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-15 04:34:28	Leaking banoffie pie..have to laugh!! #GBBOSportRelief

274535898	act1175	2014-01-15 03:18:51	@BipolarBlogger yes of course, I thought it might have been charity related..hope it goes well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-15 00:52:44	@BipolarBlogger ah okay thanks, will have a look..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-15 00:40:51	@BipolarBlogger is there a fee?..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-15 00:37:28	@MySoberPath that's the one! And a newcomers first meeting..always good, both that they're there and as a reminder of how bad it was..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-15 00:17:07	Really good home group today..and much needed..head feels clearer and looking forward to a lazy evening..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-14 19:26:15	You cannot think your way into sober living.. You live your way into sober thinking..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-14 19:23:47	@nikimummy13 yeh!! Well done you!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-14 07:05:52	Enough screens for me..time for bed with a book..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-01-13 23:38:40	@nikimummy13 thanks!!..will feel it tomorrow..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-13 22:02:43	5k uphill run..3k rowing and half hour resistance workout with weights..feel better now..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-13 19:58:41	Leaving the house before I over think things too much..telling myself will feel better after..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-13 19:25:45	Back to the gym today and it's a struggle with anxiety..just need to get there and break through it..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-13 05:04:09	Feel like Sunday has gone too quickly..would like another one before the week starts..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-13 02:09:15	Sunday phone call with mum done..a pleasure now and I'm grateful for that..caused her years of pain but we're closer now than ever..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-13 00:27:59	@ukschizophrenic that's really good, hope it continues..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-01-12 01:21:28	I've taped far too much so struggling to decide what to watch..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-11 23:21:56	Pilates was good though no improvement to my back and probably shouldn't have shopped after..never mind, home now..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-11 19:25:33	@richardkhornsey thanks for that info, forgot to get a t.v guide!! Perfect timimg for post pilates sofa fest..:-)

274535898	act1175	2014-01-11 19:03:13	Bright morning..I'm off to do Pilates in the hope it will ease my back pain a bit..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-11 06:14:00	@charlotteb297 hello!! Welcome to twitter..

274535898	act1175	2014-01-11 04:49:48	Had a two hour chat with my sister..am all talked out!!!
274535898	act1175	2014-01-11 01:53:33	Good meeting and chat after..then library and shopping..so not much but feel tired..back pain and fatigue definitely linked..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-10 22:55:47	@_ck_supergirl @MarkLH35 @Operetta_doll @beveridge_david @emmamheard @RM5566 @KarineBonneau2 @EmyRosekitten @LANEY1010 thank you!! :-)

274535898	act1175	2014-01-10 01:21:31	@painofaddiction always a pleasure to pass on your great tweets!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-10 00:45:40	Feeling a drained now..half hour nap is in order I think..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-09 22:12:44	Bit fidgety now from being in..time to have a wander out and probably buy things I don't need..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-09 21:29:23	@_ck_supergirl good choice to clean with!!.:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-09 20:42:23	Therapy done, didn't cry quite as much which I'm taking as progress..skipped gym so home to read..currently being headbutted by cat..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-09 17:32:52	Back to therapy this morning after 3 week break..oddly I'm quite looking forward to it..and then the gym I hope..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-09 05:25:41	@oxymoronic82 oh lovely, sending hugs and tissues..x
274535898	act1175	2014-01-09 03:48:32	@TheRealSupermum coffee in the morning..tea in the evening..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-09 03:47:04	@RobHofficial indeed!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-09 03:07:20	@RobHofficial not sure I'd eat out most nights even if I could afford it..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-09 02:57:06	@GreggAWallace do you eat out every night? ;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-09 01:26:25	Gone to that place in my mind where I'm imagining a future conversation..and I'm coming out of it upset..not even happened yet!!
274535898	act1175	2014-01-09 00:16:53	Home from volunteering..my back is really sore today so heat pack on and feet up to watch new Marple..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-08 15:33:37	Well am physically up for volunteering but very fuzzy head from nowhere near enough sleep..I can do this..*repeat to self*..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-08 06:33:33	@oxymoronic82 secrets safe with us..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-08 03:19:59	@_ck_supergirl ha ha good idea!!
274535898	act1175	2014-01-08 03:16:10	@_ck_supergirl we saw the clip at the weekend..looks pretty good..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-08 01:23:32	Meeting then a good, tearful chat with a friend..the power of one alcoholic sharing with another in action again..anxiety lower and calmer..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-07 19:46:45	Anxiety still high today so my only aim is a meeting..trying to ease pressure off myself to get things done..keeping it simple..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-07 04:37:16	@BipolarBlogger that's great..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-07 04:35:31	@Mr_Mike_Clarke thanks for that, made me smile..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-07 04:31:15	@moonshinehigh thanks, yes it's meant to be funny, getting some of it..just waiting for bed time now!!
274535898	act1175	2014-01-07 01:55:01	Sitting with tea and t.v with hope of easing anxiety a bit..feel exhausted from it..racing thoughts are tiring..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-07 00:11:28	Only went to local shops but gripped by anxiety..felt very exposed and vunerable so scuttled home..:-(
274535898	act1175	2014-01-06 21:00:56	Day definitely not going as planned..still in pyjamas reading..gave up on fitting everything in today and taking it slowly instead..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-06 19:48:03	Woke late so rushing as I've set myself a ridiculous amount to do today..maybe need to rethink day and give myself a break..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-06 04:48:03	@spring_lamb yeh!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-06 02:57:06	@Karen_Betts @NatalieOxford well done!!.. so pleased for you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-06 02:12:14	Feel drained this evening..normal life resumes tomorrow and don't feel ready for it..think an early night needed..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-05 19:18:39	Don't really feel rested but last day of holidays so will try to make an effort to be cheerful..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-05 19:10:45	@_ck_supergirl sounds like a good plan to heal the blues..hope it works..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-05 03:49:25	@nikimummy13 completely agree..hummed along a little and loved the snowman but that's about it..and they had subtitles up by mistake!!
274535898	act1175	2014-01-05 02:52:30	Frozen wasn't quite what the trailers lead us to think it was but a few enjoyable moments..nearing the end of xmas holidays now..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-04 19:17:53	Day has started much better today..coffee, readings and just a general sense of calm..going to see Frozen today so looking forward to that!
274535898	act1175	2014-01-04 06:54:00	@Glass1ncision Happy Birthday!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-04 04:48:38	Finally a bit calmer..quiet time with a book and hot bath helped..now some t.v time..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-04 02:34:19	Anxiety not really lowered all day..to be honest will just be glad when today is over..miserable I know but true..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-04 02:33:19	@yourbipolargirl @CraigEdwards01 @TriXorcist @LithiumLibGirl @bipolarnana1 @jbuchana @SweetSalute @ATreeHugginGal @ExitAnxiety thank you!!
274535898	act1175	2014-01-03 21:04:01	One little knock to my routines is hard enough..wish life had a reset button!!!
274535898	act1175	2014-01-03 21:02:50	Not having a good day so far..woke late, milk was off so black coffee..no time for readings before sons friend arrived so feel very uneasy..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-03 05:09:56	Went ice skating today at Somerset House, was absolutely lovely..legs ache now though..;-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-02 19:31:38	@crazynified you okay?..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-02 19:16:33	@MySoberPath they were brilliant!! First time my son stayed up to see them live so was extra special..Happy New Year James..:-)
274535898	act1175	2014-01-02 06:52:22	Sherlock done..good to see him back..now definitely bedtime..night all..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-02 03:49:25	I can't do anymore today..done loads so pleased but exhausted..time for a well deserved bath before Sherlock!!..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-02 00:23:00	Today has all been very busy..cleaning, more cleaning..sister brought furniture so lots of moving stuff around..phew need to stop soon..
274535898	act1175	2014-01-01 19:01:22	@TheRealSupermum Happy Birthday!!!!

274535898	act1175	2013-12-31 05:20:32	@AlnotsoAnon is there anyone else you can call on?..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-31 05:19:30	New years eve is when me and my son go to winter wonderland and this year we're going to the river to see the fireworks too!!.
274535898	act1175	2013-12-31 05:17:51	Furniture not coming till Thursday now..it's my sister helping and she had to change the day..never mind..looking forward to tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-30 18:34:47	Morning..quietly having coffee with readings before quick gym session..then afternoon of fitting new furniture in..quite calm for now..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-30 05:25:06	@nikimummy13 thanks..just getting rid of some stuff I've had for many years..some with memories, but needs replacing..will be fine..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-30 04:42:58	Anxiety just kicked in..I know it's because a few things are changing, even though it's all good change makes me anxious..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-30 01:51:17	Have finally done all I can until new furniture arrives..am knackered!!..tea now please..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-29 19:42:45	Excellent rest but still loads to do today..clothes everywhere and all has to be done by end of today..eekkk..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-29 05:19:17	Am absolutely shattered..must have done more than I thought today..early night for me..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-29 04:44:50	@Hippychick1987 that's brilliant..well done..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-29 03:41:43	@Comfort_talks to set myself realistic goals and practice more self care..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-29 02:12:50	Finally stopped sorting..actually got quite a bit done..more to do but it's tea and t.v time now with well deserved chocolate biscuits!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-29 02:10:09	@TwelveDrawings how lovely!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-29 00:46:44	Busy busy bee..must stop soon....
274535898	act1175	2013-12-28 20:27:58	Haven't made it to meeting, just too much to do at home..everything is everywhere and I have no idea where to start..get off phone maybe ;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-28 19:56:57	@AlnotsoAnon glad you have some support today..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-28 18:24:14	Morning..another lunchtime meeting today before facing bedroom furniture challenge..to clear all out today is going to be a big task..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-28 06:27:22	@bipolarvoice completely relate..my schedules and body clock are all over the place!!..all over soon..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-28 04:50:16	Or am I just not putting enough effort into it..I need to be more proactive in my own life and lower my expectations..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-28 04:46:33	Just another quiet evening on the sofa..want to make some plans for the new year but finding it hard to work out what to start on first..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-28 01:06:55	Realized I have today and tomorrow to clear out furniture to make way for new stuff arriving..I always leave stuff till the last minute!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-27 23:41:24	@AlnotsoAnon sending *hugs* and thinking of you..x
274535898	act1175	2013-12-27 23:39:19	Anxiety a little high today..think it's because I've been out and about and more people are around..I'm much happier when streets are quiet.
274535898	act1175	2013-12-27 06:02:23	@SoberBachelor well done with prioritising..glad you had a nice christmas..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-27 04:12:00	Making sure I get everything done before big fat quiz of the year..love it!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-27 03:03:17	Quite enjoying being glued to the sofa but it's not doing my back much good..regular stretches needed..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-27 02:28:23	@_ck_supergirl aww looks lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-27 01:38:03	@MariesVoice_MG that looks lush!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-27 00:23:47	@BipolarBlogger must have missed you yesterday sorry..happy holidays!! x

274535898	act1175	2013-12-22 20:01:13	Feeling a bit sad..christmas cheer not kicking in and feel like I have to pretend when really I just want to hide away..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-22 03:08:35	@ragazzadicali I'm jealous..over here we only get peppermint ones..:-(

274535898	act1175	2013-12-21 18:24:00	Hitting another lunchtime meeting today..trying to fit lots in as my head is in racing mode and really only a meeting can help that..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-21 05:47:59	@BipolaTimes @TheRealSupermum good answer!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-21 05:28:17	@terpsichorejoy looks like you're not allowed to move for awhile!!..;-)

274535898	act1175	2013-12-21 04:55:03	My son packing for a car journey..charging ipad, psp go and his phone..I suggested he could talk to me, his reply was "don't be silly"!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 23:08:34	@MySoberPath yep in her own unique way..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 22:07:08	Great meeting and topped up enough to face some family this afternoon..now trying to wrap presents with a playful cat is quite hard!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 19:04:37	@oxymoronic82 you should be very proud!! It's a great idea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 18:50:17	@oxymoronic82 didn't realize you had started twitter buddy..not just a pretty face are you!..;-)

274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 05:57:10	Can't stay awake..bed with a book for me..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 03:26:45	@LithiumLibGirl well a cat is a great substitute till he gets home!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 03:20:40	@LithiumLibGirl mine will come and sit next to me when I'm crying..it's lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 03:02:42	Thunder and lightning..lovely to be inside and listen to it..cat not quite so keen..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 02:33:48	Called my sponsor and she said I did the right thing..too early in my own recovery to deal with that and if she really wants to go she can..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 02:02:45	Maybe should have taken her tonight but felt she was too drunk..not sure if that was my decision to make..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 02:01:34	Newcomer just phoned me clearly drunk wanting to go to a meeting..I said probably best to do tomorrow but now unsure that was right..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-20 01:35:38	Think I've done all the shopping..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-19 21:46:20	Right, xmas shopping I go..already looking forward to being back home!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-19 21:02:03	@Rozeup3 congratulations!!..enjoy your day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-19 20:01:04	Difficulties in finding out who I am can be put on hold for today..have come home for coffee and to let my eyes recover before out to shop..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-19 19:59:23	Quite relieved that was last therapy session for 3 weeks..is good to have a place where "I don't know" is okay..and had a lot of that today.
274535898	act1175	2013-12-19 17:28:45	Morning..late night and definitely not had enough sleep but have therapy and then have to do more shopping..neither of which I want to do..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-19 01:16:32	@Polarbear3127 brilliant!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-18 21:46:11	Volunteering done and off to my sisters..she moves at the weekend so I'm helping pack the last bits..be sad when she goes..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-18 15:25:11	Think I got about five hours sleep so struggling this morning..but not going to cancel volunteering as is my last day of the year..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-18 06:18:32	@AddictAgain brilliant, glad to help..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-18 05:54:41	@AddictAgain links to both the websites with all meetings in glasgow.. http:// ukna.org / http://www. alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk/aa-meetings/fi nd-a-meeting … good luck..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-18 04:30:55	Don't need this mood this evening..need to get early night for volunteering and still feel like I can't just slow down..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-18 03:32:31	Full time job keeping the cat away from decorations..but no evidence she does it when I'm out??..sure she thrives on my reaction!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-18 03:08:52	@MYSADCAT thanks..just ordered all three!! My christmas pressie to myself :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-18 02:43:25	@MYSADCAT which is the first in the series?
274535898	act1175	2013-12-18 01:43:01	Busy day..good meeting followed by more shopping..bit anxious that I can't seem to slow down now though..still flitting around..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-17 18:57:05	Off to much needed home group soon..cards ready to give and extra big box of choccie biscuits to share.. :-)

274535898	act1175	2013-12-17 01:57:23	@BipolaTimes that's amazing!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-17 01:22:30	Thank you to Sainsburys for the gift voucher in the post..nice gesture at this time of the year..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-17 00:26:18	Just realized I haven't been to a meeting for a week..not good and explains why I've been torturing myself mentally today with old guilt..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-16 23:05:11	Pushed myself at gym but feels good..some shopping done it's time for feet up with tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-16 19:06:01	Gym time..followed by shopping..getting into xmas a little more now..about time!!

274535898	act1175	2013-12-13 19:10:02	Morning..really good sleep that was much needed..have to do some shopping today before my son comes home for the weekend..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-13 02:41:04	I haven't bought a single present yet..dawning on me I need to get a move on..I hate the actual shopping bit..might look online to start..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-13 00:22:48	Therapy done..gym done..christmas tree bought..now feet up with well deserved cup of tea before moving furniture around to fit it in!!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-12 17:48:34	@BipolarBlogger thanks!! The smell of a fresh tree is my favourite thing about this season..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-12 17:41:07	Today is therapy and hopefully gym..then it's choosing and buying xmas tree!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-12 06:52:56	Book..hot chocolate..bed..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-12 06:27:41	@nikimummy13 that's a good feeling!!..enjoy it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-12 05:19:20	@MarkLH35 thank you that's very kind..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-12 01:20:52	I'm a very tired lady..busy day volunteering but on my way home now..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-11 15:16:27	@_ck_supergirl I'm up too...:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-11 15:15:36	Wow it's cold this morning!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-11 03:57:16	Spicy parsnip soup and cheese on toast for tea..comfort food at its best..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-11 03:21:31	Spent some time bringing myself back into today..sometimes it's a real struggle in my head..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-11 00:34:32	" @PsychDigest : When the past calls, let it go to voicemail. It has nothing new to say." How apt right now..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-11 00:30:23	Good meeting and chat after with a friend..home and suddenly hit my a deep sadness over people I lost through drinking..but it's ok to cry..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-10 20:52:43	Home group time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-10 19:11:24	I'll take a responsible attitude today, but I'll watch myself for a tendency to go to pieces over things that really aren't important.
274535898	act1175	2013-12-10 18:54:38	Far too late going to bed so foggy head this morning..strong coffee and plenty more needed before I do anything..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-10 06:32:43	Yeh I'm home just in time for Have I got news for you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-10 04:08:14	Spent afternoon/evening at my sisters..heading off soon for long tube journey home..she's nearly all packed though so it's been helpful..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-10 04:05:22	@NatalieOxford very very sweet..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-10 00:03:08	3k uphill run..2k rowing and half hour resistance workout..feels good!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-09 19:33:35	And I'm ready to face the day..first stop the gym..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-09 18:05:49	Do not waste any time disliking who you are because of something you can no longer do anything about. Daily Inspirations.
274535898	act1175	2013-12-09 17:41:23	Morning..*yawn*..coffee please..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-09 07:13:02	@painofaddiction pleasure..as always..:)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-09 03:50:08	Just made two phone calls I've been putting off..and of course all went well and I'd been fretting over nothing..when will I learn?!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-09 00:38:07	But I have managed to get the decorations out so have taken the first step..getting tree this week so hope that helps..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-09 00:06:54	I'm still not feeling the festive spirit at all..it just seems to be making me feel really anxious this year..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 22:53:09	Housework done..now off food shopping..looking forward to feet up and t.v time..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 20:35:19	Blissfully long sleep..now coffee and readings before hitting the house work..got to be done!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 08:54:21	@anewonset @spring_lamb knowledge is power or so they say!..night all..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 08:51:43	@anewonset @spring_lamb completely..very reassuring you're not alone but sad so many people suffer every day from being in their own heads..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 08:49:13	@Loopylou1710 me too..and you..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 08:48:38	@stephencgrant of course, those are definitely the rules!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 08:47:25	@anewonset @spring_lamb it can help just to know others understand what your going through..stay strong..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 08:44:16	@anewonset @spring_lamb I often can't remember basic things in times of anxiety or low mood..just go into autopilot..then forget after..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 08:41:42	@Loopylou1710 oh goodness I don't think I could cope with that..shudder to think of it..I think it's sweet they see it as a gift though..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 08:36:19	@MySoberPath it's free pest control too ;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 08:35:00	@Loopylou1710 mine is an indoor cat so spiders are the best can she can do!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 06:41:32	@Andy_15052012 ha ha absolutely!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 05:17:55	Cat just dropped a dead spider next to me on the sofa..think she was expecting praise..she got a shriek instead..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 05:12:43	@tenfourzero yeh!!!!!!!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 04:56:37	@Loopylou1710 I did!! And they've left pressies at my mums so something to look forward to as well..one uncle always gets me lush chocs..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 04:54:17	Couple hours of reading and a hot bath and I feel much better..grateful I can do these things now..never used to even be invited!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 04:52:53	@Loopylou1710 that sounds positive..and glad you're getting a bit of peace..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 02:21:28	@richardkhornsey pretty!!..

274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 02:19:11	2/2 sensibly now I'm home..it's incredibly draining when I'm acting but necessary for the occasion..mask off..now I need tea and feet up..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-08 02:17:12	I'm home..went okay in that I coped with the conversations..my mum kept it quite light bless her..anxiety really high but can manage it 2/2
274535898	act1175	2013-12-07 22:03:27	Make up on..mask on..ready to go see the family..I can do this..

274535898	act1175	2013-12-07 19:07:58	@Andy_15052012 that's the one!!..thank you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-07 18:48:37	They are lovely people but they have no understanding of addiction or mental health so I have to put on a mask while with them..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-07 18:46:44	Morning..was meant to go to a meeting but just learnt uncles and aunts are in London so seeing them instead..this does not fill me with joy.
274535898	act1175	2013-12-07 18:38:18	@richardkhornsey is that you Richard??..worried me with xmas talk..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-07 05:40:10	@TheRealSupermum served Princess Diana when I worked in a shoe shop..not sure if that counts!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-07 05:37:11	@tenfourzero yep I love their scenes together so will keep my fingers crossed!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-07 05:21:03	@tenfourzero that's my choice..I love the house keeper!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-07 00:02:43	@MariesVoice_MG fair enough!!..Hope it goes well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-06 23:38:30	@MariesVoice_MG the last colour was nice and the first fringe..just my thoughts!!..:-)

274535898	act1175	2013-12-06 19:01:52	Lazy morning..coffee and readings done now off to meet my sister for lunch..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-06 06:27:47	@NatalieOxford aah that is sweet..don't think mine would like another one around sadly..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-06 05:42:25	@NatalieOxford they are lovely..are they related?..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-05 22:32:11	@acowming I'm going with short walk to clear my head then movie..though not sure about xmas one, not really feeling it yet this year..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-05 22:25:15	Feeling a bit fidgety like now I need a walk but weather is awful..what to do?!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-05 21:26:28	Eyes puffy..drained and tired..no way was going to gym after that so straight home..I wonder if there comes a time this gets easier..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-05 17:47:17	Morning..therapy today and I really don't want to go..I know I will but already dreading how I'll feel later..maybe do gym after..

274535898	act1175	2013-12-05 05:22:47	@NatalieOxford it's so funny, I buy her toys but she's happier with what she finds!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-05 04:39:55	My guess, from the sounds in the hallway, is the cat has found one of my hairbands..hours of fun ahead for her..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-05 02:21:48	Been mostly guzzling tea with lemon and honey and watching Being Human..now feel the urge for a proper cup of tea..and of course biscuits..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-05 01:39:25	@ElainaFleming2 Happy Purrday!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-04 23:07:14	@MariesVoice_MG yep they are lush for low cal..:-)

274535898	act1175	2013-12-04 20:41:29	@Glass1ncision one word- adorable!!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-04 20:01:39	@nikimummy13 if it was for my son I would have insisted he was seen but for me I'm not assertive enough just accepted what she said..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-04 19:59:08	@nikimummy13 this is quite a new system at my g.p surgery, a doctor calls and decides then..meant to reduce waiting times but can see flaws.
274535898	act1175	2013-12-04 19:39:34	@nikimummy13 that's what I thought but she went by my description of cough and symptoms!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-04 19:29:35	Not sure how I feel about being prescribed antibiotics over the phone for my chesty cough..sign of the times I guess..

274535898	act1175	2013-12-04 03:20:12	Enjoying a much calmer evening..what a difference a day makes!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-03 23:09:23	Really good to feel present and part of a meeting..came away calm..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-03 19:18:06	Anxiety much lower this morning thankfully..got my home group at lunchtime then maybe a bit of window shopping..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-03 06:31:11	@soberbill34 you're welcome!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-03 05:11:59	@MySoberPath I hope that's the case for me too..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-12-03 02:34:29	@soberbill34 it's called s health but it came already installed so not sure if you can buy..it is an android phone though..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-03 02:31:19	@soberbill34 my new phone does that too..often surprises me when it says I've done the 10k!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-03 01:54:27	@Loopylou1710 oh that is good..pleased it's easing up a bit for you..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-03 01:22:29	@Loopylou1710 thank you..home is where I feel safest when anxiety this high so much calmer than when out..how are you doing?..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-02 23:55:25	@MySoberPath not done yet still writing out 8..I do make daily living amends but guilt overwhelms me some days and hard to shift..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-02 23:54:03	Really struggling today..anxiety sky high..felt paranoid and self conscious at meeting and left before the end..only place I can be is home.
274535898	act1175	2013-12-02 21:31:15	Huge respect for @TomDaley1994 and for telling people his way before the media descends..brave and honest..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-02 20:27:14	@MySoberPath a lot of it is guilt and shame I can't seem to move past..sponsor says it will ease with time..I'm not that patient!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-02 20:25:53	@MySoberPath tears won't stop so I've written off gym and going to a meeting in a bit..hope it helps..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-02 18:56:15	Not a great morning..started the day in tears and don't know why..really want to get to the gym so hope it passes or at least eases..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-02 02:55:20	Just watched the last Poirot..the whole last series was a bit odd..maybe it's just watching them sober..;-)

274535898	act1175	2013-12-01 19:32:16	@columbophile sounds like a great idea!!..so sorry I missed last night..:-(
274535898	act1175	2013-12-01 19:31:27	Today will mostly be putting the christmas lights up in the windows and digging out the decorations..it's that time again!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-12-01 18:57:25	I can't believe I missed Columbo tv last night..sorry all I fell asleep early and slept straight through..kicking myself as I tweet!!
274535898	act1175	2013-12-01 00:32:38	Watching Lovely but Lethal..don't remember this one so extra yeh!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-30 22:35:43	Finally dressed..going to do local shopping then watch Columbo..it's like Sunday a day early..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-30 19:49:43	I have absolutely nothing that I need to do today so feel a bit lost..I sense a day of feeling ill at ease so must find something to do..

274535898	act1175	2013-11-30 01:47:58	Am so glad I'm doing secretary service on christmas day!!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-30 01:44:22	The family phone calls have started about who's doing what for xmas..at this point I want to run away and spend it anywhere but here..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-30 00:42:44	Okay I looked a lot but have nothing to show for it..wasn't really in the right mood if I'm honest..home, tea and t.v I think..

274535898	act1175	2013-11-29 03:28:42	I used to think Christine Cagney was a strong feisty woman, now I see her as shy and vunerable..strange how views change with time..

274535898	act1175	2013-11-28 23:32:37	Have a headache and not sure if I'm sad, tired, drained or all three..do feel the necessity of being gentle with myself though..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-28 20:58:19	Have scuttled straight home where I can curl up and get lost in a book..it's my way of not having to think anymore..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-28 20:55:45	2/2 being safe unless at home..how draining and debilitating it is..no wonder I'm exhausted most of the time..she's very delicate with me..

274535898	act1175	2013-11-28 03:49:10	@Loopylou1710 oh I'm sorry..I hope you get the help you need..sending best wishes and let me know how you get on..x
274535898	act1175	2013-11-28 03:31:56	I do like that my new phone keeps track of how far I walk each day..8.27km today..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-28 03:30:38	@Loopylou1710 that's true..and thanks..how are you doing?..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-28 02:58:10	Guess as all things do it will pass but it does hurt..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-28 02:57:12	It's not very often I feel lonely, am usually okay with my own company but sometimes a sudden sense of not being part of a couple hits..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-28 01:56:25	And home..tea and biscuits time for me..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-27 21:46:12	Home early from volunteering as they had staff training..half hour for lunch before back out to a hospital appointment..busy busy..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-27 15:14:43	Morning..nowhere near enough sleep but up for volunteering..coffee and then more coffee please..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-27 05:32:51	Having a very undecided night..fidgety..taking me ages to watch anything, I keep pausing to do something else..need to calm before bed..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-27 04:35:22	@oxymoronic82 oh my goodness!!..in that case good luck..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-27 04:26:03	@oxymoronic82 dropbox?..I signed up when changing phones..can get 50gb for free and easy to use..then you can save all your photos. .:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-27 03:36:55	@BipolarBlogger ha-ha boys!!.:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-27 02:55:37	And anxiety is back..thinking of volunteering tomorrow when I'm very tired and want to rest..torn because also want to go..hate it..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-26 23:30:51	Home..feel quite calm physically but my head is racing about what I need to do..truth is none of it needs to be done today..and so relax..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-26 19:28:49	@BipolarTweets well done!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-26 19:23:47	Slept very deeply and a bit foggy in the head..coffee, readings then home group..need to be amongst my own..

274535898	act1175	2013-11-26 08:24:27	Falling into bed..no alarm set..yeh!!
274535898	act1175	2013-11-26 06:25:34	Only just home, stayed too late again..next few days are about meetings, resting and hopefully relaxing a bit..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-25 21:04:48	@BipolarTweets it's hard getting there sometimes, as you know, but does help..hope you get there tomorrow..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-25 20:35:15	Managed the gym..just..not getting enough sleep so must try and work on that this week..now off to my sisters for more help packing..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-25 04:15:54	What a lovely lazy sunday..only thing missing was a Columbo..not really wanted the t.v on today..might make up for it now though..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-24 23:21:45	Well my son has headed out to see the new Hunger Games so guess I can put my feet up and read..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-24 19:32:35	@AlnotsoAnon oh she's lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-24 18:52:00	Lovely sunday lie in..son happily watching t.v..me doing my readings with coffee..all is well..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-24 06:11:13	Always nice to have a bit of a clear out..maybe one day I'll finish it all..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-24 06:09:45	Got absorbed in sorting through yet more bags of papers..put alot aside to read at a later date but most to be shredded..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-23 23:23:04	Managed to get few things done now back home for afternoon of tea and t.v..anxiety still there but manageable..hoping it stays that way..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-23 20:24:37	Nice quiet morning but anxiety levels are creeping up as I get ready to go out..trying to breathe calmly and hand it all over..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-23 04:58:04	Can really tell the difference in my head when I keep up my meetings..that's why I'll always have to go..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-23 04:55:43	And finally I'm home..tea and feet up..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-22 22:37:05	Good meeting..couple people there from my first meeting and that's always nice..now quickly home before heading to my sisters..busy bee..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-22 19:20:22	Coffee and readings done..off to a meeting..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-22 05:40:49	@AlnotsoAnon happy belated birthday!! So pleased to see you have the cat with you..cats are great company..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-22 03:27:29	But I have accepted that's how it is for now..and just by doing that I'm giving myself a bit of a break..which is good..progress..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-22 03:25:56	I know I should be used to it but still floored by the exhaustion on therapy days..and that has a ripple effect on the next couple days..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-21 23:50:18	I'm feeling utterly drained and just want the day to hurry up and end..need some tea and something mindless to watch..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-21 22:34:11	@emmamarie1980 he-he I like that..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-21 21:01:41	@spring_lamb sounds like he was thorough which is great..hope it leads to the right help..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-21 20:57:16	Cried throughout therapy talking about guilt and shame I still carry..couldn't face the gym so scurried home..going to escape in a book..

274535898	act1175	2013-11-21 17:21:34	Struggle to get up today..definitely not enough sleep..therapy then gym this morning..then hopefully a quiet afternoon..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-21 06:50:51	Home much later than I meant to be and got therapy in the morning..still my bits to do before bed as well..doesn't bode well!!
274535898	act1175	2013-11-20 22:44:36	@soberbill34 yeh!! Lovely to see the time adding up..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-20 22:41:57	Long time at the hospital but happily read my book..now warm at home but have to head up to my sisters a for awhile..time to wrap up warm..

274535898	act1175	2013-11-20 16:43:48	Morning..up for a hospital appointment..first though coffee and readings..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-20 05:26:47	@anewonset it's a pleasure..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-20 05:25:15	@Glass1ncision well done!! Huge congrats..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-20 04:47:14	@anewonset I think the writing is a great idea, a record to look back at.. a very honest, raw read..I really hope it helps over time..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-20 03:39:27	Really nice meeting, a lot of humour in the room, always good for newcomers to see..and ate a healthy dinner so done well today, for me..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-19 22:49:36	Housework done..now a meeting and some food shopping..being very productive today..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-19 21:07:22	@BipolarTweets when I start to allow my head to rule me it becomes very dangerous territory for an alcoholic..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-19 21:06:16	@BipolarTweets sobriety involves actively working a programme daily..I've not been putting it above everything else which I must to keep it.
274535898	act1175	2013-11-19 21:04:12	@blackcat3119 not heard that before!! Happy Thanksgiving too..:-)

274535898	act1175	2013-11-19 20:05:19	Need to reach out more..pick up the phone and get myself to more meetings..that's my goal this week..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-19 20:03:44	Readings really hit home today..not spent enough time on my sobriety recently and I know anything I put before I'm in danger of losing..

274535898	act1175	2013-11-19 04:37:52	@BipolarBlogger Congratulations Charlotte!! Hope you're having a good night..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-19 04:35:02	I've had a really relaxing evening..hot bath and quietly getting on with a cross stitch..nothing exciting but calm..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-18 23:48:07	A much better day..good workout..good meeting and coffee after with other members..feel topped up!!..now tea and biscuits time..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-18 18:05:11	Morning..really good rest and I'm ready to face the day..gym first then a meeting..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-18 05:32:47	Curled up on sofa with t.v..not been a great day but start of I'm a celebrity has cheered me up a little..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-18 00:06:04	Have had a quiet day but still very anxious..going to head out and see if a walk will help clear my head..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-17 20:09:18	Feel a bit odd..not settled and vaguely paranoid online..hoping it eases..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-17 01:34:08	Rant over..have put it all aside for now..evening in front of the t.v with cat on lap planned..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-17 01:32:43	I try really hard to understand operating systems and processors but honestly I just don't care..just want one phone to do what other does..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-17 00:53:57	Have spent 2 hours online..2 hours in a phone shop and yet still using old handset..too much for me am leaving it all for now..need tea..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-16 19:38:25	Today is mostly going to be trying to transfer data between phones..if you don't see me again it's because I've done something wrong!!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-16 18:34:06	@jamespetergates what brings you to Pimlico?..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-16 18:30:40	@BipolarTweets getting by!!..hope you have a good rest of weekend..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-16 18:25:24	@BipolarTweets great start to the weekend!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-16 01:49:07	Sometimes I think my pile to be shredded never goes down..years worth of illegible writings takes a long time to get through!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-16 00:22:59	Finally got my upgrade sorted..can't explain how anxious it makes me..don't cope well with decisions or change..

274535898	act1175	2013-11-15 04:47:16	@oxymoronic82 sending tissues..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-15 03:30:47	@oxymoronic82 thanks lovely..you're an excellent supplier of twitter *hugs*..always gratefully received..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-15 03:27:52	@Loopylou1710 good..hope you have a restful evening..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-15 03:11:45	@Loopylou1710 I know it's rough..I've learnt to just go with it and have an early night..how was the gym?..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-15 03:09:00	Feel mentally and physically drained..past few days been quite full on..am hoping for a couple of restful days now I've slowed down..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-14 23:44:27	Time to curl up with tea, choccie biscuits and t.v..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-14 23:41:36	@Loopylou1710 hope it helps..and I completely relate to feeling low after therapy..think it's part of the process..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-14 22:14:24	@soberbill34 a good read!! You're doing brilliantly and it's so nice to see the programme in action through others..:)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-14 21:38:40	Therapy done..gym done..and for first time this week no urge to push myself and do more..so not going to..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-14 21:36:58	@_ck_supergirl I lost one right after mentioning I was watching Cagney and Lacey one day!!..it's the ones that stay whatever that matter..:)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-14 21:21:36	It doesn't help that there are huge sections of my life that I just don't remember and suggestions I've blocked things too painful to face..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-14 21:20:36	Not at all sure I'm keen on this going back and remembering how I felt when younger..know it's important to understand but it's not nice..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-14 17:49:20	@Loopylou1710 hope it does!! It really works for me to do gym after therapy..then I begin to process what's been discussed..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-14 17:18:54	Morning..therapy today followed by the gym..am feeling a little foggy in the head so hopefully exercise will ease it a bit..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-14 04:53:57	Finally home..physically exhausted..just wish the mind would slow down a bit..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-14 00:01:31	Not a good day for me to upgrade..too fidgety and racing thoughts..instead I've headed to my sisters house..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-13 23:00:03	@MySoberPath that's exactly it..I wanted to just isolate but in fact I did a lot of data work for them that they really appreciate..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-13 21:43:37	Okay volunteering done..glad I went..now off to upgrade phone..still not able to totally stop but managing it a little better today..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-13 15:22:58	Not a great nights sleep and been up awhile..anxious about volunteering today but know I'll feel worse if I cancel so will just do it..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-13 05:24:16	@Alanonian just the idea of it terrifies me but I'm sure I'll feel better for doing it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-13 03:40:12	Have taken advice and used some self care and have calmed done a little..distraction now is Cagney and Lacey..old but good..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-13 01:33:46	so social..sorry even typing quickly..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-13 01:33:00	for me to be do social and outgoing..and still haven't really stopped as I've found things to clean now..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-13 01:32:03	I also volunteered myself to be secretary at the xmas day meeting which is way out of my comfort zone but was chatting away..again worrying.
274535898	act1175	2013-11-13 01:29:47	Was a good meeting then run around a bit doing chores..bit worried that I'm on the go a bit too much and having palpitations..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-12 19:44:55	Home group today..just what I need..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-12 19:40:45	Took me ages to unwind last night but slept well in the end..a bit haunted by sad thoughts this morning so need to share them..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-12 04:36:17	Okay I'm heading home..done enough for today..just the journey to face now..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-11 23:34:32	@BipolarTweets did my best!!..5k uphill run..3k rowing and half hour weights..felt good..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-11 23:07:34	Really good workout so I'm feeling it..now up to my sisters to help pack a little..keeping busy today..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-11 23:06:26	@MySoberPath throws me completely if I don't!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-11 19:22:53	Okay gym time..by booking a class for the end of my workout I ensure I get there..resistance work with weights today..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-11 18:16:16	Morning..coffee and readings to help me just focus on today..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-11 05:10:01	My cat just ran up behind me and bit the back of my leg..drew blood..no idea why?!..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-11 00:59:28	@JohnnyStep2 oh thank you..I only tend to see negatives of 'shouldn't feel this way' but yes I did something!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-11 00:40:59	Feel much better back home..think feeling a little low makes me feel more vunerable 'out there'..going to curl up for the evening..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-10 22:32:37	Okay well seeing as I've got dressed I may as well go out..just a short walk I think, along the river a little..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-10 20:55:34	@JohnnyStep2 haha normally..my area is flooded at the moment from the Remembrance Sunday gatherings..too many people I find hard..:-(
274535898	act1175	2013-11-10 20:40:36	Want to go for a walk but don't want to see other people..hmmm what to do..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-10 18:56:34	What I want to do is isolate which probably means I should go to a meeting today..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-10 18:34:57	@enchanted_poet @BPDtainted what a lovely message to wake up to..so pretty..thanks Dani..x
274535898	act1175	2013-11-10 06:01:53	Feeling a bit sad..think will go to bed with hot chocolate and my book..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-10 05:14:23	@mssginbottle happy birthday!! Hope you have a great day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-10 02:04:27	@NickFarmer3 thanks I am..paused to make cheese on toast..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-10 00:37:26	Currently wrapped up warm and watching a new Poirot..nice and cozy on a dark evening..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-09 19:56:01	Said she wished there was something she could give me to make everything ok but impossible..have to learn to live with things as they are..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-09 19:54:38	She pointed out all the positive changes I've made and to focus on those though understands that means little to me when I'm low..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-09 19:53:36	Well g.p had response from psychiatrist that I'm to except vast changes in emotions and mood..that hopefully the therapy will help longterm
274535898	act1175	2013-11-09 18:26:53	What a dark day..I have a g.p appointment followed by pilates..then might scuttle back home and hibernate..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-09 06:54:34	@anewonset oh yeh you're out!! Well done on staying as long as you did though..you deserve a good rest now..enjoy your t.v..:-)

274535898	act1175	2013-11-09 04:50:54	@anewonset oh bless..can you leave soon?..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-09 04:46:42	Went to my sisters to sort through some clothes..she's moving so having a clearout and we're the same size so picked up a few bits..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-09 04:36:54	@anewonset sending positive thoughts and *hugs*..keep breathing deeply..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-08 23:53:26	@richardkhornsey @_ck_supergirl just think Richard as soon as it's over you can think about xmas!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-08 23:51:03	Also found a coat in Uniqlo but none in my size so ordered online..which I actually prefer as it feels more new that way..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-08 23:48:16	Lovely time with my sister..when I was drinking we rarely met as was too painful for her..now we love a coffee and a gossip together..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-08 18:50:40	Feeling a bit better today so meeting my sister for lunch and shopping for a winter coat..I'm too indecisive on my own..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-08 01:22:12	@Loopylou1710 @BipolarTweets I've never got that buzz..just a sense of accomplishment which helps my mood..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-08 01:20:56	@BipolarTweets reading is my escape from thinking..I can get totally absorbed in a good book!!
274535898	act1175	2013-11-08 01:19:30	@Loopylou1710 that does wear off after awhile..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-08 00:24:54	Spent the afternoon under a blanket with a new Inspector Montalbano book..quite lovely..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 21:35:06	@spring_lamb oh definitely!! Let me know what you think..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 21:34:19	@anewonset yep I relate to that..that's when you're left with just you and your head..can be a nasty place to be..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 21:25:00	@anewonset have a cold and just had therapy so a bit numb today..how's your day going?..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 21:16:04	@anewonset Hi!! Thanks for follow..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 21:15:12	@Glass1ncision yes that's rough..sending *hugs*..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 20:47:45	Therapy was looking at how I felt when younger..how my environment forced me to behave secretly and no emotional boundaries in place..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 20:45:59	@Glass1ncision I know it's awful..can you give yourself time to allow it to pass or become manageable before facing the world..helps me..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 20:44:26	@spring_lamb I'm usually good at giving myself plenty of time in the morning to ground myself for the day..being unwell throws me..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 20:42:28	@Glass1ncision yes hugely..I often say my anxiety is awake before me just waiting..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 20:29:21	@spring_lamb yes it's in watford..I was blown away by it..a must see for Harry Potter fans!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 20:28:03	@BipolarBlogger got there just in time and she could see I'm ill so led into how I felt unable to cancel..skipped gym though need to rest..x
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 17:53:14	Woken late and supposed to be at therapy this morning..hate rushing!!!!
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 17:51:58	@zombierecovery1 @TheRecoveryBook done!! Thanks for letting us know about this site..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 07:29:11	@painofaddiction pleasure to pass on the message..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 07:28:40	@SoberBachelor ah okay..I did wonder!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 06:25:46	@SoberBachelor why do you keep them outside?..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 04:50:47	Not sure peanut butter on toast counts as dinner but it's worked for me!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 04:26:14	Very rarely do I spend a whole day in but it's been lovely today..aside from feeling ill that is..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 01:49:37	@BipolarTweets I couldn't possibly answer that for you sorry..I don't know enough about you or your drinking..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-07 01:18:24	Quite a good day to feel unwell..dark and miserable outside so feels even nicer being in and snuggled up under a blanket..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 23:50:11	@spring_lamb that's brilliant!! Congrats..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 22:28:02	@BPDtainted @enchanted_poet thanks you too..just a cold here, sorry you're in pain hope it eases..x
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 22:27:05	@enchanted_poet @BPDtainted thank you Dani..very kind..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 21:28:19	@BipolarTweets that leads to a drink..do you think it's a problem for you?..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 21:27:07	@BipolarTweets tricky one as sounds like you've had consequences from drinking..alcoholism not about amount you drink but the thinking
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 18:35:25	@JohnnyStep2 Complicit by Nicci French..a change from detective novels I usually read!
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 18:29:11	Currently curled up with lemon and honey tea and a good book..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 17:12:14	@BipolarTweets don't mind at all!! Primarily alcoholism but also had a nasty cocaine habit..20 years active addiction, 3 years clean..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 17:05:44	@Loopylou1710 @BipolarTweets sorry to hear that..look after yourself..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 16:58:46	@Loopylou1710 @BipolarTweets how are you finding it? Took me awhile to get into routine of going regularly..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 16:11:14	Humility doesn't mean we have to crawl lifes paths on our hands and knees; it just means we have to admit we cannot recover on our own..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 16:07:18	Becoming humble means we attain a realistic view of ourselves and where we fit in the world..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 16:04:36	Morning..really don't like missing volunteering but I've woken with a sore throat and headache so not going to push myself..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 05:28:05	Lots of helicopter noise around..my pet hate of living in central london..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 05:26:03	@enchanted_poet @BPDtainted thanks Dani..go for it then we can see your artwork!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 01:28:43	@BPDtainted thank you! My hand aches a little though..but very peaceful to do..had no distractions and just focused..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-06 00:27:25	@BPDtainted look look!! First one done..am pleased though was a little obsessive about not going over the lines..;-) pic.twitter.com/V1QI3mkmKi
274535898	act1175	2013-11-05 23:14:15	@Andy_15052012 was an added pleasure for me as you're in the fellowship!! Twitter is great for connecting with others in recovery..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-05 20:09:34	@Andy_15052012 Hi thanks for the follow..my 250th!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-05 19:16:03	@MySoberPath that's it..assuming things that have no basis in reality..handing it over means I can get on with today, which is all I have..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-05 18:40:34	Concerning ourselves with any other moment but the present prevents us from responding when "the teacher appears" Every day a new beginning.
274535898	act1175	2013-11-05 18:21:19	Woke with a very negative head..projecting and causing myself to feel dreadful..readings so important in helping me to focus on today alone.
274535898	act1175	2013-11-05 05:52:46	@BipolarTweets they are lovely with a scraping of cold butter..yum!!
274535898	act1175	2013-11-05 02:43:39	Perfect weather for soup and cheese on toast for tea..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-05 02:42:19	@_ck_supergirl think someone else mentioned that, maybe @columbophile could change the date? :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 22:45:01	Did an hour running and rowing then half hour resistance work..feels good after only going once last week..now curled up back home..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 19:15:59	@Hippychick1987 sending *hugs*..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 18:35:45	Late start but well rested..slightly anxious for no reason, hoping the gym will help..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 18:32:34	@Alanonian thank you too!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 07:02:47	@soberbill34 happened to me last week..couldn't explain it..called my sponsor and the next day was totally different..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 06:58:43	@karen12steps me too! Just had some mini maltesers..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 06:57:41	@moonshinehigh so you understand..it's pains me to see it being destroyed..I still rely on it hugely both for physical and mh issues..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 05:47:11	@moonshinehigh nothing really, I thought that myself..just a sense of being at peace with myself..going with it!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 05:41:38	I very rarely retweet anything political but without the #nhs I would be dead..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 04:11:59	@TheRealSupermum yes for my son..in a heartbeat..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 03:29:41	@Hippychick1987 it's blissful..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 03:27:52	@SoberNobby thanks!..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-04 03:08:12	Am very calm and relaxed..doesn't sound very special but not often I'm totally at ease, catches me by surprise..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-03 23:13:50	We went to a local Italian deli for lunch with my dad..so rarely see him now as he doesn't get out much or like anybody visiting..bit sad..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-03 19:50:57	My son is totally absorbed watching The Eagle..I get to read quietly..happy Sunday morning..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-03 06:10:22	@DastardlyDeano go Deano!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-03 04:20:05	@MariesVoice_MG okay thanks I like the idea of one a day..hope you enjoy! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-03 04:16:59	@MariesVoice_MG where did you get them?
274535898	act1175	2013-11-03 02:19:56	Ended up cleaning the kitchen while my son had a friend over..very satisfying..now definitely tea and choccie biscuits time..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-03 02:16:58	@Comfort_talks I think sadness would be the overwhelming feeling..but some hope that I'm finally seeing glimpses of happiness..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-02 19:08:50	Even if you are on the right track, you will get run over if you just sit there. Unknown
274535898	act1175	2013-11-02 18:48:05	Amazing how fast my son can get ready when he is off to meet a friend..so I have quiet coffee and readings time before a meeting..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-02 04:46:08	Still feel drained on days I have therapy, but I've learnt to go with it and practice self care..acceptance!!
274535898	act1175	2013-11-02 01:39:47	Upgrading always causes me a lot of anxiety..:-(
274535898	act1175	2013-11-02 01:38:40	Spent almost 2 hours in a phones 4u trying to work out best deal on upgrade..now being offered tablets and cameras and all confused!!!
274535898	act1175	2013-11-02 01:35:53	@MySoberPath absolutely..I use that one a lot..I guess until I get to know me better that's the best I can do..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-01 20:06:15	Gym time..it really works for me doing gym straight after therapy..I work out harder than other days!!
274535898	act1175	2013-11-01 20:03:00	Therapy quite hard..looking at differences between my childhood and my sons..lots of tears..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-01 17:56:40	Dropped my son with my mum so I can go to therapy then the gym..not liking the new twitter update at all!!
274535898	act1175	2013-11-01 06:14:54	All the anxiety of being out has drained me..have learnt though that I need to be around sober people when socializing for now..nite..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-01 04:47:32	@MySoberPath thanks..didn't look at it that way!! As usual my head filled with negatives..so much happier at home now with a cup of tea..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-01 04:23:00	@MySoberPath it was much harder than I thought, one brief moment of 'maybe I can tonight'..got out shortly after..was too soon for me..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-01 00:49:51	@SoberBachelor yeh!!!!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-11-01 00:47:14	Feeling very unsure about Halloween party we have been invited to..will be the first time I've been around people drinking in a long time..
274535898	act1175	2013-11-01 00:45:40	@WorcesterCats okay that's a shame would have loved to help!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 21:29:39	@WorcesterCats @MYSADCAT can he live with another cat?
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 21:22:46	@DastardlyDeano Happy Birthday Deano!! Hope you have a good day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 20:26:14	Quiet lazy morning so far..nice..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 20:19:10	@Polarbear3127 Happy Birthday to you!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 06:43:41	Goodness school holidays are tiring..in a lovely I get to spend lots of time with him kind of way..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 05:22:19	@AlnotsoAnon glad you're a bit better, bound to feel rocky..I'm much better today had fun with my son doing pumpkins! Look after yourself..x
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 05:18:25	@_ck_supergirl enjoy!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 05:17:02	@richardkhornsey thanks Richard..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 02:48:28	Hard to describe how different a day is when my anxiety levels are manageable..been able to really enjoy the day..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 02:34:18	@_ck_supergirl wasn't really for me until my son started wanting to trick or treat..now I love dressing up as a witch every year!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 01:05:46	Pumpkins bought and carved, we did one each! Son going to be a werewolf so all kitted out for that..and lots of candy bought..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-31 01:01:47	@AlnotsoAnon ah okay I thought you'd been attacked!! How are you feeling today?
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 21:40:10	@AlnotsoAnon what happened?..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 18:12:21	Morning..anxiety levels much lower today thankfully..shopping for Halloween today as my son was sure he didn't want to dress up now he does!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 06:48:38	Spent the evening watching Jonathon Creek with my boy..oh and the cat..took my meds early so off to bed..hoping for a better day tom..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 03:22:10	@RehabPath @mliimatta wow needed to read that right now..thank you..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 02:49:42	@nikimummy13 wow that's fab!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 02:46:52	@Loopylou1710 well done!! I started going to counteract weight gain from meds..it does help when I go regularly..hope it helps you!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 02:32:49	@moonshinehigh that's lovely..definitely willing to have a look..thank you..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 02:31:36	@moonshinehigh oh thank you..it varies but I very rarely have none at all..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 02:29:02	@moonshinehigh no I haven't tried anything other than I try to practice self care as much as I can but it doesn't come easily to me..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 02:26:25	@moonshinehigh there is no right answer and I don't like that!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 02:25:50	@moonshinehigh yeah, I take the anti-psycotics which even me out and never abused diazepam but worry I have the capacity to so avoid..it's
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 02:17:38	@moonshinehigh that was actually an aa meeting! The fact my anxiety made me feel like that there questions my need for meds..:-(
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 02:09:00	@moonshinehigh or some belief that I 'should' be able to cope when in fact it would really help at times..not sure..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 02:07:05	@moonshinehigh I take meds that don't conflict as before them I wasn't coping at all. But I won't take diazepam, some form of self punish??
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 01:57:46	as a result with the idea that I can work things through the programme..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 01:56:23	I find it hard to balance my mental health and my sobriety..I don't take something prescribed as it conflicts with sobriety so often suffer
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 00:59:49	@AlnotsoAnon struggling with high anxiety today sadly but otherwise okay..will be thinking of you this evening, must be very hard..x
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 00:42:17	@AlnotsoAnon sending *hugs*..x
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 00:36:30	@racheltrm congratulations!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 00:21:53	Oh I can't even get across what I want to on here...aaaarrrggggghhhhhh...
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 00:20:49	Thankfully he has a friend here so my presence isn't required too much but feel bad that am not myself..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 00:12:45	Racing thoughts that others can see in me..read my thoughts..want to hide away but can't..struggling to be okay in front of my son..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-30 00:11:31	Anxiety levels have been seriously high all day..went to a meeting and feel like I never want to go again..felt I had a spotlight on me..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-29 03:47:39	@mssginbottle that was amazing to read, touching and so honest..have bookmarked as I know I will want to read again..thank you!..

274535898	act1175	2013-10-28 17:29:21	Well I woke to find 2 leaves on my bed..had window open overnight..otherwise all seems okay in central London..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-28 07:19:51	@soberbill34 what my sponsor calls free floating anxiety..this too shall pass..do something nice for yourself..:-)

274535898	act1175	2013-10-28 00:42:55	Taken my hanging baskets and window boxes down as the wind is picking up already..not sure if I'm anxious or excited..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-27 21:41:09	My cat who normally loves going on the balcony won't go past the door..she sits there sniffing the air..cats are clever..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-27 18:40:27	@_ck_supergirl well put Claire!! :-)

274535898	act1175	2013-10-27 18:32:32	I've explained to my son what the 1987 storm was like..windows smashing, buses falling down, trees uprooted etc..his response.."sounds epic"

274535898	act1175	2013-10-25 22:39:23	My head went straight to actually making the amends..was quickly pulled back to the task in hand..first things first..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-25 22:29:57	Good meeting and as ever my sponsor ensures I take the programme seriously but not myself!! Now time to start writing my amends list...
274535898	act1175	2013-10-25 22:27:39	@_ck_supergirl @Syncriel @l_murray @Dene71 @djellicon @dev_2014 @ColumboLAPD @ColumboTweet @mechaangela thanks lovely!! :)

274535898	act1175	2013-10-25 03:39:59	@fairref @Fascinatingpics it is a stunning city..many fond memories from there..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-25 01:32:38	Must have been exhausted I slept for ages..woke with an urgent need for tea and choccie biscuits..now a lovely cozy night in ahead..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-25 01:28:43	@MrsDalcoholfree that's wonderful!! Hope you have a lovely day together..:-)

274535898	act1175	2013-10-24 21:23:25	Therapy was less tearful today..talked about what psychotherapy is and how there is no set time frame which really reassures me..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-24 16:21:33	Morning..therapy today..actually don't want to go but that's because I don't feel like crying..I will though and then hit the gym I think..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-24 07:25:26	@soberbill34 @v_henk @racheltrm @mssginbottle that scares me too but my sponsor says they are in order for a reason..I listen..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-24 06:01:21	@DastardlyDeano sending lots of best wishes..will be thinking of you all..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-24 05:16:50	@enchanted_poet that's a good idea but my laptop broke so can't use printer..I'm looking forward to starting them..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-24 05:15:00	@BPDtainted funny thing is my son has a whole drawer of pencils but I want my own!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-24 05:13:43	@trying_2_cope got them from Amazon..used to love similar ones as a kid and thought they'd be quite meditative to do now..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-24 03:46:17	@BPDtainted yep will post a picture when I've done one..going to buy new colouring pencils tomorrow..:-)

274535898	act1175	2013-10-24 01:28:07	@oxymoronic82 read my mind but everything else involves moving..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-24 01:25:24	As much as I wish he was, Ian Hislop is not on twitter.. @Real_Hislop is a fake account..just so you know..

274535898	act1175	2013-10-24 00:28:13	@MariesVoice_MG glad you corrected that, I wondered what you'd been up to!!!!..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-23 22:48:47	@soberbill34 funny enough she approached me..she lives in my area, knew I used to drink, has seen a change and wondered how I did it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-23 20:49:26	@mssginbottle yes it is!!! She was very shaky and wary but got some identification and numbers..I'll see her again later in the week..:-)

274535898	act1175	2013-10-21 23:57:45	Tired..tea with sugar please..I need a boost of energy..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-21 22:28:22	2/2 have had to hand back prescription until they can reissue..stood there saying I got it Saturday but convinced they thought I hadn't..:-(
274535898	act1175	2013-10-21 22:26:42	Tried to collect prescription g.p gave me on Saturday..pharmacy refused as it was dated April!! Even receptionist doubted me..1/2
274535898	act1175	2013-10-21 21:47:44	4k uphill run..4k rowing and half hour resistance work with weights..sense of achievement just in having done it..

274535898	act1175	2013-10-21 03:55:19	Just realized I'm feeling quite calm..had a weep earlier and it felt cleansing rather than draining..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-21 01:13:15	@bythesheetstore I think she was halfway through a stretch and just fell asleep again!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-21 01:10:48	She is funny.. pic.twitter.com/a0hqWFtZR9

274535898	act1175	2013-10-20 21:04:29	@richardkhornsey and mine and I didn't even watch it!!! ;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-20 21:03:26	@anniecat84 @oxymoronic82 I was put on it yesterday..didn't like it at all!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-20 20:11:59	It does seem like a nice day out so seeing as it's Sunday and this area is deserted I am going to have a walk..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-20 19:34:07	@_ck_supergirl I was added to that yesterday and not pleased myself!! Anyway hello and hope you have a lovely Sunday..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-20 18:50:02	Lovely lie in but can't shake this anxiety..think will try and have a walk by the river today..but first coffee!!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-20 01:57:44	If someone adds you to a list on here is there anyway to take self off..have been informed I've been added to a list I don't want to be on..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 21:29:33	Also had my flu jab so my right arm is aching..can expect to feel unwell over next couple days as I always do..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 21:24:26	Happy I'm back home and going to curl up and read..all this crying is very draining..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 21:23:28	2/2 thoughts are worrying..this only happens when I'm acutely anxious which for me is coupled with paranoia..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 21:21:25	Well g.p was sympathetic but re-referred me back to psychiatrist to be seen asap..apparently my thoughts that others can read my 1/2
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 18:04:24	@AlnotsoAnon I'm glad you've got out for now and have some space for yourself..P clearly not hit his rock bottom yet..look after you..x
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 17:39:30	Morning..am quite nervous about seeing g.p..been awhile since I've had to say to her things not very good..anxiety awake before me today..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 06:20:48	@AlnotsoAnon so sorry you're having a hard night..can you leave him sleep it off and try and get some rest?..sending *hugs*..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 04:06:34	@bythesheetstore oh she is adorable!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 02:20:20	@richardkhornsey @_ck_supergirl I told you you'd set him off!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 01:14:42	@_ck_supergirl @richardkhornsey oh don't start him off again Claire..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 01:00:35	Yes two fuses wrong way up so flicked them and normality resumes..to the electric that is not everything..;-) Thank you @RobHofficial ..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 00:46:38	@RobHofficial what does that mean?? Is it fuses? Honestly it's only times like this I miss a man around the house!!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 00:30:16	Ok this is odd..have lost power at the front of the flat but not the back??..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-19 00:23:48	Drifted off to sleep while reading..woken by my cat flying around the flat chasing a ball..guess it's tea and biscuits time..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-18 21:03:16	But I have done something constructive today by reaching out and saying I need help..that's the first step to getting help..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-18 21:01:30	Have got a g.p appointment for tomorrow..just been to a meeting and connected with another member after..now home and feel sad..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-18 18:15:32	Asked who I speak to outside of family that are all panicky about me right now..I said twitter..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-18 18:11:00	2/2 in between our sessions..and g.p needs to be aware that food and harming self are real issues right now..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-18 18:07:55	Therapist advised I alert g.p that things not well for me right now re my mental health..that I need some strategy in place for coping 1/2
274535898	act1175	2013-10-18 16:22:18	@oxymoronic82 *passes tissues*..x
274535898	act1175	2013-10-18 16:19:41	@_ck_supergirl thanks Claire..hope you have a good day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-18 15:26:51	Morning..therapy this morning..really don't want a day of crying again..but need to tell someone how I've been recently..it might help..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 23:53:34	@bythesheetstore pushed myself a bit..will feel it tomorrow!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 23:44:28	Did 4k uphill run and 4k rowing..and some resistance work..meeting was ok my head definitely not there..glad to be home again..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 23:43:05	@acowming ha-ha maybe one day..it does help my mood when I do it regularly..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 18:14:02	"To carry a grudge is like being stung to death by one bee" William Wanton So true...
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 17:50:03	@KrisArnason ah okay thank you that bit was confusing me..so if she hadn't chosen to appeal she'd be back behind bars now?..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 17:47:30	@oxymoronic82 just go with it..maybe its the Irish air..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 17:44:33	@oxymoronic82 morning Sophie..good to see you starting the day all chipper!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 17:43:24	Morning..plan for the day is gym and a meeting..though not sure that'll happen but its a plan..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 05:48:04	@SoberBachelor I play words, hangman, what's the phrase and scramble!! Too much I know..I never got into chess though..seems peaceful..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 04:59:11	@KrisArnason why has she chosen to appeal?? Surely would have been in her best interest to just leave it, or was that not an option?..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 04:54:43	Think will try and restart a big one I started when I left hospital but life took over..could help me to relax a bit..will dig it out now..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 04:53:03	I completely lost track of time playing online games..before smartphones I used to sew a lot..just cross stitches but therapeutic..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 01:48:04	@JumpRobert @ukschizophrenic this is really scary stuff yet its given next to no press..this can send people over the edge!!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-17 00:35:15	@acowming that is quite amazing!! It does work if you work it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 23:46:53	@oxymoronic82 never heard of before!! That looks lush though..may have to eat some chocolate biscuits now..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 23:45:19	Maybe its par for the course but will feel better if he's at least aware I feel like I'm struggling..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 23:41:39	I have managed to write down how I've been feeling recently and am going to drop it at psychiatrists office tomorrow..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 23:38:32	@oxymoronic82 chocolate biscuit cake??
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 23:37:08	Today I've just been tired..anxiety still far too high but I have stayed in and managed to rest a bit..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 15:05:47	@CameronTwynham Hi Cameron, thanks for following..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 14:52:57	I'm up but wish I wasn't..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 04:30:41	I'm worn out..going to bed to read till I sleep..won't be long I'm sure..night..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 04:23:39	@ljames1978 welcome to twitter!!..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 02:39:37	@ItsJackOk Kirsty Young..recording is about 2 hours..good night out!..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 02:03:56	@ItsJackOk good choice..I've been to see it filmed..enjoy..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 01:40:03	@oxymoronic82 ah okay..I did wonder why you were in the lobby for so long..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 01:31:42	@oxymoronic82 much needed thank you..enjoy your stay at fancy hotel!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 01:21:21	Haven't stopped crying all day..I can't keep doing this its exhausting and anxiety is sky high..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 01:17:48	Since moving from psychiatrist to psychotherapy I don't know who if anyone to call..think g.p would call psychiatrist to assess..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 00:45:44	I really can't remember ever feeling like this before in sobriety..this is definitely a down turn in my mental health which scares me..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-16 00:02:13	Am going to lie down with a book and see if I can escape reality for as long as possible..:-(
274535898	act1175	2013-10-15 23:02:15	I feel like I am rapidly falling to pieces and really don't know what to do about it as when I talk to family they panic and sponsor away..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-15 22:58:13	I feel like a wreck again..I've only had one day where I haven't cried in about 10 days..no idea where its all coming from either..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-15 20:13:23	A conversation with my mum has left me in tears again meaning I've not made my meeting..furious and punching a door hasn't helped..not good.
274535898	act1175	2013-10-15 18:23:36	I may not be where I want to be but thank god I am not where I used to be..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-15 18:11:28	Morning..coffee and readings before going to a meeting..not been to any for a week and need it..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-15 00:48:05	Mood definitely better today..haven't cried all day!! Just hope it continues now..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-14 22:52:52	@SoberBachelor its lovely seeing your days adding up..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-14 20:35:37	3k uphill run and 3k rowing..its a start!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-14 17:09:40	Am up with the aim of getting to the gym today..first though coffee and readings..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-14 04:51:58	@MySoberPath and I've not done much of any of those recently so back basics this week..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-14 04:48:14	@MySoberPath have promised to practice more self care..going back to the gym tomorrow is my first step!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-14 04:46:00	@MySoberPath turns out it was out of concern..they've both seen me this week and apparently I don't look my best..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-14 01:54:31	And I'm in floods of tears again..my mum spoken to my sister about me and vice versa and I HATE that..talk TO me not about me..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-14 00:59:27	And I got choccies from Vienna too!!..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-14 00:48:44	Okay Atos form complete..took us over 3 hours and my mums help was hugely appreciated..now time to relax a bit..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-13 21:15:30	Hoovering done..onto cleaning the bathroom..does anyone else do this before their mum visits?..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-13 21:12:55	" @raubrey : Talking of facts, here's how dinosaurs really died. pic.twitter.com/vLeKN2fxnr " made me smile..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-13 19:47:09	Really late start..perfect Sunday staying in weather..though must hoover before mum comes round or else she'll offer to do it..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-13 04:54:41	Have found it much easier today to keep it in the day..doesn't mean I'm feeling much better but feel like I'm coping with it a bit better..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-13 00:59:50	My mum changed plans to tomorrow so instead I've been to the library and finally done some food shopping..now feet up with tea..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 21:50:43	@agentlochhead huge congratulations.. well done!!!!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 21:49:22	@racheltrm my son wouldn't eat potatoes until he saw Harry Potter eating them!! Then loved them- thought they'd help him fly..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 21:34:24	@racheltrm ha-ha I remember those days..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 21:22:42	@A_Broken_Puppet ahh okay..thanks..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 21:20:49	@DancingBeaver they over cover all bases so no excuse to miss appointments..if only they also cared what you have to say!..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 21:19:05	Why is it unlucky to open an umbrella indoors..but not when you're drying it?..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 21:15:50	Hate finishing a book when I've really enjoyed it..odd..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 20:00:38	@nikimummy13 I've called my mum to come and help which feels a bit pathetic but it feels too overwhelming to do alone!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 19:41:28	Am going to attempt to complete Atos questionnaire today..it's due on Friday and I've not touched it yet..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 18:17:53	I woke feeling a little less anxious and slightly less like I'm cloaked in darkness..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 05:21:10	Spoke to my sponsor..advice accept how I'm feeling..allow myself to feel it..cry as much as I need to..and remember I'm going to bed sober..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 05:01:37	@NatalieOxford oh good..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 05:00:11	@NatalieOxford ooh looks painful..hope it helps..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 04:56:47	Recently even the idea of food is off putting..old eating disorder issues resurface when I feel I'm not in control of my emotions..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 04:54:59	Have managed to eat some toast and nutella..my sister really stressed that I need to practice self care when feeling so low..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 01:47:06	@terpsichorejoy just needs to be taught..each time move him/her to water bowl instead..soon enough they learn..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 01:44:23	@MySoberPath well then I've done something today..thanks James..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-12 00:44:58	@MySoberPath I'm not of any use to anyone right now, though haven't spoken to my sponsor all week either..hope your chat helps..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-11 23:01:22	@my_fight_within thanks..hugs too..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-11 22:48:58	I really do feel like I'm falling apart inside and out..anxiety is so high and mood so low..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-11 22:47:37	Really not doing too well..burst into tears on a bus..then cried through coffee with my sister..she could see I've not been eating either..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-10 20:20:08	Another session where I cried throughout..exhausted now..all I want to do is curl up and hide away from everything and everyone..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-10 17:11:24	Therapy day and struggling to get dressed..am very lucky its only a 5 min walk away..couldn't face public transport right now..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-10 04:25:01	@jacqt64 welcome back! Sat 26th at 10pm..host @DastardlyDeano ..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-09 23:48:10	@oxymoronic82 thanks lovely..you need to rest after all your packing!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-09 23:44:40	The #gagginglaw is a threat to freedom of speech and it needs to be voted down! I hope my MP @MarkFieldMP listens.
274535898	act1175	2013-10-09 23:42:59	@nikimummy13 thank you..x
274535898	act1175	2013-10-09 23:41:00	@SocialAlertMe done!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-09 23:30:53	Feeling low..still..feel like I'm trudging through wet sand, even when still..

274535898	act1175	2013-10-09 01:40:57	But did get to a meeting so have achieved something..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-09 01:33:16	High anxiety and low mood have not made this a very good day..

274535898	act1175	2013-10-08 00:28:44	@_ck_supergirl thank you lovely..x
274535898	act1175	2013-10-07 23:28:32	I want to go out but also don't..feel stifled indoors but the world seems too much to face today..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-07 23:27:11	@nikimummy13 @DastardlyDeano thanking you..:-)

274535898	act1175	2013-10-07 22:54:16	Sitting here in floods of tears..am not coping well at all today..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-07 20:52:28	Aside from eye I am feeling numb today..almost feel separate from myself..very uncomfortable..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-07 19:40:37	One of my eyes is hugely swollen..look like I was punched in the night! Waiting for g.p call back..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-07 01:45:40	Cat on lap..tea..catch up t.v..and relax...
274535898	act1175	2013-10-06 21:02:53	@DastardlyDeano oops forgot that was the next one for Columbo tv.. Luckily I am happy to rewatch!!
274535898	act1175	2013-10-06 20:29:30	@DastardlyDeano my son decided he wants to watch them all in order so we started with Prescription Murder..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-06 19:26:27	Currently both still in pajamas and watching Columbo..happy Sunday..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-06 05:03:17	We've had a nice evening after all..we got kfc and curled up and watched Jonathon Creek together..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-06 00:12:56	Been very irritable all day and my son can tell..using time he is out to try and relax a bit..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-05 23:41:55	Chores done..son out to play..tea time for me..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-05 18:48:29	@richardkhornsey yeh!! Glad you stuck with it..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-05 18:14:08	Nice lazy morning before chores to get done..feeling slightly anxious so trying to focus on calm breathing..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-04 22:06:35	Just picked up my son who is in a grumpy, tired mood..looks like it could be a long evening ahead..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-04 16:47:39	Yesterday is history, tomorrow is but a mystery... Today is a gift, that's why we call it the present...
274535898	act1175	2013-10-04 16:28:42	Morning..coffee and daily readings..best way for me to start the day..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-04 03:08:15	Feeling quiet and thoughtful..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-04 01:14:24	@marialex1971 be kind to yourself..*hugs*..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-04 00:30:25	Only now my eyes are stinging from crying earlier..have quietly read and reflected..think its time for some tea and t.v now..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-03 16:31:36	@TheChristorian thank you, yes I've learnt from past 3 weeks that it floors me so lots of self care planned..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-03 16:24:24	Scary that @itvthismorning is celebrating 25 years and I can remember it starting!! #mustbegettingolder
274535898	act1175	2013-10-03 16:20:38	Therapy this morning and have made sure the rest of the day is free to just be afterwards..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-03 16:10:05	@nikimummy13 @Syncriel Happy Anniversary!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-03 05:39:49	Felt the need to be gentle and kind to myself this evening so have done so..long bath now off to bed..very tired..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-02 23:42:13	Busy busy day volunteering..involved having to watch someone being taken off by police for sectioning..quite emotional to see..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-02 05:13:15	Hot chocolate..book..and bed..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-02 03:14:12	@chinorossioc yes we are..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-10-02 03:14:00	Okay diving over..anxiety still high but hoping it will ease up a bit once I'm home..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-01 23:57:19	Anxiety only getting worse..its all the conversing with other mums I find so hard..would be fine if it was just me..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-01 22:13:22	Been to a meeting now off to watch my son diving..quite anxious, for no reason so hoping to read and concentrate on breathing on the way..
274535898	act1175	2013-10-01 17:39:18	Having to read twitter very very carefully as loads of Breaking Bad tweets and I don't want to know.. #twitterdoingwhatitdoesbest

274535898	act1175	2013-09-29 02:51:50	@oxymoronic82 of course, those are definitely the rules..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-09-28 21:42:08	Been to a meeting now settling down with Breaking Bad for the afternoon..odd mix..;-)

274535898	act1175	2013-09-26 23:28:13	@mssginbottle beautifully worded..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-09-26 23:27:12	Have found on therapy days I feel shattered by the evening..need to ensure my schedule allows for time to rest and reflect calmly..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-26 20:19:43	Quite a hard therapy session..trying to look at issues from all angles to gain some perspective..interesting but still cried throughout..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-26 16:35:11	I will turn to the program and everything it offers today. Just today, and no more, is my concern. Each Day a New Beginning.
274535898	act1175	2013-09-26 16:05:06	@MySoberPath was having a day of not wanting to be powerless..just once..but I am and today is a whole new day!!

274535898	act1175	2013-09-25 23:09:01	Been home awhile but still foggy with anaesthetic..and a bit sore so keeping warm and quiet..

274535898	act1175	2013-09-24 00:52:46	@Ben_Cooleyy @PMFdotNet seems wrong to me that shes not made to attend the trial in the first place..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-24 00:51:06	@somealibi @PMFdotNet interesting reading..thank you..

274535898	act1175	2013-09-23 19:48:45	She seemed caught off guard by @reallorraine question of whether or not she would take a lie detector..surely clear answer would just be yes
274535898	act1175	2013-09-23 19:45:47	Just caught up with Amanda Knox interview..don't understand how she can choose not to attend trial..what happens if shes found guilty?..

274535898	act1175	2013-09-22 19:36:40	Respectful attention to and willing acceptance of our emotions, whether fear or anger or jealousy, take away their sting..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-22 19:12:46	Slept for 14 hours but now moved from bed to sofa..lucky I don't have any plans so can curl up here all day..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-22 02:49:26	Okay definitely not well..achey and head all fuzzy..tea with lemon and honey and curled up under a blanket..

274535898	act1175	2013-09-20 18:31:18	Well that wasn't too bad..talked about conversations I fear having and why..advised to maybe try to take some pressure off myself..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-20 15:02:17	Stirring slowly..psychotherapy again today and already don't want to go as I cried throughout last week and don't feel up to that today..

274535898	act1175	2013-09-12 22:49:43	Odd mix of emotions..felt quite pleased with how it went but a vunerability has seeped in too.. #therapy
274535898	act1175	2013-09-12 20:59:09	There is something very reassuring about being told its ok to feel what/how I do..bit drained now as cried throughout but guess I needed to.

274535898	act1175	2013-09-10 21:03:19	@AlnotsoAnon I can't imagine how hard it was to make that decision but I also think its the right decision if that helps at all..

274535898	act1175	2013-09-06 03:21:27	@Glass1ncision I completely identify with feeling unworthy..its often others who see things in us way before we can say yeah I did that!!
274535898	act1175	2013-09-05 23:54:29	@Glass1ncision but totally deserved!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-09-05 23:53:56	Pain relief barely touched this headache..every movement hurts and nauseated..never had like this before..:-(
274535898	act1175	2013-09-05 20:25:35	@Glass1ncision thats great..well done!!
274535898	act1175	2013-09-05 19:52:50	Have had to resort to pain relief..don't like taking as it spaces me out, after liver failure I can only take dihydrocodeine, but had to..

274535898	act1175	2013-09-03 01:31:54	@oxymoronic82 sending best wishes..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-02 23:17:22	My son back till school on wed..my anxiety over being irritable is affecting him so retreated to the bedroom to try and relax a bit..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-02 19:43:09	Tired..headachey..irritable..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-02 01:51:36	@RogueGod well done!!
274535898	act1175	2013-09-01 23:29:04	2/2 took me months to accept I would never know..from that to where I am now is a miracle..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-01 23:28:00	Coming up to a sobriety birthday is always very unsettling..no idea what I was doing or where I was at this point 3 years ago..1/2
274535898	act1175	2013-09-01 20:02:41	@richardkhornsey well if we find out he watched it that will be spooky..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-01 19:35:22	Very long sleep..now coffee and Columbo..what sundays were made for..
274535898	act1175	2013-09-01 19:34:00	@richardkhornsey was my first thought as well!!
274535898	act1175	2013-09-01 05:20:25	A few laughs but not great..never mind..hot chocolate and bed for me..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-09-01 04:23:44	Going to watch Through the Keyhole..I remember watching the originals!! #showingmyage
274535898	act1175	2013-09-01 00:30:54	@ragazzadicali I agree..not liking them at all..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-31 23:30:59	Day has consisted of sitting on sofa..drinking tea and catching up on t.v..still so tired though..head feels all foggy..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-31 19:06:58	Done nothing yet am exhausted..definitely need couple quiet days where my only focus is to catch up on some rest..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-31 17:06:41	Well I'm up..thats all..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-31 02:29:24	Tea and toast and calm..what a difference a day makes!!
274535898	act1175	2013-08-30 23:33:32	Am feeling much better..took awhile but am calmer..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-08-30 14:58:19	Slept okay but still underlying anxiety..for me I still want to know why although from experience there isn't always a reason..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-30 03:07:36	@nikimummy13 thanks..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-30 03:07:21	Usual self help techniques not working..still agitated :-(
274535898	act1175	2013-08-30 02:11:59	Got really irritable and anxious on the bus on way home and its not relenting..this isn't a good sign for me..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-29 21:37:32	Good meeting now sitting in the sun in Holland Park..peppermint tea..new Jo Nesbo book..happy lady..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-08-29 18:56:03	Heading out to a meeting then a walk down Piccadilly..feel the need to be out today..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-29 17:04:12	Lovely long sleep..would have continued but woken by a hungry cat..:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-08-29 00:49:56	Up from nap and now I feel dopey..sweet tea and biscuits needed..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-28 21:16:50	Home and so tired can barely stand..afternoon nap for me..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-28 14:30:02	Not enough sleep but didn't want to cancel volunteering so bring on strong coffee..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-27 23:20:13	Meeting was lovely..keeping it simple!!
274535898	act1175	2013-08-27 18:24:25	Lovely long sleep though it will take a few more before I catch up fully..now coffee then a meeting..not been for 2 weeks so much needed..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-27 01:20:41	@_ck_supergirl thanks..hes away from me a lot but its always hard when he first goes..allowing myself a little weep..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-27 00:44:14	Busy day today but home now and my son has gone..am tired beyond belief but the flat feels so quiet without him that loneliness is acute..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-26 01:58:02	@NatalieOxford haven't been for years hope you enjoyed! Good weather for it:-)
274535898	act1175	2013-08-26 00:39:14	@GregMcCambley I was glued to Breaking Bad..just fantastic..enjoy!!
274535898	act1175	2013-08-25 01:31:50	@oxymoronic82 fair enough it is a little odd..;-)
274535898	act1175	2013-08-24 23:54:03	@TwelveDrawings thank you for sharing that as I also struggle with defects not being 'removed'..fantastic new way to think about step 7..

274535898	act1175	2013-08-24 21:36:48	@richardkhornsey I agree..I like the interaction with the street cops..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-24 21:12:04	@richardkhornsey ah just what I needed!! Laptop trouble driving me mad..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-24 21:10:41	Laptop won't start up keeps saying press ctrl alt delete but when I do says same thing over and over..any ideas anybody??
274535898	act1175	2013-08-24 19:58:14	Well I was going to go to southbank fair but weather has decided I stay in and catch up on some t.v..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-24 18:39:45	@_ck_supergirl easily done!! :-)
274535898	act1175	2013-08-24 18:31:09	Yeh got 10 hours sleep..:-)

274535898	act1175	2013-08-23 16:48:55	Horrible nights sleep and woken by nearby builders..not a good start to the day..:-(
274535898	act1175	2013-08-23 04:38:55	Had a very long anxiety filled day..ended up being snappy..now finally some me time..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-22 19:05:30	Plans for a day in the park scrapped with the weather..has anyone seen The Lone Ranger? Any good?..
274535898	act1175	2013-08-22 05:06:30	Have been so busy, definitely not getting enough sleep and poor eating..its like I put so much effort into looking after my son I forget me.

274535898	act1175	2013-06-28 21:21:54	Am going for a walk along the river to try and just clear my head..or actually to just not think at all if possible!!!
274535898	act1175	2013-06-28 21:19:33	Not doing very well with my head at all..am unable to concentrate with this feeling of having been decieved in such a cruel way..
274535898	act1175	2013-06-28 19:01:40	Slept really badly now headachey and still feeling really hurt and vunerable..
274535898	act1175	2013-06-28 06:55:38	before I decide what to do with it.....needed to get that out somehow...
274535898	act1175	2013-06-28 06:54:33	After having been led to believe it was for so long am completely confused, tearful and very angry..all I know is I need to let this absorb
274535898	act1175	2013-06-28 06:52:33	Have had a shock today..found out by chance that something I've been feeling guilty about for 24 years wasn't in fact my fault..

274535898	act1175	2012-06-21 16:14:21	@Rethink_ @guardian has to constantly adapt to society..some say bi polar is a perfectly reasonable reaction to the world today..I think
274535898	act1175	2012-06-21 16:13:10	@Rethink_ @guardian I thknk certainly there has been a shift from diagnosing depression to 'upgrading' it almost to bi polar..but psychiatry

274535898	act1175	2012-06-20 03:24:13	@KimJeppe Oh nice..hope it goes well..I always get anxiety badly over those occasions..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-20 03:22:55	@Comfort_talks @Talk_Out Went to a support group yesterday and they talked about how cats are calming for people with bi-polar..is true..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-20 03:15:15	@KimJeppe what are you up to at the weekend?..

274535898	act1175	2012-06-20 02:18:44	@olliehowitt You cynic you..absolutely right though..!
274535898	act1175	2012-06-20 02:17:35	@richardkhornsey Sounds great..will look out for your name in lights..!!!
274535898	act1175	2012-06-20 02:15:28	@Twilight_Zone__ Oh yes.. dihydrocodeine running round my system nicely..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-20 02:09:09	@richardkhornsey Sounds exciting and intriguing..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-20 02:04:52	@Twilight_Zone__ 3 extractions..pain not set in yet but feel very dazed..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-20 01:51:49	Home safely from dentist- feel very bruised..and very sorry for myself..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-20 00:15:04	Last coffee and cake before dentist..three extractions so going to be in a lot of pain tonight..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-20 00:09:29	A man in costa coffee just asked the server where the carrot cake is from. She replied Whitbread..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-19 22:13:33	@brokenmind_ Did mine recently..£8..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-19 19:27:58	@KimJeppe Absolutely..I have major dental surgery later so off to rest up..hope you're well..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-19 19:25:17	@KimJeppe No normally we just don't talk about it but had to tell her because these meds are clearly slowing me down..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-19 19:23:05	@KimJeppe most of the time its ok because we don't have to see each other a lot..but staying with her always a mistake..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-19 19:22:01	@KimJeppe ..ever again..she just doesn't get it..very aware of the family image..its important to her that everything looks ok even if isn't
274535898	act1175	2012-06-19 19:20:29	@KimJeppe She wouldn't and I wouldn't ask..we had a family session sbout 20 years ago and it was so horrific none of us have mentioned..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-19 19:13:39	@Mattjohnsons Now that I would like to see..he-he..!!
274535898	act1175	2012-06-19 19:09:59	@KimJeppe I try to but very hard talking to her about mental health..she says "but you seem fine"..!!
274535898	act1175	2012-06-19 18:48:46	Made the mistake of staying at my mums last night..had a night of "what a shame" about me being on meds again..I never learn..

274535898	act1175	2012-06-18 20:26:41	@bipolarvoice Do you have people around you who would know how to help if you got bad?..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-18 20:20:17	@Talk_Out That was the topic of discussion at a support group I just had to leave..not their fault but too wobbly on meds to be out safely..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-18 16:17:28	@columbophile Its a pleasure sir-well deserved..x

274535898	act1175	2012-06-18 00:09:43	@Talk_Out @Comfort_talks ..all an adjustment period I'm told but not easy..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-18 00:09:06	@Talk_Out @Comfort_talks The meds I started are gradually going up and can feel them working but very hard to adjust to..feel supressed..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-17 23:46:20	@Comfort_talks @Talk_Out Just can't seem to do anything today..making a cup of tea seems about my limit..! feels quite surreal..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-17 21:45:52	@Comfort_talks Absolutely..though I have huge difficulty doing nothing..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-17 21:12:47	@Talk_Out @Comfort_talks Sleepy myself today..have half managed to get dressed and not sure can manage the rest..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-17 21:11:21	@Twilight_Zone__ More than one reason to avoid downing street I'd say..!

274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 23:07:43	@columbophile The honour must fall to you sir to decide where I should start..

274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 19:46:38	@Talk_Out Please keep urging people to write to their MPs asking what they intend to do after yesterdays #mentalhealthdebate
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 19:21:31	@disparity_muse Sorry to hear that..sending hope..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 18:26:42	Actually got 9 hours sleep..yey!! Going to attempt to write my first blog today..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 18:02:42	@LouvainRees @FollowBDT I agree, my son can name all drugs and how to use them but no mental health advice is taught, I do that with him..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 17:49:50	@DoctorChristian How about people with less severe mental illness who also have physical illnesses? Be interesting to see..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 05:36:06	@richardkhornsey At what point does it get pointed out that if he has difficulty remembering things should he be running the country??..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 05:29:11	@augustine_ryan I know have had to deal with them myself and go through the appeal process..its appalling..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 05:25:19	@richardkhornsey The whole thing is a complete farce..would be funny if wasn't for fact that these are the people in power..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 05:19:47	But now finally think I can sleep..may write a note to self that it's friday tom.!
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 05:16:59	Thoroughly enjoyed #mentalhealthdebate today..was great to see it trending..intrigued as to how papers will cover it..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 00:36:16	Just lost the plot a bit in the post office- was absolutely convinced today was friday..have somehow lost complete track of days..scary..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 00:22:42	@augustine_ryan Have to hope this debate forces some real change.. #mentalhealthdebate
274535898	act1175	2012-06-15 00:10:33	@TheSadTeen Always nice to hear..

274535898	act1175	2012-06-14 21:26:03	@_Kenneth01 Absolutely it's great..just very disappointed at turn out..really hope it leads to some real changes though..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-14 21:22:41	@MindCharity About time too..
274535898	act1175	2012-06-14 21:22:02	@Talk_Out They are the company that organise the DWP medical assessments

274535898	act1175	2012-06-14 18:33:41	Right now as for me- 4 hours sleep and feeling it badly!! Why meds not doing same job they did yesterday?! Rhetorical but answers welcome!!!

274535898	act1175	2012-06-11 19:26:14	In the end we only regret the chances we didn't take, the relationships we were afraid to have and the decisions we took too long to make..X

274535898	act1175	2012-05-07 03:54:49	@TheSMILEGroup Make time to read. Sounds silly but absorbing yourself in a book reduces anxiety and regulates heartrate.
