177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-12-16 02:59:26	Tried to schedule mammogram/ultrasound where I went last year (now w/insurance). No appointment for both till MAY 2017.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-12-15 11:39:15	And another recruiter just wrote me back. I should have done this weeks ago, or last weekend, but better late than never.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-12-15 11:32:27	My new answer when they ask why I'm jobhunting: I'm a clinician, not a logistician.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-12-02 09:41:24	That's why I overreact to things like gospel in the car. Most of me is an open wound right now, & every grain of salt stings.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-11 09:51:49	It was nice to hear everyone say they'd miss me. I will really miss them. Good thing there are some holiday parties next month I can go to.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-11 09:50:46	Said goodbye to everyone. They kept congratulating me. Doesn't feel like a promotion. No title change or salary increase, & I had no choice.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-11 09:48:02	Reassuring that recruiters reach out to me from time to time. I have marketable skills. If I hate the new job, I'll find another.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-11 09:47:37	I like my new supervisor, but she was complaining of headaches & high blood pressure. I'm not sacrificing my health for a job ever again.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-11 09:47:10	Been learning about the new job. It's about 95% operations and 5% clinical. Not sure that is enough clinical to keeip me interested.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-11 09:45:42	I seem to have accepted the election results because my appetite is back. Definitely a mixed blessing. Glad I'm going away for the weekend.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-10 02:11:38	Work changes+election=I feel sick. Dizzy disoriented I dreamed someone tried to rape me last night I'm so afraid
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-09 20:41:55	This cannot be happening.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-09 01:23:31	Damn @EmblemHealth won't reimburse me even tho I've sent TONS of reimbursement requests. Have to hound them mercilessly & who has the time?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-09 01:22:45	Seeing my current therapist AND a new trauma therapist today. I don't know if i can see both at the same time. Neither takes insurance.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-09 01:21:55	I'm going to miss my work friends. & my cubicle, since the space I'm moving to is even smaller. & my favorite lunch place.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-09 01:21:24	Gorgeous sunny day & I feel low. Tried to walk in sunshine so I won't need the light box. Big change at work comes at the worst time.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-07 07:44:41	Maybe if I take a shower it will put me in a different mood. I did get out yesterday and today so the weekend wasn't a total waste.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-07 07:43:55	I'm not feeling inspired to write, yet I have a number ot projects I think I should be working on. Distressing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-07 06:03:59	Trying not to feel sorry for myself.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-07 06:03:48	I'm working Nov. 25, so I'll be alone on Thanksgiving. Last year I had a boyfriend, flawed though he was.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-06 10:11:39	Probably shouldn't have left her a nasty voicemail, but come fucking on, she isn't alone like I am. Get a goddamn loan!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-06 10:03:22	You didn't even invite me to your wedding, assholes, and you're asking me for money? I should report your gofundme as a scam.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-06 10:02:14	SERIOUSLY TACKY to ask ur single Fb acquaintances to fund ur infertility treatments. You're blocked. Be grateful for what you have, jerks.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-05 07:16:23	But considering how things could have turned out for me & my minions, this is a very good outcome.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-05 07:15:50	Partly cuz he let me do whatever I want & now I'll have many more deadlines. Mostly because I respect his outlook & opinion.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-05 07:15:26	She is very cool, but I will miss my boss, who has been moved to another department altogether.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-05 07:15:04	Met w/new boss. I'll have a new title, more administrative responsibilities, & keep my social workers. Might even get another one.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-04 09:20:57	Not sure what to expect, but if I don't feel anything, I'm not going back.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-04 09:20:42	Just made an appointment for the kind of therapist recommended by the survivors weekend facilitators. Expensive AF.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-04 08:11:42	@RobinEdgar Totally overreacted. wasn't in trouble. Agency reorganizing, known for a while, and they just told me where I'm going.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-04 08:10:46	Now I just have to figure out how to say goodbye to everyone on Nov. 10, since I start the new place Nov. 14.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-04 08:10:25	Disaster averted. Meeting wasn't punitive, was reorganizational. I'm fine. I have a job and they value my work.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 22:50:29	Meeting went well. I was not in trouble. You can all say "I told you so"
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 09:49:33	Want to thank the friends who called and commented to comfort me. I would be completely lost without you.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 09:14:18	He said if I was in trouble I would have heard from him & his supervisor first.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 09:13:23	So I am going to try my hardest to think positive and not freak out.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 09:13:06	Boss called, doesn't think it's anything bad. Agency is going thru changes, he's contacted by ppl who don't alert his supervisor eithre.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 08:28:10	@RobinEdgar Bless you. Thank you. I will try, it's just that I've had so many meetings like this in the past that ended horribly...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 08:27:29	And suddenly my knees hurt. Just great.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 08:21:11	I wanted to last more than a year in this job.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 08:14:18	It was too good to last. I screwed up again.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 08:13:37	Trying not to panic but this is awful. I had second thoughts about helping and I helped anyway.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 08:13:06	I'm an at-will employee. They don't have to follow any protocol to get rid of me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 08:12:10	She writes "See you in my office, we will discuss tomorrow when we meet. Have a good night!"
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 08:11:53	Have to cancel plans for a really cool meeting and I don't know what's going to happen, but my gut says I'm going to be fired.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 08:11:25	Today I got an email from a Deputy Commissioner wanting to meet with me tomorrow. No reason given.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-03 08:10:47	Yesterday tried help someone being served by my agency. I didn't follow protocol-I didn't KNOW the protocol-& someone got offended.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-02 22:12:13	Ovulating. ow. OW. Need to tell new gyn at my next annual. Left ovary always worse than right. IDK y. Ow.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-02 19:31:03	Been a good year, on the whole, great boss, new experiences, less conflict. Except yesterday's, sorry not sorry.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-02 19:30:40	Happy anniversary to me! I've been at my job for ONE WHOLE YEAR!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-02 08:07:56	I went out drinking TWICE this past week. That's more than in the past YEAR. Learned that hard cider does not make me as happy as wine does.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-02 07:41:50	Survived happy hour with coworkers.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-02 05:44:55	At a happy hour with coworkers, agony for the shy. Enduring.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-02 02:58:48	Anxiety is here after a minor work disagreement. I didn't do anything wrong but still was triggered. When will I feel safe at work?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-01 01:06:35	Seriously he sent the connection request from his iPhone literally 3 minutes after I emailed him. I'm breathless
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-01 01:03:40	I asked if he was on LinkedIn. He sent me a connection request. The dance continues...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-11-01 00:53:11	Marine responding to my emails & offering advice. Wonder if he lusts me as much as I lust him.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-31 08:14:45	I think I need to use a bit less product. I'm used to needing TONS because I have TONS of hair.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-31 08:13:43	Just straightened my hair with a new straightening brush, much quicker than a flat iron. It better not rain tomorrow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-31 06:47:13	Now invisibly viewing his LinkedIn profile #cougarontheprowl
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-31 06:46:54	He's 15 yrs younger than I am, so odds are he thinks I'm HAWT (are the kids still saying that?)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-31 06:46:31	Took a young vet to a veteran social networking event. Met a cute Marine. Exchanged work-related emails. Crushing hard.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-30 22:14:54	After incredibly hectic week thought I'd love a day to myself, but it seems to have dysregulated me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-30 22:13:42	@BobbiLParish @CSAQT what is CSAQT?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-30 22:12:33	Made a to-do list today. Feel frozen & anxious. don't know why.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-30 04:24:24	Of course, insurance doesn't cover ANY of them.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-30 04:24:11	Got a ton of referrals for bodywork therapists. Don't know if I can go to 2 therapists and a psychiatrist. Not sure what to do.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-30 04:23:33	Therapist finally texted me back: "It's winderfuk that you were able to share at the veterans event!" Pretty sure she meant "wonderful."
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-29 07:17:48	Ayelet comes out. In the Bronx. Does that count? http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2016/10/ayelet -comes-out-in-bronx-does-that.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-29 06:38:06	Now I'm wondering how to roll out my coming out. I know I'm going to publish the incest article under my own name.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 09:46:14	Will be interesting to see what my boss thinks tomorrow in supervision....
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 09:46:00	She's an adult, and the organization has many, many wholesome social activities. I still think it was the right call.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 09:45:11	This has been quite the momentous day. I come out as a psychiatric survivor, and I take a client out drinking. More or less.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 08:23:09	Rly cool presenter from today's conference accepted my LinkedIn connection request! So happy! Am either a total geek or still tipsy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 07:25:59	Damn I'm a cheap date. One glass of wine and whoaaaaaaaaaa
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 07:13:55	I always forget how happy alcohol makes me. And what a cheap date I am. One glass of wine is all it takes.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 06:56:34	Had part of a glass of wine and I'm tipsy. Hanging back so my client can socialize on her own. Should've brought business cards :/
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 04:25:22	I am part of the veteran treatment community. And tho not a vet, I have unique knowledge that I can put to use in serving my clients.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 04:24:48	The colleagues who invited me to the event were so warm. They thanked me for disclosing. They look forward to seeing me soon.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 04:23:56	I'm not doing this for attention. I need to live an authentic honest transparent life. As a clinician with a diagnosis.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 04:23:31	"I'm taking 3 medications that work pretty well, and I've taken about 18 medications. Not all at once."
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 04:22:55	Peers were talking about side effect agonies. Shrink insisted ppl HAVE to take meds. I said psychiatrists NEED to TALK about side effects
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-28 04:22:00	Did I just tell a room full of veterans/peer specialists/clinicians that I take psych meds? I did. & they loved it. Exhilarated/terrified.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-27 21:20:04	Hope the ppl blasting music on their headphones go deaf at a young age. Wow. I am cranky.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-27 20:43:04	Realized I clench my jaw when upset/frustrated. Now when I start getting upset I relax my jaw.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-27 20:41:53	Good thing nothing starts on time in the Bronx, but seriously MTA sux
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-27 20:41:03	Squished into a 4 train to go to a conference in the Bronx. Went downtown instead. So damn stupid. Now must wait 10 min.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-27 09:48:04	Busy&happy all day. Several people hugged me unsolicited. i'm not usually a hugger, but I didn't mind.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-26 07:42:50	Can't download Windows Media Player 12 to my work laptop to listen to work voicemails. FUCKING FUCK WTF @Microsoft ????
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-26 07:42:12	Email on my work phone isn't functioning. Annoyed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-26 07:41:53	My Outlook calendar is not syncing with my phone calendar, and I missed a therapy appointment. Annoyed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-25 19:58:14	Woke up to 47 texts from the other weekend participants. Awesome feeling.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-24 12:28:59	On plane home. Woman next to me asked if I would switch to an aisle seat 2 rows down. Said no without thinking. My needs matter.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-24 04:33:51	Where can I publish my incest article?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-24 04:32:22	Vulnerable people can set strong boundaries. It's about them not me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-23 22:35:01	So interesting being a client not a clinician. So comfortable saying everything about myself including bipolar.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-23 07:29:41	Feeling judged/ostracized by some of the participants. Not sure if it's all in my head. Still feel support from some.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-22 12:39:17	Trying not to care about the $$ I'm dropping on flight changes. I'm so darn cheap.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-22 12:38:20	Survivors weekend=group therapy + sleepover with your best girlfriends=awesome. Glad I went. Best thing ever for me & United Airlines
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-21 23:35:54	Good night last night. My cousin the vet thinks I should get a therapy dog
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-21 10:36:32	Wanted to get a pedicure while I wait but like everything at the airport they're overpriced
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-21 10:35:13	Have used 3 airport bathrooms today. O'Hare definitely best, but only SFO has green smoothies near the gate.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-21 00:33:48	Hate being alone, hate feeling lonely. It's like missing a large muscle, like a quadricep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-21 00:03:23	@JohnJGeddes not as hard as being ignored as a plain woman with a beautiful soul
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-21 00:01:31	At airport, thru security and checked in WAY too early. Guess that's better than way too late
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-20 22:42:59	I think I can change the flight at check-in for $75.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-20 22:42:46	Definitely going to change my flight to get in Monday morning. I have a few hours left of leave time...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-20 20:23:10	Off I go! You won't hear much from me for a while, but I'll be in a supportive environment. I hope...

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-19 08:13:04	@apostherapy refunded my money, decent of them. I'll go back if the pain gets bad again. Really hope it doesn't.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-18 09:04:31	@doctorira said I can eat as much fruit as I want. easier with grapes or peaches than apples, but apples are in season, so here we go.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-18 08:30:39	Kind of pointless to speculate, since if I can't remember it, I can't do much about it, at least verbally.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-18 08:30:15	I was very happy as a very small child. I was miserable after age 5. Is my father's death the only trauma, or the only one I remember?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-18 08:29:44	As bad as the trauma I remember was, I think there's a worse trauma that I don't remember. From age 3 or so, when I went from happy to....
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-18 08:29:09	Knees fine, sacrum irritated. Emailed a physical therapist who does "bodywork"; not sure if he works with trauma survivors.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-18 07:35:05	Apropos of nothing, am also trying to eat more spicy foods & enjoy the burn. I'm a gringa. It's not easy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-18 07:32:42	Anxiety. That the other participants won't like me; that I'll miss too much essential stuff by leaving early.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-18 07:32:00	Only a few days until I fly off to the sexual abuse survivor weekend. And see the cousin I haven't spoken to in a year.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-16 11:01:50	Emotionally dinner was great. Physically I'm nauseated. I'll be mad if I paid $48 for food poisoning
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-16 05:51:21	About to go to dinner with a bunch of strangers and one person I met years ago. Wish me luck.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-10 07:25:56	Talked to my niece today. First time in more than a year. She still loves me. Relieved.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-09 08:05:25	I've gotten two chiropractor Groupons, and while they didn't do me any harm, I don't think they did me all that much good.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-09 08:05:01	Right now my sacrum is really bothering more than anything. I should go to a chiropractor who doesn't offer Groupons.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-09 08:04:37	Then I had an Indian wrap and my mouth hurt. Why must tasty food be painful?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-09 08:03:52	Went to a museum today: walking/stopping/standing. First my knees hurt. Then my feet hurt, so much that I didn't notice my knees.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-08 22:29:29	When home alone want to be out doing stuff. When have plans, want to stay home alone. Very odd.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-08 19:31:45	Lost 2 pounds. Only 14 (according to @doctorira ) or 30 (according to my skinny clothes) to go.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-08 07:25:05	Knees feel fine so sacrum has gone out of joint, random shooting pains #itsalwayssomething
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-08 07:24:43	I switched to a high-EPA fish oil supplement that's supposed to be better for depression #fishoil #EPA is that why mood is good?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-10-08 07:24:01	Brain is making zero sense. Mood pretty good but quick to anger. Thinking creatively but sleeping terribly. Watching for signs of hypomania.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-30 09:18:04	Kind of like the personal trainer who destroyed my knees 10 years ago.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-30 09:17:50	My @Apostherapy therapist should have left well enough alone last year, when I was 100% pain-free. Instead she pushed me into a "challenge."
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-30 09:17:23	@AposTherapyUS was supposed to call me to discuss my concerns. It's been almost a month & they haven't called.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-30 09:16:56	There is knee pain, but so far it's been manageable with a stiff cocktail of ibuprofin & acetominophen.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-27 09:04:28	I want to use my leave time for something other than surgery...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-27 09:04:16	But when I see the surgeon for my annual gyn invasion, she's going to notice the breast lump that they want to take out.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-19 03:54:12	Went to a picnic yesterday. Stood around. Knees on fire today. Could be the damn humidity. At least I got out this weekend.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-19 02:39:28	I know going will help me become part of a community. I'm still kind of dreading it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-19 02:39:04	After talking about the weekend, I didn't want to go anywhere, not even the farmers market.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-17 07:55:17	I can keep taking magnesium even if work isn't great. Or it could be the apple cider vinegar. Happy gut, happy brain.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-17 07:54:50	That could just be because work is going well, I'm busy & getting busier. I'd like to think it's the magnesium, though.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-17 07:54:24	Been trying a few things. Magnesium, apple cider vinegar, zinc, CoQ10. Been in a pretty good mood despite my cycle starting.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-14 09:22:05	@eyesanew You don't have to be. Healing from trauma is peeling off the layers until you find who you essentially are.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-14 09:19:37	Trauma lives on in the body, so to exorcise it you need an intervention that involves work with the body #sexabusechat
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-14 09:17:59	@SongWarriors It's called Somatic Experiencing. I really don't know how it works, but it's a physical intervention, not talk therapy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-14 09:14:26	Is anyone familiar with SE therapy? I've been considering it #sexabusechat

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-14 09:08:54	@RachelintheOC @BobbiLParish So many of us suffer from chronic pain.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-14 09:05:31	#sexabusechat So many healing methods come from Eastern traditions. Yoga, mindfulness, acupuncture
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-14 09:04:18	#sexabusechat Hi @BobbiLParish and @RachelintheOC
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-14 09:02:09	I definitely have some questions.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-14 09:01:58	I still have airfare! This is going to be a very pricey weekend. But I can't buy tickets until I speak with a conference organizer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-14 09:00:35	I just spent $720 to register for a survivors event. Then they said I need to reserve my hotel. It's not included?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-14 01:20:45	Signing up for an incest survivors weekend in October, as recommended by the expert.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-12 03:26:12	Finally got something half coherent written, sent it to 3 good friends who are excellent writers for feedback.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-11 22:02:13	Maybe I know they will never understand and will never condemn my mother for what she allowed to happen in her house.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-11 22:01:55	Nothing has ever upset me so much that I couldn't write about it. But I'm strugglng to write about my trauma so others can understand.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-11 21:35:47	Still more to do, of course... always more to do.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-11 21:35:33	Woke up inspired & did some organizing/purging in my apartment. Probably no one else can tell the difference but I feel accomplished.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-09 09:09:52	Can't just be middle age & seeing myself so diminished from my college and young adult years. I am lessened by my illness, not made greater
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-09 09:09:02	Years of anxiety and depression have eroded my confidence, creativity, initiative, courage, my essential power, my soul if I have one.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-09-09 09:07:59	I used to go on vacation by myself, rent cars and drive around with a map. I can't imagine doing that again.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-04-17 23:04:46	It's NOT okay that they caused me problems they won't help solve. It's NOT okay that they make my life more difficult than it has to be.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-04-17 23:04:08	People think I can just let go of my anger at them & forgive them & everything will be fine. That invalidates my struggle.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-04-17 23:03:07	It's easier just to cut them out of my life, because their presence reminds me of the trouble/expense they caused & didn't help me with.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-04-17 23:02:25	People create shitstorms in my life & then refuse to help me clean up. Mom, sister, former friends. Increasingly hard to trust anyone.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-04-14 06:54:57	There's just no comfort in books, words, TV, or my thoughts. I can't lie down anywhere, it's all jagged rocks. Vitamin K is a buffer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2016-04-14 06:54:06	Decided to take a Klonopin instead of buying a cheesecake or a gallon of ice cream. When I'm not working I'm SAD SAD SAD, I need a break.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-12-14 10:29:43	I wish my nieces & nephew hadn't seen me in the state I was in when I last saw them, when I left. Crying uncontrollably, shaking.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-12-14 10:28:53	Maybe some of us just can't be happy; we're not wired that way. Like my brand new ankle pain: if there isn't a problem, my body invents one.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-12-14 10:28:19	I wonder if I'll ever get back there, with therapy and mindfulness and all the complimentary/integrative techniques I try.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-12-14 10:27:04	I was so happy when I was wearing lidocaine patches 12 hours/day, after adjusting my lithium dose. Only time I remember just being happy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-12-14 10:26:31	Do people really choose to be happy and then they're just happy? it's never worked that way for me.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-10-03 12:09:46	Dinner with the Dominican was fun. He's a bit chubby, but who am I to judge.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-10-03 05:05:07	Dominican updated tonight's date to dinner, not just coffee. Happy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-10-02 23:34:29	Ugly guy keeps looking at my Jwed profile. Wish he'd stop. He doesn't ever contact me, just visits every time I change my photo. It's creepy
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-10-02 23:34:01	Post-procedure the breast seems relatively unscathed, although I did discover a freckle on the underside. Time to go to the dermatologist.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-10-02 08:01:11	Started texting with a Dominican, now a Jewish guy's IMing me on Facebook. Riding the wave.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-10-02 06:02:54	Breast is slightly sore, mood is surprisingly good. Took some acetominophen.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-10-02 04:04:52	Biopsied. Everyone thinks it looks benign, but I'll have the results in 3-5 days. A bit sore, will be more sore when lidocaine wears off.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-30 04:21:27	@AposTherapy That's the schedule my therapist set up. I've been taking it a little easier and the pain is better.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-30 04:20:26	Don't want the job. Interviewer was pushy and abrasive, job sounds like it's 90% fighting with Medicaid.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-29 21:25:16	Slept pooryly, nauseated, but have an interview. Hope I do okay. Hate wearing interview clothes, so stiff & uncomfortable.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-23 03:20:22	@AetnaHelp I need you to send me a letter saying you won't cover the diagnostic mammogram and breast ultrasound my Dr. says I need.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 23:09:59	It's slightly unethical to keep looking even after I get an offer, but my last 2 jobs proved I have to look out for myself, nobody else will
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 23:09:13	And I just got another interview. For a much more traditional job. Because my life always has to be complicated.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 23:00:36	I want a NORMAL job... but I guess an atypical job is better than nothing. Of course, I just withdrew $ from my Roth IRA.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 23:00:10	It's not a traditional job. it's a new program they're developing, that I guess I will be developing. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHH
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 22:12:55	I don't even know if I want th is job. I'm kind of terrified.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 22:08:54	OK so I was just offered a job, but I'm stil going on the interview I scheduled for Oct. 15 unless the paperwork goes thru before then.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 05:09:49	And then my MOTHER calls with another meaningless apology. Fuck off.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 04:21:10	Just told my psychiatrist I can't afford to see her every month. I don't know if she'll drop me as a patient.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 04:14:30	I've been calling the radiologists all day trying to get a cost estimate for the ultrasound. No response.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 04:14:07	And Dr. said he can't talk to the insurance company about covering my scans. "That's YOUR insurance, Ayelet." Fuck me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 04:13:28	Maybe I should stop paying for COBRA after the end of this month. Doesn't help with therapy, psychiatry, scans.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-22 04:12:41	Because I have insurance I pay for that doesn't pay for my diagnostic scans, I can't get help to pay for the scans. Fuck you, @AetnaHelp

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-19 00:13:33	Feel dizzy, nauseated, "off." Readjusting lithium levels is brutal.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-18 07:09:04	I think missing 2 doses of lithium had more of an impact than I initially thought. I hate being so dependent on outside chemicals.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-16 21:38:55	@AetnaHelp I still don't understand what you will and will not cover.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-16 07:37:37	Everything and everyone in my sister's house reminds me oif what I don't have and never will.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-16 07:37:22	I am so unhappy, I'd almost rather be depressed. Then I would be numb.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-16 05:36:39	No more family events. Everything is a trigger.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-15 08:34:38	And my younger niece runs from me. Rejection is painful.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-15 08:26:41	My sister is nice to everyone but polite to me, no more. This is why I hate spending time with her.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-14 06:53:13	Trying to be grateful not envious, content not bitter. It's a lot of effort.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-13 10:18:04	Family events always remind me how very little my sister values me. Don't know why that still hurts.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-13 07:52:51	Hanging out in Facebook singles groups is starting to depress me. Nobody ever seems to meet and escape.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-13 05:28:47	Surviving the bar mitzvah by lying about my job & pretending to be normal. It's hard.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-09 23:37:36	And now the printer that was working a little bit doesn't work at all. And my phone has no dial tone. Life fucking sucks.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-09 12:38:50	@AetnaHelp If my doctor calls and precertifies, will the imaging be covered?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-09 12:38:30	@AetnaHelp All you said was that imaging is covered AFTER I meet a $4000 deductible. There is no way I can meet that.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-09 12:22:34	Computer is not completely dead, but my knees are killing me. I'm tired.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-09 11:46:58	And now my computer seems to have crashed. I don't know how much more bad luck I can take.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-09 01:51:38	@Aetna My COBRA coverage has a $4000 deductible. So I have to pay for lab work or diagnostic imaging.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-08 23:40:59	It just seems really chintzy. And inconsiderate. Not qualities of people I want to work with.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-08 23:40:36	Temp-to-perm agency expected me to print out 64 pages of paperwork. I asked them to mail it, never got it. I guess I should have printed it?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-09-07 04:32:28	Jewish men don't date women their age. Only younger or much younger. Very disheartening.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-19 03:00:26	@AetnaHelp But very glad I'm paying $10 instead of $50, considering how much COBRA is costing me (although it could cost more)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-19 02:59:52	@AetnaHelp Had to call hotline AGAIN & then pharmacy AGAIN. Please let all your employees know that generic lithium carbonate IS covered
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-19 02:58:59	@AetnaHelp That is what the person who answered my call told me; however, I went online and found that Lithium IS covered.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-19 02:43:31	LITHIUM is not on @Aetna 's formulary list WTF?????? Epic fail @AEtna
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-19 01:50:31	Just found out I didn't get the job I didn't really want, I guess that's good, had a decent 1st interview for another job
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-18 09:57:36	Hours and several dashes of water later, still have something in my eye. Hope I don't wake up disfigured.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-18 06:44:42	got something in my eye & can't get it out #suckstobesingle
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-18 03:50:44	Just met a Persian on #Jswipe . Am I nuts? Persians be trippin. http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2007/05/what-h appens-in-vegas-stays-in-vegas.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-17 22:01:00	Got another interview. Hoo-ah!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-16 21:34:08	Looking at dating websites, it's increasingly obvious that Jewish men don't look for women their age, forget about older.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-15 05:05:08	So tired of screwing up and getting screwed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-15 03:26:42	Why Siblings Sever Ties (it's not just me) https://www. psychologytoday.com/articles/20150 3/why-siblings-sever-ties …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-15 02:14:31	Went to Coffee Bean for WiFi. No WiFi. This is a pretty shitty day. Starting to see why ppl get high
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-15 02:13:02	Went to Dunkin for grilled cheese. Waited 5 min. No bread.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-15 00:39:58	Bipolar. Single. Unemployed. Not a failure.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-14 23:42:19	Interview for job I really wanted canceled. After I printed out resumes for it. FML.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-14 07:28:04	Colleagues from former hellish job telling me they can't give me a referral letter on letterhead. FML.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-13 19:03:30	I really should stop worrying about my neck wrinkles. Nobody notices them but me. I don't need to give away all my necklaces.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-13 18:59:16	2nd interview 9 am. Wish me luck. Not sure I want the job, but it's good practice if nothing else.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-13 08:13:08	Almost every supervisor I've had has taught me what NOT to do more than what TO do. https://www. linkedin.com/pulse/leadersh ip-lessons-from-kim-jong-un-dr-travis-bradberry …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-13 04:30:30	"as it is clear that you wish to make a difference and you are doing just that!!!" Wow. Humbling./2
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-13 04:30:10	Just got email from LinkedIn contact: "I just wanted to thank you for all of your wonderful contributions on this site.../1
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-13 04:26:24	Called to see what's going on with last week's interview. Follow-up interview tomorrow. Glad I checked!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-13 04:17:03	I think the people who agreed to provide references have blocked me. When I call their cell phone, I get a busy signal.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-13 04:10:32	Still trying to get a reference letter. Seems like nobody can give it to me. Starting to worry.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-12 09:47:02	So I guess that's three potential opportunities. Still networking like a banshee, though.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-12 09:46:41	Interview on Tuesday: 2 next week. Also got a call from a temp-to-perm placement agent who found me online.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-12 02:12:11	59yo looked at my Jwed profile. EW.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-11 22:34:48	Interview on Monday. Why do they always ask to bring copies of my resume? My printer's busted >:(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-11 05:48:21	Another great networking call. People are so eager to help! Humbled. Don't know what took me so long.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-11 02:18:35	Turned down an interview for a job making $10K less than I've been making. LCSW/CASAC means employers need to pay me what I'm worth.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-11 01:45:46	Soup is cheap & filling. Good unemployment food. But it's hard to get into the soup mood when it's August. Even a cool August day like today
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-11 00:13:09	Networking my ass off. Phone calls, emails, people thanking me for writing and saying I'm looking for a job. Wow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-08 22:24:34	Maybe I should focus on clinical work and not try to be a supervisor.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-08 22:24:13	Good interview yesterday. For a direct practice job, not supervisory, but what am I if not a clinician? Salary decent, commute tolerable.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-08 09:11:54	Should I contact the HR professionals in my LinkedIn network and ask if they're looking for a LCSW?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-07 07:20:01	Thursday evening is probably the worst time to try to network, but inspiration struck.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-07 07:15:22	Sent ~70 networking letters to LinkedIn contacts. 4 responses: sent 1 my resume, 1 will make inquiries, 1 I talk with next week.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-05 05:55:57	Things happen slowly in the summer, and I'm slowing down with them.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-05 05:55:42	Recruiter called for temp work, but maybe I should consider it. Turned down an interview for a job paying too little.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-05 05:55:01	Feels like I'm in a holding pattern. Not good, not bad, just on hold. Numb. Have another interview this week, got call from recruiter.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-03 09:04:58	I have stopped trying to educate the world.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-01 08:41:33	I know I'm not in good shape, but some men still find me attractive.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-01 08:19:35	Nice guy. SO NOT attracted to him. Not his fault. Probably my fault. Blergh.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-01 06:32:07	He texts "20 min" so 6-ish is now 6:40? I guess punctuality isn't an essential characteristic, I'll have to work on not being annoyed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-08-01 06:31:28	He said "six-ish" for dinner. I didn't like the "ish" but whatever. At 6:08 I text him "text me when you get to the restaurant"/1
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-30 09:06:17	So now I'm just watching controversial discussions on Facebook without trying to persuade anyone of anything. Surprisingly difficult.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-30 09:05:54	I always want to be right & convince people of my POV. This might be what keeps getting me fired.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-30 06:15:22	I don't know why I still feel so draggy. It feels like bronchitis without the coughing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-30 01:20:47	Struggle resolved: they only want people with auditing experience. Didn't you read my resume?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-29 04:54:08	Do I want to be a behavioral health auditor? If I take an auditor job, can I ever go back to clinical work? Do I want to do clinical work?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-28 23:19:12	Not having a bad period. Having the worst period. Almost glad i'm unemployed, although coulda called in sick.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-28 06:24:13	Acceptance is not love. U love a person b/c he or she has lovable traits, but u accept everybody just b/c they're alive and human. Al Ellis
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-27 18:58:38	It's hard to wait and do nothing, waiting for others to respond. It's so hard to be patient.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-27 15:25:45	Up too early. First time in a long time. With knee pain.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-27 09:50:37	Trying not to let my intellectual snobbery keep me single for the rest of my life.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-27 09:50:16	I have a date this week with an office furniture salesman who seems to like me. So I'm trying to like him.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-27 09:49:52	Is there anything stupider than saying you're 35/47/53 "years young"? SO STUPID. #rantover
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-24 08:09:55	3) Two master's degrees and I don't know jack about men of any age.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-24 08:09:41	2) I don't know what is wrong with men my age, and I can't understand why millennials fetishize cougars.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-24 08:09:34	1) As a joke, I decided to increase my OKCupid age range. Downward. Substantially. Within two days, I've gotten 187 likes.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-24 04:29:09	Looks like I'll get a 2nd interview 4 the job I don't really want. Maybe it's not such a bad opportunity.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-24 01:38:48	Although who the hell gets bronchitis in JULY? I'm so lame.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-24 01:38:33	This was either a very bad cold or a very good bronchitis. Still fatigued & coughing, but it could have been so much worse.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-23 07:58:26	And then I might eat some ice cream. I'm in the mood for ice cream a lot these days.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-23 07:58:07	I'm going to remind them that even though the inquiries are ongoing, I deserve a good reference for the excellent work I did there.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-23 07:57:43	Tomorrow I will: go on my interview; come home & nap; give myself an incredibly creative manicure; & call my former employer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-23 05:43:22	This has been an extremely mild case of bronchitis, but I still feel exhausted after doing very little all day.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-23 05:24:43	Interest fades by attrition -- drop by drop until nothing remains but a painful memory.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-23 04:44:41	And I officially signed up for COBRA. Feeling much safer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-23 04:44:26	Oh yeah -- I also scheduled a job interview and got a call about my resume. Things continue to happen.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-23 04:44:04	Took cough suppressant, still coughing. But I can breathe through my nose and the weather is balmy, so on balance I'm grateful.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-23 01:36:08	Naps are so important when you're recovering from a bad cold.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-22 20:20:28	Definitely getting new lenses for my glasses, seeing the dentist, and probably the dermatologist for a mole check & retinol prescription.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-22 20:19:58	Signed up for COBRA. Includes vision & dental for little over $600. May be the best thing the agency ever did for me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-22 10:22:45	Jackie was right. Ice cream is making me cough more than I was already coughing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-22 03:07:40	thanks whatever powers that be that I have friends who understand COBRA and help me navigate HR bullies
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-21 23:02:15	I still have time to sign up, so I'll call the agency when I can talk.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-21 23:01:55	FINALLY got the damn COBRA paperwork. Not that expensive, but confusing. I"d call to discuss but have almost completely lost my voice.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-21 21:17:23	Guess who just visited my Jwed profile? A man 10 yrs older who lives on GUAM. No, I am NOT that desperate.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-21 19:11:06	head is clear, cough is sharply painful
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-21 09:20:37	I go to sleep alone every night, but I never like it any better.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-21 07:23:14	Going to sleep early. Please don't call or come by unless you have ice cream, in which case bring a LOT and wake me up.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-21 05:40:20	Why are the men who openly proclaim they want to get married so unappealing? Weak, boring, no fire at all.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-21 05:34:29	Being sick = being on weed. Your sense of time is totally warped. A brief nap lasts hours; an agonizing span of time awake is a few minutes
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-21 05:14:12	Coughing, weak, lethargic. Bronchitis. I have healthy food at home but all I want is ice cream
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-21 00:31:37	I can breathe. Little coughing. Just lethargic.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-20 19:27:17	Update: I can breathe, but it hurts to swallow & I'm coughing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-20 10:04:16	I'm coughing, feel crummy, but I can breathe so today's better than yesterday. I need to be healthy by Tuesday, I have a special event.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-20 08:48:07	And... I'm coughing. Shit. This can't become bronchitis, and not just because I'm uninsured.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-20 01:41:09	Traded nasal/sinus congestion for headache, sore throat, and chest congestion. Nose still hurts though.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-20 00:55:09	went to pharmacy for more powerful decongestants. forgot to get cough drops for sore throat. #fml At least I'll be able to breathe
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-19 23:05:53	Just because I accepted your friend request does not mean I want to chat with you ALL THE TIME. Boundaries, people.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-19 18:46:01	Goodnews: I can breathe thru my nose. Bad news: cold has migrated to my throat and chest.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-19 18:30:08	Good news: nose/sinuses clearer. Bad news: throat/chest now sore & coughing. Sgh...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-19 10:18:13	Feels like the inside of my face has been grouted.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-19 08:59:53	Know the expression "cut off your nose to spite your face"? I want to cut off my nose and gouge out my sinuses.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-19 08:03:17	Slept v. poorly last night due to not being able to breathe. Tonight I'll need a stiff dose of Klonopin. I canNOT get bronchitis.again.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-19 07:33:13	I wish I could find a way to feel attracted to average-looking men in their 50s. It's almost always impossible.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-19 05:50:14	This cold absolutely positively canNOT turn into bronchitis. I cannot get sick with bronchitis and lose a week of my life right now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-19 05:41:01	When you're sick & you're single, nobody takes care of u. Of course, this is probably also true of bad marriages.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-19 03:46:30	I don't think I could ever SCUBA because I *hate* not being able to breathe through my nose. This is miserable. Time for more soup.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-19 00:47:07	@jenl54361 Thank you :) I'm just uncomfortable & kvetchy. I awfulize and feel sorry for myself when several disappointments pile up.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-18 17:49:55	Although nowadays they don't like giving antibiotics for a sinus infection, so maybe there's no point in seeing Dr.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-18 17:49:14	Like concrete was poured into my nostrils and sinuses. Complete bilateral blockage. Haven't signed up for COBRA, can't go to Dr. Shit.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-18 10:43:34	Man, I hope none of my former clients are on Tinder.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-18 08:56:21	Coming down with a cold. Mad congested. Drat.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-18 03:20:37	I'm getting all kinds of spam for AstroGlide and Viagra_Cialis. Clearly they have no idea how single I am.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-18 00:40:19	Agency responded. They're not contesting unemployment. So eventually it should come through.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 23:16:50	I haven't gotten updated COBRA materials. Unemployment hasn't been deposited. Very stressful and tedious.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 22:57:55	Recruiter emailed about a hospital Director of Social Work position. It must be in Staten Island. I'm so not qualified. for it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 18:52:28	Have lost track of how many celebs have gotten divorced and remarried while I've been single. Mazaltov @jenniegarth your dress = awesome
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 05:12:27	Former coworker I saw on the subway didn't respond to email or return phone call. Guess she didn't mean it when she offered to help.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 05:11:40	But I just want to binge-watch "The Mentalist" and ignore what I can't change: waiting for my job-seeking efforts to bear fruit.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 05:11:06	The recruiter who called yesterday said he's been reading my posts. That's how he noticed I'm no longer at my former employer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 05:10:45	I know I should be writing and posting. Not on my anonymous blog, but the professional articles on LinkedIn.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 05:05:55	Moderation in all things, but the green beans I just ordered from @PeapodDelivers are sweet as farm stand corn.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 05:05:01	But I feel confident, so I had cheese on my mushroom tofu burger AND ice cream. My cholesterol's jacked, despite all the vegetables I eat.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 05:04:02	Really a head-scratcher, especially the 19-year-olds. I'm 45, more than twice their age. What on earth is driving this trend?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 05:03:21	Esp since I changed @JSwipe age parameters & about 50,000 guys half my age think I'm gorgeous. Or just want to do me, essentially the same.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-17 05:02:17	Thanks for the follow, Fitness Tips @KaireHealthTips , but I am a very, very, very bad example.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-16 23:13:03	We'll see if she does the right thing.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-16 23:12:33	I said I needed a good letter of recommendation so I could find another job, but all my former co-workers were no longer returning calls
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-16 23:11:58	No return call yesterday, I called again today, and spoke with another investigator. (Many investigations going on.)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-16 23:11:29	Tried to follow the advice I got yesterday from the independent investigator: called the VP of compliance to ask about the inquiry.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-16 05:23:34	Why does a handsome psychoanalyst keep looking at my LinkedIn profile? Doesn't he know I'm a behaviorist?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-16 00:04:27	Got a call from a recruiter who noticed my change in job status on LinkedIn. Wow. Might get an interview.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-15 04:10:14	Asked about the job I interviewed for. Apparently asked the wrong person. She's forwarding my email to someone who knows...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-13 21:06:05	If people don't like you, they'll find a reason to fire you. Hoping I've finally learned that lesson.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-11 04:59:23	Wondering if I should call to follow up on a job interview from 2 weeks ago. Or should I just assume silence = no.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-11 04:58:08	Another fantastic interview for a job I do not want: supervisor in a methadone clinic. Unless they offer me sick money, I'm not interested.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-11 04:57:34	Seen 3 ostensibly frum married guys on Tinder. Demoralizing. I know their wives.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-10 02:53:11	Apparently it's possible to eat too many vegetables. Not feeling great.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-09 12:44:22	Three ppl from my former agency have looked at my LinkedIn profile, HATE that I can't see EVERYONE who looks at it.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-09 06:30:52	Why do I always need to show people how smart I am? Because I'm insecure. How do I get over that? It makes me so unappealing.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-07 10:14:45	Mentor thinks I should take the program director job & hire a supervisor. I'll sleep on it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-07 09:10:22	Forced myself to go to my social work mentor meeting, glad I did. People believe in me. Even though they see where I could improve.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-07 04:38:44	I don't know much, but I know I don't want to be the program director of an outpatient substance abuse clinic. That is the wrong direction.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-06 20:35:29	During the investigation I can't get a reference from my most recent co-workers. Hope to get one or two from previous jobs.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-06 20:19:22	Officially declined the offer. How do I keep fooling people into thinking I could be an administrator, when I've failed at it twice?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-06 03:01:15	Also lonely. Also sad. I know my life's better than the average African's, but it just seems so difficult.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-06 03:00:46	Declining the job offer cuz failure a 3rd time is not an option. But scared I won't get another good offer soon.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-03 05:00:18	Have to figure out another person I can contact for a reference.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-03 04:59:48	Or talk to me. Or email me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-07-03 04:59:38	Because of the investigation into the cover-up, none of my colleagues from my most recent job can provide me with a reference letter.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-04-02 19:44:25	Therapist I fired just left me a voicemail asking why. I don't think that's quite ethical.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-04-02 09:38:59	Fired the therapist. I need someone who will teach me how to deal with my anger/anxiety/trauma/frustration, not how to avoid my triggers.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-03-31 21:59:48	She did give me one good pointer: don't "broadcast" my feelings. Which I know I do.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-03-31 21:59:30	Therapist suggested I should be an auditor if I don't feel up to being a manager or administrator. Not sure I like that idea.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-03-31 21:59:02	Woke up at 2am again. Not sure if I need to go back on Trazodone to sleep well. Very frustrated.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-22 09:29:57	Hope this one's not anti-marriage. As for the bushy-haired #hinge dude, he hasn't contacted me since I refused to hug him goodbye.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-22 09:29:26	Flirting with a new guy on #OKCupid . Very intelligent. Literate. CUTE. So hard to wait a few hours before responding to his emails.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-21 10:51:14	Coffee date. Bad haircut. HORRENDOUS beard. Nice enough but kinda weird. Ugh #hatedating
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-20 23:15:04	He looked at my profile again last night. I should've blocked him.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-20 12:19:23	Have a date tomorrow night with a guy I met thru hinge. Not sure if I'm into him, but it's something to do.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-20 11:57:20	Date was great til he said he doesn't EVER want to get married again. Oh well.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-20 08:18:49	Wouldn't it be great if this were my last second date?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-20 06:23:39	What will we do on the third date, pick up trash along the highway?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-20 06:23:26	He suggested we meet at a diner for dinner. Trying to reserve judgment, but: A diner? On the second date?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-19 09:45:12	I will not call him. I will not text him. I will not email him. I will see him tomorrow. I will survive until then.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-19 05:24:06	Prying Guy has agreed to ease up on the questions. Whew.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-18 21:35:22	Museum Guy from the NYE party has asked for a raincheck due to icy weather conditions. I don't think this will happen.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-18 09:33:37	Also, I'm having dinner Monday evening with Prying Guy... will keep you posted. Will NOT tell him I have bipolar.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-18 09:32:36	how do I look at a LinkedIn profile without revealing my identity?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-15 18:53:24	Talked it out last night with a good friend. Felt better. And he texted me. I'll answer. Eventually.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-15 10:06:41	Anyone who wants to talk tonight and keep me from texting/emailing/calling the jerk -- please call me!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-15 08:12:23	Maybe this is why he's divorced. He pouts when you don't meet his demands.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-15 08:11:01	I should never have tweeted about him. As soon as I talk about someone I actually I like, things unravel.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-15 08:10:39	And when I wouldn't spill, he ignored me. Another guy who seemed great turns out to be a jerk :( I don't need this.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-15 08:10:14	The new guy keeps asking me to tell him something personall I wouldn't normally share. He's pretty persistent and it feels inappropriate.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-15 07:53:12	WRiting someone up isn't as bad as being written up, but it's still not fun.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-13 12:20:12	The best thing: I left him wanting more. I ended the date before he wanted, and I didn't tell him everything.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-13 11:55:44	I can't let myself get too wrapped up in work again. Nothing good comes of that cuz I get frustrated & destabilize. And do stupid things.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-13 11:55:14	Trying hard not to feel overwhelmed at work: I inherited a mess, and it will take time to sift through.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-13 11:54:44	I know, right? I think there will be a second date, cuz he didn't want this one to end.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-13 11:54:24	OMG AMAZING FIRST DATE W/GUY FROM @okcupid YES HE'S JEWISH HAD SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-12 12:16:11	As always at singles events, I met some great girls.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-12 10:17:42	At singles event. Lots of chicken, only dated 3 men. So, not horrible.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-12 05:59:46	In other news: have a date 2moro with someone who found me on OKCupid. Jewish even. Busy week!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-12 05:58:03	This event better have GOOD FOOD. Otherwise venturing into the freezing cold will be such a waste.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-11 22:55:44	Also: "Follow your heart and do what is right for you for the long-term." Does my heart know what's right for me?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-11 22:55:10	Horoscope today: "A social event can connect you with interesting and inspiring people." At 6:30pm I guess I'll find out.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-11 07:53:31	Forgot to tell him I have impossibly high standards, but I think I scared him off anyway.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-11 07:52:50	"....and I doubt you know anyone eager to marry a 44yo with bipolar disorder. Even though she's cute and very smart."
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-11 07:52:39	I wrote back: "Thanks, but my past experiences with shadchanim have not been good,..."
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-11 07:50:28	Just got this message: " I am a shadchan from monsey ny let me know if you want to discuss some suggestions THANKS" Clearly doesn't know me

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-11 02:35:29	coooooooold. heat is on, it's not enough.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-09 10:22:20	Since I have no love to keep away the cold, I'm wearing several layers: nylons, fleece leggings, socks, boots, sweater, cardigan.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-09 10:21:34	I got ssssssssssssssteam heat, I got ssssssssssssssteam heat, I got ssssssssssssssteam heat, But I need your love to keep away the cold!

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-08 10:15:42	Missing my former subordinates, and wonder what, if anything, they think of me now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-08 09:21:53	Very. Very. Tired.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-07 11:40:00	Singles groups on Facebook have taught me that there r people out there who r even more clueless and tactless than I am. Make me look suave
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-07 11:08:33	May have just signed up for a fairly expensive singles event. Why do I... I must be desperate.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-06 11:44:08	It's the plague of the lovable losers.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-06 11:27:21	Why do I have to choose between someone accomplished and someone kind?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-06 11:27:07	Heard from another guy on Facebook. MSW: not LCSW, not even LMSW. I guess I should give up on finding an achiever.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-05 11:08:03	he is SUCH a nice person and I am SO not attracted to him. he works in retail. hardworking yes, stupid no, interesting... not really
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-05 03:24:39	Sent him a text: "Can't stop thinking about what you said to me at the party." No response. So that's that.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-04 08:39:59	Nice guy called. He is definitely a talker. Not sure I enjoyed the conversation, but we're having coffee tomorrow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-04 07:05:54	Met new guy in Fb Jewish singles group. Asked me out. Not awful looking, seems nice. Trying to like him more than the guy who hasn't callled
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-02 10:49:47	1 guy took my #, 1 guy promised to take me to a museum. Which will follow thru, if either? Stay tuned.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-01 16:19:59	Party was actually fun. Got tons of flattering attention, made some new friends. Not a bad NYE at all.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-01 06:30:40	Got invited to a boring party in Jersey, so that's where I'm going. Feh. Better than staying home alone. A little.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-01 06:30:17	Last night's guy claims his nephew ended up in the hospital and his phone died. He apologized. Whatever.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2015-01-01 00:08:16	Got invited to a party in NJ. Guess I'll shlep out there. Woohoo.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-29 21:18:30	Go to a party full of strangers with a guy I met the night before? Well, that's one way to get me back to blogging.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-29 21:18:09	Is this a huge mistake? I am not super social right now, and so not at the top of my game. (Up for hours, just remembered to light box.)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-29 21:17:21	Have been interviewing numerous candidates for New Year's Eve, and might have found me a date. To a party where I won't know anyone. Um...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-24 10:02:05	oh, how I detest PMS. I know it's temporary, I still feel abjectly wretched.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-24 09:42:48	Also, when you're even just mildly depressed, it's hard to make quick decisions. Especially when people are yelling. (Not at me, but still.)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-24 09:40:40	Feel like my supervisor wants me to assume more authority, but don't feel ready. Still don't know how everything runs. Tomorrow it's 30 days

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-17 20:28:41	Winter is a high-maintenance season for me. And I still am not very productive. It's more like treading water than swimming somewhere.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-17 20:28:11	I spend so much time on maintenance. Light box 45 min every a.m., walking in the #apostherapy at least 4 hours, lying on the mat 45 minutes.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-17 20:27:21	Filled all my Rx. Got the right lithium generic, not sure about the Remeron. If I don't use the acutorture mat, I don't sleep well.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-17 11:18:54	MIttelschmerz. Ow. Can't believe I was tortured by menstruation all these years for nothing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-17 11:03:03	Wore the #apostherapy all day today. First time. No pain at alll, but now noticing some discomfort.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-16 11:08:07	No New Year's plans. I should just go to sleep at my usual time and wake up the next day.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-16 10:52:59	Filled prescriptions. New generics. Hope they work. Hope I sleep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-15 22:49:52	And another local pharmacy stocks the right generic lithobid. This isn't going to be so difficult. Relieved.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-15 22:49:16	@MetroPlusHealth It's OK - I was able to fill the script without PA
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-15 22:47:09	Filled my duloxetine script. No prior authorization or fight. Woohoo. However, need to find pharmacy that stocks the right generic lithobid
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-15 08:40:18	Niece going to college. Hope she doesn't make all the mistakes I did. Guess she'll make her own, hope they're less disastrous.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-13 23:50:52	@AetnaHelp It's okay, I have different insurance now. They're giving me the same crap over my medication as Aetna did.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-13 23:46:54	@MetroPlusHealth I'm stable and functioning well. I can't change meds. I've tried everything else. Are you trying to kill me?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-13 23:46:25	@MetroPlusHealth My doctor was told you don't cover duloxetine. But it's generic. And I've been taking it more than 8 years.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-13 23:46:04	@MetroPlusHealth I joined you through the marketplace. Why won't you let my Dr. pre-authorize my medication?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-12 09:01:30	Having trouble getting the right phone #for my Dr. to call to pre-authorize my Cymbalta. So far Obamacare is no better than Aetna.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-05 08:40:30	Supervisor told me I can order a new chair from the catalog we use. Guess she wants me to like it there. Need to measure my chair at home.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-04 11:08:09	Hate going to sleep with a backache & waking up with a backache. Need a new chair somehow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-03 10:46:31	Went to a training today. Chair was ENORMOUS, back hurts. Am I some kind of dwarf that chairs for average people are so uncomfortable?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-02 09:17:01	Still don't have a new chair -- don't ask -- but having somewhere to go and something to do is definitely helping my mood.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-12-01 04:43:19	My best friends know when I'm depressed, and force me out of my apartment to interact with them. I'm lucky.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-11-26 10:03:36	People I work with are great, but I'm not thrilled with my chair. Hurts my back. Not sure how long to wait before asking for a different one
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-11-24 12:36:56	Another person who hasn't seen me in almost 20 yrs said Ive hardly changed, I look so young. & again I assume she pities the spinster.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-11-18 07:48:39	And then I need to find a therapist so that I KEEP this job. I can't keep bouncing from agency to agency.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-11-18 07:48:02	Now that the job is in place, I need to line up health insurance for the interm until the agency's kicks in. Thank you, #Obamacare
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-11-18 07:00:16	Night falls and so does my mood. Lonely. If anyone wants to call me, I'd be so happy to talk.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-11-18 00:18:34	But I don't start for a week. A lot can happen in a week. The preferred job told me they wished they had two openings...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-11-18 00:17:10	The job I want is PROBABLY going to go to someone else. So I guess I'm accepting the second-best offer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-11-17 23:07:20	Wondering if I've lost enough weight to find jeans that fit. Kinda doubt it. Being short & thick looks great but makes jeans shopping agony.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-11-17 06:33:59	I've been lonely & bored yesterday & today, instead of just wanting to be alone. So I think the light box is helping.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-10-07 09:31:43	"At work"? What about EVERYFUCKINGWHERE? WHERE is it appropriate to give a Nazi salute and say "Heil Hitler"?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-10-07 09:31:19	She told the case manager you have to be careful even when you're joking at work, there are things you can't say at work.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-10-04 06:34:59	I don't want the direct report to get in trouble. But her hurt feelings do NOT trump my trauma at hearing "Heil Hitler."

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-12 07:09:41	#RobinWilliams : another person loses the battle with bipolar disorder. This one's famous, so we hear about him. Many others die unknown.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-11 09:23:56	Wonder how many people at work would wear a diagnostic label if that wouldn't jeopardize their career. Probably more than just me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-11 09:23:31	Ironic that I work in an agency that serves people with psychiatric disorders, but I'm afraid to, I can't, disclose my own.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-11 09:23:03	Sometimes I wonder if I should tell HR that I have bipolar. Because sometimes my anxiety shorts out my intelligence and I freeze. But-- no.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-11 09:22:31	My friend's a retired psychiatric nurse. Every mistake I'm making on the job -- she's made. So I'm not an idiot. I just work in the field.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-11 09:21:39	Talking shop to good friends who've been there is better than therapy. And certainly cheaper.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-11 01:51:21	In other words, my experience is normative albeit difficult and sometimes unpleasant, and I'm doing just about right.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-11 01:50:01	There are always unwritten rules you learn the hard way, and it takes time to determine who's honest & who's not.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-11 01:49:11	Talked to a friend who's worked in the field for decades. All the hard lessons I'm learning, she had to learn too. I'm not extra stupid.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-10 05:26:16	I love doing my nails myself when I'm not depressed. I can't seem to do them lately. Not sure why.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-09 08:53:42	Why isn't #ISIS trending on Facebook like #Gaza ? Hypocrites.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-08 19:48:55	I need to get a life.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-08 19:48:45	I'm so bad at making plans to have fun on my own. I'm not good at coordinating other ppl or coming up with stuff to do.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-08 08:29:38	Took a nice walk in the #Apostherapy devices. Feeling the burn everywhere but the knees, which is great.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-08 07:47:49	Supervisor says she's seeing progress. Knows I'm trying hard. Doesn't want me to burn out. I have to expand my concept of her.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-08 07:47:22	I think all my life I've been ignorant about the subtler variations of social interactions, and I'm only learning now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-07 09:52:47	Wondering if my former co-workers miss me as much as I miss them. The ones I didn't hate, of course.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-07 06:17:09	@DatingTrick Thanks for the follow. You're going to learn all about what not to do :)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-07 06:06:02	It's not a perfect agency. It's just a good agency that is a million times better than my last job.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-07 06:05:43	If not by all the higherups, at least your direct supervisor.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-07 06:02:39	Make yourself indispensible and hopefully you'll be appreciated.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-07 06:02:19	As long as the bus doesn't crush you, just keep your head down & do your work. Not their job to soothe your hurt feelings.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-07 06:01:45	or, as Al Ellis would say, they are 'fallible fucked-up human beings' who might throw you under the bus when you don't deserve it
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-07 06:01:14	Much better day at work. Realized several things: can't expect higherups to always do the right thing, b/c they are human.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-06 18:17:02	I'm pretty sure my job's not in jeopardy, because they do acknowledge that I work hard & get a lot done. I guess I'm just sensitive.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-06 18:15:25	Looks like I'm going back on the Trazodone, because I can't take another sleepless night fretting about the feedback I get.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-06 18:14:57	And I'm doing all new things, not any of the things I'm good at. I come early, I stay late, and it's never enough.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-06 18:11:09	Not sleeping well. I don't get enough supervision and then I get slammed for screwing up. I can't win.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-06 06:10:38	Why can't I just be judged by my work? Why do I have so much trouble negotiating office politics?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-06 06:10:18	It is so hard to pretend to be happy when I'm not, and apparently some ppl think my face is a dead giveaway.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-05 09:57:29	It's the 9 Days, and an allegedly religious man is trying to mind-fuck me. Nice. I don't know how these men can live with themselves.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-04 07:22:00	just now he wrote "i thought i will get atleast a hug; i was sure you were not interested" DAMMIT if you were interested YOU SHOULDA CALLED
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-04 06:42:17	I keep trying as hard as I can at work. They just keep suggesting it's not enough. Not sure what else I can do. Offer to donate a kidney?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-04 06:40:48	Tomorrow I talk with someone from #acupuncturistswithoutborders so I can start sticking needles into veterans. Don't worry, I'm trained.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-04 06:39:41	Welcome to my new followers. I will try to post something more interesting than my dating misadventures.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-04 06:30:21	Not like I was SO into him, but he never called, so I didn't email or call. He waits THREE WEEKS to contact me? WTF??
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-04 06:29:48	I wrote back "I never heard from you after our date. I assumed you weren't interested." WTH?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-04 06:29:13	Went out w/a guy 7/13. Neve heard from him again. Today he emails "So Ayelet you had given up on me?" Um, WHAT?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-03 22:26:22	Just caught my mother trying to spy on me. I am the way I am, in part, because of her piece-of-shit boyfriend. So don't feel sorry for her.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-03 22:20:07	How long does it ever take anything good in my life to turn to shit? Not long.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-03 22:12:13	So frustrated & overwhelmed @work. I have NO frame of reference for any of the new things I'm supposed to do. It's really stressful.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-03 09:17:47	The 31yo didn't get in touch to plan where we're supposed to meet tonight. Guess he just wanted to talk on the phone.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-02 07:47:14	Happy to report the rash is mostly gone. Work is overwhelming: so much that I don't know that they expect me to know. It's hard.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-02 07:35:56	I'm not the only queen of Dead To Me http:// music.msn.com/music/article. aspx?news=879954&ocid=Outbrain=obnetwork …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-01 10:49:59	Tried to look at my ultrasounds, and realized that I forgot to finish my radiology residency. No idea what they show.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-01 10:40:29	Don't know if this means my Dr. will recommend surgery. But hey -- I'm not fat, my uterus is enlarged!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-01 10:40:03	So there are 2 "dominant" fibroids that have grown, and 1 new. Cyst on right ovary, odd because I feel the left 1 more when I ovulate.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-01 10:39:15	My bladder appears to be doing just fine. "No intraluminal mass or wall thickening."
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-01 10:38:19	Intramural is new. Other fibroids were noted in last year's scan. Also, my uterus is "enlarged." Because it wants to be DOING SOMETHING.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-01 10:37:32	Got the ultrasound on CD & the report. It lists 3 fibroids & 1 ovarian cyst. No submucosal, only intramural.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-08-01 09:49:43	New job. New modality. New role. My anxiety is ratcheting up. I need to make myself stay calm under pressure so I don't drive everyone off.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-31 09:53:11	Aloe seems to help the rash. Living alone, I can't always gauge how bad something looks. Hope my co-workers aren't grossed out.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-31 08:26:35	& o yeah, the rash & I are having coffee with the 31yo Saturday night. Cuz I have nothing else going on.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-31 08:14:44	@PerceptionTNT Best show on TV. Compassionate portrayal of mental illness and strengths as well as symptoms.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-31 07:44:45	Thought life after 40 would be a slow decline, but it's accelerating. Really not in the mood to go to the dermatologist.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-31 07:43:35	Last night my neck was dry. I applied Aquaphor. Today it's double-ringed with a rash. Attractive. I put on aloe gel but it's still livid.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-30 08:12:19	Now the 31yo is trying to convince me he's only got marriage in mind. Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-30 08:11:34	From the depths of my fibroided uterus, I cry out in frustration.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-29 06:34:49	Had the ultrasound. @least 5 fibroids, including 1 submucosal. My Dr. will get the report & call me to discuss.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-28 10:11:24	I really don't know what to think http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2014/07/i-real ly-dont-know-what-to-think.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-28 08:43:46	Do I expect too much when I expect my friends to be loyal? Apparently. Either my definition is off or I need to do some spring cleaning.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-28 01:51:53	Some friends validate your feelings, some invalidate. Right now I'm choosing to listen to the validators.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-27 23:56:32	With some guys, there are so many red flags it's like a Chinese military parade.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-26 04:08:59	GYN this morning. Good news: HPV negative. Bad news: fibroids are bigger, & I may need surgery. Time for another invasive ultrasound.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 08:14:06	I said, "I don't think we find the same things funny." He said, "Good night." It's a wrap.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 08:13:48	I told him I thought a recently bereaved person might be too sensitive to be dating. He told me to say what was on my mind.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:57:07	I'm sorry for his loss, but he's creeping me out and making me uncomfortable. Sending me a LinkedIn request was a boundary stretch.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:55:12	No wonder he's coming at me like a bullet train.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:54:57	OK. RED FLAG. His beloved mother, whom he's been rhapsodizing about for 10 minutes, died 3 weeks ago.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:41:45	I just don't LIKE him. He's corny. I'm trying to get over that, but it's so much work.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:37:50	"I'm diabetic but exercise like mad." Well, nobody's perfect.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:35:35	"I'm not sure which word I like better: commiserate or kvetch." Um, who cares?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:32:57	I don't want to be with a corny guy. Does that make me shallow?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:30:13	Yesterday I had a very annoying conversation with an unappealing man. When I said I wasn't interested, he sent a few nasty emails. Now this.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:29:46	All of his cultural references terminate in 1979. Landshark. Looney Tunes. The crap on his blog. UGH. I am not enjoying this.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:28:49	I guess he types slow: "University of Chicago. Which makes me a Maroon. It always reminds me of the old Bugs Bunny line, "What a Maroon!" "
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:26:48	I'm live-tweeting the agonizing IM with him. Just asked where he went to school. Simple & relevant question. No answer... <crickets>
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:26:05	He also has a blog. He thinks it's funny. It is NOT. I read it; he's a horrible writer. Why did I let the friend of a friend introduce me?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:25:26	He just posted a shout out to my alma mater. This isn't getting to know me, this is STALKING.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:24:59	He blows up my FB page, sends me a LinkedIn connection request, and we were only connected this afternoon!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:24:18	"I'm a happy camper and very happy to make your acquaintance!" WHO SAYS THAT ANYMORE??? SHIT this guy is WEIRD. He thinks he's funny & isn't
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-24 07:23:38	Again being pursued by weird and unattractive men. It's almost worse than being completely alone.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-23 19:57:55	Emboldened by yesterday's success, I'm wearing a black pleated skirt with a pink and white snakeskin print shirt. Call TMZ.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-20 06:13:45	Thought I could start taking calcium again at night. too soon. Threw me way off. I'm struggling to climb out of the pit.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-19 01:56:23	Waiting to feel better. I know I will, this discomfort is temporary. That keeps me hanging on. I will feel better, more competent. Alive.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-17 07:13:27	Fever would also explain why I feel so achy, although there's no upper or lower respiratory involvement.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-17 07:12:06	Running a fever. No wonder I'm tired. Taking meds & going to bed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-17 07:00:54	Woke up tired. Tired all day. Exhausted now. No idea why, I slept last night. Knees hurt. Want to go to sleep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-16 10:34:04	If I seem to be in a better mood, it's because I took a percocet.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-16 10:33:50	Wonder if the guy who didn't call realizes that I'd have introduced him to my friends had he done the decent thing?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-16 09:26:07	I've been a fan of @Sephora . No longer. Boycotting Israel? I boycott you. #StopBuyingFromSephora #IStandWithIsrael
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-16 09:14:05	goddammit I'm in so much pain. I've switched chairs and pissed off my supervisor. I don't know what to do.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-16 06:26:16	Feeling jangly. What the Brits call "nervy." This supervisory thing is a lot more complicated than I thought.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-15 09:39:50	This concludes the political segment of tonight's broadcast. Now for the important news: Last night's date? No call, no email.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-15 09:38:51	Learn from history, France. Getting rid of your Jews is the beginning of your end.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-15 09:38:37	France will soon regret its failure to defence its Jewish citizens. Spain certainly did. 1492 was a disaster for that country.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-15 09:35:47	Thinking I'm probably a little too old to go to the @bangitout white party. Although they're having it in a better location this year.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-14 09:02:58	Date was OK. Not awful, not awesome. I'd go out again. We'll see if he calls.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-14 06:08:21	He called to say he's running a bit late for "the big date" (his words). FINALLY ;) Just as well, since I'm not ready.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-14 05:32:03	everything aches, legs back knees. took ibuprofin though I shouldn't & percocet which I don't like to. why am I so sore?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-14 02:03:40	Hands are shaky. Not sure why. Maybe lithium. Don't feel esp. anxious, just sore (knees) & irritated: 2night's date hasn't called 2 confirm.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 23:42:32	If I get all ready & he stands me up, I will be VERY angry.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 23:42:21	I said he could pick me up or meet me at the restaurant. Going to assume he's picking me up.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 23:42:06	Should go to the farmers market, but knees hurt & I supposedly have a date tonight. (Haven't heard from him since Wednesday.)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 06:52:44	Toy Story 3 is very, very dark.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 05:31:38	Looks like EPA should be at least 60% of the supplement, and 40% DHA. My current batch of fish oil capsules follows this ratio. Good.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 05:25:28	Whatever I do, I am DEFINITELY not looking at Dr. Oz's take on fish oil. He's a shameless quack; even Congress thinks so.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 05:23:47	(btw DHA & EPA are omega-3 fatty acids, I should have indicated that earlier)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 05:23:25	The brain is mostly made of DHA. Some people with mental illnesses take pure DHA supplements.instead of a DHA/EPA mix.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 05:21:25	Hard to know who to believe when NIH disagrees with Dr. Weil. I can't get hurt taking the wrong ratio, but I won't get full benefits.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 05:20:25	EPA better for inflammation (my knees) and DHA better for the brain. Although inflammation is supposed to contribute to mental illness too.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 05:19:45	Trying to figure out the right EPA/DHA ratio for my fish oil capsules. There seem to be many differences of opinion.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-13 05:11:51	not sure if it's the humidity or I've been overdoing it, but my knees are killing me today. so tired of being half-crippled.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-11 10:48:43	He hasn't said whether he's picking me up on Sunday or we're meeting at the restaurant. He has my address, so I guess he's picking me up.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-11 10:13:54	no Trazodone tonight, we'll see how I sleep
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-11 10:13:44	weaning myself off the Trazodone (sleep aid): I felt oversedated in the morning and was sleeping the night effortlessly

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-10 10:44:47	But I'm not fully comfortable in the OTD world. Or the secular world. Or the Orthodox world. I don't know where I fit in.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-10 10:44:23	Musing on the irony. I seem to be attracting Orthodox men even as I find myself less and less interested in being Orthodox.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-09 07:16:14	He apologized for not getting back to me sooner. He's busy Thursday, available Sunday. Lucky for him, so am I.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-09 06:26:40	He hasn't emailed to say he's available Thursday. Annoyed. Of course, in the context of the war, it's kind of petty.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-08 19:58:26	drinking water & hoping I find some energy soon.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-08 08:34:00	His profile's pretty empty. And no picture. He does say his build is "above average." Not writing him.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-08 08:26:23	He better buy me dinner, I just dropped $36 on membership. Last time we just emailed and never met, but he sent me 2 emails recently.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-08 08:25:59	Renewed #Jwed on the advice of my dating coach. Hope this time the guy who contacted me actually follows through with a DATE.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-08 07:00:55	Walked all over three boroughs today. Seriously exhausted, knees ache but not as much as you'd expect.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-07 08:41:17	Went on a mini-hike wearing my #Apostherapy devices: uneven terrain, up and down slopes, balancing across a bridge. Good times.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-07 08:34:40	Weekend was pretty good. No attractive single men - mostly families. Hung out w/good friends & enjoyed the nature.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-07 06:12:30	@HeathenHassid My mistake.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-07 06:09:57	@HeathenHassid You called the wambulance because I tried to politely tell someone that it's rude to say what I quoted.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-07 05:55:35	@HeathenHassid whether saying "the cool table in the mental hospital" is disparaging. You think it's fine, I disagree.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-03 19:27:40	Also still anxious at work. Waiting for them to punish me for something I didn't do, since that's what happened elsewhere. Need to chill.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-03 19:27:12	Glad to be back online. Still kind of angry-irritable: you have NO IDEA how difficult it was to get my computer back. People are idiots.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-07-03 06:25:40	Laptop's back, no pink line, hard drive just as I left it. Wonder if she missed me as much as I missed her....

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-06-23 08:08:49	I thought I was angry. Then I joined some FB Jewish singles groups, and DAYUM! I am not nearly as angry as some of these bitchez.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-06-23 07:54:49	OK. Tomorrow I'm REALLY sending in my laptop for repairs. Don't worry, I'll be fine, I'll miss all of you, and I'll be back as soon as I can

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-06-22 23:15:42	Having a severe pain episode this past week has really dampened my spirits. Seeing my physical therapist on Tuesday, hope that helps.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-27 04:15:13	When depressed I'm happy to spend my whole weekend alone @home. Now I'm BORED. Need to reconnect w/friends & do stuff.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-27 04:14:46	Took Klonopin & Trazodone & slept all day. So much for a fun weekend. Hope I sleep tonight, I want to DO SOMETHING tomorrow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-26 16:21:47	up @3am AGAIN dammitall guess I still need some Trazodone so sick of this insomnia...

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-25 08:31:08	Dear dorky 47yo on OKCupid: You are delusional if you think a 30yo woman would be into you. Yes, I'm bitchy - I'm FRUSTRATED.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-25 04:08:25	Dealing w/highly inconvenient arousal. Several days. I want to jump almost everyone in sight. Very frustrating. Must be ovulating.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-24 08:54:25	Have I mentioned I'm SO FUCKING SICK of dating? Seriously. Why email me endlessly and then drop off the face of the earth?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-24 08:52:35	Most of the men who email me on dating sites never call & set up a date. Either I'm really bad at this or there are many jerks online.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-15 02:13:48	About to go into the lion's den -- my sister's house. Chag kasher v'sameach to all, hope I don't end up in prison.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-15 02:12:50	@JennyCraig @kirstiealley Diet didn't work the first time, won't work now. Deeper issues need to be addressed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-15 02:11:28	@kirstiealley You don't need @JennyCraig . It didn't work for you. Have you considered #OvereatersAnonymous ?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-14 19:51:25	Still feel lousy. Called in sick. Hate being sick at my sister's house. Sigh. Will take a car service there, not subway. Need rest.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-14 04:07:18	It's not mania. I feel like shopping, go online & put stuff in shopping carts, but then I think it's not worth the $ and leave.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-14 02:26:24	plan today was to shop for Pesach groceries, pack for Pesach, & do a sinkfull of dishes. did 1 & 2, maybe 2 out of 3 ain't bad
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-14 02:25:51	really do feel lousy,tho. tempting to call in sick 2moro but I'm already taking off 6 days- 7 is a bit much. altho, what can they do to me?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-14 02:24:52	surprisingly, tho, feel good about my life; looking forward to seeing the kids, starting a new job- all w/o slightest hint of man in my life
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-14 02:23:53	can't tell if I feel lousy cuz I got no sleep last night; cuz I have another bad cold-sore throat-cough; or cuz I still got bronchitis. damn
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-13 23:05:31	Still hoarse, coughing, and sore-throated. This bronchitis is just lingering.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-13 17:31:41	Lingering insomnia http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2014/04/linger ing-insomnia.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-13 15:01:34	Dr. New increased my Trazodone, but I'm still not sleeping well. I'm not happy about that, which is a good sign, but TIRED.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-13 15:01:06	Went for loooooooooooooong walk Saturday afternoon. Woke up 1 a.m. Sunday morning. Dammitall...

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-11 07:09:59	Wish socialworkschool dean would email #OASAS & tell them I studied enough ethics... want to take the stupid test & get credentialed NOW.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-11 06:42:12	Of course, I thought @manilaluzon was robbed, and I detest Satan's child. But heck, nobody's perfect. #rupaulsdragrace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-11 06:41:30	My favorite 2 contenders, @SHARON_NEEDLES and @JinkxMonsoon , both snatched the crown. Pretty sure @bendelacreme is next. I'm smart that way.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-11 06:40:44	@SHARON_NEEDLES @willambelli Do you have petite sizes, or is this just for drag queens?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-11 06:40:08	The feds have accepted my efiled tax return. Get on the ball, New York State. I need my refund from you to balance out what I owe the feds.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-11 06:39:20	@SHARON_NEEDLES @willambelli It's vomit-proof, right?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-11 05:17:45	@VeteransHealth No to all 3.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-10 08:52:12	I'm going to miss some clients from this job, and a lot of counselors. I will not miss anyone from the administration.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-10 08:51:53	It's funny how much I miss some former clients, especially those that I didn't formally terminate treatment with.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-10 08:21:25	Escaping by watching "The Little Couple" @TLCLittleCouple . My second favorite reality show, after @RuPaulsDragRace . Will & Zoey r hilarious.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-10 08:17:24	Friend's father is dying in hospice. Can't do anything for her. Except be there, I guess, which isn't much, and bring Godiva to the shiva.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-10 00:17:16	Know I shudn't feed my feelings, but banana pudding calms me WAY faster than Klonopin. & because it has milk & bananas, its effects last ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 09:30:10	Will someone please take that girl to a psychiatrist? @RuPaulsDragRace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 09:29:48	Latest "Untucked": lack of coherent identity; overwhelming emotions; demanding attention; taking EVERYTHING too personally @RuPaulsDragRace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 09:25:50	Methinks @lestranja needs a psychiatric evaluation. I'm seeing borderline personality disorder. She needs some DBT. @RuPaulsDragRace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 08:04:40	It's good to have goals. And internet access. And a job you love. And a rent-stabilized apartment. And an AMAZING rack, even if ass is lazy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 08:04:02	4. Keep using @AposTherapy devices. Shrink 2 curvaceous size 6. Phys.therapist says my glutes r weak. My ass is fat & lazy. That must change
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 08:02:38	3. Volunteer for @GiveAnHour . I have my LCSW. But I don't have a private practice or my own office. Need to figure that out.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 08:02:06	OK, #2 is a little ambitious.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 08:01:53	2. Help my friend write a memoir: "The Truth about Methadone: How a Brooklyn Boy Became a Cop, a Nurse, and a Father." I'd buy that!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 08:00:42	1. Basic jewelrymaking/findings crash course. Just so I can repair & rearrange my own stuff. Not a silversmith.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 08:00:10	I am stupid happy about my new job, tho. Thinking about new projects for the future when I have a decent schedule (645am-3pm SUCKS)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 07:59:32	Not sleeping well but not indifferent to that. I'd like to get more sleep. I need more sleep. I'm not hypomanic right now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 07:59:08	Friend thought I sounded manic yesterday. I was just excited to have reliable internet again. Sux that my happiness rings alarm bells.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 07:57:41	Wanna go 2 Seattle & see @JinkxMonsoon & @bendelacreme perform together. Is @RuPaulsDragRace BOTS coming 2 NYC, @michellevisage ?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-09 07:56:24	@trinitykbonet and @TheBiancaDelRio TOTALLY growing on me (ofcourse they're thrilled 2 hear it) hang in there @bendelacreme I love u best :)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-02 00:39:32	Burned right hand this a.m. making breakfast. Dr. at employee health gave me another day off. ouch. not worth it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-01 00:11:14	my good friend Bruce Holland is coming over to see if my computer can be saved. stay tuned.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-01 00:10:43	funny, but when you're cut off from the online world, you miss the little things, like looking stuff up on Wikipedia or shopping online
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-01 00:09:50	no idea what happened to the guy in Brooklyn, who was part of the reason I rejoined Jwed again. good $ after bad- again. when will I learn?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-01 00:09:12	if a guy asks me to get texting on his phone so he can text me every time he thinks of me.... that could get expensive for ME
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-01 00:08:46	just want a job I like, a working computer, and a boyfriend. pretty sure I can accomplish the first 2, not sure anyone can get me the 3rd
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-01 00:08:06	knees don't like cold damp weather, especially since I took a long vigorous walk with a friend yesterday. ow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-01 00:07:44	this year March came in like a lion and went out like a polar bear. saw actual snowflakes this a.m. ridiculous.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-01 00:07:11	Don't want to go back tomorrow. So glad I have another job to look forward to!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-01 00:06:53	hope I'm granted disability for the months I've been out; if I'm not, I might just quit. I called to check-- I can still get COBRA if I quit
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-04-01 00:06:19	faxed in the short-term disability paperwork that the dept sec'y should have faxed in MONTHS AGO
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-31 23:53:32	computer crash. NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. just when things are getting REALLY complicated... oy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-28 19:20:05	He emailed to say he'd call. I didn't respond. Is that why he didn't call? HATE this, why can't I just be myself & fall in love?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-28 09:38:33	He didn't call. Hate when men pull disappearing acts. Fucking sick of dating. It's worse than going to the dentist.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-28 02:35:48	Haven't heard again from the Italian guy in FL or the Greek guy in CA. Or the Israeli guy in Brooklyn. Whatever. I'm not chasing anyone.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-28 02:35:02	The Italian guy in CT apologized for not calling last night, sez he'll call tonight. I will be busy this weekend.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-28 02:33:37	Went to Dr. Got Rx for cough meds but no antibiotics, which is fine. Will keep up the Mucinex/Sudafed. Feeling a little better, not all.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 09:15:26	In the end, neither guy called. Guess I won't have a date this Saturday night, but theoretically Sunday brunch is possible.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 07:53:41	I want the guy I like to call, not the guy who likes me :(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 07:53:22	Looks like my work stuff will work out, just not on my timeline. What else is new.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 07:18:51	Relieved & exhausted, and glad I got through it without Klonopin.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 07:18:40	I still have a new job. I'm still escaping. And as soon as I figure out my disability & COBRA, I am OUTA THERE!!!!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 07:16:13	@PsychCentral Disagree. It means saying you're sorry and meaning it when you fuck up.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 07:13:55	HUGE relief. Tomorrow I can relax.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 07:13:41	Whew. I thought she was going to tell me I didn't have a job! Which is silly, because I signed papers and everything. WHEW.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 07:13:20	We'll play it a little by ear -- I'll just give notice sometime in April. AFTER my disability paperwork is FAXED IN TO THE UNION.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 07:12:54	She FINALLY called back. Renovation delays means she wants me to start later than May 5. Fortunately, I haven't given notice yet.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 06:52:45	Agency called while I was on w/a guy. Said I'd call back in a few; when I did- voicemail. Nothing going my way today, can't get it right.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 05:48:38	Interesting. Tweet a drag queen for filth & she favorites it & thanks you @GiaGunn @trinitykbonet #DragRace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 05:43:46	And I don't care what they say, I'm taking off all Pesach, not just first & last days.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 05:43:30	This basically means I really do have to return to work on April 1, although that damn secretary BETTER send the union the forms on March 31
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 05:42:36	There is achance the union will deny me disability because of the late filing, even though the insurance company approved it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 05:41:20	Fortunately, I now have about 10 new kinds of aromatherapy oil to utilize. One of my 4 a.m. online purchases. Hey, there was a sale...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 05:40:52	Physically I'm better, in terms of bronchitis, but this has been a very anxious & upsetting day.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 05:40:35	Still waiting for the new agency's deputy director to call me back. What the hell is the matter??? >:(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 05:40:00	I should have been on top of this sooner, but I couldn't. I was depressed. It's truly a disability.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 05:39:38	Then I fax it to the department secretary & call her EVERY DAY until she tells me it's been faxed to the union, which I verify independently
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 05:39:10	Psychiatrist will do paperwork AGAIN tomorrow afternoon. Won't charge me, which is really nice of her.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 02:27:14	Have to go back to my psychiatrist & pay $300 to fill out the paperwork again. Seriously pissed off.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 02:22:05	I faxed my disability paperwork in January. Now the dept. is saying they never got it. Fucking fuck.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 02:17:33	Glad bronchitis is better w/o useless doctor visit, but the an-ti-ci-pa-tion of all these phone calls is KILLING me https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=4NwP3w es4M8&feature=kp …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 02:15:57	And it just leads to more waiting, and hence more anxiety.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 02:15:42	Distraction: key 2 managing anxiety over events I can't control (waiting 4 phone to ring). Online shopping is the most effective & expensive
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 02:12:41	Been a week since I replied to my dean's email; asking her help to use my social work coursework to get my CASAC. Should I email her again?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 01:14:52	I am waiting for four people to call me. http://www. classicshorts.com/stories/teleyc al.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 01:14:14	Still coughing, but not very productively, & not very congested head/chest. Tired, but could be due to insomnia, not bronchitis.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 01:12:52	But nervous about the new agency request for a phone call. WHAT DO THEY WANT?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 01:12:38	On the + side, one gentleman says he'll call between 5-9pm tonight, another asked if I want to speak on the phone sometime. (Yes, dammit.)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 01:11:33	Also getting NO response from current agency administration about my disability payments. Seriously pissed off.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 01:11:13	I turned down 3 interview requests after accepting this job. Wonder if I could get them back or if it's too late or would look bad.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-27 01:10:49	New agency director emailed me, asked that I call. I left a voicemail. Trying not to worry that something went wrong.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-26 18:36:09	Damn insomnia. I don't know what to do. Trazodone, melatonin, calcium supplements & Klonopin aren't helping. Help me, time change!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-26 06:15:57	Pathetic how 10% off at a store makes me want to shop there, even if I don't NEED anything from there.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-26 06:14:32	Especially dangerous because when I'm bored I like to shop online.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-26 06:14:21	I don't want to sit at home & watch my favorite shows. I want to DO SOMETHING. But too bronchitic to do anything.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-26 06:13:26	So bored. Maybe I really do need to go back to work.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-26 02:13:06	Slept well lastnight thanks to Klonopin, feeling MUCH less congested but still feverish/fatigued. Tho fatigue could be from Klonopin.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-26 02:10:55	@Bendelacreme FOR. THE. WIN!!!! you are so snatching the competition, mopping the stage, and making me wish I were a gay man. #DragRace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-26 02:09:40	@GiaGunn LEAST classy exit since Willam; WORSE than Willam. A queen is gracious. You may do drag, but you ain't no queen. #DragRace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-25 23:45:20	Maybe that's just what I should do. To follow the rules, have closure, and get back into the swing of things.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-25 23:44:56	What if I went back to work on April 1, gave notice, and told them I'm taking off all Pesach (first days/last days/chol ha moed)?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-25 10:03:25	caw-haw-haw-haw-HAWF. wondering if it's time to see the Dr. or if this will run its course. Cold for a week, bad cough for 5 days.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-25 00:13:33	But still congested as hell.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-25 00:10:46	Just turned down another recruiter I had an initial interview with. She said, "Oh, NO!" Felt pretty good ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-24 23:38:49	Called to cancel TWO job interviews cuz I ALREADY GOTTA JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But still not disability. Need to call my union rep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-24 23:38:23	Again frankly impressed by the amount of mucus my body generates. I should be a size 2 in no time.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-24 13:53:51	To bed @11pm. Up @1am. Dammit. At least I don't have to go to work tomorrow. But still: DAMMIT.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-24 05:54:57	I had so many guys emailing me. What did I do wrong?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-24 05:53:55	Bored, sick, home alone, trying not to brood over men. Marginal success. & I've lost a follower. Desolated.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-22 00:07:13	@Astaighsamuigh @HealthyPlace @secretsufferer @BeLyndaMarshall Deleted tweet on method #lwrenscott used. Will just say: no accident.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-22 00:05:27	Is this going to complicate quitting without the 30 days notice?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-22 00:05:15	Called payroll; they said I have to talk to my department about getting my approved disability payment. Dammit.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-22 00:04:58	Still can't get through to new HR to see if old HR verified my employment. Frustrating.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-22 00:01:19	@MarieAnneLeCler @GiftedWithADD @HealthyPlace Yes. #lwrenscott had so many friends who loved her. Wish she had talked to them & asked 4 help

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 23:37:45	Love when ppl say I look great in pics I consider unflattering :)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 18:32:48	I am no longer a clinical social worker. I am now just a mucus factory.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 15:56:58	woke up 3:30am. fever, congestion. not getting better yet.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 15:55:56	@billmaher Not funny.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 10:10:42	A girl on my "real" FB page commented on one of my Purim pics: "You look fat." Well, THREE men from Jwed beg to differ! ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 10:10:09	Head's almost decongested. Good. Cough's getting worse. Not good. Do not want another bronchitis. It has never been fun.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 08:43:53	Not feeling fat anymore :)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 08:42:04	Showed both of them recent pics of me in my Purim costume & they say I'm gorgeous. So... we'll see what happens :)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 08:41:23	Neither lives in my state, but one lives closer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 08:41:14	Tonight spoke w/2 #Jwed men, both raised in Italy & living in US, who love horses. Interesting. Only one offered to cook for me, though.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 05:36:30	@HealthyPlace I just hope that the description of what she did doesn't inspire copycats :(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 05:32:16	Scheduled 1 job interview, trying to schedule another. All I can do besides wait, wait, WAIT.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 03:33:58	Keep it classy, @bendelacreme , @courteneyact , @Joslyn_Fox and @dariennelake ! Love you girls! #DragRace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 03:31:53	Final 3: @bendelacreme , @courteneyact , and @TheBiancaDelRio . I love @dariennelake but the final 3 always has 1 bitch. #DragRace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 03:28:16	They needed more documents from Dr. R to approve leave thru the end of March. She'll send them ASAP, but still.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 03:27:42	Disability approved thru 3/12 technically means I should have gone back 3/13. Obviously haven't. What will HR say for verification??????????
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-21 02:57:18	Haven't heard from HR all day. Or gotten a disability check. Going out of my mind.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 23:47:47	Person I know just got engaged. Ring is TRULY HIDEOUS. Somehow I feel a little better. I am a bad person.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 22:19:14	Had to take 2 Trazodone and 2 Klonopin, but I slept great last night. Now I need a nap.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 22:12:18	Sucks being sick, but sick & anxious is hellaworse.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 22:12:03	So I have NO IDEA what our HR department will verify when the new HR person calls them... just know they haven't told me I'm fired.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 22:11:26	But they didn't tell them they're reviewing the case for approving it through the end of March.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 22:11:02	Called disability. It was approved thru 3/12 & employer was told (& supposed to tell payroll) ...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 22:03:36	I hate being sick, alone, and uncertain of my job status. You'd think I'd have gotten used to it, it's happened so many times. But I'm not.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 21:59:46	Still can't reach new HR. Need someone to call current HR's employment verification #and see what they say about me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 21:24:08	Called HR. Not at her desk. Scheduling interviews w/other agencies JIC. Also ferociously sick :(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 20:47:32	That would be just God's style.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 20:47:18	Just want this to be OFFICIAL! And hope I haven't jinxed it by tweeting about it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 20:46:58	Home sick, instead of just home on leave. Waiting to hear from HR. It's 8:46, I can call in 14 minutes, right????
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 05:11:12	Cannot WAIT for Snatch Game!!!!! #DragRace Why can't you have 2 seasons per year like #DancingWithTheStars ?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 05:10:29	@JoslynFox Miss Congeniality or I'll eat my wig. #DragRace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 05:08:52	#DragRace @GiaGunn : You really are ignorant if you can't appreciate different types of drag. You're not the only type of drag.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 05:06:06	Starting to feel the sore heaviness in my chest that betokens bronchitis. Really didn't want to get it again. Really, REALLY didn't want it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 05:05:38	The new HR person left voicemail asking me to call back. Didn't say whether employment verified at current job. On pins & needles still.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-20 05:05:08	Sudafed + Mucines = much less congestion. Just hope I don't stroke out from all the decongestants ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 13:51:08	Took Trazodone & Klonopin & STILL woke up 1am. Laryngitis. FML, have a class and a TEST today.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 08:46:18	Damn. Watching #DragRace makes me read. Maybe I'm a drag queen inside.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 08:38:37	@TheBiancaDelRio The bitch hasn't won since Season 2. You are going in the wrongest direction, like Phi Phi & Roxxxy. #DragRace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:50:15	He lost his job & his dog's very sick, so he might not be in a dating place right now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:49:54	Had a gr8 date on 2/6/14 w/guy who made then canceled a 2nd. He keeps looking at my profile but not contacting me. Do I ignore him?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:49:05	I might need to open a spreadsheet soon to keep track of their individual details and when we've communicated.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:48:43	Also still sporadically communicating w/guy in Connecticut & 2 in Brooklyn. But they're proceeding at a glacial pace.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:46:56	One's in LA and one's in San Diego. I like LA, haven't been to SD since I was 3. But I'm afraid to rent a car. Haven't driven in 13 years.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:46:17	Assuming the last piece falls into place & I get the new job, I don't have to start till early May. So I could go to Cali & meet them.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:45:57	Two single dads (w/a son each) in California (widowers) wrote to me on Jwed, & now we're corresponding.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:45:15	I wish I were a drag queen. Or @michellevisage #DragRace
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:44:54	You can tell who's going home on #DragRace cuz they comment a TON on the early episodes. While they're still on... I love this show.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:06:34	Went through 4 pocket packets of tissues. I'm leakier than an antique faucet. Also SWEATING at home since it's TOO DAMN HOT in the apartment

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:02:46	Really, really, REALLY hope I sleep tonight. So miserable.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-19 06:02:29	Day 1 of housing tax credit training was not awful, despite my horrendous cold. But I have to take a TEST tomorrow! Yikes!

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-18 14:37:10	Took Trazodone and slept for 2 hours. Dammit. Have to be awake all day for a tax seminar. That will be a challenge.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-18 08:45:08	I didn't go public this year with my bipolar disorder. Thousands did. Maybe next year. I want to be open and honest about it.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-18 07:15:48	Not clear whether #LWrenScott suffered from clinical depression. Seems that her company was deeply in debt, & she was a perfectionist.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-18 06:07:49	Haven't heard whether new job's HR got through to current job's HR for verification. A little nervous.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-18 04:27:09	Being inside alone for months has weakened my immune system. One party & I have a lousy cold. Annoyed.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-16 13:35:33	Had fun at the party, but I should have won the costume contest.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-16 09:01:18	Wish I'd charged my camera earlier today. Still not operating at peak performance. I need to get out more.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-15 06:26:38	Still no phone call from either the contingent job or the disability folks. Will just have to celebrate Purim amid uncertainty.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 21:50:58	Told them I'll give notice after I get their final offer in writing. That's fair, right?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 20:35:14	And the wait for phone calls resumes... patience is so difficult to practice.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 09:04:09	9:04pm. Turning phone off & going to bed. Neither guy called; their loss.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 08:12:45	And the Klonopin, and the chocolate. I had 2 grapefruits so I could feel less guilty.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 08:12:29	It's 8:11. Jwed men have 49 minutes, then I turn off the phone and go to sleep. I'm EXHAUSTED from the funeral and the contingent job offer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 06:03:38	Wonder if either of my Jwed correspondents will actually call tonight. I will keep call/s brief to encourage them to take ACTION!!!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 06:02:56	Just want to go to sleep & get my phone calls tomorrow. That is probably the Klonopin talking.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:57:14	I really need a scalp massage.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:55:53	I AM WAITING FOR SOOOOOOOOOOO MANY PPL TO CALL ME NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Along w/the 42yo there's a 44yo supposed to call me tonight.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:55:17	I waited 4 hours and told him I understood, I'm still available & still interested.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:54:59	The 42yo Jwed guy who took my phone #& disappeared emailed to say he went thru a rough patch but would still like to meet if I'm available.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:44:34	But knowing ain't feeling. I have never wanted tomorrow to come so badly. Get this over with!!!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:40:47	I know that if I don't get this job & have to go back to my current job, or if I get fired from my current job, I will be okay.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:39:55	THIS is why ppl drink & use. Waiting is TORTURE. If I eat any more chocolate, I will not fit into my Frida costume.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:39:11	Also: short-term disability guy called while I was at funeral. I left a message, but he's gone for the day. More to worry about...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:09:10	In other news, I attended my second funeral within 9 days. It's a levaya-thon. BD"E.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:08:50	really, really, REALLY want this to work out
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:08:30	Just hope that the HRs at current & previous jobs don't screw me over. And that they can reach the reference I want them to use.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:08:06	But if this works out, I don't have to return to my current job, & I can start my new job after Pesach.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:07:46	I'm very nervous. Ate some Klonopin and some chocolate. Neither is helping much.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:07:18	They called my internship, where my former supervisor gave me a "glowing" review. Nice of her :)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:07:00	plus HR from my current & previous job. I said I'll give notice when I get their final offer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-14 03:06:30	Contingent offer. They have to check w/ reference from my current job (I got them to call the clinic Dr. instead of my idiot supervisor)...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-13 21:31:08	I called. They're calling my employer today to verify. And they'll call me back today. HOPING HOPING HOPING....
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-13 05:06:23	Practicing the unibrow, which looks like it will be the most difficult element of my Frida Kahlo costume.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-13 00:26:55	Sad that I haven't heard back from the interview on 2/25/14. I guess that's that. Got fingerprinted and all, y'all... damn.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-13 00:26:28	Really hope I can go to a Purim party this weekend. Don't want to be in pain or depressed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-12 23:32:52	Knee pain bad since Saturday. 5 days. Trying not to take too much codeine. Frustrated.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-12 09:14:40	Just need to practice putting up my hair and using makeup to recreate her unibrow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-12 09:14:12	In hopes I'll feel well enough to go to a Purim party this weekend, I put together a pretty nice Frida Kahlo costume.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-12 07:44:42	I so need a hug. A big one.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-12 07:43:06	I'm sad. It's a feeling. It will pass. I would love to go to bed now, but I'd never sleep the night through. So tired.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-12 06:56:56	Exhausted. Not sure if it's the interviewing or the Trazodone. Maybe both. So tired.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-12 06:56:27	Had what I think was a good 1st interview. Will hear by end of week if I get a 2nd. Haven't heard from 2/25/14 interview. Not a good sign.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-11 22:25:20	Almost forgot the good new: Endocrinologist called, thyroid blood work NORMAL. Don't need any Synthroid, at least not yet. Hoo-rah.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-11 22:19:07	Feeling low. Think it's PMS, at least in part. Why do I let romantic disappointments get to me so much? Lame.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-11 06:36:55	Ow. Ow, ow, ow. Everything hurts, especially my knees & breasts. Achy all over, feverish. Can't I have a normal life?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-11 04:26:18	Phone interview went well, I think, and I'm feeling better.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-10 20:54:42	Endocrinologist called to cancel. Yay. Hope she calls me tomorrow w/news that I don't need Synthroid.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-10 20:35:08	headache bodyache feverish, how'd I get sick when I never leave home? interview tomorrow I BETTER feel better.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-10 05:32:27	3 men have my phone #. Waiting for 3 men to call. 1. Do not like waiting. 2. Do not like waiting. 3. Do not like waiting. Annoyed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-09 10:58:41	And I realize: that person was REALLY annoying, self-absorbed, self-pitying. I'd like to think I'm different now but suspect I'm not.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-09 10:58:13	I started re-reading the early days of my blog, thinking of making it into a book. But I'm not that person anymore.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-09 10:55:49	Slightly tipsy and itchy from all the codeine. The knees still hurt. The 30yo called: if we have dinner tomorrow night, he's got a shot.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-09 02:58:26	I miss Oxycontin. I took it for back pain years ago. It abolished the pain but didn't mess with my head. Damn hillbilly oxy abusers >:(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-09 02:57:51	Overdid it yesterday. Way much. Knees HURT. Took codeine & even percocet. Still in pain but pleasantly mellow. Need to see Dr. Cool again.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-08 18:14:08	I hate being awake when nobody else is. It's boring.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-08 18:12:48	Hello, insomnia, my old friend, You've come to fuck with me again. You wake me up when I am sleeping, Interrupting me when I'm dreaming...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-08 09:23:06	I just hope I don't become hypomanic on the higher Cymbalta dose.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-08 09:22:48	Daylight savings is ending. What a relief. Maybe now I'll sleep normally without Trazodone.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-08 06:22:41	Tuesday: in-person interview with a different agency. Wednesday: psychiatrist. Hoping for more action on the job front.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-08 06:22:15	Next week: busy. Monday: endocrinologist, then phone interview for an agency with a REALLY cool name.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 20:33:36	Fortunately, a nice 44yo engineer has also started corresponding with me. Onward and upward.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 20:31:53	2:28am he writes "Hey, what's doing Totally forgot about our date?" 7:10am I wrote "Sorry, I didn't know where we were meeting."
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 10:06:50	Had some Godiva truffles. Dark chocolate, so they're healthy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 10:06:13	Hope's not the thing with feathers. It's the thing with Valium, the milk of amnesia. Makes you forget your past experiences.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 10:05:47	9pm. 1 hour late. No call. No email. No thank you. Why did I re-up my Jwed membership? Good $ after bad...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 08:36:59	Why is it that romantic disappointment makes me want to shop online?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 08:36:35	@MarielHemingway That is my favorite Hemingway work! I love the overheard argument between Gertrude Stein & Alice Toklas.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 08:35:53	Just had pasta with roasted garlic marinara. Not going ANYWHERE tonight. His loss.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 07:35:08	It's 6:30pm. 30yo hasn't called to confirm where we're meeting @8pm. I don't think he's husband material.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 06:43:08	The sleep, though: shit. Took 2 Trazodone per Dr's orders, still woke up twice, too early.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 06:42:44	Okay, only the last is actually true. Although I did gain a ton of weight during my severe atypical depression of 2005.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 06:42:16	It's depression's fault that I have acne/am overweight/am single/have bad knees/can no longer carry a tune/am nearsighted/can't sleep well.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-07 06:41:04	Earlobe infection. Went to dermatologist. Her 1st words: "What's going on with that jawline acne?" Ouch. Can I blame my depression?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-06 07:46:33	@MayoClinic Kinda surprised to see you tweeting about such a superficial matter, no pun intended.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-06 07:44:09	He wants to spend HOURS over drinks. I say 1.5 hours, tops. Especially since he can't meet until 8pm.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-06 07:43:29	After three days of intensive emailing, the 30yo just wants to go for drinks. I'm losing interest.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-06 06:30:03	Also haven't heard about my disability case. Trying not to worry cause that's pointless.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-06 06:29:37	Spoke to my most recent reference. She's still enthusiastic about providing a recommendation. Haven't heard more about last week's interview
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-06 05:59:48	Asked GFMP 2 send me a pic of limo driver (LD). He agreed, asked for pics of me 2 send 2 LD. Only AFTER I see LD's pics & am not repulsed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-06 05:39:06	30yo asked if we could go out tonight. I told him tonight was no good, so allegedly it's tomorrow. Still feels like a bit of a booty call.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-06 05:37:25	Asked GFMP for a pic of the "chubby" limo driver. He agreed, then tried to sell me a smart phone. Very hard sell; I didn't enjoy that.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-05 10:45:01	I give up. Taking Tramadol, unplugging phone & going to bed. Don't know why I thought they'd call when they said they would. Men suck.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-05 10:19:31	Waiting for 2 guys to call is 4x more difficult than waiting for 1 to call. #chivalryisdead
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-05 09:32:45	8:30pm & neither guy has called. Did I have to tell them not to call before 9pm? #wherehaveallthegentlemengone

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-04 07:47:44	It's funny -- I can't remember anything about February 2014. That's how depressed I was.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-03 22:24:00	And how weird is it that a 30yo ALSO favorited me? What's wrong with men my age??? Why don't they desire me as much as geezers & babies?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-03 22:20:16	It's really hard to un-Favorite people on #Jwed . Also, how gross is it that a SIXTY-year-old favorited me?

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-02 20:41:09	kinda lame how many guys on #Jwed don't post photos on their profiles. looks aren't everything but they're not IRRELEVANT.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-02 02:42:56	He was nice to me on the date. But that doesn't mean he was into me. I wish it were easier to tell.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-02 02:38:51	Now I really need to get this job... just have to wait for the background & reference check and it's hasta la vista, bitchez.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-02 02:38:22	He hasn't called. I must've been too needy & lacking in confidence. Like I always get around cute guys. :( Feeling kinda sad.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-01 06:21:10	Good friend: "You're not crazy. You're just talented."
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-01 04:54:25	Then I went back to sleep for hours because Trazodone is so sedating.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-03-01 04:53:59	So many good things happening really boosted my mood and I cleaned a little. Spontaneously. Which NEVER happens.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-28 23:59:33	Great job interview. Great first date. Now waiting for the other shoe to drop.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-28 22:45:17	Nice. Complimentary. Easygoing. Cool. Interesting. Cute. With or without fro-yo, best first date in a LONG time.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-28 10:35:29	Date was awesome: nice, cute, smart, gr8 listener, no BS, paid me lots of compliments. Hope we go out again.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-28 08:16:37	2 hrs sleep last night. So tired. I give up: I'm going to try using Trazodone tonight.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-28 08:16:17	Walked a lot today. Not as much as yesterday, but still a lot. Knees hurt, and I still have that date.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-28 03:26:52	Next up: dentist at 5:30 and a date at 7:30.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-28 03:23:48	Mission accomplished: fingerprinted without running into any co-workers.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 23:09:48	Called disability agency. All paperwork is in (ON TIME) and will be reviewed by the agent and maybe a doctor. Hope they think I'm disabled
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 21:40:58	Just saw an ad for a social worker in my current program. Wondering if there's something they haven't told me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 17:06:51	Just hope all my references answer the phone and say good things about me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 17:05:19	I cannot express how happy it makes me to think that I might never have to go back to my horrible job again. Feets don't fail me now...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 17:04:26	I think this is the fifth time I'm being fingerprinted for work or professional reasons. Good thing I've never been arrested.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 17:01:27	Was fingerprinted in same place 2.5 yrs ago for current job, but have to go again. Paid $100 to be fingerprinted for my CASAC in 12/2013.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 17:00:17	Spoke w/my union rep. I might not need to go back EVER. I can give 30 days notice while on leave.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 16:59:56	I have to get fingerprinted on the same block as my current job (which I'm not going to today). Plan to wear a hoodie & sunglasses.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 16:59:15	Slept for 3 hours then BOOM wide awake. Annoying. Fortunately all I have to do today is get fingerprinted, go to the dentist, & go on a date
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 08:54:45	Walked a TON today but the knees don't hurt. They did yesterday, I took a codeine, but not today. At least - not YET...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 06:06:28	By next week, I might have a new employer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 06:04:47	Will HR tell them I'm on leave now? I'm still waiting for my disability to be approved; if it isn't, the leave isn't approved.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 06:04:17	After calling my carefully chosen references & making a final offer, they'll call my current HR to verify employment.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 06:03:50	Filled out & sent in forms as best I could. I don't remember the apartment #where I crashed for 5 months in 1996, wasn't on the lease.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 05:07:58	But: they want me! Yay!!!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 05:07:47	If they call my current supervisor, what will she say? Worried.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-27 05:07:30	Got a call about yesterday's interview: they're sending me for fingerprints & calling my references.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-26 23:02:04	must be feeling better: just took out 6 tons of recyclables. hope is a joy that could become a torture. really want this job!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-26 08:32:39	Now freaking out a little that she might find out.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-26 08:32:28	Felt normal and balanced most of the day. A rare and wonderful thing. Of course, I didn't tell the interviewer I'm on leave from my job.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-26 06:36:56	Interview went well. I think. I hope. Please please please please please please please please please please PLEASE let me get this job!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-25 22:34:31	Job interview today at 3:30 p.m. Wish me luck.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-16 21:16:32	Feel OK today. Of course, I know I don't have to go to Hell, I mean work, tomorrow, which helps.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-12 08:43:44	New network honcho on #Episodes : in therapy, on meds, very erratic. Not sure if it's mocking the mentally ill or saying we deserve good jobs
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-12 02:07:19	Headache's better. Sleep still sucks. Dr. New's not worried, I see her tomorrow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-11 18:25:56	Headache, feverish. Want it to be sinus infection, not serotonin syndrome, but I'm afraid. Called Dr. New, waiting for callback.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-10 18:24:40	Not loving this headache & terminal insomnia. Still adjusting to the higher Cymbalta dose.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-10 09:04:46	He called. Good conversation, and we're going out again next Saturday night.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-10 01:17:58	Think date went well. He's nice & not repulsive. Hope he calls for another date.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-09 08:29:11	Using the #Apostherapy devices. Hope to make more progress and slim down.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-09 08:28:51	Yesterday and today I've been feeling better, less depressed. Maybe I've found my right Cymbalta level.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-09 08:28:22	Dolled up for my first date in months. Hope he thinks I'm pretty, not fat.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-07 05:49:28	Fridge full of healthy food and all I want is ice cream. Screw you, atypical depression. I miss typical depression.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-06 06:36:18	Back to #Apostherapy . Haven't lost the progress I made, Still much improved. Relief.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-02-03 06:42:26	Codeine does nothing for pain, but does make me happy despite it. Guess that's something.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-31 05:03:12	In 4 weeks: repeat blood tests & thyroid ultrasound. Just to be sure - & because I have insurance, I bet.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-31 05:02:45	Went to endocrinologist. My numbers were normal, but that could be because I was taking the evil synthroid.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-30 05:59:19	Spoke to another, very nice recruiter. Too bad she can't afford me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-30 05:24:41	He said I'll hear back from them in 2-3 weeks. So I won't start freaking out for 2-3 weeks.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-30 05:24:11	Feeling a bit better. Great conversation with a recruiter for another hospital system (i.e., union jobs!)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-28 04:48:01	Also took out the garbage, for which I am very proud of myself.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-28 04:47:46	Finally called back all 4 recruiters. 1 job in Vermont, 1 in Valhalla (NY): too far. Left messages for the other two.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-24 05:52:44	Saw endocrinologist, who ordered tests. She's not sure I need to be on Synthroid. PLEASE let it be so.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-23 09:16:11	Ayelet messes with The Man http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2014/01/ayelet -messes-with-man.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-23 06:52:47	Psychiatrist thinks I should see an endocrinologist. Will make some calls tomorrow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-23 02:28:41	Struggling. Want to stop synthroid until depression is under control. Seeing Dr. today.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-20 05:03:48	Just need to shower.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-20 05:03:13	Be proud of me. Cleaned the bathroom & washed sinkfull of dishes. Despite my lethargy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-19 07:18:45	So there might be a medicatrion change - which my previous psychiatrist would NEVER have considered. Feel much better off now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-19 07:17:59	Tried to start using the light box again, but it just made me agitated.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-19 07:17:07	I know I've been quiet lately. Fear not. I've been seeing my psychiatrist, and just feeling down but not out.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-15 09:33:57	Headache/dizzy all day, but no nausea. Getting used to synthroid one symptom at a time.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-14 09:08:29	Dr. R called just to give me my "beautiful 0.9" lithium lab results. You really get what you pay for. She sounded so happy!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-13 18:46:39	The knees are hurting a little. I may have overdone the Apostherapy a bit. Need to go in and see my therapist again.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-13 18:45:48	Up way too early again. Today have to fax in leave of absence application & maybe apply for a job I want. Definitely a nap.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-12 22:56:09	If I got the job near my apartment, maybe I could get a little dog, because I would have time for 2 or 3 daily walks.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-10 05:06:06	Long klonopin-assisted nap. Headache almost gone, and I'm hungry. Maybe I'll survive this synthroid after all.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-09 22:42:48	Of course the day's still young. It hurts to look at a computer screen or read. But if I do neither, I am SO bored.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-09 22:42:12	1/2 dose of synthroid. I only have a moderate headache & I'm not hungry. Better than yesterday's migraine plus chemo nausea.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-09 21:01:24	Is it pointless to apply for a different job at an agency that's ignored your past applications for lower positions?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-09 10:55:03	how important is a thyroid anyway? it's not like I'm sporting a goiter.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-09 10:53:57	will halve the synthroid tomorrow, but if it keeps killing me like this, I might live with an underactive thyroid. how bad can that be?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-09 10:53:30	headache/nausea better, but I'm feverish & still feel lousy. was just really beginning to feel good again. dammitall.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-09 05:04:00	In other news, I puked my guts up earlier. DrCool doesn't think it's the synthroid, but I've been sick ever since I started it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-09 05:03:27	Just heard back from an interview in 12/2013: position is "on hold." Funding issues. Drat.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-09 02:21:22	Headache. nausea. hating synthroid. waiting for Drcool to call. UGh. Miserable.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-08 03:21:09	Ugh. First day on synthroid: awful. Nauseated and knocked out. Have to call @doctorira & see if I can break them in half.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-07 06:02:57	Badnews: pharmacy that has codeine does not accept my insurance. Must call insurer tomorrow for assistance in finding pharmacy. Annoyed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-07 06:02:25	Interview: AWESOME!!! Really really really really REALLY hope this is the one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please please please please PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-07 02:47:10	The knees hurt, but not too awfully. Maybe I will push myself to fill that Rx today.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-07 02:46:46	Then again, I didn't know I was going to get serotonin syndrome and miss so much work. Without being a lazy slacker.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-07 02:46:12	I'll finally be using the unlimited MetroCard I started 3 weeks ago... expires 1/15/14. Not my best economic decision.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-07 02:45:29	Now all I have to do today is survive my job interview at 4pm & get the prescription filled. Might fill it 2moro if tired after interview.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-07 02:44:22	(Don't tell my boss I just said that.)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-07 02:44:12	Codeine Rx w/o Tylenol is HARD to fill! Called about 15 pharmacies before finding one that stocks it. I'd have an easier time on the street.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-07 02:42:32	Saw DrCool aka @doctorira , who was nonplussed by my serotonin syndrome. He agrees that tramadol bad, codeine better.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-06 22:14:21	Not sure why I'm anxious, although I didn't sleep much last night. Have to make sure I always take the right dose - enough - lithium.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-06 22:13:49	Why does it ALWAYS rain when I have a job interview? Need to see my GP and psychiatrist this week too. Anxious.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-06 09:39:17	Ayelet doesn't always fight fair http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2014/01/ayelet -doesnt-always-fight-fair.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-05 09:20:07	I'm trying to play the game. I'll reveal my sensuality only AFTER they've gotten to know the rest of me. Wish I'd done this decades ago.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-05 09:19:25	The virgin/whore paradigm is alive and well in the American men psyche. Idiots who marry a good girl and then are unsatisfied in bed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-05 09:18:49	Sick of horny 20somethings hitting me up on OKCupid. So I erased all my answers, and now I won't answer any question about sex.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-04 08:40:06	Dr. New is VERY impressed that I tried to work while in the throes - twice! - of serotonin syndrome. Makes me feel like less of a slacker.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-04 03:19:45	Tried to shop for a new computer chair. Can't. Too anxious. Hate not having enough lithium in my system, hate NEEDING it even more.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-04 00:22:17	A somewhat happy New Year's http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2014/01/a-some what-happy-new-years.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-03 06:25:57	I have a new interview this Monday. Hopefully a few days of increased lithium over the weekend will revive me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-03 06:25:38	& to have a life that includes more than work and isolation at home. I'm grateful for the work & my skills/knowledge, but want a better job.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-03 06:24:56	Actually, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is no laughing matter. I'm hoping to resume my former level of relatively high functioning.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-03 06:24:31	Or at least not constantly miserable. I don't know if I'll ever be "happy" unless I sustain a significant head injury or something ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-03 06:23:59	I don't feel well, but I'm trying not to succumb to anxiety and dread. I really think I will get better and be happy again.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-03 06:23:33	Lab results: lithium LOW, thyroid somewhat high. Definitely need to see Dr. Cool again ASAP, seeing Dr. New tomorrow. Progress.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2014-01-01 23:03:26	Had fun @party. Even danced a little, & met another amazing woman friend. I have so many of those. What's wrong w/single men?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-31 08:50:16	Actually might be going to a smallish party. Thank heaven or whatever for good friends.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-31 08:33:10	Kinda sad I'll spend NYE at home alone again, but what can I do?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-29 10:53:06	knees HURT never realized how much I relied on tramadol to tolerate the knee pain. annoyed
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-28 10:05:25	Not lithotoxicity. Serotonin syndrome http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2013/12/not-li thotoxicity-serotonin-syndrome.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-28 09:55:32	That would be a wonderful relief. She is already more attentive & supportive than previous psychiatrist.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-28 09:55:12	So I need a different painkiller, and maybe I can keep the medication cocktail that worked for me for so many years.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-28 09:54:50	New psychiatrist conferred w/colleague. They think my meds & painkillers might be triggering a mild case of serotonin syndrome.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-28 08:17:12	Good first appointment w/new psychiatrist. She has ideas we're going to try. Feeling a little better, hopeful.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-27 02:38:43	It will get better. I will feel better. Someday not too soon but not too long. I always have. Not on my schedule but someday.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 19:04:03	Knees HURT. Can't take anything for them. Called in sick, which is not good, but I can't help it. Que sera, sera.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 10:44:03	Can't sleep. Knees hurt, can't take anything for 'em. Upset about job, tired of being sick & in pain. Want to quit job & just interview.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 07:30:03	Hate being hungry & nauseated. SICK of rice, beyond sick. And too tired to go out & get bananas & applesauce.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 06:51:11	& my interview suit should be looser, given all I HAVEN'T eaten the past week, but it's not. Lithium must cause water retention. Can't win.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 06:50:33	Interview went well despite the stupid fucking application. WHATEVER.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 03:11:46	4000 tweets. I should have more than 152 followers. I am so narcissistic. Please just let me get through this latest health crisis.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 02:39:17	The worst that happens is I lose my job. I'll find another, I always have. Don't want that to happen, but I can survive it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 02:38:07	Not looking forward to sending that email. Guess I should call my union rep. After the interview.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 02:37:46	Guess I should email supervisor & tell her I'm in pain & trying to find a new... endocrinologist, but it's tough this time of year.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 02:35:17	The new psychiatrists are pricier than Roda, but I will expect much more from them. Someone has to figure out this medication boondoggle.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 02:34:52	Not that achieving good health has brought me joy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 02:34:40	Of course, none of the new psychiatrists take insurance & they're expensive. It can't be helped. I have always spent more on health than joy
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 02:33:47	Feeling LOUSY, knees HURT, but will take no tramadol. Or ibuprofin. Because both interact w/lithium. What else does? What else DOESN'T?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 02:32:39	Appointment to see new psychiatrist #1 on Friday. Not sure I'll see anyone else sooner, but have calls out to 2 more just in case.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 02:03:11	Called a third psychiatrist. If I can't go to work tomorrow, I could be in serious trouble. Don't want to go on interview but must.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-24 02:02:51	Phone tag w/one psychiatrist. Spoke to another going on vacation. He sez its not lithotoxicity, it's "lithium side effects." Still disabling
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-23 21:46:34	I refuse to suffer any more for this job. No more forcing myself to go into work when I'm not feeling well. I need to take care of myself.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-23 21:44:14	Would be AWESOME if I could see one today, but that's unlikely. Hope I feel better by my interview. Hate interviewing when it's raining :(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-23 21:43:16	Called 2 new psychiatrists & left messages. Hope to make an appointment soon. A bit nauseated after morning lithium, but not too bad.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-23 19:01:57	I really should use the day to try to find a new Dr. I'll see if anyone isn't on vacation in a few hours.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-23 19:01:35	Took no lithium last night, took one this morning. We'll see how the day goes. Should call my Dr. But don't think he'll be of much use.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-23 18:59:51	If they give me a hard time @work I'll take the sick days as vacation days. I'll tell them my knees have been off w/the weather.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-23 18:57:54	Woke up feeling okay but knees hurt, & I have an interview this p.m. Called in sick, icing knees since I won't take painkillers.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-23 10:06:47	I really do need to find another psychiatrist. I can't imagine this roller coaster of lithium levels is healthy in the long run.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-23 10:06:15	If I feel lousy tomorrow, I'll call in sick & just do the interview, but I'll also call my psychiatrist, useless as he is.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-23 10:05:57	Feeling better, which is good cuz I have to go to work tomorrow & then I have an interview.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-22 08:42:33	The poison I live and almost die by http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2013/12/this-p oison-i-live-and-almost-die-by.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-22 07:32:34	Almost every night I dream about my sister being rude & nasty to me. Not sure what that means other than I miss her children.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-22 03:38:43	Too much & I'm sick. Too little & I can't think & I'm screechingly anxious. I hate being dependent on such poison.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-22 03:38:10	I don't remember managing lithium dosage to be so difficult before I used the patches for months & months. Will I ever be back to normal?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-21 21:49:15	No lithium last night, feeling better today. Have to be more careful what I take with it, painkillers & supplements. Delicate balance.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-21 05:52:03	I am lithotoxic. This is very, very bad. I can't function/work/interview like this. I can't go lower or I'll be paralyzed w/anxiety.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-19 09:00:09	1991 LinkedIn connections. Shouldn't I have a new job already? ;) Got a call from another recruiter. Nice to have jobs looking for me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-19 07:34:23	I also notice that reflective listening is becoming more & more a habit, which is also good. I think.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-19 07:33:57	When I get my new job (& I actually have an OFFICE) I want to volunteer for @GiveAnHour .
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-19 07:33:18	It's amazing to be able to make people feel better just by talking to them. Whether or not I'm being paid.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-19 01:01:44	After videoconference, find myself wishing more than ever that I worked in a prison. Cuz they're supposed to rehabilitate as well as punish.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-18 07:06:58	Or I could just go for a massage.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-18 07:06:49	I will probably have to blog about it. Without violating confidentiality. There are unfortunately many men who kill their girlfriends.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-18 07:06:24	My fav coworker can't believe I'm going. I don't know what I'll say. But I knew him, & he's in jail, & probably doesn't get many visitors.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-18 07:05:35	Basically, am just tired. I hope I sleep tonight. Tomorrow I videoconference with the former client who killed his girlfriend.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-18 07:01:37	Am so tired of fighting for the right medication. It should not be this difficult, in an industrialized nation.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-18 05:20:10	Damn online pharmacy gave me the wrong generic AGAIN. So tired of fighting this battle, but I CAN'T SLEEP with this manufacturer's pill.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-17 08:47:47	@natasha_tracy Most of the time I think of myself as having an expiration date. I don't plan to be old & alone w/this disease.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-17 08:47:17	@natasha_tracy Keep being honest. I try to be. When I'm suffering and struggling, I don't sugarcoat it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-17 08:46:45	But went through it all w/grace, & then returned 2 recruiters' phone calls. I am so getting out of that shithole.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-17 08:46:17	Job interview on my lunch break. Forced to write an ENORMOUS application, then found out job pays $10K less than acceptable. SERIOUSLY?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-16 02:42:08	Or could be because children were losing a parent.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-16 02:41:47	Saw "Best Man Holiday" & cried my eyes out. Not for her -- I think because I never had a life like hers and never will.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-15 21:49:17	Horrible anxiety, no idea why. Firing up the big guns: lavender aromatherapy. Took klonopin yesterday, don't wanna make it a habit.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-14 07:18:54	sigh... and another interview on Monday, during the day... hope nobody notices I'm away from the office for a while
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-14 07:18:35	Now, however, I am WRUNG OUT & anxious. Stomach in knots. Making some instant soup cuz I can't face eating solids.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-14 07:18:07	But I liked her & I think she liked me, & she can pass my resume along. It's a good agency with other opportunities.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-14 07:17:44	Interview went well, I think, BUT they want someone to work Saturday. Still don't want to do that, not sure why.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-06 09:27:19	started work on a fiction piece - who knows if it will develop into anything, but it's fun
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-05 07:09:45	@natasha_tracy Personally, I don't want to live to 70, 80. Even 60 is pushing it. We die of cardiovascular disease because our hearts break
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-05 07:08:29	If I'm sad about my life, I have no one to blame but myself, I guess.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-04 08:30:49	What a luxury to be bored instead of abjectly miserable. Need to remember this next time I'm annoyed at being bored.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-04 04:48:03	Knees feel almost normal, for the 1st time in years. Lithium levels much better. Enough has changed that I don't want to die right now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-03 08:51:49	Why are nice guys afflicted with such a dire lack of personality?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-02 07:50:54	Helped a friend disentangle herself from a man who turned out to be an abusive alcoholic pothead -- they always start out so charming...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-02 07:50:05	I know it's a symptom, just a symptom, but so painful nevertheless. So today was easy: klonopin & cherry pie. Don't ask how much...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-12-02 07:49:26	Day was bearable because I took 2 klonopin and canceled my date. Yesterday I lay in bed and tried not to think about suicide. It was hard.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-29 08:14:01	I do feel a little better than yesterday. It's been such a horrible 2 months, with the generic switch and then stopping the patches. so hard
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-29 08:13:15	so hard to remember I won't always feel sick,scared, confused. can't see how I'll get thru the rest of my life. have to believe I'll want to
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-28 21:16:42	took an extra lithium yesterday, today feel more relaxed & competent. of course, I don't have to do anything today.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-28 07:22:11	I remind myself I've struggled before but reacquired equilibrium. It has to happen again this time. Please.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-28 07:21:40	He asked for Saturday night. I have a party Sat. night. No idea if I'll make it, but have to try.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-28 07:21:18	It will get better. Right? It has to. Right? Struggling. Sunday date called, I have to call him back. I'm a wreck, but have an excuse.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-27 21:17:51	Feel unmoored, anxious, shaky. Not thinking very clear. Can't do anything but hide at home. Will call Dr.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-27 05:21:29	home enjoying the dark. head still aches. stomach still churns. blurgh.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-26 08:27:13	Laid out clothes. Packed lunch. Will get through tomorrow by the skin of my teeth -- somehow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-26 03:32:46	Haning on by my mental fingernails. Supposed to talk to a recruiter today. Not scheduling any interviews for this week.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-26 00:12:14	Called out today. Will power thru Tues/Wed. Weds night will take more lithium, see how I feel on Thanksgiving. Good thing I have no plans.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-26 00:10:21	4th day w/o lidocaine patches. Knees r OK, brain is NOT. Feeling decidedly off. Might need more lithium :(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-25 06:03:33	The date was fine, I guess. If he calls I'll go out with him again. I didn't really feel a connection, maybe cuz I don't know who I am.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-25 02:52:44	Off I go. Been so long since I felt excited about a first date. Now just going thru the motions. Was I deluded before?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-25 01:04:59	Friend sent me this article; wondering if I should follow its advice http:// blog.simplyhired.com/2013/11/how-to -make-your-resume-or-cv-age-anonymous.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-25 00:14:07	On the positive side, the pain is very mild this morning. Haven't taken anything for it yet, although probably will before the day is over.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-25 00:13:32	Just not in the mood. Want to mope at home by myself. Going on a date w/the wrong person is worse than being alone.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-25 00:12:25	Feel like calling & canceling. I know that's rude & judgmental.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-25 00:12:11	Why would a man work part-time at his synagogue helping serve food at catered events? Not a good sign. Don't want to go on this date.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-24 01:32:49	Knees barely hurt. No patches, and so far no tramadol or ibuprofin either. Hope this is a trend and not a fluke.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-23 07:54:20	Interview #3 was canceled by voicemail. I called to suggest he let me know which afternoon next week works. No respose. Do I call again?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-23 07:34:13	Watching Glee reminds me how long it's been since I rocked a karaoke mic like a vandal. Too long.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-23 07:20:17	Never give up everything, especially yourself, to be with someone. Cuz when it's over, you might not get anything back.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-23 05:46:07	Survived a whole day w/o lidocaine, just tramadol, ibuprofin, and klonopin. Not sure which is preferable.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-22 09:33:48	So THAT's my problem http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2013/11/so-tha ts-my-problem.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-22 06:49:44	Angry fucking mood. Fucking fed up with my stupid job and my stupid life. Nothing to do but wait for it to pass.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-21 09:42:58	Depressed therapist wearing pretty big shoes http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2013/11/depres sed-therapist-wearing-pretty-big.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-21 09:18:44	I cannot overemphasize how repulsive I find mustaches. Really, really find them ugly and nauseating on almost everyone.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-21 06:46:35	Interview went well: like the agency & the job description, & the salary/benefits/conditions are acceptable. Waiting for round 2.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-21 06:35:38	Before you jump on me 4 judging, remember I don't have my cane chair & had to stand more than usual today. Knees hurt and I'm rather testy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-21 06:34:54	Left him a note asking to tell the p.m. shift where cane is. Great opportunity 2 practice being nice & pleasant to idiot incompetents.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-21 06:33:30	Went to the post office. A.m. shift didn't tell p.m. shift I was coming, & apparently they don't have a "lost and found." Going back 2morrow
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-20 07:09:29	Maybe it's not such a tragedy that I never had children. Maybe I couldn't have handled it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-20 07:08:11	Feels so relaxing to just go to work and go home, and not have to go on an interview. Recharging mental batteries for tomorrow's long day.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-19 08:40:04	I give you my resume. I give you my references. I'll give you a writing sample. I'm not filling out any fucking application.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-19 08:39:45	Also, they expect me to fill out an application. Dafuck? I have 2 master's and my LCSW: I am not filling out any fucking applications.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-19 08:39:15	Did not enjoy today's interview. Got a very weird vibe. They kept asking questions about why my current job is structured as it is.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-18 10:17:33	Hope the knees can handle 3 job interviews this week. Using the #apostherapy shoes is getting less painful, which is good.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-17 09:38:20	He wants to know if we're sexually compatible. I'm pretty sure we could be, I want to know if we're emotionally compatible.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-17 09:37:25	VBI keeps asking about sex. I don't think this is going to go anywhere serious. I could so easily talk sex w/him, but I don't want to.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-17 07:55:55	"Nice to hear from you. Hope the weather is good in Brussels. I assume you're not just there to try the chocolate ;) Do you have Skype?"
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-17 07:53:03	I guess he's a very busy Israeli, so his name will be VBI for now
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-17 07:52:18	What should I write back? "Can't wait to try the chocolates you're going to bring me"?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-17 07:52:00	Latest note from the Israeli: "email will be much better! my email is x@gmail.com I am in Brussels now for 2 weeks, lets talk via email"
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-17 07:20:23	Used the devices, iced the knees, and hardly any discomfort. Maybe I'm getting good at this. Now what to wear at my interviews next week?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-17 03:39:53	Went to bed with significant knee discomfort, but when I woke up it wasn't so bad. Hopeful that this is a sign of progress, not painkillers.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-16 22:10:44	My mother suffered growing up. That didn't give her the right to ruin my life.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-16 05:06:09	At least I managed to get through the day without a major meltdown.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-16 05:02:01	Rotten, rotten, rotten, rotten mood. Didn't get to call former prof because I was sick Weds/Thurs. Guess I'll try next week.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-16 05:01:35	& I'm not at all sure the PT is helping. Come home, put on the shoes, & the pain begins. Not happy. Sick of the knee pain.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-16 05:00:41	Israeli hasn't responded. Asshole. So fucking sick of dating.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-16 05:00:08	Hope that what I wear won't determine the outcome of the interview. Because it's HOT where I have to work; I can't wear fancy clothes.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-16 04:59:37	3 job interviews next week. Difficult to wear interview clothes to work as I am stuck in a small OVERHEATED room all day.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-14 22:55:05	Struggling. Still thrown off by too much light box. Taking it minute by minute.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-14 03:54:38	Must have used light box too long yesterday. Today was one long horrible jangle of nerves. Hoping for calm tomorrow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-13 09:43:02	Tired of dating. The real rat race. I should know, I've dated all the rats. Or maybe there are a million more rats I have to wade through.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-13 09:42:27	Israeli hasn't called. Disappointed. He touched my cheek when we said goodnight, and I hugged him. But he didn't walk me home.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-13 08:28:40	Still trying to connect w/former prof. She emailed me. Appreciated the condolence card ;) Hope we'll talk tomorrow or next day.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-12 09:03:58	and ohhhhh the knees hurt. talked to my physical therapist today. apparently WHERE the knees now hurt is good - progress. but still hurts.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-12 09:02:38	We have enough in common for a second, less time-sensitive date, so that's good.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-12 09:02:17	Don't ask how he guessed. I certainly didn't plan to tell him. He was an officer in the IDF - must have learned interrogation tactics.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-12 09:01:45	But still attracted to me, and not put off by anything I've told him or he's guessed (including my diagnosis).
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-12 09:01:21	He wants to get together again when we're not rushed (my early bedtime, his important presentation tomorrow). He was a bit distracted tonite
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-12 09:00:35	At least he thinks I'm attractive, unlike the past few dates I've been on, where I could sense their palpable disinterest.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-12 09:00:00	Good listener. Reasonably attractive. Extremely matteroffact/blunt/straightforward. Efficient, I suppose. Not much seems to faze him.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-12 08:59:23	Not a bad first date, albeit a quick one. But that gives me time to ice my knees before bed. Seems like a nice guy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-11 09:45:19	Lay on acutorture mat for 35 minutes. Felt every point. Back is burning now. I better sleep well after all this pain.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-10 09:27:17	Got a date w/extremely smart & blunt Israeli. Might be just what I need. Or another disappointment. Who knows?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-10 06:24:28	Miss my nieces&nephew. Their stepmom is very pregnant, I can't ask for another visit. Feeling sad.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-09 06:47:55	Seriously: in this day and age, is it still taboo to ask about salary range? Because I'm not putting my shoes on for just pennies.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-09 06:46:26	I can be almost anywhere in the city by 4pm. If you need me to take off work to interview, I'm entitled to ask about salary range.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-08 06:10:19	@ExpressScripts YOU ARE IDIOTS I NEVER HAD THESE PROBLEMS WITH MEDCO YOU FUCKING SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-08 06:09:01	@ExpressScripts I have called SIX times in the past 3 weeks and you STILL can't get my meds to me in time! I was very clear each time!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-08 06:04:17	Have another interview 11/18 and will hopefully schedule another before then.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-08 06:03:56	On the bright side, interview went fairly well. But it will be a long process, so my dramatic storm-out giving notice will have to wait.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-08 06:03:18	on phone AGAIN w/stupid fucking pharmacy. fucking FUCK. 6 fucking calls in 3 weeks. so fucking SICK of being sick & dependent on meds
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-07 09:14:56	Knees. OUCH. OUCH. OUCH.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-07 09:13:57	Flu shot. OUCH. itch.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-07 06:28:05	Big job interview tomorrow, could include acupuncture which is my DREAM. Will probably pop a Vitamin K tonight to guarantee some sleep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-07 05:58:52	So damn tired. Was cranky all day. Can't afford another depression- trying so hard to find a new job.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-07 05:55:33	My OKCupid "stalker" apologized. Which I appreciate :)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-06 11:56:55	can't sleep despite acutorture mat, melatonin, medication. very frustrated. 2 days after Daylight Savings & I'm already messed up.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-06 09:28:04	I don't know why I'm so afraid of pain. I've lived through so much of it. You'd think I'd be used to it already.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-06 09:26:43	oh the knees hurt... rly hope they don't hurt tomorrow, although at least I don't have to cover a group
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-06 09:12:01	@social_brains Is bigger always better?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-06 06:43:33	Was excited & walked around w/cordless in my #apostherapy gear. Now knees hurt. Drat. Iced & took some painkillers.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-06 06:43:00	Nice of her to call, tho. Professional courtesy I guess-I sent transfer request 2 HR & they sent her my resume, not realizing it's not a fit
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-06 06:42:11	1 called to say I'm extremely qualified, but not for the position, which involves working with children ages 0-3. I work with adults.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-06 06:41:41	1 recruiter of 5 called while I was on the phone with another of 'em. Have spoken to 3. 1 needs to check calendars 4 good interview date.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-06 05:33:24	Not a single idiot last-minute 'vote-for' robocall. Two reasons to smile :D
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-06 05:32:50	Election Day. Came home to 5 voicemails: from RECRUITERS, BITCHEZ!!!! Calling to set up INTERVIEWS!!!! I am one badass social worker.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-05 09:59:47	Having a shitty life doesn't give you the right to treat others like shit- when you do that, it kinda explains your shitty life
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-05 09:45:40	Betrayal from a friend I helped a TON: stings. But as Mother Theresa would have said, "Help people anyway."
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-05 09:39:02	Wonder if I'll ever find a psychiatrist who can manage light therapy as well as medications.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-05 09:38:44	Using the acutorture mat is much more painful when I'm menstruating. Water retention, I guess.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-05 08:42:29	There are bad places to work, better places to work, but are there any really great places to work? Am I a fool for hoping there are?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-04 11:22:48	Although I did get MIGHTY angry at the insurance company over the problems with my prescriptions. Enraged, furious, livid.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-04 11:22:13	On the bright side, I should be having seriously bad PMS right now, and this month it's not hitting as hard.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-04 11:21:49	I hate daylight savings. Can't sleep, and tomorrow when the alarm blares at 5:45am & I leave at 6:10am, it will be pitch black outside.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-04 00:56:07	Some nerve http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2013/11/some-n erve.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-03 13:13:01	Went on Jwed, got email from an unattractive 55yo w/a high school diploma. Where are the professional men in their 40s who would want me?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-03 05:33:47	I don't think my pictures are too sexy. So what about my profile says "use me for sex, young man!"?????????
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-03 05:18:30	In 2 days got THREE emails from 20/30somethings on OKCupid. Nothing REMOTELY sexy in my profile essays. What am I doing WRONG?

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-02 04:39:57	This has been a fucking pain in the ass. Seriously pissed at the long-term pharmacy, the local pharmacy, and the insurer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-02 04:39:19	Had to call insurance, which gave me a #for pharmacy to call, & then spent 15 minutes on hold trying to reach pharmacy again to give the #
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-02 04:38:31	Fucking FUCK. Called pharmacy to deliver emergency meds and was told the insurance didn't pay. After I was PROMISED yesterday they would!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 08:08:40	PLEASE do not try to find me on OKCupid. It only creeps me out when you do. Just please DON'T.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 08:08:12	I can't understand or relate to a woman who describes herself as having "my parrot son, Kyle." Seriously?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 05:03:31	I'm sick of being so sick and being in so much pain. Fucking fucking sick of it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 05:03:16	Fucking sick of all this shit. I've missed 3 days of work this month - 2 because of the lithium and 1 because of the physical therapy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 05:02:25	But shit like this reminds me how alone I am. Esp. when idiots @the mailorder pharmacy keep callin me "Mrs." after I say "Miss" THREE times
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 05:01:24	Grateful, at least, that this didn't happen BEFORE the LCSW exam.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 05:00:57	After ANOTHER call to the mail-order pharmacy and ANOTHER call to Dr. Roda, it seems everything will be taken care of well enough.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 04:36:51	SO. FUCKING. FRUSTRATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GODDAMNIT. AND I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS ALL ALONE. FUCKING FUCK.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 04:36:24	BUT WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO WHEN I CAN'T REACH HIM BECAUSE HIS LINE IS BUSY?????????
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 04:36:07	SERIOUSLY FUCKING FURIOUS WITH MY ASSHOLE PSYCHIATRIST. AS SOON AS THIS IS OVER I AM DEFINITELY FINDING A NEW SHRINK.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 04:35:39	I also need an emergency supply because I AM RUNNING OUT OF THE MEDICATION. AND HIS PHONE IS BUSY. I CAN'T GET THROUGH.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 04:35:18	They can't send my old Remeron generic because it's not available from manufacturer so Dr. Asshole has to call in a new Rx.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-11-01 04:34:54	GOING THROUGH ABSOLUTE FUCKING HELL WITH MY LONGTERM PHARMACY AND ASSHOLE PSYCHIATRIST.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-31 09:27:19	Worse than nobody liking you is the wrong person or people liking you. Frustrating as fuck-all.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-31 05:12:56	@natasha_tracy The world's most expensive doorstop.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-31 05:06:13	LCSW. FINALLY. Hopefully my golden ticket out of hell.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-30 18:38:41	Soon it will be over. I will pass, I will get my LCSW. Soon it will be over.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-30 17:42:18	Slept well. Eating breakfast. Staying calm.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-30 06:26:00	Grateful for my excellent mind, even though it's produced by a defective brain. Just need to keep thinking "Don't Rain on My Parade."
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-30 06:25:29	Feeling grateful for the love & support of my friends. My life could easily be so much worse.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-30 05:55:27	Wish I had someone to hold & comfort me. This is when being single is so hard to survive. When you need warmth and touch & don't have any.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-30 05:54:14	Diffusing lavender oil, to reduce anxiety and promote good sleep. I'm going to sleep well, have a good breakfast, and CLOBBER that exam!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-30 05:35:20	NERVOUS. Want this to be over, taken, passed. But I'm visualizing success.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-30 05:35:03	Laid out comfy clothes. Planning tomorrow's breakfast. Will have one more study session right before I go to sleep for best retention.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-30 04:45:07	Wish me luck! And minimal pain! And tranquility, and concentration, and memory, and clear thinking!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-30 04:43:53	LCSW exam tomorrow at 8am. Starting to get nervous, but also printed out my resume with LCSW on it for a transfer request...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-29 22:35:16	Couldnt sleep. Very bad pain. Sent bunch of emails & called out. Don't care if they think I'm malingering, test tomorrow is too important.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-29 15:10:37	Still can't sleep. Don't want to call in sick, but if I feel really exhausted when the alarm goes off, I will. The test is too important.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-29 13:58:28	Insomnia. Not sure if I forgot one of my meds. NOT good, I have a busy day tomorrow and I'm taking the LCSW soon. Drat.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-29 05:14:46	Sick of the stupid little bitches without licenses who go out their way to make trouble for me because they don't want to do the job right
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-29 05:11:44	Have to hope, cuz HATE where I work. No office. No voicemail. Blistering heat in the room where I work.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-29 05:11:01	So today I sent the new connection my nice little networking beg letter. Haven't heard back yet, but hopeful.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-29 05:10:30	Is sending former prof a condolence card sucking up? Also, a person from the institute spontaneously connected w/me on LinkedIn.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-29 05:10:05	Prof is going to visit the dept where I applied and ask a few questions and drop my name. Profoundly grateful.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-29 05:09:33	FINALLY got former prof on the phone. Her mom just died :( She goes to the institute where I applied 1x/wk.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-28 04:42:20	Rotten week, foul mood. Watching "The Trojan Women" hoping it'll cheer me up.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-27 22:22:57	Took & passed practice LCSW exam. Time to schedule.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-24 03:32:15	I have time to go for a manicure, but it's cold out and my knees hurt. Not sure if that's depressed or just not manic.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-24 03:31:41	Whatever. I'm going to do my nails. I guess I'll take the practice test this weekend.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-24 03:31:22	ASWB makes you register 4 the test b4 buying official practice test. But u have 2 wait 2 days AFTER registering 2 buy practice test! SMDH
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-24 02:14:01	Didn't sleep well last night, not sure why. Wasn't the pain, as that was bearable. I'll probably lie on the acutorture mat tonight.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-24 02:13:25	If I pass I'll schedule the real thing. If not, I'll go to a few more review classes. Because once I have it - watch out New York!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-24 02:12:58	Grateful that I'm back on the right generic. Grateful that I can relax a little and then take a practice LCSW exam. Hope I pass it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-24 02:12:20	Cold damp day, the kind you REALLY feel in your knees. Grateful for central heating, moderate painkillers and take-out delivery.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-23 09:01:32	Although, OW. I don't want anyone to think this is a painless process. Why doesn't pain burn more calories? I'd be a STICK.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-23 09:01:07	Interesting that I fall asleep with knee pain but wake up without it. Hopeful sign, I think. Usually it's the other way around.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-23 08:50:26	I'm using the #Apostherapy shoes every day, and icing my knees. Can't wait until I can actually walk more than around my studio in them.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-23 08:49:59	I bought some pricey Açaí berry whitening toothpaste, but I'm not seeing amazing results. Maybe I expected too much.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-23 04:19:56	No sleep last night; not sure why. Can't decide whether to nap or eat my weight in cupcakes.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-22 08:12:44	Getting used to walking around my studio in the #apostherapy shoes, but really want to walk in Central Park. For hours. Like I used to.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-22 05:09:03	Or follow my example, for that matter. If I'm an expert on anything, it's not dating.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-22 05:08:43	Am now being followed by @PTSDDating . Please don't use my misadventures as proof that true love doesn't exist.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-22 04:46:52	feel like a billion times better on the correct generic medication - amazing the difference. almost feel normal, or as normal as I get.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-21 03:04:29	Weird and twitchy. A bad date is worse than no date.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-21 01:32:08	#ChrisColfer . Now I'm smilling. Off to lunch.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-21 01:00:37	Listening to cheery music, trying to cheer myself up. Never realized so many of the tunes I love are in a minor key.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-21 00:51:45	I appreciate being set up, but am just not excited about dating anymore. I can't imagine anyone who could make me happy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-20 19:12:05	Feeling more or less normal. Finally. Relieved. Stupid generics, stupid mail-order pharmacy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-19 23:54:47	And just spilled a huge bowl of oatmeal all over my desk. Nothing destroyed but a bunch of important papers need to dry out.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-19 23:54:20	Not feeling much like he's doing much for me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-19 23:54:08	Roda had his secretary call in the prescription change. I thought doctors were supposed to do that kind of stuff in emergencies.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-19 22:49:00	Amazing to think more clearly and not feel like my arms are concrete noodles.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-19 22:48:42	Unless of course I see my dream job - but nobody (including former prof) got back to me on that one.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-19 22:48:23	Hope I'm 100% by Monday, because I've got a hell of a lot of work to do. Cutting back on job applications till I take the LCSW.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-19 22:47:47	I slept a lot. I thought that would be the best way to let my system rebalance. I think I was right -- I do feel better.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-19 22:46:33	Lithium is processed through the kidneys, lidocaine through the liver. Why do they interact and augment each other?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-19 21:41:53	taking the old generic, starting to feel more normal. Relief.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-18 04:43:08	I don't expect life to be easy, but when will it be less impossible? Tired of so many bad things happening, accidents and illness.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-18 04:42:38	can't catch a break. sick all day. can't study for LCSW. prof never called me back, jsut as well because I'm too sick to talk.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-17 09:31:39	I must have seemed very dubious when he dropped me off. I was tired & confused. Whatever. He did seem kind and nonjudgmental... :(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-17 09:31:12	No call from the areligious guy I dated on Monday. Tried to call, he didn't answer. Guess I should be relieved.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-17 05:04:04	Less anxious. So freaking tired. I think I need a new psychiatrist.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-16 07:06:09	Life was easy and happy. And then it wasn't. Wonder if it's really just the meds. Inclined to think that's a big factor.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-16 04:01:56	struggled through the day. miserable bus ride home. I had a few weeks of happy productivity, can't believe it's over.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-14 03:56:35	more and more this feels like lithium toxicity -- weakness, increased urination, mental fogginess
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-14 01:23:54	I take two generic medications. Pharmacy switched both recently. Is that why I feel so off? so weak? like my arms are concrete noodles?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-14 00:49:55	just feel so WEAK... I assume it's depression. could it be something else?

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-09 07:03:28	I guess I'm learning, but I hope this doesn't mean this VERY EXPENSIVE new therapy won't work but will get me fired for absenteeism.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-09 07:02:58	hate missing ANOTHER day of work, but had no choice. couldn't even stand after taking painkillers. slept all day w/Klonopin.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-07 05:49:36	FB friends are great, but nothing beats meeting up w/friends IRL. Thankful I have so many that live so close to me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-07 04:02:21	I should probably stop thinking about it. It's a gray day, but I got out for a bit, and I'm in no immediate peril. Just wistful.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-07 04:01:40	Wistful. That is how I feel right now. But I don't know why. What am I wistful for?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-07 04:01:16	"Melancholic" has different connotations. It denotes extreme depression clinically, but in layman's terms suggests gentle, wistful sadness.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-07 04:00:18	No, I'm sad. Definitely sad. Sort of. Don't know why. Not miserable, not upset, not devastated, just sad. Can't think of a better adjective.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-10-07 03:58:18	I don't know how I feel. Don't know if I'm happy or sad. Kind of neutral. Which I guess is better than angry or sad.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-09-30 06:36:22	Trying to practice yoga nidra again- meditation is good for sleep, pain, mood, and everything else.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-09-29 04:09:13	Because spending time w/men means spending more time without them & obsessing & wondering & ruminating - all very bad for me
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-09-29 04:07:38	Just do things with friends, fix the knees, get my LCSW and get a better job. Forget men, forget sex. Too emotionally draining.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-09-29 04:06:16	Men & sex are bad for my mental health. Need to learn this, memorize it, tattoo it on my forearm. NO MEN NO SEX ANYMORE.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-09-29 03:51:33	Need to stay balanced, calm, grounded. Can't let myself fall prey to anxiety. Need to start meditating again.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-09-29 02:51:20	I was happy. For 2 months. Want to go back to that, but I can't. Can't stand the knee pain any more. No hope.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-09-24 04:21:54	Although the pain was bearable while I was at work, so today really could've been much worse. But I did want to go to that benefit...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-09-24 04:21:24	Forgot to bring lidocaine patches to work. Was supposed to go to a benefit tonight. Don't think I can. Too much pain. Sux.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-09-08 07:02:09	Osteopath thinks the personal trainer stretched out my ligaments so that my knees aren't aligned properly. Could be the case.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-24 03:39:18	I survived. I learned. Almost all my counselors love me. Things could be much, much worse.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 17:29:18	@PsychologyNow Because therapists aren't using evidence-based practices.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 17:28:10	What I don't have is a good night's sleep, unfortunately.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 15:14:54	Most of my counselors love & respect me. That is all that matters. I'm a good supervisor & awesome social worker.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 15:14:31	Good morning, terminal insomnia/knee pain. Strangely calm. Everyone says 1writeup = no big deal. Just need to be careful for 6 months after.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 15:13:00	@21Hastings Just one. But I'll be fine. It's scheduled for 1pm, and I get to go home right after, so that's somethin' ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 10:00:44	Went to dermatologist for my annual mole check. Dr. tried to sell me on botox. Bitch please. Save that for your ugly patients.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 08:58:31	Would LOVE to be able to walk for more than a few minutes without pain. I used to walk for HOURS.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 08:56:32	Ohh the knees hurt. Bad. I made an appointment to learn about Apostherapy. Supposedly they can make me shoes that will let me walk w/o pain.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 08:53:27	@PsychologyNow And we're supposed to shield children from every possible stress so they'll never learn coping skills? Or history?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 08:49:05	Counselors who don't want to change how they do their job- & don't care about OASAS standards- are fighting me. & coddled by clinic mgr.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 08:41:54	I know I don't deserve a writeup because my counselors told me I'm the best social worker they've ever had. Most of the counselors.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-23 08:37:13	Knees hurt. Another damn meeting with the evil administrators, probably for a writeup I don't deserve. How do I know that?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-22 07:32:25	I should be writing. I want to be sleeping. Too early to go to bed, I won't get a full night's sleep. Slumped.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 14:43:45	@StillCarolinda @Bipolar_Blogs But after surgery - REALLY need to ask why he never suggested lowering my lithium dosage.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 14:43:25	@StillCarolinda @Bipolar_Blogs I definitely need to talk to my doc. I'm having surgery soon, so switching now might not be the best idea.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 14:36:20	Really needed to take yesterday off.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 14:36:07	Terminal insomnia AGAIN. Despite calcium supplement & Vitamin K. But the pervasive body ache is gone, so I'll go in to work & function.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 10:03:58	@StillCarolinda @Bipolar_Blogs I know. I've been MISERABLE for years, & he didn't ever want to change my meds. Thinking about changing HIM.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 09:55:56	@ayelet_survivor Back in the day, I would have tried to get him to kiss me or something. I didn't this time. Finally learning.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 09:54:18	He wanted me to friend him, so I sent him a friend request. He accepted. Ball's in his court...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 09:43:24	@MJTKPsychology also, my sleep gets deranged by work stress and daylight savings time - it's not a choice :(

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 09:20:02	@StillCarolinda @Bipolar_Blogs It's tough to balance. I'm realizing I've been on too high a lithium dosage for YEARS b/c I'm on 2 ADs.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 09:19:27	For the record, we were ONLY TALKING.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 09:17:46	Had a great time @the party. So glad I went. Got a ride home, he didn't want to let me out of the car, but I think he's too young.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 04:13:16	@MJTKPsychology Definitely! Good advice for either gender ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-21 04:12:49	@MJTKPsychology Not if they're in a supervisory position over me;) Also, it's more effective to "fake it" sometimes to accomplish your goals

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-20 15:25:59	Fuckwits down at administration have no idea how to manage people. It's like they want all the social workers to die or quit.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-20 14:51:14	@DrPhil u still owe me & every person living w/mental illness an apology for your "suck rocks & bark at the moon" slur
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-20 14:17:30	Work stress is very bad for my sleep. Not happy. Like they're trying to make me miserable so I'll be too afraid to quit.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-20 08:59:53	@PsychNews Because it destroys your confidence, and you never believe anyone can really like or respect you.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-20 08:58:56	Give without thinking about what you'll get, and you'll get more than you can imagine. Or you'll burn out and die.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-19 03:18:44	Nervous about the party. But not anxious. Blessed difference.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-19 02:06:44	Going to a party. Just to see my friend & have fun - not to meet a husband. What a difference less lithium makes ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-19 02:06:03	Enjoyed the simple pleasure of wandering thru a flea market, not kept at home by depression or knee pain. Got some bargains too!

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 14:20:33	Up at 2am agin. Sigh. Work stress. Hope I sleep Friday night. At least I have fun plans for Saturday and Sunday.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 07:35:56	Rheumatologist called. Insurer still not willing to cover surgery. It might be postponed. On top of everything else, I don't need this.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 06:50:00	Meeting with administration tomorrow. At least this time I'll actually have a delegate, although I still don't know what it's about.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 06:48:57	You know you've made it on LinkedIn when people start emailing you asking for favors ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 06:09:43	So far, I'm not hypomanic. I'm just exuberant and managing my life.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 06:09:24	Have not been having sex with strangers, or friends for that matter. What I do in my own home w/a vibrator and @JamesDeen is - reasonable.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 06:08:07	Been shopping a lot but not SPENDING a lot. I'll pore over a makeup store for an hour & buy a lipstick for $1. My bills are paid. No debt.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 06:07:21	1 symptom of hypomania is "excessive involvement in pleasurable activities" - shopping, sex, food, etc.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:59:14	Still a bit sad that I won't have children, but I'm important to my nieces & nephew, and I will make more of an effort to be in their lives.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:58:29	Organize & fix up my apartment. Get a cat. Make a nice life for myself no matter my marital status.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:57:54	I almost don't recognize myself. But this is who I want to be. I see how I'll progress- get my LCSW and CASAC, then a better job.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:57:21	I'm not hypomanic. I'm just productive, creative, effective, efficient, hilarious, empathetic, vivacious, solution-oriented. And... happy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:56:24	Life is working out. Want to go to a party to see friends, not to meet a husband. Feeling like that's enough of a reason to leave the house.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:55:36	Not simple or oversimplified. But I just think of the right intervention for a patient or the right way to organize my shower & it works.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:55:02	I'm productive & efficient. I'm in control. I make people happy. I solve problems @home & work, & everything is so EASY.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:54:24	Is this the person I was always supposed to be? Are the seething neurochemicals in my brain finally balanced? Am I naturally exuberant?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:53:17	I'm happy- but not TOO happy. Gone is the simmering resentment anger bitterness envy. I'm content with my life for the first time in- ever?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:50:26	I make people laugh. Give sincere compliments they seem to appreciate. Why don't I trust that they actually like me?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:49:53	Although I was moderately productive at work. I supervised counselors all over the place, met with a few patients, signed a bunch of charts.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-16 04:49:06	I should blog. I should be productive. I haven't slept well in a week. How do parents of infants manage?

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-15 05:05:28	So happy, so productive, so efficient, so creative, so hilarious (judging by the laughs I'm generating in others). So afraid I'm hypomanic.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-15 04:40:21	Just happy. Worked hard, played hard, and shopped strategically. It's been a great day.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-14 07:59:11	The problem is, they say he's in love with me - but they won't tell me his name. Now i have to ask all counselors if he's on their caseload.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-14 07:58:42	2day in group the patients told me there's a patient who was hit by a car and now sees dead souls in Purgatory. But that's not the problem.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-13 08:20:34	they only do real tattoos but they also do piercings, and I was thinking, "Nipple? Navel?" Or maybe I should just get a toe ring.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-13 08:19:57	If I got my nipple pierced, which nipple should I pierce? Left or right? I went into a tattoo parlor to see if they do temporary tattoos and

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-12 09:22:29	I was happy for most of today. Even with the threat of Tuesday doom hanging over me. I didn't let it stop me or spoil my day.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-11 19:41:03	My nephew Oedipus put up his first "real" FB profile pic. He's sitting on my lap, w/his sisters standing next to us.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-11 18:45:41	I will not get depressed. I will cope with anxiety. I will not enter a mixed state. However, I probably should rein in the online shopping.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-11 18:44:01	I am not going to let work stress send me into a tailspin. I will not decompensate because they're harassing me. I will stay healthy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-11 18:39:26	Wrote up a 16-pg document of all the shit management has tried to fuck me with. Ready to share it w/my union repS.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-11 16:14:56	Woke up again @3am. Another anxiety attack. Angry at supervisor & administration. Starting to prepare for meeting w/union rep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-11 08:59:48	Had lunch w/good friends. Feeling happy. Hope that means I sleep through the night.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-11 05:56:02	@21Hastings He sure is. So's my supervisor. And clinical director. But I'm okay. I updated my resume & LinkedIn profile ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-11 00:42:45	@LittleMsHaldol @electroboyusa I do both ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 23:17:43	@electroboyusa Well, that sounds therapeutic.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 21:33:09	Hey, supervisor, clnic manager, and clinical director: http://www. youtube.com/watch?v=mqs05V LlHB8 …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 21:31:36	Don't get mad --update your resume and LinkedIn profile.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 20:45:33	@electroboyusa @pete1169 @douglasbeckham @AlexSterling291 Cuz 4x/day sounds like a low-ball estimate.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 20:45:18	@electroboyusa @pete1169 @douglasbeckham @AlexSterling291 To masturbate or to admit that they masturbate?

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 15:17:00	3am. Woke up again w/anxiety attack. So pissed at supervisor, clinical director, clinic manager. But I won't let them destroy me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 07:37:51	When I compare it to my last job or The Bad Place, I am so much better off. I have protection and support, and I'm in the right.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 07:35:45	I'm proud of myself. Not losing control, not lashing out, not decompensating and not raging. Grace under pressure.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 07:33:31	Not just my opinion. The other clinic manager, union reps, and most colleagues agree I'm doing a FANTASTIC job, and for that I'm harassed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 07:32:25	I'm most proud of the fact that this whole imbroglio at work is the fault of my supervisor & a clinic manager - and NOT ME. AT ALL.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 07:32:00	Haven't heard back from my jailed former client's attorney. I'll call him on Monday.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 07:29:37	One rep to help me in the clinic, another to accompany to my meeting at downtown HQ. I have an entourage!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 07:28:18	Twice the idiots from management have browbeaten me (illegally) in meetings w/o a union rep. So relieved I have TWO reps helping me now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 07:24:52	Harassment @this job isn't as bad as @the last, cuz I have colleagues who not only support me but can actually FIGHT for me. Luv my union.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 03:45:14	@21Hastings But 99% of my colleagues love & believe in me, respect me & support me, so I'm so much better off than I could be.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 03:44:50	Reply to @21Hastings They don't have a leg to stand on - I haven't done ANYTHING wrong - but it's still stressful and irritating.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-10 03:44:18	@21Hastings I don't do passiveaggressive. & it's moot; they beat me to it & told me to come in next Tues. w/a unionrep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 16:54:33	Woke up @2am w/anxiety attack. Fucking pissed @supervisor & clinic manager. Definitely going to take my union rep to a meeting with them.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 08:21:30	I really should Skype more, but then I'd have to put a shirt on. Doesn't everyone sit around in their undies when home alone?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 08:20:41	Want to blog about everything that's happened, but I'm so drained from all the emotions that rampaged through me today. Maybe this weekend.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 08:19:53	Facebook friends aren't a substitute for friends IRL, but they're a damn fine adjunct.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 08:19:32	So many dear FB friends I can tell anything, who accept me unconditionally and love me, yet I've never heard their voices.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 08:09:41	@MelodyMoezzi A f/t writer? You are all kinds of awesome! As a clinical social worker, I fear how my coworkers and patients would judge me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 07:51:00	1,410 LinkedIn connections. Today Manhattan, tomorrow THE WORLD!!!!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 07:48:49	@JeffreyGuterman I've seen many people addicted to marijuana whose lives became unmanageable. So we can't just legalize it like tobacco.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 07:48:10	@JeffreyGuterman Weed could be a powerful medicine, but I still think it should be a controlled substance, like Percocet or Klonopin.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 07:45:52	@DrJlieberman @APAPsychiatric @MelodyMoezzi Maybe someday I'll have the same courage to "come out" as a mental health clinician with bipolar
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 07:43:39	Now I just need a system to organize my hair accessories in the bathroom, so I can access them very quickly in the very early a.m.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 07:42:59	Bought the bathtub adhesives (cherries, not ducks) and a hook for my shower cap. I like taking care of my home.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 07:41:58	@DrJlieberman @APAPsychiatric @MelodyMoezzi And I admire your courage for showing your face to the world as a COMPETENT person with bipolar.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 07:41:21	@DrJlieberman @APAPsychiatric @MelodyMoezzi Melody, I've read your work. As a clinical social worker with bipolar d/o, I totally identified.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 06:43:15	Cool shower w/nice lavender salt scrub in soothing oils. I need to get some adhesive ducks for my bathtub, but it was still relaxing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 06:42:42	Too worked up even to watch TV. From my crazy day of comforting seizing patients and ambush meetings with management. What did I do?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 06:41:48	@JeffreyGuterman @ABC She could hold her liquor and throw a punch.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 06:02:45	I have a LONG list of her inappropriate, threatening, intimidating words & actions. And I'm not afraid to show it to her supervisor.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 06:02:16	My supervisor's incompetent & blames her shortcomings on me. Fuck that. I'm tired of her getting in the way of me doing what needs doing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 06:01:36	Then had a meeting w/3 members of management aligned against me alone. Held my own but my union rep & I are going to file a formal complaint
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 06:00:25	Patient had a seizure in clinic today. I knelt by him and patted him, trying to keep him calm and still, murmuring 'calmate papito, calmate'
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 05:32:56	@JeffreyGuterman Must be why I enjoy shopping online more than actually receiving the deliveries ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 05:32:16	@JeffreyGuterman Who gets to decide whether you're wrong? A ton of German clinicians proved that it's not always easy to determine.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 05:31:14	@JeffreyGuterman So true! Makes them feel competent and powerful, and who doesn't like that feeling?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 05:30:24	@JeffreyGuterman Another shining example of the excellence of German psychiatry.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 05:26:09	Jailed former client's attorney called. They have court tomorrow. He'll ask the client if he wants me to visit him on Riker's.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 03:56:39	Spoke to Dr.Kind. He & Dr.Sharp are appealing to my insurance to cover surgery, & they're optimistic. High hopes...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-09 03:55:44	@21Hastings Definitely exciting. Also very sad. A good learning experience. Still waiting to talk to his attorney, we're playing phone tag.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-08 06:21:29	Her incompetence almost killed me. She's never even apologized. So let her suffer. She deserves much worse.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-08 06:20:36	@SJRaphael @JinkxMonsoon I love you for loving Jinkx, Sally J!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-08 06:19:37	Won't even call Dr.Incompetent back. Let her stew. She should stop Googling herself incessantly. Or Google with " -ayelet "
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-08 06:18:51	Talked2 lawyerfriend. Dr.Incompetent's real name isn't on my blog. No way to prove I'm referring 2 her. Don't need to do anything. & I won't
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-08 04:28:52	It can't be a gynecological problem because I've been EXHAUSTIVELY examined recently and everything was fine.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-08 04:28:33	Lot of pain today, in kind of a strange place. Not just my lower back, my pelvis. Told my chiropractor and she did something. Hope it works.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-08 04:27:15	Just read that a client of mine at my former job was arrested for murder. Wonder if I should try to visit him on Rikers.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-08 04:26:59	One cup of coffee + one cup of ginger peach green tea = one happy Ayelet. Hopefully not too happy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-08 04:26:09	@21Hastings True. But I don't feel like taking down my blog post without some kind of incentive.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-07 08:53:13	Of course statute of limitations has probably run out. But why should I cave to her request? At the least I deserve a REFUND + interest.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-07 08:52:42	She failed to recommend appropriate level of care. Incompetence or malpractice, and there's legal precedent to sue: http://www. psychiatrictimes.com/all/editorial/ psychiatrictimes/pdfs/osheroff-chestnut-lodge.pdf …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-07 08:50:39	Confidentiality means Dr.Incompetent can't reveal my name. If she does, she could lose her license.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-07 08:50:11	Dr.Incompetent says my Google bomb 'feels really disturbing to me.' Try waking up from a coma tied to a hospital bed, bitch.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-07 04:07:46	Should I take down the post about Dr. Incompetent? Will that FINALLY remove it from her Google results?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-06 09:15:53	Also been shopping more (not too much) online, but it's my only recreation, given my homebound state after I peel off the patches.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-06 09:15:23	Been cleaning more on the lower lithium dosage. Wonder if I should stay on this dose, even though my levels aren't in the clinical range.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-05 13:53:38	Trouble falling/staying asleep. Think the waitress gave me regular coffee, not decaf, at dinner. Drat.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-05 09:17:31	Have started putting castor oil on my hair & eyebrows. Supposed to support growth. I'll let you know if it works.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-05 09:16:20	I need to make an effort to spend time w/my friends, because it makes me so happy when I do.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-05 09:16:01	Had dinner w/a friend 2nite & realized how much I need to get out & see ppl. I see ppl every day at work, but that doesn't count.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-04 23:52:16	Letter from obgyn: fibroids not much bigger, pap smear normal, no STDs. One less thing to worry about.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-04 08:08:06	Ow. Knees hurt, shoulders hurt, every part & all flesh hurts. What if I don't get the surgery? What if I get it & it doesn't work?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-03 05:26:02	Wow. Ridiculously busy day at work. Exhausted. Took normal lithium dose last night, so I'm not overly happy, but not sad either.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-03 04:53:03	@Bipolokayakerr4 @electroboyusa @Bipolar_Blogs Obviously! ;)

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-01 07:42:54	@tikunolam2pt0 Just sent you someone's profile on LinkedIn.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-01 07:31:21	@tikunolam2pt0 Actually, I might. Let me check.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-01 06:51:45	Today I am feeling so content - happy - even blessed - that I wonder if I'm not taking enough lithium. I *never* feel blessed!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-08-01 06:47:05	Amassing many LinkedIn contacts in ex-offender re-entry & veterans, two populations I want to work with, although I'm doing good work here.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-31 08:07:07	A wife dies, a mother dies, and I'm still here http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-wife -dies-mother-dies-and-im-still.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-30 07:24:50	Because if the lidocaine & lithium don't kill me, the pain will. Inevitably. I have NO life at this point. Work & rest, that's it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-30 07:24:09	He'll appeal. I'll hope. Because there's no hope for me without the surgery. I can't live my life like this indefinitely.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-30 07:23:48	Dr.Sharp called. Insurance denied my surgery. Don't they know they'll save $700/month when I stop using the lidocaine patches? Shit.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-29 06:14:00	Or if dating were a good idea right now, which it probably isn't.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-29 06:13:49	Also slightly annoyed that MM didn't call. But I'd be more annoyed if I were more into him.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-29 06:10:40	Did I mention my ass still hurts? Dammit.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-29 06:01:48	There are worse things. Bad marriage is worse than no marriage. Bad father is worse than a father who died too young. Bad back sux, tho.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-29 04:20:23	My butt still hurts from the cane chair fall last week. Not glamorous, but true.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-29 03:49:38	Getting over yesterday's horrible lithotoxicity. Appetite still impaired. Probably not entirely a bad thing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-29 03:48:16	@trevorellestad Thanks for following. Namaste.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-28 19:13:04	Miserable day yesterday. Apparently lithium doesn't mix well with Benadryl. Feeling better now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-28 19:02:55	@PeterLaBarbera @chaim89 @fakedansavage Homosexual isn't an insult. Denying your true nature by attacking those who are like you is.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 09:02:17	Whaddya know - MM called me. Never got my last email. We're going to talk more on Sunday. I didn't screw it up!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 08:58:25	@tikunolam2pt0 @PeterLaBarbera @chaim89 @fakedansavage exactly. reparative therapy can be FATAL.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 08:56:22	@PeteLaBarbera @PeterLaBarbera @chaim89 @fakedansavage "supposed" good is meaningless when there are documented cases of trauma and suicide
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 08:55:46	@PeterLaBarbera @chaim89 @fakedansavage W/o rigorous outcome study comparing harmed vs. helped, you can't claim overall positive effects
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 08:18:18	@PeterLaBarbera @chaim89 @fakedansavage & every reputable mental health organization agrees: reparative therapy HARMS, doesn't HEAL

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 08:16:17	@PeterLaBarbera @chaim89 @fakedansavage That's why practitioners have to be licensed. So that their practice is within recognized guidelines
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 08:15:56	@PeterLaBarbera @chaim89 @fakedansavage And since most parents aren't experts in child development, regulation is critical.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 08:15:34	@PeterLaBarbera @chaim89 @fakedansavage Parents should not be able to consent to therapy that will traumatize their children.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 08:15:10	@PeterLaBarbera @chaim89 @fakedansavage abused by their parents or denied medical treatment (chemotherapy, blood transfusion).
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 08:14:50	@PeterLaBarbera @fakedansavage Because sometimes children like @chaim89 need government to protect them for their parents. Like kids who are
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 08:14:20	@PeterLaBarbera @chaim89 @fakedansavage If you can't prove that a therapy works - or at least does no harm - then government should step in.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-26 08:13:45	@PeterLaBarbera @chaim89 @fakedansavage Pete, can you name any empirical studies that demonstrate reparative therapy works?

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-22 07:42:03	Had great belated birthday lunch w/friend. Tailbone is healing. Renewed lidocaine patch prescription (re-used yesterday's patches today).
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-20 22:39:33	I last filled them on June 20. How the fuck can't I refill them on July 20?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-20 22:39:12	Goddamn fucking asshole insurance fuckheads.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-20 22:38:42	Tried to refill my patch prescription. On my last pair. Pharmacy says, not until tomorrow when they open at 9. Fucking fuck.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-20 03:43:06	Even with the donut pillow, sitting hurts; also sleepy from tramadol. Used more of my about-to-expire vacation time to go home early & nap.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-19 06:53:25	Dammit, he only gave me 15 Percocet. Hope that's enough.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-19 04:56:02	Also got a prescription for Percocet. Hello constipation my old friend... you've come to block my poop again...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-19 04:47:31	Saw a Dr. Diagnosis: bruised tailbone. Got a donut pillow and a new cane seat, and will be VERY careful how I set this one up.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-16 15:47:29	Second night I'm exhausted but can't sleep. Wonder if it's the lower lithium dosage, the knee pain, the subclinical UTI, or all of the above
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-16 12:17:57	Wake up to pee, stay up because of knee pain. Didn't sleep well Sunday night, not sleeping well tonight. OY.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-16 05:26:33	Told a trusted colleague I have bipolar. Such a relief to be able to talk about who & what I really am, & what I learned on the psych ward.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-16 04:22:37	1st day back was OK. Employee Health doc didn't remember me: good sign. Coworkers were either happy 2 see me or convincingly pretended.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-15 14:43:29	woke up WAY too early needing to pee again. UTI or anxiety about going back to work? annoyed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-14 18:42:37	Slept through the night. Woohoo! Finally ready to go back to work!

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-12 19:56:07	Meeting w/Dr. Cool today. Hope hope HOPE he'll give me a letter that excuses my almost 2-wk absence. Finally feeling really better.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-12 05:33:19	But Dr. has helped me out in the past. Really hope he plays ball tomorrow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-12 05:33:04	Urine test results in. See Dr. tomorrow. Hoping 4 UTI diagnosis and antibiotics prescription, and an excuse letter for work. Wee bit nervous
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-12 05:06:49	Really hope it's boredom and cabin fever.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-12 05:06:35	Slowly growing urge to shop.Not sure if it's cabin fever from being home almost 2 wks or the start of hypomania from lithium dose reduction.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-12 03:46:07	Also have 1,070 LinkedIn connections. If I have to start looking for a new job soon, I'll know where to go.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-12 01:47:27	and feeling better, which is the main thing; waiting on utox results to confirm UTI & get antibiotics. how long? however long it takes
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-12 01:46:56	making phone calls & getting the runaround, but I let go of the 8/5/13 surgery date, so I will just let the process take as long as it needs
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-12 01:04:39	Slowly feeling better http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2013/07/slowly -feeling-better.html …

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-11 22:01:26	fortunately I have enough vacation time to cover my absence because I've been feeling too poorly to actually go anywhere & have fun
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-11 22:01:05	got sorta-scary email from boss's boss. responded calmly & factually. doing all I can, waiting for utox results.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 22:52:00	Thank u all 4 ur love, prayers, problem-solving, and support. U r my pit crew, and I am a winning NASCAR driver. Or something like that.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 22:51:09	I am going to take a nap and let sleep continue to heal me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 22:50:57	I have plenty of vacation days to cover this absence, because I never go anywhere or have any fun. That's now coming in handy ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 22:50:33	Then I'll get a prescription for antibiotics and a better letter for the HR department about my absence. And everything will be fine.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 22:50:11	I'd like my life to run with 100% efficiency, but that's not realistic. It may take days for the urine tox results, and I will have to wait.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 22:49:47	It's not just on my time. I have to work with other people's schedules, and if that means things take logner, they take longer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 21:32:31	Would getting a present for my long-suffering doctor seem like a bribe?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 21:32:09	I am not malingering or faking, I'm doing the best I can.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 21:31:50	I will get through this, I will be okay. I will get better, the surgery will happen, my knees will stop hurting, I will get well.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 21:31:03	Even if I get written up for excessive use of sick time, even if I lose my job, I will get through this.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 21:27:53	So hard to let go of the need to CONTROL everything. So little is in my control, and I have to accept that and take on what I can control.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 21:27:09	I have to keep reminding myself that my situation is not dire, that I don't need to panic, and that people will help me when I need it.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 20:51:25	Guess I'll wait for the utox results & go from there. I guess Dr. Roda had good reason, but I'm still annoyed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 20:50:18	Damnit. Dr. Roda won't give me an excuse letter for work. Will have to wheedle one out of my long-suffering primary care doc.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 06:01:31	forgot to mention - the white blood cells were already differentially analyzed in the original blood work, indicating acute infection
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 03:11:12	Hate the idea of wearing patches longer than I have to, but I'm not feeling up for surgery now, not sure I'll feel better in less than 4 wks
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 03:10:27	Going back to work tomorrow, hope they don't give me a hard time. Also want to postpone surgery, esp. if I have an infection now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-10 03:09:54	Definitely feeling better on the lower lithium dosage, for whatever reason. Went to Dr., gave urine sample, waiting for diagnosis.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-09 21:47:59	Will see my dr. today @2pm and will ask for 1) urine test 2) differential white blood cell analysis. Maybe it is just a whopping big UTI.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-09 08:41:14	Talked to a friend & psychiatrist, a plan: tomorrow go back to GP and leave a urine sample, get a note 4 work saying I have an infection.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-09 06:04:46	But she has no idea where the infection could be. So nobody knows what's wrong. I don't know what I'm going to do.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-09 06:04:24	Dr. called w/lab results. Lithium level slightly LOW (opposite of expected), white cell count slightly high.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-09 04:21:58	so tired of all this shit. why am I so sickly? early trauma? bad karma? negative mindset?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-09 04:21:32	They stuck me twice to draw blood for tests. I bled all down my arm. Tomorrow I'll probly get stuck again. Death of a thousand needle sticks

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-07-09 02:23:20	So angry @stupid surgery coordinator, but I think I'm really angry about being alone and having to figure this out all by myself, w/no help

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-23 09:04:05	Went on another LinkedIn binge. Up to 618 connections, WHAT???
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-23 08:12:49	I work so hard to create billables for my employer, and they reward me with flagrant disrespect. So disgusted with them.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-20 06:16:10	Dr. called. Can't do anything about patches til tomorrow. I'll definitely be late for work. Dammitall. I don't deserve to lose $ for this.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-20 05:33:24	May be late for work 2moro. Just how it is. & I'll tell them I do NOT deserve to be docked, cuz I did NOT know about this problem till 2day.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-20 05:32:11	Calmer. Klonopin helped, also got cooked sushi, miso, mei fun. But still can't get more patches til Dr. overrides the insurance patch limits
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-20 04:54:05	Already took a Klonopin and don't want to take 2. So fucking pissed at the job that totally RUINED my knees.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-20 04:53:41	My Dr. has to call the pharmacy provider to argue I need more patches than they think I need. So fucking exasperated, want to break somethin
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-20 04:38:29	Now they're telling me it WAS preauthorized but I'm trying to fill it too early. How can that be when I'm OUT OF PATCHES?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-20 04:36:48	Dr's employee who was supposed to call me back LEFT FOR THE DAY. WITHOUT calling for authorization. Really fucking angry.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-20 03:40:34	calling pharmacy, union, doctor's office - so fucking frustrated
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-19 08:13:18	Kinda sad that my family still thinks I'm young or single enough that they should give me $$ for my birthday. But I'll spend it on my nieces

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-12 04:58:58	Saw a happy birthday post I missed on the actual day last week. From a college friend who mentioned my age. I cried all the way home.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-11 09:03:19	Odd. Knees hurt less when I'm busier at work.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-10 02:23:54	Wore the patches too long yesterday. Today heart is thumping, but if I take them off, I will be in so much pain. Sux.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-08 03:52:27	Cuz if I leave the lidocaine patches on too long, I get anxious & my heart pounds. So frustrating. I want a normal body & normal legs!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-08 03:47:21	Slept badly last night; woke w/knee pain @4am. Want to nap, but I'm afraid of sleeping too long and not taking off the patches in time.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-07 03:50:38	Despite yesterday's emotional turmoil, today I met with two patients and did a training for 10 counselors. I am SO good at my job ;)

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-05 05:42:17	Walked more than usual today, although not far, and knees SERIOUSLY unhappy about it. Dammitall.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-05 04:49:38	Excessively irritable & anxious. Hoping it's PMS. Could be cabin fever. Getting into lots of online disagreements. Not good.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-02 03:32:05	My knees burn in the heat. It will be an expensive summer, cranking up the a/c.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-01 07:37:56	Told me not to fill the script if I feel substantially better by Monday. So I'll see.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-06-01 07:37:26	Slept VERY heavily; Benadryl&Klonopin might have been overkill. Dr. says it's probably just a virus&allergies but gave me Rx antibiotics
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-05-31 08:22:16	I feel a little better, but I'm still going to the doctor tomorrow. I really, really hope I sleep tonight. Took Benadryl & a Vitamin K.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-05-30 22:17:33	I feel so lousy now, and I can feel the expanding pressure in my sinuses as the bacteria multiply. Despite the Neti pot. FML.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-05-30 22:17:01	Dr. can't see me till tomorrow at 9. I guess I could go to the doc and then go in to work late. If I feel able.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-05-30 19:37:59	I'm going to try not to take any Sudafed today. Throat hurts, chest is wheezy. Hope I get sleep tonight and go to work tomorrow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-05-30 15:36:29	Can't go to work if I'm sick and had NO sleep. Can't choose between breathing & sleeping (i.e. not taking Sudafed). Feverish achy & annoyed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-05-30 14:35:04	Wonder if lidocaine suppresses immune function. I know cocaine does. Maybe that's why I'm getting sick so often.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-05-30 14:34:40	Can't sleep. Probably from mixing Sudafed with Lidocaine. Tomorrow will be miserable. I vowed I'd go in no matter what, don't know if I can.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-05-30 12:15:24	Went to bed very early to get rest so I can go back to work tomorrow. Now can't sleep. FML.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-05-24 06:38:41	Friend asked me, "Do you EVER have a good day at work?" Not really. It's sad. I need to get out of there.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-05-22 07:32:56	Forgot to take off the patches. Wore 'em 1.5 hours too long. Now heart is pounding. Dammitall. Will have to be careful tomorrow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-05-22 05:37:29	It's so difficult working for people I don't respect, & I don't think I set the bar so high. I let someone down, a friend; I feel so awful.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-06 01:08:07	I was joking to ease my pain, since laughter is the best medicine, but something seriously struck a nerve, I guess.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-06 01:07:18	Was IMing w/a friend. She says, "I am not sure what is going on here, but I think GD just spoke through you." That would be a first.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-06 00:25:52	The Richter scale, where every decimal point represents an increase by a factor of 10.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-06 00:25:37	Today I'm at about 7.2 on the pain scale. If 10 is being burned at the stake, and the pain scale is like the Richter scale --
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-05 22:48:31	If the MRI shows no problems (as usual), I will ask my Dr. for a prescription for a customized wheelchair, so I have mobility.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-05 22:41:02	MRIs were taken but they couldn't give me the CD. Technical problems. They say they'll try to deliver it to my Dr. before tomorrow morning.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-05 08:57:20	Got the FMLA paperwork. MRI 2morrow. If it shows nothing, won't get disability leave. Will have to resign, because I can't work in this pain
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-05 05:09:45	Got insurance authorization in less than a day. That must be some kind of world record. I am a gold medal invalid.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-05 05:09:22	Wheedled, cajoled, called, & called again.l have an MRI appt for 7am tomorrow and will see Dr. D the next day unless there's a cancellation
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-04 21:34:32	Made MRI appointment for tomorrow. But Dr. D has to call my insurance to get authorization today. He better not dawdle like last week.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-04 19:16:58	goodnews: med interaction apparently over. badnews: knees still hurt. requested FMLA paperwork, will call to schedule MRI.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-04 08:54:16	headache & nausea: med side effects. backache: that time of the month. knee pain: just because and always. Really sick of being sickly.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-04 08:48:39	y does pain always worsen at night? because I don't feel up to going to work tomorrow?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-04 07:56:11	I think I could be content to be single even with bipolar, but having to deal with constant physical pain is almost more than I can handle.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-04 05:12:29	Still sorta miserable from the med interaction. Gave away almost all my inflammatory foods. But don't feel any better.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-04 05:12:01	Learned a great expression from a patient: "You look like death between two soda crackers." That is how I feel right now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-04 01:15:33	good friend just helped me w/some small chores, y is everything so much easier when someone else is there?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-03 21:10:07	headache/nausea better, but knees hurt again. fml. tomorrow I guess I'll call for an MRI appointment and apply for FMLA
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-03 08:32:50	New painkiller interacts badly with lithium. Headache & nausea, and my knees are still uncomfortable. Dammitall.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-02 04:13:16	Is anyone else sad that Ed Koch never got to be open about his sexual identity?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-02 04:03:26	Saw Dr. D. He gave me a new medication and ordered MRIs. Something about my MCLs. Hope it shows SOMETHING.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-01 04:58:46	FINALLY got a call from the Dr. He is still baffled. I'm seriously worried. He's talking I need to see a surgeon.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-02-01 03:21:46	Week of pain http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2013/01/week-o f-pain.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-31 08:04:34	still can't stand or walk w/o pain and STILL my doctor hasn't called -- 2nd day in a row -- starting to feel outraged
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-31 05:47:19	Still in pain, still no call from Dr. Dashing. If nothing else, I'm losing the illusion that he likes me more than his other patients.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-31 02:40:18	Ow. OW. Major bad knee pain. Seriously. but I keep wondering if it's psychological, if I'm depressed and it's really not that bad.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-29 09:47:54	& this coldrainy weather is KILLIN my knees. Dr. Dashing gave em a new & different injection last week, but it didn't help. bruised well tho
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-29 09:44:20	my whole life, I always thought where I thought I was going would definitely be better than where I was. that might not be true.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-29 08:13:55	A very weird party http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-very -weird-party.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-27 12:17:07	I just want a normal life. I'm tired of being extraordinary.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-27 12:01:22	Went to a party. Looked good (I think), smelled good (I was told), talked to several men, and none of them asked for my #. Idk what to do.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-24 10:02:32	Actually, I've been playing around with a 21yo I met at Starbucks, but I haven't really spent any time on my knees or on my feet.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-24 10:00:42	Dr. Dashing asked if I've been playing tennis, because my arthritis is worse. He is baffled. I am worried. Got more injections, ouch.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-23 04:50:31	survived the day at work. group even went beautifully. maybe I do know something about what I'm doing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-22 05:56:47	so don't feel like going back to work tomorrow... haven't been using the light box and I feel kinda down

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-21 08:01:10	Nephew told me "it's good when you're here" and "you are a CRAZY good aunt." Need to spend more time w/him & his sisters.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-15 17:00:14	Woke up to pee, stayed up for the knee pain. I eat too much sugar, it's the hardest addiction to kick. After nicotine and heroin and crack.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-15 09:55:32	time to go lie on the #acushakti mat, because I have no life and go to bed stupid early. ow. torture, but it helps me sleep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-15 06:56:13	Feeling apathetic. Apologies to my followers. The light box is helping, I hate my job, I have no boyfriend, but I don't want to die.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-13 23:06:41	The d'var Torah KILLED, btw. Tons of men came up to me to say how great it was. Why didn't they ask me out?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-13 23:05:35	I met a FANTASTIC girl at the party. Hung out with FANTASTIC girlfriends at the dinner. Ain't that the way it always is...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-13 22:47:33	Survived the singles dinner. Survived the party. Knees not in agony. I guess they hurt less when I'm having fun and more on the job.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-11 09:13:11	Struggling http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2013/01/strugg ling.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-11 08:42:11	Amazing how the act of sitting down to write crystallizes vague ideas into sentences and paragraphs. I still got it. Even depressed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-11 08:00:24	I hate seasonal depression. It diminishes me. I'm not as creative/smart/talented/funny as I normally am. Dammit.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-11 07:59:53	Y did I say I'd speak @the singles dinner 2moro night? dammit, will not be brilliant, will have to play it safe, brain is no good
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-10 08:53:50	When did the job I liked become the job I hate so much?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-10 08:11:01	@MrRPMurphy Saying 'that's so gay': uncool. Saying 'you're so bipolar': ratings gold?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-10 08:10:36	@MrRPMurphy Ironic that this week's episode of TNN was about bullying and slander, since that's what you do to people with bipolar disorder
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-10 08:10:08	@AliAdler What do you have against people with bipolar disorder, since it's clearly your favorite gratuitous insult?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-10 08:09:13	@MrRPMurphy What do you have against people who have bipolar disorder, since it's clearly your favorite gratuitous insult?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-09 05:38:43	Wish I was better at facilitating groups. So tired of hating it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-09 05:17:59	@baffinfootwear1 Thanks for the follow, I feel like Carrie Bradshaw in snow boots!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-09 05:08:07	Had to call the agency where I interviewed last December to ask about a mutual client. Ironic. Still no callback.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-06 10:34:45	so many people in my life love me so much, I don't know how to make that be enough
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-06 07:38:46	http:// not.doing.very.well.hope.it .will.soon.pass.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-05 05:50:36	Dr. Dashing called: after 2-day procedure of many needles and hours, negative results. He promises the pain will just disappear. I doubt it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-05 04:30:42	Did not get a callback after last week's interview. Guess I'm not escaping my job anytime imminent.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-04 07:13:23	No wonder I wanted chocolate last night.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-04 07:13:13	breast awareness being my first indicator of impending menstruation. And BPMS being roughly 75% more drastic than regular PMS.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-04 07:12:43	became intensely aware of my breasts & realized: It's not just seasonal depression. It's my special extra-powerful bipolar PMS.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-04 03:31:18	Everything is so hard. Getting up. Getting dressed. I lose things. I am so angry. Winter is killing me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-03 08:06:36	@tikunolam2pt0 Hope this is IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-03 08:05:38	went home sick from work. hope it's not bronchitis. really, really hope it's not bronchitis.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-02 04:06:17	Got no deeds to do, / No promises to keep. / I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-02 03:46:53	trying to be present and content in the moment, not regretting the past or wishing for the future. it's surprisingly difficult.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-01 23:00:45	wondering if I'm the only person who spent NYE at home alone and why that bothers me so much
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-01 18:10:51	Every year I wish things will get better. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. I should just wish to handle everything gracefully.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2013-01-01 08:17:22	@home sick alone, hope this is the end of a 2012 trend and not a continuation into 2013
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-31 09:39:48	trying to create NYE plans that are naughty yet safe and easy on the knees. challenging.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-31 06:43:19	now I'm in the running for another job. will the secular new year be luckier than the Jewish?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-31 06:42:59	last Rosh Hashsna I thought my fate would be decided if I got a new job. got the offer, not enough $ so I declined and stayed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-31 06:41:33	Sometimes the green mile seems so long.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-31 05:41:19	@jwharnisch thans for RT, I feel like a celeb! except I'm wrongly proportioned
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-31 04:58:48	@electroboyusa Thanks for being a Man Against Gun Violence. I am depressed over New Year's but being part of something bigger helps.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-31 04:56:23	if you're feeling down, "The Green Mile" is NOT the feel-good movie to pick you up
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-31 03:04:26	watching The Green Mile and wondering what would be the happiest time in my life that I'd want to be my heaven. 3 yrs old, I think.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-30 22:53:43	at some point have to attack the dishes in the sink... waiting for my knees to stop hurting a little
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-30 22:52:36	insane how just taking out the garbage exhausts me. I'm not as over this cold as I think.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-30 22:40:06	insane how much just taking out the garbage makes my knees hurt. not happy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-30 21:58:22	needs to take out the garbage, it's approaching the dimensions of a Shel Silverstein poem http:// mste.illinois.edu/courses/ci407s u01/students/north/kristy/Project/K-Poem-Net.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-30 21:48:19	I have discovered the cure for the common cold: sleep 18 hours a day. I feel much better and I lost 3 pounds.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-30 21:47:54	What would happen if I just stayed home New Year's Eve? My knees can't tolerate a party. I'm going to a party January 12, I need to rest up.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-30 12:24:09	Instead of telling clinic manager he's not my boss & can't give me directives, I smiled & explained why I was doin what I was doin. Worked.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-28 06:52:55	PLEASE just let me get a better job, and I promise I will work to make myself a more satisfying personal life.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-28 05:23:18	Probably need to apply for intermittent FMLA. Don' t want to lose this job before I find another.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-28 05:22:57	Not 2 whole days. One day I get blood drawn, then injected with dye, then injected with my own blood again. Next day they scan it all.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-28 05:22:24	Saw Dr. D. Knee might be infected or some of the filler might have leaked. Have to go for a 2-day nuclear medicine scan next week.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-28 02:42:05	I "never" have a fever because my body temp is usually 97.2, thanks to the lithium; today it's 98.6 and I feel crummy
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-28 02:40:57	and no matter the overall muscle achiness that feels like a flu, I will use the acupressure mat tonight, I can't sleep without it
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-28 02:40:16	need to get a doctor's note explaining why I've missed 3 days of work in 3 weeks; fortunately not many patients are around for the holidays
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-28 02:39:49	is this headache from the Percoet/Voltaren I popped at 3 am or the Klonopin I took at 6 am?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-28 02:39:17	slept few hours, would've been more if Con Ed hadn't robocalled me; got slightly earlier appt w/Dashing; hope he can figure out what's wrong
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-28 02:16:40	took some Klonopin and napped a little. don't like doing that but sleep helps the pain.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-28 02:13:15	@johnryanmartine Absolutely. A good psychiatrist is worth his or her weight in gold. Unfortunately, seems like the bad outnumber the good.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 18:01:38	Just noticed I lost a follower. As long as it's not Patrick J. Kennedy, well, I can cope.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 17:57:11	@CoyneoftheRealm I'm more surprised that BYU students abstain from coffee than sex. How do they get their term papers done on time?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 17:54:20	I normally wear soft and flowy knit clothing. Yesterday my waist felt strangled by my skirt. How did women wear corsets? I woulda hated that
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 17:53:30	what will I wear to my follow-up job interview? ppl will start to wonder if I'm always dressed up, it's so unlike me
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 17:52:59	let's see, what else can I worry about? hope my former supervisors' supervisor is going to submit my LCSW paperwork without a fuss
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 17:49:41	have I mentioned I'm tired of needles? you would think this would make me dislike Dr. Dashing. I wish it would.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 17:49:19	so frustrated by the knee pain, it's as if all the gains of the first 3 injections were ruined by the 4th
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 17:48:56	or, I'll get a new job with a later start time, so waking up at 2am won't torpedo my whole day
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 17:48:30	need to apply for flexible FMLA before I lose my job
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 17:47:27	ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow finally caved and took a Percocet will see if Dr. Dashing can see me earlier today because am miserable

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 08:03:18	feeling weak, feverish, achy, and hoping the knees aren't infected. seriously going to bed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-27 07:09:17	interview went well I think, sent off a thank-you email and now I will collapse
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-26 10:27:59	@johnryanmartine Some psychiatrists want to heal suffering, and some are into mind control. Of course, even they don't know it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-26 10:19:30	is getting spam replies a sign of success on here? hope so, cuz I cannot figure out how to delete em
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-26 10:15:58	@Visitkarte I really felt it today. Friend was here - knees didn't hurt. He left, they started hurtin. The whole mind-body connection thing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-26 09:28:02	@Visitkarte thanks for RT :)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-26 08:31:06	made a significant discovery: pain hurts less when you're not alone. need to hire a babysitter.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-25 22:06:03	Woke up in a good mood despite the pain, and despite significant insomnia. Of course, didn't have to get up at 5:45am.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-25 22:04:00	re that damn ovary: means I'm still ovulating, so I'm still holding out some hope I'll have a child
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-25 21:56:01	OK, heat pack on the back, putting ointment on the knees, and hoping the ovary will shut the hell up

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-25 07:48:04	feel like a loser for not going out and partying, but honestly, I'm so sore & tired, I would not enjoy it
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-25 07:39:57	gashed a big sore gash on my elbow. how do I do all this damage to myself? it's a miracle I can still walk and talk
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-25 06:10:44	Knees hurt. Back hurts. But I got my hair done and it looks okay. Looking forward to resting tomorrow.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-24 03:04:26	Now worrying that falling in the tub will set of my lower back pain as well as my continued knee pain. Fucking fuck.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-24 03:01:17	Trying to keep my hair dry in the shower. Slipped & fell on the edge of the tub. Hit my wellpadded ass, not my head. Only injured my dignity
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-23 21:38:58	I'm really angry that I waited 10 min for a bus after my last injections on 12/3 and my knees have hurt since. Feels like backsliding.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-23 21:38:11	@PsychCentral Tell that to most of the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, etc. Plenty of aging Rock Stars out there. They just stopped drugging.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-23 21:37:31	I wake up occasionally to pee. But I get a lot of sleep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-23 21:37:11	since I don't sleep well during the week, &sleep is when the body heals, I take sleep aids on Fri. evening and sleep more or less until Sun.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-23 21:33:56	so fucking frustrated I do everything to help my patient and the hospital fucks it all up. SO FUCKING FRUSTRATED.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-23 10:11:47	Took Klonopin and slept all Shabbos... and hope to sleep tonight as well.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-22 04:33:04	Helped a patient despite enormous barriers. Counselor said I should be named Social Worker of the Year. Kinda proud.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-21 18:16:39	Poor sleep again last night, despite some benadryl and using the mat. I used more benadryl the night before and slept better.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-21 06:50:49	3 random men poking my "real" profile. Will 1 of them grow a damn spine & ask me out already? What is wrong with men????????????????????????
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-21 04:10:26	Slept better last night, after taking calcium and benadryl. I hate sleep aids, but I can't function without sleep with my knees this bad.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-20 08:45:54	Hope that's not a breach of confidentiality. I can't really talk about my job as much as I'd like to.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-20 08:45:32	However, even from home, I managed to ensure that one patient will get the care he needs, even if he doesn't know it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-20 08:44:35	Taking lots of benadryl tonight, because I really HAVE to sleep well. I've been exhausted and cranky all day. Hate the time change.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-19 23:11:41	despite lack of sleep & sore knees, landed myself a JOB INTERVIEW next week! sounds really cool, I'll keep you posted
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-19 22:28:19	seriously hating terminal insomnia. using all my non-pharmacological remedies and they're not working. very frustrating.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-19 22:27:45	two hours sleep/five hours tossing & turning + wicked bad knee pain = calling in sick. don't like doing it, but I can't work in agony.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-19 16:20:05	sleep is bad with the acupressure mat but even worse without it. dammit.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-19 07:16:16	also HATE how using the light box makes my eyes burn... it's a shitty trade-off for a better mood. and still my sleep is wack.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-19 07:15:10	Using the acupressure torture mat isn't helping. I wake up several times a night. Operating on maybe 5 hours of sleep. Not happy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-18 10:11:06	A little black humor to spice up your Monday. I do not plan to have a breakdown ever again. Then again, nobody does.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-18 10:10:43	More followers every day. How can I sleep when they must be entertained? I better have a breakthrough or a breakdown soon.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-18 10:06:04	Totally sucks going to bed at 9 pm. I gotta get another job.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-18 05:43:56	Was told by a counselor today that the patients complained about the last social worker, but not about me. Kinda proud.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-18 05:39:43	Do everyone else's lower eyelids look so crepey in their passport photos? Sheesh. I better start hitting the eye cream.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-17 08:35:39	It was the Chanuka that wasn't. I didn't light candles. I'm not sure I believe in miracles, at least not for myself.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-17 06:54:39	Small steps. Finishing up and submitting the elaborate LCSW paperwork. Scheduling the test. Taking the test. Then I'll worry about what next
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-17 00:27:30	what is it about a rainy day that makes me just want to curl up and do nothing? I got a pedicure -- that might be it for today
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-16 09:01:12	"Good King Wenceslas" in an Irish accent - awesome https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=N5E8CX Qwtrg …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-16 09:00:43	Listening to carols instead of going to Chanuka parties. Guess I'm a bad Jew. I just don't feel like getting dressed up for disappointment.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-16 04:16:17	Single motherhood isn't an option for me. I grew up without a father; I would never impose that on a child.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-15 04:42:36	@pattyduke_id It happens because there's inadequate access to quality mental health care and excessive access to guns in the US
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-14 10:27:20	Need to buy some big envelopes for all those forms I'm sending to my school, former employer, NYS Dept of Education... such a process
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-14 10:26:48	Sunday I'll take the passport photo and get the application notarized (hopefully the local UPS offers those services on Sunday).
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-14 08:33:27	I know I frequently say that some people are idiots, but some of these idiots on LinkedIn are IDIOTS, and I'm not being a snob
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-14 08:32:41	no license/online degree/no f/t job as a clinician: not worth engaging in conversation, because they're afraid of evidence-based practices
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-14 08:31:42	b4 commenting in LinkedIn discussions, I should check to see if the poster 1) has a license, 2) got their degree online, 3) is employed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-14 07:11:25	Eckhart Tolle vs. Bahaa Taher - who's right? Does past misery scar the soul for a lifetime, or has it no power over the present moment?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-14 06:54:28	Yes, I *finally* have enough hours to apply for my LCSW! Of course, that means asking the agency that fired me to confirm I worked there.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-14 06:53:47	Welcome @cprnnj - I will try to post something interesting soon. The latest news is, I need to get a passport photo for my LCSW application.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-13 10:02:38	It sucks because I just KNOW my patient will be bored. Safe, well fed, but BORED.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-13 10:02:22	Patient of mine is hospitalized where I was taken in 2010. Guess I will not go a-visiting.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-13 05:53:16	tired. fat. knees hurt. annoyed with life.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-12 07:18:16	Especially since I haven't had sex in more than a year. For someone with bipolar, that's like a decade.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-12 07:17:59	Is too old and too tired to go out and party every night. Any night, practically. My life isn't "Sex and the City."
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-12 04:53:14	Thinking about going to a LGBTQ Chanuka party. I'm tired of seeing all the same people at the parties I usually go to.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-12 04:50:13	Just bought this for myself for, let's say, Chanuka http:// books.google.com/books/about/Th e_Dialectical_Behavior_Therapy_Skills.html?id=_dh8CdwO4vUC …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-11 08:57:04	I hate fighting with friends, especially when they are as stubborn as I am. But I'm too angry/exhausted to be emotionally generous.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-11 04:32:28	Blog commenter says I don't have "biological" depression. So I must be imagining this seasonal downward effect on my mood.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-10 05:58:12	Anger is a symptom of bipolar disorder. It is not a character flaw.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-10 02:39:13	I think the real test of friendship is not just being there when you're needed but surviving a fight. & I think I'll test that theory soon.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-10 01:33:02	Never yet regretted telling any of the few in my Secret Circle about my illness, because nobody used it against me. Until now.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-09 09:18:51	Chanuka shmanuka... not going to parties, not lighting candles, not eating fried foods. Just not feeling it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-09 08:09:21	Anger unleashed, again http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2012/12/anger- unleashed-again.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-09 04:08:29	And I feel particularly ungrateful because a friend paid for my dinner and I know she only wants the best for me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-09 04:07:36	I will probably never go back to that synagogue. Even though I enjoyed the speaker/dinner last night and there were single men there.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-09 04:07:10	I hate my anger. I fear my anger. And when the time changes and I'm unstable, and work is difficult and draining, I can't control it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-09 04:06:31	Of course, having told off 2 perfectly nice ladies, 1 a dear friend, I am now humiliated and furious w/myself for giving in to my anger.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-09 04:05:51	Living alone and knowing you'll probably die alone and childless. Don't you DARE tell me how fortunate I am to not have anyone.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-09 04:05:22	Don't tell me I can have so much fun going out every night. Don't tell me husbands and children are overrated. Try living alone.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-09 04:04:41	To married ppl who think single life is so wonderful & carefree: don't say this to me in public, or I will humiliate myself w/my anger.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-08 04:46:57	Elevator out again. Fuck. Not in a good mood.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-07 07:35:23	I finally have more followers than following and I AM SO STOKED!!! None of y'all better leave.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-07 07:34:51	patient has a crush on me. so does his counselor. psychoanalysts would call this "parallel process"
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-05 18:40:54	major serious bad pain today. hope I won't get in trouble for calling in sick again. don't feel guilty, feel justified. they did this to me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-05 08:28:03	Helped a patient understand some of his depression symptoms today, for the first time. Some days I really do make a difference.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-03 19:47:17	Been feeling a lot worse since the time change. I thought it was work stress, but maybe I need to start using the light box again.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-03 06:49:14	Tired of always having to pretend I'm normal when I'm not. Tired of not being allowed to be who I am. I hate the closet.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-02 10:26:04	Only I would call a phone sex line for companionship and end up giving free therapy to some dude in South Carolina.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-01 09:11:24	It was a good day. Why do I want to cry? I know I should practice yoga #nidra , but it's so hard to lie down and focus my mind off myself.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-01 09:10:39	Met Sol Wachtler, who spoke @conference. Thought we could bond over having bipolar. Alas no; he's busy. Just said, "Take your medication!"
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-01 09:09:11	Can't change my lovelife, but can change my job. Conference today inspired. I need to be in a place where I can learn & grow & be supported.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-12-01 06:29:15	Feeling much better after attending a professional conference and NETWORKING. If I can't find a husband @least I can find a better job.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-30 10:17:13	So pretty, so smart, and it's meaningless because it hasn't gotten me anywhere.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-30 10:04:04	And I know it's self-pity and self-indulgence. But the emptiness and loneliness is more than I can bear.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-30 10:03:23	I cried @the doctor today, waiting for my sonogram. In a waiting room full of pregnant women & their mates. I was the emptiest one there.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-30 10:02:36	It made me want to die. I promised to take my niece to the concert, & I did. I have no other compelling reason to continue living.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-30 10:01:54	I know there r huge world events in motion. But last night I heard a teen heartthrob sing about love & I cried because I'll never have that
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-30 05:09:15	Hysterosonogram. Invasive, unpleasant, but showed there's no obvious reason why I couldn't have a baby if I tried.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-28 06:59:08	Worst thing about being alone: u have a shitty day, and there's no one to either comfort u or submit to some angry sex for tension release.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-28 06:58:27	@RobWeissMSW I think it's AWESOME that these "practitioners" are being called on their bullshit. JONAH is an agent of destruction.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-27 09:40:39	@tikunolam2pt0 Because people have always suspected that Facebook being free is too good to be true.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-27 09:40:13	of course, no day of bipolar would be complete without SEX... when not sad or anxious, I have felt very lusty & buxom today
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-27 07:54:52	A day in the life of bipolar http:// ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/2012/11/a-day- in-life-of-bipolar.html …
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-27 06:06:30	2 kinds of anxiety: 1) makes you eat, 2) makes you unable to eat. No idea why or how each strikes at any given time.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-27 06:05:55	Woke up sad. Midday: anxious. Now nauseated. Just another day in the life of bipolar. Hate it. Miserable.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-26 09:38:47	What do you tweet when you have nothing to say? I will never be as good a writer as David Sedaris.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-25 22:56:54	Haven't had much to say lately. Guess I'm okay. Knees are getting better. Work is very demanding. Just don't wanna do anything.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-21 07:48:33	@jsende Exactly :) Looking forward to a great meal and a new friend.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-21 07:21:06	so excited! just made plans to have lunch on Thanksgiving with an online friend. Love meeting online friends IRL!!!!

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-21 05:28:34	Nowhere to go for Thanksgiving, but I have a roof over my head and a job, so I'll just... sleep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-20 06:15:53	I will sleep (alone) this Thanksgiving because I have to work on Friday and I'm not talking to my sister.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-20 06:15:29	He was very friendly today. Clearly relieved that I wasn't withdrawn and angry like last time. Shared his Thanksgiving plans.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-20 06:15:01	HATE when the Dr. says "Wow, I'm surprised that injection hurt you so much!" Ow.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-17 05:08:55	"slammed" means inundated - everyone wants a piece of Ayelet and I'm so depleted

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-16 15:55:51	Because there is very little at my job that I control, and I can't keep trying to exert control where I think I can

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-09 04:43:58	It's taxing to supervise 16 counselors and oversee 800 patients. I try not to let things fall through the cracks, but I'm only one person.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-09 04:43:22	Had a minor meltdown in the secretaries' office. Felt embarrassed. Talked to the secretary later, and she forgot the fit I threw.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-08 08:49:49	In a jolly mood tonight, probably from the sleep deprivation. Hard to explain. It's destabilizing my mood, but not always downward.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-08 07:02:26	I should have taken a shower instead of doing dishes...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-08 07:02:12	HATE that after washing dishes I am too sore to stand and take a shower. Took a percocet, hope it helps.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-06 10:45:05	Gd social work meeting tonight. Apparently I'm a powerhouse. So many ppl love me, why can't I find a palatable man?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-06 06:36:48	Interestingly, I spoke to a friend for work reasons and learned that at work, I sound really great. Wearing the mask.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-06 06:36:21	I know I should feel sorry for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. But I can't tear my heart away from the tragedy of my own life.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-05 07:35:34	Nothing to say right now. Just miserable. Nothing anyone can do about it. Nothing but time.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-05 01:26:11	beautiful sunny day. don't wanna do anything. why did I let myself crush on a doctor I have to see for several more months? crap.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-03 05:54:26	I miss my nieces with a visceral ache. Why is their mother such a horrible person?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-02 06:38:05	I know I'll feel better at some point. Just sucks being this angry and frustrated and miserable two days in a row.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-02 04:37:04	More injections. I've given up on seducing Dr. Dashing. Just need to finish this series of injections and then forget him.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-01 07:55:31	Cuz as it is, I'm completely unmotivated to clean or fix up my apartment. So I live in semi-squalor. With OCD my apartment would look nicer
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-11-01 07:52:37	My co-worker has OCD. Can't sit in anyone's office without wiping everything down. I wonder if I'd be happier with OCD or just cleaner.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-31 07:47:58	I know people died in #Sandy . Most of me is glad I didn't, some of me thinks I should have instead of them.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-31 07:47:21	Yes, I know, unrequited love is neither interesting nor limited to bipolar disorder. But I've been very relaxed these past 2 days.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-31 07:46:46	Have a new follower. Feel I should post something interesting. I hoped Dr. Dashing would call to check on me, but it was my aunt.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-30 23:04:28	knees hurt & I'm bored, but overall very lucky
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-30 18:54:03	oh: safe & dry & have power, btw
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-30 18:53:46	2nd day home, no subways. Just massaged knees & calves w/rosemary arnica oil. Don't know if I feel better but it smells amazing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-30 00:44:06	Transit shut down. Home for good reason. Feeling anxious, maybe because I had coffee and haven't eaten yet. Knees ache. Safe so far.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-29 06:45:55	in a lousy mood all day. not sure if it's party hangover or hormones or just loneliness. not worried about Sandy, life's already a disaster
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-28 13:16:37	I should stop going to parties in bars/clubs. Nothing good ever happens to me there.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-28 13:08:16	I have nothing to live for. A job is not enough.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-28 12:37:06	In a very foul mood. Only good thing: my knees don't hurt much after taking off the braces and wearing high heels.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-28 12:35:54	To the wingman who told me his friend's really into tall thin girls: thanks for calling me short and fat, asshole. I hate parties.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-28 09:39:35	Third day of my menstrual cycle, and I am just LOOKING for a fight. Perhaps not the best time to go to a party. Definitely won't drink.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-28 08:22:41	okay, turns out she's going to another party first and will meet me at the second. not optimal, but not as bad as a blowoff
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-28 07:44:32	Stabbed in the back, and you're to blame / You give friendship a bad name. Man, I'm in a crappy mood.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-28 07:36:26	You make plans with someone, and you prepare, and then they blow you off. This is what it means to be single.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-28 07:34:35	wish I hadn't just had a cup of coffee in preparation
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-28 07:32:30	Friend who said she misses me so much and was supposed to take me to a party tonight just blew me off. Whatever.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-27 05:46:12	You can learn a lot from a bad example.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-27 05:46:02	When you supervise, you should listen more than you talk, and when you talk, what you say should be RELEVANT and grounded in reality.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-26 04:25:29	Should go to party tonight. Knees don't hurt much. But I tried to nap & couldn't. It's just the same annoying women & ugly men. Why bother?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-24 09:34:59	@MHSMchat @Murfomurf Holistic treatment is the best approach!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-24 08:42:06	I really need to get back to yoga #nidra . I need to meditate to handle my anger and pain and frustration. Tomorrow, no excuses. I meditate.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-24 08:35:22	Every bad day, every sharp word, every impatient exhale- & they will assume I'm depressed or manic or both. SO UNFAIR. I can't be who I am.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-24 08:34:21	want to tell EVERY1 I am a better clinician BECAUSE I have bipolar, but then they'll judge everything I do by my diagnosis
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-24 05:21:07	Got into ANOTHER flamewar. When will I learn? I don't know everything and I don't have to prove the whole world wrong. Why do I do that?????
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-24 04:09:50	Knees bad today. Very very bad. Not sure if it's the wheatfest 2 days ago or running around 2 clinics all day.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-24 04:08:18	@lifeaftertrauma Well, I'm not just a clinician, I'm a survivor. I have type 2 bipolar disorder. I've been on both sides of the locked door.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-23 05:52:47	okay, NOW the knees hurt, but I haven't taken any Voltaren tabs- just smeared on some Voltaren gel. Trying to see how much wheat I can have.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-23 05:51:59	@lifeaftertrauma Definitely. Not incorporating information from patients/clients/survivors makes you a rotten clinician.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-23 03:37:07	Much less pain than expected from yesterday's wheatfest. Maybe dairy is my main downfall. Some day I'm going to eat pounds of tomatoes & see
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-22 08:11:50	I'm happy for the bride of the shower, but tired of it never being me.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-19 08:46:11	And Patrick J. Kennedy is still following me. I am still awesome. Even constipated and exhausted.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-19 08:45:27	@lifeaftertrauma Eastern philosophers would say that instead of trying to assign meaning to trauma, we should practice acceptance.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-19 08:45:02	Damn that Voltaren gel. Constipates me something wicked, & then I get the headaches.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-11 18:09:27	ow ow OW Dr. Dashing said these injections wouldn't hurt; hate calling in sick after being out 2 days but was up all night OW
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-11 09:26:24	@BrianBeckner Really? What did she have done??
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-11 09:25:14	All the extra crap they keep piling on the counselors & social workers, I'm terrified of screwing up. But it didn't paralyze me today.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-11 09:24:50	And tonight while meditating I found a coil of anxiety in my stomach. I was so busy today, I forgot to worry that I can't handle this job.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-11 09:24:21	I'm finding it easier to smile at people even when I'm annoyed and angry, and to act apologetic instead of belligerent.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-11 09:23:53	Yoga #nidra hasn't changed my life, yet somehow I feel happier. Hasn't taken away my knee pain but it's easier to cope.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-11 09:22:38	Ironic that my Persian doctor thinks Halloween is better than Purim. Persians really are batshit crazy, I am lucky he doesn't want me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-11 06:38:11	Knees hurt. From injections or a month of inflammatory food? Dr. D said injections shouldn't hurt, but he's at the other end of the needle.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-11 05:29:50	Dr. Dashing is really good at the friendly-with-shields-up thing. I can already see the beginning of the end of the crush.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-10 08:28:15	Charmed an Iraqi Jewish guy yesterday. His sister went to med school w/my sister and married my ex-bf. We should have met before now.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-10 06:39:34	Very excited to try my chic new knee brace tomorrow. Also trying #salonpas pain relief patches on 1 knee. Not sure I notice a difference.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-07 10:09:13	So many strange, sad, incoherent people in their 50s at that party. So depressing. I don't want to be like that in 10 years.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-07 10:03:33	Met a very nice woman tonight, learned about an awesome hair product. Did not see ANY attractive men. NONE. Sick of parties.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-07 06:28:04	Tried to ice the knees tonight; couldn't; felt painful, not relief. Is it the cooler weather or are knees really getting better?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-06 07:28:30	To a person with bipolar, a year without sex is like a decade. Or is that just me?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-06 07:15:34	so why do I love buying more & more & more & more & more makeup when I almost NEVER wear it? @askelf
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-06 07:15:10	only wear makeup to social occasions: parties, dates, synagogue events & services; otherwise can't be bothered
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-06 07:14:27	Don't wear makeup to work cuz everyone would stare at me enthralled, nobody would get anything done, & all the patients would fall in love
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-06 07:13:31	when I'm sad, why do I love going to http://www. eyeslipsface.com and buying more makeup that I almost never wear? @askelf

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-06 05:41:39	I am such a fame whore. Totally bums me out that I have more following than followers. Really cranky and off my schedule. Need much sleep.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-06 04:01:20	2oday was very aware that I seemed to be trying to make myself angrier over something that I already was. It's such a habit. Hard 2 break
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-05 10:47:10	Maybe because I meditated before the party. Proud of myself for forcing myself to practice when I wasn't in the mood.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-05 10:46:40	Knees don't hurt as much as I expected. Hm.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-05 10:46:20	Was BAD, ate dairy, wheat, nightshade (pizza), did not get a cookie (wheat, sugar). Saw tons of men I've already dated & tons I don't wanna.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-05 07:39:10	Another party. Getting myself out there or just more denial, like my crush on Dr. Dashing?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-05 05:58:59	meditate or watch stupid sitcom? lazy me wants to watch TV. smart me knows I should meditate.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-05 04:01:21	Cupcakes at work to celebrate a co-worker's wedding tomorrow. I'm single, but I'm full of frosting, so for the next few hours I'm happy.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-05 03:54:24	Shrink sez I seem happier. Either yoga #nidra #irest is working, or living in Denial is like living in Oz after the witch gets squashed.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-04 10:43:39	cuz if I'm not in the 47% now, I probably will be pretty soon
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-04 10:43:18	yeah, there was a debate, but I need to find a husband more than I need to watch 1 man I'm not voting 4 and 1 man I don't wanna vote 4
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-04 10:42:31	idk what I'm doing wrong, I looked AMAZIN tonight, in red w/@least 33% of my breasts visible, and got NO PLAY AT ALL. wtf
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-04 05:40:31	I'm sure tomorrow will be crazier and more enjoyable
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-04 05:40:18	knees hurt >:( not sure if it's the weather or running around the clinic all day looking for something to do
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-04 05:38:21	so annoying when I'm out of the clinic & allkindsofcrazyshit happens & then I'm back in the clinic and NOTHING happens
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-03 07:56:24	@manilaluzon So so sorry for your loss. No words.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-03 06:37:47	As for the deluding... well, the crush has got to run its course. It always has before. It must this time.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-03 06:37:20	Spent a very relaxing 2 days sleeping, eating icecream & deluding. I now think I really should avoid sugar/dairy as the knees hurt more.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-10-01 04:58:10	Sensible shoes aren't as emotionally satisfying as sexy, unhealthy-for-your-feet shoes. I don't know why.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-30 09:08:48	will never understand God's plan - so many men have wives who avoid sex, I would chase it twice daily like the last Alpha-Bit in the bowl
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-30 09:05:14	am I constantly craving sex cuz I have bipolar or because of the extensive porn education provided by my mom's degenerate live-in boyfriend?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-30 09:02:07	Of course, if it is a stressful day in the clinic (it will be after I'm out 2 days), I might need some aromatherapy before my Dr. D appt...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-30 08:48:11	I may have to eat a butter cookie (sugar, wheat, dairy) to cheer myself up
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-30 08:47:54	next Dr. D appt is Oct. 10, and I will not be wearing perfume cuz the holidays will be over :(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-30 08:45:13	y is eating in so much more boring than ordering in? & y can't I get Dr. Dashing out of my head? 5+ more needle stabs over the next 3 months
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-29 06:10:19	After the holidays I will: eliminate wheat from my diet, practice yoga nidra every day, and stop wearing perfume when I see Dr. Dashing.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-29 06:09:32	My supervisor is a big fat hypocrite. Suck it up, Ayelet, because the counselors love you and that's what really counts.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-28 05:25:05	Dr. Dashing was ALL boundaries today. There goes that forlorn hope. How can I eliminate my love & sex drive? Tired of disappointments.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-27 07:46:58	Survived the fast. Rested, read, prayed, dreamed of Dr. Dashing - not sharing the proportions of how I spent the 25 hours
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-26 04:28:15	If I've done anything to hurt or offend any1, I hope you accept my apology - with the caveat that I'm a smart-aleck & it could happen again

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-26 04:15:23	"Since your interview the salary for the position has changed." Really? The workload increased hugely and you CUT the salary? See ya!

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-25 04:28:31	Maybe my knees will get all better. Maybe I will find a way to live with my job. Maybe I will get over wanting love & sex.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-25 04:28:06	Not on my timetable. Never is, never will be. On the upside, knees hurt less today. Forgot cane in a.m., had 2 stand on the bus in the p.m.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-25 04:27:01	Just trying to accept it all gracefully & gratefully. I don't have to rush to leave this job. I can find another job anytime.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-17 00:57:21	Unlike 5771, this year I will not pray to be inscribed in the Book of Death. I am aware of my many blessings and have hopes for a good year.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-16 13:29:33	sent Dr. Dashing LinkedIn connect request: (in Farsi) happy new year and best wishes for you my dear friend (translated for me by a friend)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-16 09:36:08	@MalkieLun Amen! Thank you so much! I wish you a year of health, serenity, clarity, joy, and all good things!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-16 05:34:28	Apparently I need to combine voltaren gel with voltaren tablets to manage my knee pain. I may never poop again.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-16 05:33:55	@RobWeissMSW I may share this with my Dual Recovery group.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-15 06:03:31	Could not see if he's married or single, though. But at our next appointment I'll wish him shana tova.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-15 06:02:12	OK. I Googled Dr. Dashing. And... he is not Pakistani, as I thought, but a Persian Jew from Los Angeles.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-15 05:28:39	Is Dr. D crushing on me as hard as I'm crushing on him???
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-15 05:28:23	Today Dr. D called AGAIN to check on me, even tho I scheduled a followup appt 4 the normal 2 week interval. & again wished me Happy New Year
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-15 05:27:13	Tuesday Dr. Dashing & his fellow injected my knees. Weds Dr. D called to thank me for sending yoga nidra info & wish me happy new year.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-15 03:54:24	My sister called with her annual meaningless apology. Do I have to keep forgiving her and watching her treat me like crap AGAIN?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-15 03:28:18	I need your prayers now more than ever to get me my dream job!!!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-15 03:21:05	So much of my life will be decided for me this Rosh Hashanah. Feels... so ironic.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-09-15 03:20:29	Haven't heard back from provisional offer. Which is great cuz I got to use it as leverage but I don't have to negotiate it just yet.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-18 04:04:29	Transfer is official. I start at the new, closer clinics on 8/27. More paperwork, more clinical supervision.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-16 04:16:48	A colleague is being transferred to my clinic. I will probably be transferred to her clinics (yes, 2) that are MUCH closer 2 where I live.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-16 03:10:43	Worst case scenario: I lose my job. This time, have bulletproof reason. Have savings, although most in IRAs. But won't starve or lose home.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-15 22:29:30	I worked so hard to get my degrees and my jobs. Why did it all go wrong? What did I do wrong?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-15 21:47:46	trying not to stress. I'm doing all I can. I have to believe in myself even if work doesn't. just stretch the ITB 2x/day and hope 4 the best
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-15 21:27:41	it's being processed further, but I'm very worried. and very uncomfortable. they don't believe I'm in pain.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-15 19:53:46	I'm exhausted & in pain, why do I feel guilty about not wanting to go back to work?

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-15 05:50:12	definitely sore. don't regret last night, but hoping tomorrow at Employee Health I get the option to extend my leave.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-15 03:01:54	I think the interview (w/FOUR ppl) went well. It's fee-for-service, but lots of patients w/schizophrenia, and only 20 min from my apartment.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-14 23:08:41	Still don't feel up to facing the punishing commute, though. Have a job interview today, wish me luck.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-14 23:08:12	Dr. & I both pleased w/my progress. Pain not gone but better. Have another procedure 9/4. Dr. sez I have a childbearing pelvis. Good 2 know.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-14 04:39:47	nervous about returning to the Commute From Hell, irritable. stupidly furious that I was double-charged for a bus transfer.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-14 00:50:25	closer I get to going back to work, more I dread the horrific commute. I don't think I can do it again.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-13 05:02:13	@Karen_Tyrrell @AmandaGreenUK "Crazy" "lunatic" "madman" is the last acceptable stereotype. "Psycho" is the mental illness N-word.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-10 05:39:33	Got new clogs online. Not sure if they're too tight or I just hate the feeling of a shoe pressing against my heel. Really, REALLY hate it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-10 03:38:24	Wanted 2 see a friend & run some errands. Pain. Instead, watched #Bridezillas , feeling superior, & gave myself a manicure. #onedayatatime

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-09 08:04:21	@PTSDdotOrg If that were true, why would any woman have more than one child? I spoke with an Israeli trauma expert today, and he was dubious
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-09 01:49:36	if ur FB handle is "Radiant Rachel," I don't think too many men will be interested in dating you
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-09 01:24:16	Decide 2 sit watchin TV- nothin happens. Decide 2 take an Epsom salt bath to help ur knees- and both phones ring and you get a delivery.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-08 04:33:10	Reframing the painful ovulation: that's just fodder for hope that I'm still fertile, right? ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-08 04:32:46	Dr. Dashing says I can wear the knee braces "around the clock." Too hot for that, but I'll wear them all the time I'm out & about.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-08-05 08:40:27	I need to be validated, not shaken up. And if if it were that easy to cheer up, I'd already have tried what you suggested and cheered up.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-31 00:21:36	Ran 2 brief errands. Knees hurt. I don't know how I'm going to live like this.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-29 08:34:39	What happened at my job was not my fault, but I'm the one who suffers. How do I live with constant knee pain and job terror? Alone?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-28 07:55:06	Am I just a complete baby when it comes to pain? My knees have been burning for more than 6 hrs after PT. I don't know what to do.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-28 02:36:06	Went to PT. Knees hurt. Losing faith in the therapist and the doctor.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-27 04:09:17	I hate that I can't walk two lousy blocks without pain.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-25 07:16:04	Also feel better after watching several episodes of the TV show "Teen Wolf." Inducing anxiety defuses anger. And those boys are hotttttttttt

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-24 23:45:05	Went to pain management. Hope this Dr. knows what he's doing. More PT and an injection.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-24 16:51:46	ibuprofin helped with the Bactrim aches, but the knees are really hurting
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-24 15:39:50	why is an allegedly hot young guy from Rajasthan poking me? I'm not even sure where it is, I'm guessing India.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-23 22:32:47	and my Dr. STILL hasn't called back, I guess bleeding after a routine sonogram is NO BIG DEAL
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-23 22:32:21	what do you do when everything falls apart & you don't know where to stand or how to start puttin it all back together? so scared about work
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-23 21:17:34	Left a message about the bleeding. My gyn will call back. Now I wait. At 2:30 go to see my primary Dr. for my disability appeal. Never ends.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-23 20:21:09	Woke up a mass of body aches. I absolutely HATE Bactrim. Can't wait to switch to Macrobid. Hope it won't be as bad - or worse.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-23 05:36:14	Spoke to the Dr. on call. She said call the office tomorrow and talk to my Dr., but I don't need to go to an emergency room. I'll do that.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2012-07-23 05:11:11	Got through to the gyn's answering service. Finally. Now waiting for the Dr. on call (not my Dr.) to... call.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2011-03-15 07:08:22	If none of my matches respond to my initial contacts, eHarmony's no better than any other site. I'm "waiting for his response" on 62 men!

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-11-29 05:53:25	Saw Mr. Spontaneity surfing SuperTova... very annoyed he hasn't called me again. Why do I do this to myself? He's obviously not worth it.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-11-29 05:39:35	annoyed that my credit card had to be cancelled right before Thanksgiving sales - need to buy Chanuka gifts, hate shopping offline
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-11-29 05:11:24	kinda wondering if I'll ever hear from Mr. Spontaneity ever again... and wishing I didn't care at all

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-11-28 10:13:02	Had coffee with SOS yesterday - enjoyed. Too bad he lives in Cleveland. Might have coffee tomorrow with the Southern Gentleman.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-11-27 02:06:50	attention from SOS and SG is sorta balancing out all the crap from work
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-11-26 07:16:16	It's all politics. I need to learn how to smile, and smile, and smile, and be a villain.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-11-25 23:12:45	told work "I feel like there's an axe hanging over my head." was told, "there's no axe." so the situation's not as dire as could be.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-11-25 23:10:19	Southern Gent was looking @my profile when he called last night. Isn't that sweet? Hope he calls again soon, but trying to be patient.

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-11-25 09:47:16	and I still think "From the GET Go" is the WORST screenname on a Jewish dating website I've ever seen
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-11-25 09:46:54	sometimes I feel like I've screwed up my life so badly, I don't know how to fix it

177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-09-01 03:43:18	there it is again. Sad. Just had AMAZING breakthrough session w/a client, probably diagnosed him for the first time in his life, and I'm sad
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-09-01 01:32:52	Brunette Bombshell? I don't need to tell people I'm smart, they get that from speaking to me. I need to emphasize my EXPLOSIVE sexiness!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-09-01 01:21:05	what should I call myself on dating sites? Had the same handle for more yrs than I like to admit -- new self-description needs new moniker
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-09-01 00:42:09	interview fine, starting salary SAD. 2 master's degrees, can't take a $10K pay cut. Will go on f/u interviews and then decline the offer
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 19:17:45	got a job interview, out of the blue; wish me luck, this could be my ticket out. No pressure, though.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 09:38:49	the blog is back, and so is Ayelet! Read about my first post-JV date: http://bit.ly/a7Z5P4
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 08:39:43	relaxing after a parafin pedicure & a sizeable dose of Nutella, the staple of my post-breakup diet, along with milk, fruit, & coconut water
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 05:05:58	sending out tons of cute notes to the guys on Jwed... expecting a return rate of something like 1 in 1000
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 04:49:55	will this day never END? I want to go home and curl up with a jar of Nutella
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 04:16:07	need people to critique my dating profile: http://bit.ly/agjlsv
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 02:45:05	did I ever think he'd love me forever? does anyone ever keep that promise?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 02:18:09	ra ra ah ah ah, roma romama, gaga ooh la la, what's your bad romance?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 01:48:57	I am the loneliest urinologist in Brooklyn
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 01:12:19	just pulled FIVE urines, I am the best urinologist in Brooklyn
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 00:34:14	he was never mine, he kept arms' length away; he made no promises or pacts, and held my love at bay
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-31 00:27:59	surviving the day, so far
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-30 21:41:13	when do I stop feeling like my life is over?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-30 21:17:13	I'm fine for a few minutes, and then the misery hits again. Nothing but time will help, but time stretches agonizingly long
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-30 18:11:38	Feeling better. So far. Not looking forward to work today, and my back hurts.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-30 09:44:01	broke up on Thursday, had a date Saturday... not bad for an old cougar. Although the guy can't kiss -- I was afraid I'd fall down his throat
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-30 09:23:56	I am a masochist, I rejoined a dating website. Just got shot down by the first guy I contacted. Story of my life...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-30 07:22:30	glad to feel numb... hope it lasts the next 10 years
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-30 06:21:17	alone is worse when you recently weren't
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-30 05:45:07	I feel fine, as long as I don't think about anything
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-30 03:09:33	what cures a broken heart besides time and alcohol?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-30 02:58:32	I changed so much to be with him... now I don't know who I am
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-30 00:17:21	all I want to do is sleep... for once, I don't feel like eating. Assume that will come back at some point, but for now, I'm just sleeping
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-29 21:30:45	gave him the names of the geriatric psychiatrists I got from friends. Why should his grandmother suffer becase we're no longer together?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-29 10:04:37	the date was... okay. He made it clear he'd like to have sex, I made it clear I didn't. Supposedly we're going out again on Thursday.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-29 03:14:58	neither klonopin or wine help.... eventually I sober up to painful reality, incomparable loss. Will try not to discuss on my date tonight.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-28 08:08:49	numb to the pain.... klonazapan works well with white wine
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-28 07:21:31	good news is, the blog is reopened... http://ayelet-helpfordepression.blogspot.com/ spread the word
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-28 01:22:24	and all around me... life goes on
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-28 00:29:21	I guess the only good thing is, I don't want to eat. I'm going to ride that trend as long as it lasts. Don't worry, I have coconut water.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-27 20:08:25	Still don't know how I'm going to survive this. Feel completely hopeless and shattered. I should never have kissed him last September.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-27 09:01:10	on Tuesday he realized: I love Ayelet, I don't want to get married. So it's over. So far I'm just numb. I guess that's better than...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-27 07:24:18	Toothpaste on my pimples to make them go away. Stings a bit. Hope Colgate Total works as a home remedy & isn't too technologically advanced
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-27 04:41:15	"honest, intelligent, kind, witty." from another friend brings the count to 14
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-27 04:39:35	from a friend: Brains. Beauty. Tons of caring friends. Sense of humor. 10 blessings and counting.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-27 04:34:45	disgruntled, cranky, surly, trying to count my blessings. 6 so far. Nieces, job, health, boyfriend, rent-stabilized apartment, born in US
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-27 01:24:58	less weighted down, still melancholy... apprehensive about couples therapy on Sunday... a new beginning, or the beginning of the end?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-26 22:15:51	thought the sunshine would energize me, instead I feel like Harrison Bergeron
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-26 21:31:57	RT @psychcentral : You Really Can’t Lie to Yourself #http://bit.ly/9OvA1U
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-26 20:47:44	lost a follower... guess the state of my skin is not a good twitter topic. Maybe this was a silly idea.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-26 09:42:14	SO need a facial, subcutaneous acne erupting like wildfire... painful, but less disfiguring than you might think
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-26 07:46:47	I still don't think twitter is as much fun as Facebook. And I have like 1200 friends on FB. So far twitter isn't wowing me.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-26 07:08:08	back hurts: b/c it's raining? b/c I'm down? b/c my body wants to get my mood off my mind and is staging a distraction? annoying
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-26 04:00:51	and back to feeling dreary... I really think it's the endless rain. Why do I feel so blah and blue?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-26 03:32:59	energized after an awesome group supervision session... I'm not the only one who struggles with groups!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-26 01:28:23	@PsychTimes DSM-V is a crock of... you know what
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-26 01:27:39	anniversary gift for JV: what's a good tennis racket for a guy who plays mainly on weekends? are they all pretty much the same?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-25 23:49:45	strange -- it's Wednesday/hump day, but I'm feeling better, more energetic... got up earlier, managed to shower... still have more to do
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-25 20:18:12	another rainy day... trying not to let the gloom affect my mood
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-25 20:17:45	@partimefabulous my mother is afraid of me "going public" too, that's why I operate anonymously so far, I dream of "coming out" like you did
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-25 20:16:17	@MikeS28E28 I know... I acknowledge their feelings of powerlessness & try not to take it personally... it's just annoying
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-25 20:15:29	@StephenAtHome only if they're loading the rods into a woman belonging to some other man
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-25 08:18:02	right?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-25 08:17:59	but I know it's not personal... they don't hate ME, they hate the PROGRAM... even when they tell me other counselors are better than I am
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-25 06:40:04	still almost 1.5 hours left before I can go home... group tonight was like chewing glass, to keep smiling while they laughed at me >:(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-25 03:11:20	sullen, surly, every kind of cranky... three straight days of rain, and without sunshine I get VERY disgruntled
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-24 09:57:57	itch itch ITCH damn mosquito bites... Jersey sucks, and I hope and pray to move there sometime early in 2011
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-24 08:07:42	quick Google search reveals no evidence that lycopene helps depression, but apparently it's really good for my heart, breasts, and prostate
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-24 07:46:09	eating tons of raspberries and cherries in hopes that LYCOPENE will cure my depression
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-24 05:43:11	cranky cranky cranky CRANKY CRANKY CRANKY stupid weather
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-24 04:43:40	when will this day be OVER? I feel like I never knew how to be a therapist, and all day I've just hummed a few bars and faked it
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-24 01:34:43	laughing @shitmydadsays ... guess I'm not as depressed as I thought I was
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-24 01:18:16	I'm drowning. Is it the rain? I'm so depressed. Can't concentrate, feeling of dread hovering in the pit of my stomach.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-24 01:09:38	why is resentment so easy and forgiveness so difficult?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-23 23:18:55	Booked a busy Sunday for JV & me: 11 a.m. couples counseling, 2:30 pm color job/haircut for me, haircut for JV. Should be interesting.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-23 22:26:28	I miss blogging openly and getting comments on my posts. If I write an entry on my blog and nobody reads it, have I really said anything?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-23 22:25:29	...and the thought of losing JV shatters me
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-23 22:25:12	I shouldn't blame JV for my most recent hospitalization, but I do. Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-23 22:07:27	does Lindsay Lohan have bipolar? does Britney? does it matter? it's a crappy disease, but you have to learn to live with it
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-23 22:00:59	sad gray Monday morning... feeling lonely and insecure. Doesn't rise to the level of clinical depression, but that doesn't mean it's fun >:(
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-23 09:09:02	maybe I should ask my shrink for Ketamine, since it interrupts bipolar depression; he'd probably just say, exercise more, lazybones!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-23 01:51:47	everyone thinks JV should marry me except... JV!!! >:( went to a birthday party for 7yo twins and everyone says, "when's the date?" Gd knows
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-22 22:26:19	@DailyZest a good nap can be delicious
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-22 22:24:23	@ActuallyNPH TEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-22 22:23:33	@MikeS28E28 why, do they snore?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-22 22:23:07	and visiting JV's grandmother in Brooklyn... had to let the Malchicks bring their DSes, otherwise they would be unbearably rowdy
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-22 22:22:36	going to a birthday party for twins... hope there is CAKE
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-22 22:22:19	having a good time so far... cooked a lotta food, washed a lotta dishes, scratched a lotta mosquito bites... typical Jersey weekend
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-20 22:38:45	sinus pressure: check. knotted shoulders: check. achy knees: check. When I say TGIF, I could be in synagogue because it sure is a prayer
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-19 19:58:12	not in the mood to go to work... why did I think I wanted to be a therapist? I am having trouble rustling up my empathy
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-19 06:41:15	show me the way to go home... I'm tired and I wanna go to bed...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-19 03:24:33	feeling blue... I hate working nights, I'm a morning person
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-18 22:49:54	okay... time to put on some clothes and pretend I'm a therapist... can't sit around in my underwear all day
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-18 07:42:56	@ElianahSharon ANY night!
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-18 06:23:38	NOT in the mood to write that group note...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-18 06:22:57	I wanted to discuss making amends as part of recovery from drug use, but none of them thought K-Rod had anything to apologize for
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-18 06:20:06	unintentionally hilarious group - K-Rod's apology to me falls short, and they think he was justified in hitting Pena for dissing K-Rod's mom
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-18 04:49:59	still dragging... wish my knees were better so I could exercise myself out of this funk
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-18 01:25:06	lesson learned: if I mope and make myself miserable for no good reason, it will still take time and effort to pull myself out of the slump
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-17 21:28:52	Got a bill for $329.80... at my annual exam, they sent my blood to a lab my insurance doesn't accept. Do NOT feel like dealing with this...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-16 09:35:27	my boyfriend's son offered to PAY his brother to get him on board for us to get married... how cute is that? ;)
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-15 22:45:21	the malchicks are TOTALLY ready for a stepmother... why isn't JV ready for a wife?
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-15 22:44:39	@MikeS28E28 packing always sucks, packing for 6 sucks extra
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-15 22:44:15	@ElianahSharon I rely on melatonin
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-15 05:02:38	Neil Patrick Harris is pregnant. I'm happy for him. But when do I get to fall pregnant with twins???
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-15 00:40:34	I have followers, I exist!!! Relaxing at home with JV and the malchicks, who are -- as usual -- watching Pokemon...
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-13 23:14:04	grumpily slogging through another day of cheering up ex-offenders in recovery from substance abuse. They would prefer a drink. So would I.
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-13 05:08:01	I've been on twitter for hours, and still have NO FOLLOWERS! How is that possible? I thought this social networking this just, like, happens
177560914	ayelet_survivor	2010-08-12 21:30:12	Let's see if I can develop a HUGE devoted international following. I'm a narcissist; I need the reinforcement.
