1662859214	AtSeSu	2016-05-18 10:11:34	I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http:// youtu.be/ql8p9XBQKDE?a FIVE LIFE CHANGING PRODUCTS!!!!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2016-01-01 09:14:46	BUT, the year wasn't a total bust. I lost 3stone (and still going). I'd still like to not be mental though..... pic.twitter.com/aHLrj9JW5O
1662859214	AtSeSu	2016-01-01 09:13:50	So, 2016.... The yea they discover a cure/effective treatment for mental illness. Or just bipolar would be grand. Over this illness.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-10-16 18:45:13	@tweety123pie Nope. A general study mentor who I haven't met yet but no-one mental health specialised. I'm pretty lost with no support.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-10-16 18:14:05	So.....uni has triggered all of the everything and I'm becoming very unwell after only two weeks. Don't know what to do. Boo ya sucks.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-10-13 18:23:04	Current feelings about uni is it's hell on earth. Starter project is just all of the triggers, not quite sure how I'm going to get through.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-10-06 18:53:18	In a gothic lecture, completely distracted by the girl in front of me and her hair extensions.....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-10-06 02:07:51	I did it! Got through day one of uni! Now just to get through the next three years.......yikes.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-10-05 04:37:46	I start uni, again, tomorrow. So scared but excited too. I hope this is the time it sticks!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-18 05:51:27	This lady was my hair inspiration. Rocking a pixie long before they were acceptable. Jean Seberg. pic.twitter.com/nloLooJFkY
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-18 05:46:27	@La1aBr0wni3 I'll take that! I had it short for years then grew it out. Happy to retire the rollers for a while!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-18 04:38:02	@La1aBr0wni3 out just made me realise even more how awful she was.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-18 04:37:38	@La1aBr0wni3 It hit me so hard because I just wasn't expecting it from someone supposed to be on my side as it were. Typing the whole thing
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-18 02:22:12	@ladybirdspam Ah that's shit. Plod we do though. I'm doing okay, okay enough to be starting uni, shot disability advisors notwithstanding!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-18 02:15:10	@ladybirdspam Thank you x How have you been keeping? I've fallen out of the Twitter habit of late.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-18 02:00:34	So after yesterdays car crash meeting, today I went and got my hair did. It's all gone and I love it! pic.twitter.com/cY8fRWrpwN
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-18 01:59:41	@La1aBr0wni3 Head of dept. emailed me so I have replied with details of the whole sorry affair. Truly dreadful.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-17 05:08:38	@IamSecretL Said whilst painting at Dalai Lama quotes printed and stuck to her office wall. Just awful. Awful awful.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-17 04:44:44	@IamSecretL She also said she doesn't think she's ever experienced depression because of her faith. Thanks for that shaming.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-17 04:44:14	@IamSecretL I think she meant using mania. I explained I don't get mania because I'm BPII. Cars crashing everywhere from her mouth.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-17 04:40:20	@IamSecretL I just can't let it lie. She's been in the job 10+ years, jut an unbelievable attitude.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-17 04:39:15	@IamSecretL I think I'm fine. It was distressing because she's supposed to be my advocate of sorts and she was clueless.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-17 04:34:52	@IamSecretL I've sent an email asking who I can raise my concerns with to the general disability department. I cried afterwards.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-17 04:25:19	"You don't look depressed". "Bipolar people often use it to their advantage". So much fail from uni disability advisor.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-17 03:00:11	Shall be making a complaint, left feeling minimised, shamed and sad. Opposite of the desired effect.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-09-17 02:59:32	Uni disability assessor didn't know what bipolar 2 is and told me her faith stopped her getting depression #FML
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-08-28 17:04:55	@La1aBr0wni3 och no doubt I'll be back to Twitter at some point with all my uni shenanigans!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-08-28 07:31:44	@La1aBr0wni3 But yeah, all still a massive balancing act and always exhausted. Just got to keep trying though, tough old bird I am.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-08-28 07:31:01	@La1aBr0wni3 I now run 3.5 miles 3-4 times a week, have lost 2 stone (so far) and start uni next month! All go.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-08-28 07:30:16	@La1aBr0wni3 I've just fallen out of the habit currently! I'm doing okay, still mental and function as such but lots happening.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-08-06 17:04:19	@LillaJade Haha, feel free. If you join MFP I'm VintageFeline ;)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-08-06 17:02:04	@LillaJade That's absolutely it! Once my head was in the right place it all just clicked. It's been pretty easy so far!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-08-06 16:56:14	@LillaJade whatever I want but I have to weigh and log it. It makes me accountable and learn moderation.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-08-06 16:55:46	@LillaJade I think my issue with those is that we perceive an end point to the diet. Just old fashioned calorie counting means I eat
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-08-06 16:50:11	@LillaJade thank you. I hit 2 stone lost this morning! I need new pants!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-08-06 16:49:22	@LillaJade I use MyFitnessPal to weigh and log everything I put in my mouth!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-08-06 16:48:16	@LillaJade No secret, resistance training for appearance and calorie deficit for weight loss. And commitment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-07-13 07:40:01	Reliving some past @RuPaulsDragRace and Jinx during the makeover challenge is my favourite #ikilledjudygarland
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-07-04 21:16:12	I know I haven't been about much but here's an update on my fitness/health progress http:// pic-collage.com/_vYFEhcYH pic.twitter.com/whJQtT6zCM
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-07-03 16:18:02	"Oh I think I might have that" No, just no, don't minimise me in that way, it's not on.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-16 23:12:25	Central London when it's vaguely warm = busy sweaty hell.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-16 22:30:53	Cabinet of Curiosities. Wow.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-16 20:06:51	Erm, what are you doing at an exhibition with a sodding Reilly suitcase?! Get outta my way lady!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-16 19:00:17	Hullo Twitter! I've been busy doing life, how are you all?! Off to Savage Beauty today, excited!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-06 21:10:50	Guacamole, mole, mole, mole. I just made some guac and it's delicious! Thought I'd share.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-06 20:06:44	@LithiumLibGirl Thank you! MyFitnessPal and I are besties now!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-05 19:27:38	So I'm still doing "Insanity". I'm about a week behind schedule because of life but still going! Big changes! pic.twitter.com/LxQqEO6sEo
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-05 00:38:11	@rabbitsoup_zola Thank you! I can see weight gone from my face now, which is a bit satisfying!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-05 00:17:39	Splashed out and had my roots done at a salon for a change, it's such a pretty blonde now, no pink for a week or two! pic.twitter.com/zCL6R1RSXP
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-01 19:53:31	To regularly scheduled programming if Insanity and lots of healthy goodness.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-01 19:52:27	Slept better than I have in a very long time last night, it was bliss! Now taken myself to lunch, all of the food! Treat before back
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-01 05:42:14	Going the whole 7.5mg zop hog tonight. I really need some good sleep. Fed the cats late so hopefully Dave is too full to annoy me tonight!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-01 04:18:04	If I don't get some good sleep tonight me and my wonky brain are going to be having a massive fall out. I only got about 5 hours last night.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-01 04:15:30	Met some lovely people, will be doing the events once a month and spent today sharing wise cracks with Philip Sallon. Not a bad weekend!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-01 04:14:50	This makes me really worried about how I'm going to cope with uni, just have to hope I'm overthinking it! Otherwise I really enjoyed it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-06-01 04:14:04	So, I basically "worked" both days this weekend at a vintage shopping event I organised. I am so tired and sleeping hasn't been a reward.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-28 03:00:05	I think this says all it needs to.... pic.twitter.com/8Xmwv3FdBb
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-26 21:15:18	Definitely depressed but getting through so far. Still working out (after injury time off) but massively lethargic. Spoon count low.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-25 03:21:29	Still happy as a clam about my car boot finds today. Horrockses, for £7, dead stock jewellery for little money. Jackpot today.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-24 21:46:26	Car boot happiness today. Bargain of a lifetime Horrockses skirt and a bunch of dead stock jewellery. pic.twitter.com/YAcw68Ubrl
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-24 17:31:18	I am carbooting today and with the sun out I am wearing my novelty seaside print skirt! pic.twitter.com/9tTiZJPmzx
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-24 08:50:21	And with that I shall try to take my own advice. Fuck. Start uni soon. AM I ENOUGH!? I hope so........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-24 08:49:35	There's space in the middle there and that middle is good enough. You're good enough. I'm good enough. Living isn't conforming societally.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-24 08:48:47	It makes me so sad that I, and others, have such great expectations of ourselves sometimes. We either function completely or not at all.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-24 08:48:05	The notion that managing a mental illness is all or nothing is bull. "Recovery" is bull. "Enough" is enough. Function where you can.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-24 08:47:01	You know, you don't have to hold everything together all the time. Just keep enough together to make it through tomorrow.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-24 04:33:37	Dave's opinion of #Eurorvision2015 Make of it what you will pic.twitter.com/FtJbVgcKF7
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-22 18:40:16	I can confirm I still have pulled abdominals. Forced rest day. Meh. What a daft injury too *twiddles thumbs* Miss my routine already.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-22 00:12:13	In other news though, new sports bra just arrived, a Panache one. First impressions are it's wonderful for my big old boobies.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-22 00:11:27	And there was me worrying about my rickety knees, it was daft core I should have been concerned with *always maintain proper form*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-22 00:10:43	I have strained my lower abs, an injury I've never had before and I can reliably inform you, it ruddy hurts!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-21 22:16:57	@hardfemme with Feliway spray. If in doubt, look up Jackson Galaxy on Youtube, he's brilliant!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-21 22:16:30	@hardfemme Put the scratching post near where they're scratching. Try different types, mine like cardboard as well as sisal. Spray sofa
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-21 18:24:36	I have yoga mat burn on my elbow. Thanks low plank to high plank, as if you weren't punishment enough!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-21 05:31:17	No cardio tomorrow! I should be excited but it's intense muscle work instead, so called cardio "recovery". My much perkier ass it is!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 19:00:53	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola have taken the brunt of fatty wobbles and they're seeing the biggest changes. 4" off already just there.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 19:00:18	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola Yes, for physical changes related to muscle it is the main thing but for weight it's calories. My bum and hips
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 18:57:26	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola Exercise isn't really the magic panacea, it's all about calories in. Exercise helps other stuff though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 18:56:28	@rabbitsoup_zola @debecca BUT, if I hadn't been mentally well enough I couldn't have done it. Don't beat yourself up.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 18:56:02	@rabbitsoup_zola @debecca I have dropped at least one dress size in just the 5 weeks, all muscle. My weight was affecting my physical health
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 18:54:38	@rabbitsoup_zola scales say (they haven't moved but I've dropped many inches, yay muscle). But I could become unwell again and undo it all.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 18:54:04	@rabbitsoup_zola head also just sort of shifted. Diet changed completely, looking forward to working out and not being too fussed what the
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 18:53:34	@rabbitsoup_zola I couldn't go to the gym 1. I hate it and 2. people. So finding a home programme I enjoy has been amazing. I guess my
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 18:52:35	Hmm, think the washing machine may be on its way out, bit clunkier than it should be, bearings I expect. Not my problem though, phew!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 18:51:07	@rabbitsoup_zola Thanks! Still can't quite believe I'm still doing it and I quietly enjoy the pain but it was a beast today.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 18:47:49	Just did Insanity Max Cardio Conditioning *cries quietly in a corner* Never have I ever wished I had a bath not just a shower more *wails*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 00:16:57	Don't get me wrong, I am thoroughly enjoying it still but it wipes me out completely!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-20 00:16:31	So tired. The extra hardcore intensity of month two of Insanity has floored me. Nothing like a reminder you're a #spoonie
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-19 21:32:50	Quite the storm rolling through, thunder, lightening, hail. Glad I'm indoors!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-19 20:27:25	Side suicide drills (burpees) just should not be a thing. Ever. Dying. #insanity #shaunt
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-18 23:50:06	Insanity of a different kind – Let’s get month two started! http:// wp.me/p3OsRg-3C
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-18 19:41:59	Did my first month two Insanity workout. Yes it's a whole other level of hell. And yes I really really enjoyed it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-18 17:05:04	You know what Daily Mail, I LIKE self service tills because it's easier for me than dealing with a person. So up yours to your campaign.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-18 06:34:43	I don't want to go to sleep. Because going to sleep means waking up. And waking up means starting month two of Insanity. Argh!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-18 04:06:49	@Smitchalot Dave is noisy in general, he eats noisily, cleans noisily, smacks his lips whilst snoozing, snores. Total boy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-18 04:04:49	@Smitchalot Dave snores, very loudly!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-18 02:03:16	I start month two of Insanity tomorrow, I'm very scared. So I'm having Indian take away in preparation. Seems legit.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-17 23:15:32	Fitted a new shower riser rail and mounted my bedroom TV on the wall. Yesterday I fitted a roller blind. DIY master!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-17 19:45:24	The number of children trying to burst my eardrums today is exactly why I don't want kids. Not for me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-17 05:10:20	@inmywindow not worried about going back on something at some stage, feels inevitable.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-17 05:09:40	@inmywindow They only really worked for me briefly, then I was worse than ever before. Calculated risk. I'm one of the lucky ones. I am
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-17 05:06:06	@inmywindow And I feel sort of fraudulent for coming off them and doing well (for the moment). Funny how our minds work.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-17 02:17:14	Finally got some proper skirt hangers and now my wardrobe is (temporarily) organised, if a little overstuffed. Accomplishment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-16 01:43:33	All in prep for Insanity month two. Well scared.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-16 01:42:41	And a knee and ankle support because old and creaky. Ankle did not appreciate the support though, selfish.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-16 01:41:57	Bought a new yoga mat (don't like my old one, reasons) for my new bedtime yoga routine. And all of the vitamins and supplements.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-15 20:18:17	I'm in IKEA and Jo Brand is also here. Do I tell her I love her?!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-15 05:28:50	This might be my new favourite thing, so chilled now. Bedtime Yoga Sequence http:// youtu.be/XOTGz-1vizY
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-15 05:26:39	I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http:// youtu.be/XOTGz-1vizY?a Bedtime Yoga Sequence
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-15 01:56:41	I have booked my Savage Beauty ticket at last. I go next month, yay! Now, may I please have the sunshine back?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-14 17:25:00	Hopefully it's just a minor blip and one I can get through. Bit of a test for coping with it happening at uni I think. Urgh I hate this.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-14 17:24:10	Been feeling a bit "off" the last few days and now I think it may be the black dog. Trying to keep to my new routine to keep it at bay.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-14 04:32:31	@rabbitsoup_zola @tweety123pie Oh my! I get night terrors anyway, it's how my PTSD manifests, now I wonder if zop increased them!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-14 04:30:51	@rabbitsoup_zola I still wouldn't look as good as her in that costume though. Give me another month of Insanity and maybe!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-14 04:26:25	I have also killed my shoulders by lugging very heavy shopping home and then working out. Just call me Wonder Woman.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-14 04:25:23	Burning 500+ calories during "Recovery Week" workouts. Petrified about what next week brings with this in mind!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-12 03:15:25	Lovely day. 6 miles covered wandering round Crystal Palace park with a friend I haven't seen in a while. Weather was perfect. Restorative.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-11 18:33:40	I shall be leaving the flat without a jacket, cardigan or brolly. First time this year, don't let me down Mother Nature!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-11 17:59:39	So obsessed with my heart rate monitor, wore it to do the vacuuming. 100 calories right there!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-09 21:37:19	So this morning this happened...... pic.twitter.com/9PsSHnv60d
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-09 19:30:16	Month 1 of Insanity, OVER! With no skipped workouts either. Roll on recovery week (which I'm sure is its own kind of non-cardio hell).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-09 05:04:41	Very glad today is nearly over.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 22:46:55	Right, 5 hours sleep, doom and gloom and it's time for a nap before I have to do my second last workout of month one. Tories can kiss my....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 12:53:35	I have an important phone call at 2pm, do I pop a pill and head to blissful oblivion for a few hours or stay up for all the results.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 12:52:00	We can only hope a small majority means the Tories will be tempered a bit by those in opposition. We can hope.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 12:47:34	Sorry British public but after tonight I don't trust you to vote sensibly on EU membership #GE2015
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 12:41:53	LOL to the guy trying to get a selfie with him giving the finger to Cameron.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 12:31:07	Tonight confirms I am indeed an insomniac without medication. Still bright eyed at 5.30am!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 12:19:57	Croydon North, my constituency, remains a safe Labour seat with Steve Reed.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 12:03:08	Esther McVey out! The silver lining! Well done Wirral West!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 11:52:26	Nick Clegg kept his seat?! How the duck did that happen?!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 11:48:35	Jesus, SU voted Tory because services are just dandy where they are apparently. Tough shit for the rest of us!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 11:47:45	@rabbitsoup_zola Thanks. Craving junk at this point, maybe I'll just make some toast...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 11:38:00	Is Twickenham lady going to cry for Vince Cable? Odd.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 11:33:39	Shut up Boris!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 11:32:38	I did not plan this all nighter at all well. I think it needed cheese, crisps and chocolate. I had some grapes. Starving. #GE2015
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 10:03:12	Getting hungry now. Seems staying up late hunger is not just alcohol driven. *Fantasises about eating pizza*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 09:55:58	Dave the cat not impressed with the election so far. pic.twitter.com/1FDSoslixY
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 09:48:24	@MaiaMoxie It's just too awful, the vulnerable have been shafted for 5 years and it looks like we're in for another 5.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 09:45:58	@MaiaMoxie It's okay, vanity is one of my specialist subjects! Plus, temporary distraction from bleak election results.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 09:44:07	@MaiaMoxie Long bob.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 09:34:06	At this point, I wish moving back to Scotland was a realistic option. Labour, you'd better lurch properly left off the back of this.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 08:21:38	Dave the cat is now being a twat because I'm not in bed. He does like routine!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 07:53:13	Somewhat off topic but may I please have the pink sofa in the @itvnews election studio once you're done with it tonight?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 07:40:13	Oh dear Ken Clarke. #GE2015
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 05:43:31	lifelong chronic but invisible condition. I can't even leave the country because I currently can't work to support myself. Fucking great.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 05:41:56	right to an existence while ill, it's too exhausting especially with little in the way of other support. Pray I'm suddenly cured of my
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 05:40:53	So basically, the exit polls better be wrong because it would mean I and many others are pretty fucked. I can't continuously defend my
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 05:02:26	Fuck. That exit poll is bollocks. Fuck fuck fuck. Please be wrong. #GE2015
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 02:52:26	@sandersn85 I may, I've had a preparatory nap and won't take meds so will see if I last!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-08 02:26:55	Tell me Twitter, which channel will have the best election coverage? Dusting off the TV for the evening!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-07 20:25:41	@Smitchalot In my experience yes, everyone had a laptop or tablet. Tap tap tapping away.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-07 18:09:36	My X is in the box. And now, we wait.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-07 07:15:33	That moment, when insomnia has beaten you and you think fuck it, I'm taking the other half of the tablet only to discover you took none! Doh
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-06 21:35:59	Faded too much in the supermarket, now stuck waiting for bucketing rain to stop or at least ease up. What fun.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-06 21:35:21	Well done Daily Fail, you've outdone yourselves on the vile headline front. pic.twitter.com/KROWi70WF4
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-06 18:13:22	I've just been called a bigot for challenging UKIP supporters on their ill-informed views. Massive LOLs.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-06 04:08:28	Well that's a rather exciting email. Whoop.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-05 23:56:49	Quite amazed I only have 4 days of month one of Insanity left. Did I really do all those workouts!? Looking forward to recovery week!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-05 23:52:59	@rabbitsoup_zola Talk, talk at me, DM me, whatever you need.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-05 16:34:26	Well done Daily Fail, you've outdone yourselves on the vile headline front today. pic.twitter.com/ZFl30VpJzj
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-04 21:02:55	I really wish cat hair didn't create as much mess as it does. That and I wish I didn't create so much mess. Can I be rich and have staff now
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-04 19:30:39	Actually, while people are (not) bringing me stuff. Could someone give my left calf a good massage, a twinge is turning into a strain, argh.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-04 19:26:03	So could someone kindly bring me something yummy, healthy and tasty to eat because I'm not really about cooking today.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-04 19:25:27	Wekk 4, day 1, Pure Cardio and Cardio Abs, 750 calories burned. BOOM! Done in now though as still tired from being "normal" on Saturday.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-04 03:07:06	@LalaBrownie Mebbe's aye, mebbe's naw. Still a rare occurrence whatever the outcome!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-04 02:53:24	When someone sends me their mobile number in an opening online dating message I am always tempted to get up to mischief with it......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-04 01:48:46	Had a rather lovely evening yesterday! Bonus a lady asking if my waist was natural (it is), as it's so "va va voom". Yay for hourglasses!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-03 07:09:38	I GAVE A BOY MY NUMBER!!!!! After a very intellectual conversation about Lego and the 'big fight' on the tube to Brixton.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-03 01:47:37	Half cut already. Lightweight.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-02 23:35:07	Oh, off out for my best friend's 40th, winning in the hair department. pic.twitter.com/w3S8WIJUxM
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-02 23:34:31	Very very drunk man in this train with a very lovely sober girlfriend. I can smell him from here!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-02 17:29:49	And now, to shower. Eyebrow appointment in a bit ahead of dinner and drinks for my best friend's 40th tonight!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-02 17:28:42	626 calories burned today. This is why Insanity is the business. Even with a calorie reduction for weight loss I get to eat loads!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-01 21:07:26	@rabbitsoup_zola I got mine a while ago but I don't think you need it. Confirmed, says on it you don't need it with you to vote.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-01 19:27:45	On the claim form it says it will be a bank transfer. So now I have to go to a bank. Urgh.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-05-01 19:27:05	Not only was claiming back NHS costs for glasses a painful drawn out back and forth experience, I've been sent a cheque, not a bank transfer
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-30 23:51:17	Ah, usual 4pm not enough quality sleep crash. Then come bed time I won't be tired at all followed by hours of tossing and turning. Ugh.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-30 21:44:40	The scaffolders tunes are pretty good, some top late 90s early 00s classics for me to reminisce to!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-30 20:46:02	Just hid from a man going past my window on a ladder (doing guttering or something upstairs). Yup. Still mental!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-30 19:08:27	Feeling unbelievably well at the moment. Sleep still a big issue but everything else is just lovely and even mostly. Long may it continue!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-30 05:32:42	Dave the cat does not like changes to his schedule. I haven't gone to bed yet which is highly unusual, so he's being a dick.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-30 04:01:21	So I had a "cheat" meal today, still within calorie allowance though. But I am actually hungry for the first time in weeks. Lesson learned.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-30 03:17:50	@BipolarBlogger I got a recruiter email about a £40k job in my past life profession. Considered it for a moment, then laughed at myself.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-30 03:17:11	@rabbitsoup_zola This happens to me about twice a week. I thought that was normal.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-30 01:22:21	Plus I bought all of the vegetables. Take that potassium intake!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-30 01:22:01	But, I am now in possession of a Garmin Vivofit and heart monitor. Bring on accurate calorie burn counts! It's getting a bit serious.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-30 01:21:01	Is it bed time yet? I'd like it to be bed time. My 6.30am wake up call and Insanity beasting have left me extra tired today.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 22:57:24	My Parcelforce man is the friendliest ever. Much better than my postie who is the most miserable ever.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 14:29:56	And now the noise has stopped, after making sure I am most definitely awake. *shakes fist*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 14:15:51	Woken at 6.30am by the noise of very noisy power tools in the office opposite. That is not cool, I feel a snotty email coming on.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 06:02:49	@sandersn85 I'm spoiled for choice here and it's mostly good I do miss my Edinburgh haunts though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 05:34:57	@sandersn85 This one is so good. They do not delivery to London though. Sad times.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 05:16:31	Just got the first email in ages from my favourite Chinese take away in Edinburgh, man I miss that food!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 04:35:31	@rabbitsoup_zola bit of a health nut but I'm really enjoying it. Seems 10 years out of the dance studio was break enough!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 04:35:00	@rabbitsoup_zola Avocado on toast will be my new breakfast (ripeness permitting), then green smoothie post workout. I fear I'm becoming a
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 04:25:40	@rabbitsoup_zola Well yes, I suppose so! Eating half a bag of cooked kale can be a challenge too. Avocados are easy though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 04:24:36	@LithiumLibGirl Can't believe I'm in week 3 and really enjoying it still!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 04:24:01	@rabbitsoup_zola I don't mind the taste, I actually like fruit and veg so makes it a bit easier. Just tweaks to get all my nutrients in.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 04:03:50	@rabbitsoup_zola That's exactly what I'm going to do, already got my new shopping list!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 03:58:02	@rabbitsoup_zola Already eating those! I'm way off daily intake, need to overhaul my already overhauled food plan!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 03:24:57	@LithiumLibGirl Well done! I have nothing showing on the scales but have lost several inches so I'm happy enough after two weeks!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-29 03:23:47	Getting enough potassium is now my new mission. Had no idea I was barely eating any! Thanks MyFitnessPal *Some sarcasm*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-27 19:06:37	Start of Insanity week three fit test and look how far I've come already! So proud http:// pic-collage.com/_2u9Tr374 pic.twitter.com/GzPdX6Pg1w
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-27 18:05:28	Nice bit of trans a homophobia in the Daily Mail today. Well done. Once again proving what a vile rag you are.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-27 17:26:24	Just waiting for my breakfast to settle and then it's the two week fit test time! Amazed I have stuck out two weeks already! *Proud face*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-27 06:09:51	Mind blown. 600'000 food products available in America, 80% of them have added sugar. Yes, I'm watching a documentary!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-27 03:03:51	Clean flat, clean laundry, clean bedding, clean me, clean PJs. A Sunday like the old days! *Feels a bit smug with self*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-26 22:37:09	My word, so much housework done, on a mission! Almost looks like a normal lives here
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-26 04:08:28	@Smitchalot All the way. The accusers have nothing to gain from this, it's just conspiracy theories so people can justify still liking .
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-26 04:06:17	@Smitchalot I don't know the full story as I've been a bit Twitter lazy but the support he's getting is why people don't come forward.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-26 00:18:29	@fuzz_walk Very!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-25 23:40:19	Final workout of second week of Insanity and I smashed it today after the little hiccup yesterday. Yay! Still enjoying it too, weirdo.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-25 23:39:24	I wish I felt as tired at 11pm as I do at 4pm. Bloody wonky brain.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-25 02:32:53	Er, dear Nige (of Farage), what in the farking fark is a "black part of London"?! I happen to think you're xenophobic by the by.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-24 23:30:21	I've been a terrible Twitterer recently, not in the loop at all but from the snippets I've caught re: abuse by an "advocate" #ibelieveher
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-24 17:42:46	So fatigued today, my body is like nope! So only did have the workout and even that was an epic battle. Better than nothing though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-24 04:56:19	Sadly the hoped for improved sleep isn't a thing for me, still terrible. Still, I have a perkier bottom already, swings and roundabouts.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-24 04:54:47	I'm sure you're all dying to know but yes, still on track with Insanity. Cardio recovery today. Wee bit smug about how well I'm doing!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-24 03:33:35	@rabbitsoup_zola @NyxyNyx And I've honestly not been more "well" in years! I think just being on it for a while reset me a bit.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-24 03:33:04	@rabbitsoup_zola @NyxyNyx lower dose and couldn't drag my arse to the doctor. So a week of hellish insomnia but I rode it out.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-24 03:32:35	@rabbitsoup_zola @NyxyNyx More sensible than me! I went from 75mg to nothing I think, or a did a day on day off because I didn't have
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-24 03:25:04	@NyxyNyx Ha! Me too!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-24 03:21:37	@rabbitsoup_zola @NyxyNyx Small warning, first couple of weeks off completely were withdrawal hell. It does pass though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-23 00:02:19	Plyometric cardio done. Still feel a bit queasy. It's annoying now, so hard to get anything done when you feel pukey.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-22 22:57:04	Just feeling a bit sicky again today so getting hot and sweaty isn't the most appealing! 2.5" off my hips so far is motivating though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-22 22:56:03	Still feeling a bit out of sorts and a bit of wisdom tooth pain thrown in for good measure. Haven't worked out yet either but will.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-22 04:39:29	You know, I've yet to have a sensible discussion with anyone with far right views. They just throw insults at me. Very adult.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-22 04:08:14	Alright sleep, let's have it. No getting up to pee three times tonight eh? All this exercise is not helping with sleep, phooey.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-22 02:08:05	@sandersn85 It's part of an ongoing discussion about St. George's day that has kept me very entertained!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-22 01:41:22	"make sure it's British not Aberdeen Angus" Ummmm.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-22 01:18:03	Finally received a much waited for email. Replied so fast! Now I wait again.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-21 18:30:31	And I feel less sick after the workout too. Who would have thought. Now I can lay on the sofa and feel sorry for myself all day!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-21 18:29:39	Feeling a bit off colour/sicky today but I still worked out. What have I become!? Massive improvement today though with Pure Cardio.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-21 00:16:40	Gosh, so tired all of a sudden. Is it bed time yet? I'd like to sleep now please and thank you.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-21 00:11:46	New blog post, first week review of #Insanity by #ShaunT https:// attentionseekingsurvivor.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/ins anity-of-a-different-kind-time-to-get-sweaty-week-1/ …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-20 22:07:08	@LLouQuiet I wonder if/when I'm able to go back to some sort of work how he'll cope. He has the girls for company but he's a mummy's boy!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-20 21:06:05	@BipolarBlogger Muscle memory is a wondrous thing, being reminded of this myself at the moment!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-20 19:19:39	Poor Dave the cat, I'm doing really well and not spending much tome in bed (other than sleeping), he's really missing his cuddles!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-20 18:28:41	It's lovely and sunny, feel like I should do something with the day, like go prance about somewhere in a killer novelty print for funsies.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-20 17:56:36	Getting fitter and healthier is much harder work in a way I did not expect. Finding it easy to stick to, but hard to eat enough, argh!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-20 17:55:54	I'm also still really struggling to get enough food in with "eating clean". Calories just aren't mounting up as they should!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-20 17:52:01	But yeah, wanting to puke for most of the duration was awful. Maybe no coffee, even an hour before doing it would be wise.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-20 17:51:28	Week 2 day 1 of Insanity. That was the hardest so far, really pushed, felt sick for most of it! But am managing some press up drills now!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-20 05:09:55	Having a bit of a "you're mental so your opinion is invalid" moment after someone went snooping. Bring it, I'm well used to you trolls now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-20 01:59:16	Kiwi friend just spent a month at home. I requested Squiggles and Timtams. I think she brought me some. Too excited!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-19 05:10:22	@sandersn85 But thanks for feeling my pain :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-19 05:10:04	@sandersn85 I'm mostly deaf to it having lived here two years. Just now and again it's especially offensive, like the start of summer!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-19 05:07:08	@sandersn85 I live with traffic lights outside my flat. I get many twats doing it all day and night long. Fun.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-19 05:05:06	@sandersn85 In particular, young men who clearly think they're "gangsta" at 3am. Piss off.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-19 04:57:14	Particularly annoying when you live on a busy road with traffic lights right outside your bedroom window. Turn it down!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-19 04:56:31	Three days of moderately warm weather and everyone with questionable music tastes has to share it loudly out of open car windows.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-19 00:13:54	Never thought eating enough would be a problem. I've had dinner and still have 800 calories left to eat my way through for today!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-18 20:38:31	One very large cat and one very little cat, both far too cute and having a snuggle. pic.twitter.com/XHvxjQpe1v
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-18 19:48:05	I think all 6 Insanity workouts in a week is pretty good going! So have put a wash on and will see if a nap is forthcoming.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-18 19:36:06	Hmm, planned on a little housework today but think it may need to be a nap instead #selfcare
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-18 18:33:04	Proof I scrub up VERY well, post Indanity workout red face. Shaun T is the best kind of pain inflictor. pic.twitter.com/rV1f29rIIz
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-18 17:09:33	Plus, Dave the cat actually let me sleep last night and this morning, so that was lovely.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-18 17:08:20	"Sciatica bum" seems to be improving, just need to remember to give it a good stretch every day. But no pain in left buttock today, yay!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-18 17:07:10	Anyway, morning! Breakfast eaten, now settling then it's final workout of the week before rest day tomorrow, whoop! Look at me go!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-18 17:06:18	The Daily Mail really really hate Nicola Sturgeon don't they? Even more than Ed Miliband. It's sort of laughable so called "journalism".
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-17 22:19:38	Londoners so confused by the current weather, some in shorts, some in duffel coats with good up. Tricky seasonal transition fashion!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-17 20:14:04	@LithiumLibGirl Yep, even a few weeks ago I was still struggling to get out of bed, going on 2 years plus. A week of workouts is so alien.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-17 20:12:35	@LithiumLibGirl So far not too bad pain wise, although old injuries are flaring up, reminding me they also benefit. It does feel good!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-17 20:10:51	@LithiumLibGirl Just managing a week is such an achievement! Depression robbed me of any motivation and anxiety stopped me going to classes.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-17 20:05:19	@LithiumLibGirl Thank you, most exercise I've done since leaving dance college too many years ago!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-17 18:32:33	Also still fighting exercise induced panic attacks. Today was the worst, the intense cardio triggering massively but working through it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-17 18:31:40	PS. Could do with a good sports bra, two tops is a bit sweatier than I'd like......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-17 18:30:54	Day 5, Pure Cardio, done. Sort of. Done as I can do it at this point! But definitely improving already, so happy I've nearly done a week!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-17 17:24:57	Dave the cat thinks it's time to get up and have breakfast when the sun starts coming up. I'm not terribly impressed with this......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-17 00:41:25	So full of beans this afternoon. Hypo? The elusive euthymia? Benefits of exercise already having an effect? Don't really care, enjoying it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 23:09:18	Day 4, "Cardio Recovery". Recovery my jelly legs and ass! Liked it though. Seems I like working out. News to this former gymnast and dancer!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 21:42:33	The cats are not about getting out of bed today! pic.twitter.com/DKonK2bTyZ
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 21:29:55	Still waiting for delivery, could have done my workout, which I'm now chomping at the bit to do but don't want to miss courier! Bah!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 19:25:07	And I say enjoying in a sort of pleasure is pain way. Because it is exceedingly hard! Also hard to eat enough, which is also weird and new.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 19:23:37	I got more sleep last night so should be better equipped for the workout than yesterday, which was hell. Actually quite enjoying it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 19:23:01	Waiting for the courier and then, you've guessed it, another Insanity workout. Once again sorry for the name of the thing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 19:20:35	@BipolarBlogger LIES! I don't even have a balcony let alone plants!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 05:32:07	@sandersn85 That's okay, I don't post for help, just to vent. Empathy always welcome!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 05:19:04	@sandersn85 Yeah, the sleep hypnosis and similar generally do nothing for me. Oh how I long for the days I slept no problem.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 04:50:47	@sandersn85 Thanks, I'm certainly going to try!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 04:40:39	So close to a time I can sleep and it not be too early. Meds kicking in nicely, so tired today. Hoping I sleep well!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 03:46:36	8 tops, two cardigans, little money. Win. And summer separates sorted, yay for Bardot tops being all trendy! pic.twitter.com/3Pk2zVnTbB
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 01:57:38	Can't believe how much better I'm feeling with the good weather. Shame it's back to normal tomorrow, nice while it lasted.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 01:56:31	Erm, squatting to clean litter trays shortly after Insanity workout HURTS! DOMS doing their thing. Oh well, at least I know it's working!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 00:12:46	Plus £30 later in H&M and Primark, I have enough bardot tops to see me through the apocalypse!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-16 00:11:42	Didn't get enough sleep last night so struggled but still did day 3/workout 2 of Insanity. So looking forward to bed time though, yawn.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-15 18:30:17	I can confirm, it's bloody lovely in London Town today!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-15 05:46:48	Ya know, I think the exercise of the last two days is helping my sleepy meds be more effective. Actually feeling them, first time in a while
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-15 05:39:58	AND PB&J on toast FOR A SNACK! Seriously, what's not to love!? I actually have to eat more than I currently do. All of the win.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-15 05:37:11	Literally hungry for an anticipated "breakfast tortilla". Hell yeah! All of the nutritionssss!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-15 05:31:56	Oooh, food delivery tomorrow for the Insanity nutrition plan thingy. All of the egg whites and peanut butter! Is it weird I'm excited?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-15 05:05:27	Dear recruitment agencies. I'm not really down with direct to me emails at 10pm at night. Go have a glass of wine and send in the morning!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-15 02:14:43	@LithiumLibGirl I don't know how it works as a gym class as it's a 63 day programme with 12 or so workouts. I'm sure it's still damn hard!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-15 00:50:13	@LithiumLibGirl So hard I didn't even make it through the first round of warm up moves without needing to stop. I am super unfit though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-15 00:45:29	@LithiumLibGirl Well, it lives up to its name, it is intense and then some but the results people get seem worth it. But hard, very hard.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-14 22:33:06	Today's @AbelandCole recipe box offering, saffron risotto with squid. Pretty tasty! pic.twitter.com/6NgjigKfJz
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-14 22:27:34	And yes, I'll probably be a workout bore until I'm done, if I manage to finish it so sorry about that.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-14 22:26:58	First workout proper of the unfortunately named Insanity this morning. Sweet lord, DOMS already, not for the faint hearted!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-14 17:37:56	First workout proper today, I did have a little mini anxiety attack but recovered and finished. Well, finished as much as I could. Lordy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-13 23:25:24	Although no exercise induced anxiety attack, it bubbled a bit but came to nothing, which is a massive plus. Had been worried about that.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-13 23:24:44	Day 1 of Insanity. Just the Fit Test. Damn near killed me! What have I got myself into.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-13 19:59:22	So this just arrived....proof positive any marbles I had left have finally left the building! pic.twitter.com/6d6AmvihG3
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-13 03:32:10	Got out of bed properly today at 10am and have only just got back in. That's quite a result for me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-13 01:02:31	Having weird feelings that being currently med free I'm some sort of fraud. I know that's not true but I'm struggling with it. Is that odd?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-12 23:46:33	Just seen a clip of George Osborne digging and enormous, embarrassing hole for himself on Andrew Marr. Dave's not going to be happy!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-12 07:34:36	I napped. I am now realising this was a mistake. But there were Dave the cat cuddles and they are the most soothing, sleepiest things ever!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-12 05:29:27	Saturday night and I'm looking at loo roll holders. Rock on!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-12 02:59:04	Having no actual idea what time you put something in the oven. Oops.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-11 22:53:39	And now Dave the cat has come for a cuddle. Willpower depleting by the second!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-11 22:51:35	Resisting the urge to nap when so tired is so much harder when you fail to resist getting back into bed......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-11 22:05:05	Once again, Yodel are shit. Redelivery today you say? Why is the damn thing still in the depot then? Is it doorbell operating training day?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-11 22:04:09	I woke up all full of beans so got down to some serious housework. Now slumping badly and still need to rinse shower and hang washing. Argh!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-11 05:05:11	didn't realise! That may make a thing I have bought for a new target a bit tricky. Will just have to see how it goes I guess.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-11 05:04:29	because even just walking up a bit of steep hill triggers major anxiety. I thought I was just very unfit but it's more! All this time I
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-11 05:03:42	any and all attempts to get back in the formerly super fit saddle have been thwarted not just by depression. I'm subconsciously scared
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-11 05:02:42	Hadn't realised exercise induced anxiety attacks were a thing, even though seeing it mentioned has made me realise I have it. No wonder
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-11 03:50:42	Oh dear, I've fallen into a Dr. Phil hole on Youtube. SEND HELP!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-11 02:32:38	Showers are ruddy marvellous things, just wish I could convince myself to have them a lot more often!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-10 23:52:56	@YodelOnline I believe if you check your mentions and DM you will see both pieces of information. I have had no reply to my DM.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-10 23:46:42	@YodelOnline Nope. Silence so far.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-10 23:44:30	@YodelOnline Have done so on my other account @AKittyBitCrafty
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-10 23:35:05	Yodel couriers once again somehow failing to understand how a doorbell works. Missed parcel. Home. Tested doorbell and worked first press!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-10 22:13:38	Waiting for a delivery is tedious regardless of whether you need to go out or not. Always feel in a weird limbo, currently delaying shower.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-10 20:42:23	If as many human athletes died on the race track as horses do, racing would no longer happen but horses? Disposable entertainment. Sickening
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-10 20:28:56	I love(d) @CrabbiesUK but can't support a brand that supports horse racing, in particular The Grand National. So adieu from me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-10 18:51:28	You know, Ed Miliband is starting to bare his teeth a little now and I like it. Becoming less indifferent to him.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-10 11:22:31	Okay, think I'm sleepy, let's give the sleep thing another crack.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-10 11:13:48	And now Dave the cat is snoring louder than I have ever heard him snore, just to rub in how well he's sleeping whilst I listen to birdsong.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-10 11:10:28	4am. Insomnia. Deeply joyous. That last bit may be sarcasm.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-09 05:13:31	Peckish, well, more than peckish. But it's also nearly sleepy time. Shouldn't really eat but my tummy is protesting!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-09 04:58:28	"Why do think foxes decided to move to London" Easily the funniest thing typed in all seriousness I've read this year.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-09 03:28:54	21 years since my Dad took himself off this planet. Time flies and stands still.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-08 19:43:01	Side note, thank goodness for Pets at Home allowing the return of some open food. Cats hate Wainwrights and they'll eat anything!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-08 19:41:27	Just saw my first butterfly of the season! Hello spring, nice to see you!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-08 17:58:06	I have turned the heating off completely, so if there's a cold snap it's my fault. Soz.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-07 18:57:38	I am just about feeling better, the sunshine is helping, as have all of the kitty cuddles. Must try not to overdo it again though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-07 18:56:39	Dave, enjoying all of the pink things, taking advantage of things from weekend guests not yet being tidied away. pic.twitter.com/KRRPeOEQRv
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-07 04:27:39	I don't know what the trans community thought about #transgender kids but I thought it was brilliant, majority of parents doing a great job.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-07 01:58:59	For someone with such poor mental health, mostly marked chronic depression, I'm annoyingly cheerful most of the time. How does that work!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-07 00:59:13	Totally just had a "who is THAT" after seeing a new avatar pic pop up in my feed. It's me, I changed it this morning. Dunce.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-07 00:58:29	Nurse cats still in attendance, Chilli on duty. Dave being a bit naughty, think he's antsy after watching me sleep for two days!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-06 20:39:52	Two twelve hour sleeps and I still feel like death. Socialising is such hard work, harder than I realised until this weekend. Lordy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-06 05:58:45	BUT I loved Gizelle and I loved The Rhythm Shakers and I got my hair cut and styled by my wondrously talented friend. Swings and roundabouts
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-06 05:57:52	I did way too much. Pushed myself too far. Paying now. Foggy and tired and aching and broken. Hope I feel better tomorrow!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-05 19:51:15	Overnight guests on their merry way, I managed some sleep and now trying to decide if enough spoons to go get some supplies.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-05 13:11:33	And of course the cats are more interested in the strangers in the lounge than comforting me after abandoning them so much this weekend!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-05 13:10:09	Completely spent, more than in a long time. This is going to take some time to recover from but oh well.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-05 13:09:25	Now to wait for zopi to kick in so I can finally get some sleep to somehow get through seeing my overnight guests off tomorrow.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-05 13:08:19	Pretty much only just got home, feeling over emotional, I pushed it too far this weekend but also proud I did it and it was a good gig.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-05 10:11:16	Jesus that should say friend! Not even drunk!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-05 10:10:40	I don't want to cut her night short though so sticking it out. Can sleep tomorrow then hibernate for a week at least.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-05 10:09:54	Is forgotten this grind has to stay to the very end of the night, a sort of compulsion. I was over it 3 hours ago.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-05 04:00:57	@rabbitsoup_zola They're more OTT than usual as fuller than my regulars and not trimmed. Feel a bit drag queen!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-05 03:56:16	Harsh train lighting but ready! Going out for first time in aaaages. pic.twitter.com/EYKC15rL7N
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-04 23:32:32	In other news, I am having a BATH. First one in two years! Before you say it, my flat only has a shower, which I use maybe twice a year ;)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-04 23:11:06	totally underestimated how hard and tiring it would be to keep going socially for so long. Want my bed, my cats and solitude.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-04 23:10:06	That's not to say I'm not having and will have a lovely time. It's great to catch up and see people I've not seen in a long time. I just
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-04 23:09:23	I'm so exhausted but not at home and committed to going out tonight with friends staying at mine. Damn. Roll on tomorrow!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-04 20:38:22	Seeing a friend I haven't seen in aaaages and got my Christmas pressies, including awesome vintage bag! pic.twitter.com/gatazMQbR4
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-03 04:07:38	Not watching, waiting for a friend to get off a train. Garage is saying all foreigners have AIDS?! What the actual?!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-03 03:36:32	When you tell someone what station to get off at and they reply "oh fuck do I have to walk up THAT hill?".
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-02 04:30:38	Have to be realistic though and realise working for Dior atelier, including learning French to do so, is probably not on that road!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-02 04:29:26	So I'll never be the person I tried to be "pre-breakdown" but beginning to think there's a little road for me to wend my away round in life.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-02 01:51:53	Dior and I was SO GOOD. Can I just wear couture Dior forever and ever?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 23:45:39	Small empty cinemas are the way forward. With comfy seats. Could hibernate here forever if I had the cats with me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 23:15:32	At a small cinema, about to see Dior and I. Bring it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 18:52:14	In the spirit of constantly trying to push myself, I think I'm going to take myself to the cinema to see Dior and I later!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 08:19:17	@Smitchalot Never found they work. Something else to scratch directly in front though works a treat.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 08:05:36	@nvrbnormlagn Thank you, hopefully the wind won't wake me tonight!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 08:02:08	@nvrbnormlagn 18 months dealing with it is totally agree. Karma for bragging about how good a sleeper I was, haha.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 08:00:33	@nvrbnormlagn I used to be a champion sleeper, then got very ill and it's never come back. I remain hopeful it will return one day!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 07:58:07	@nvrbnormlagn I tolerate fast, hence my weaning down so I have the higher dose option. Just needs must.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 07:57:30	@nvrbnormlagn though and will likely give coming off a go but not whilst sleeping is an issue. Tried promethazine, didn't help, got hungover
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 07:56:41	@nvrbnormlagn Lots of people end up on it long term. If I don't have a good sleep routine everything turns to custard. I did self wean.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 07:53:25	@nvrbnormlagn About a year. It's actually just full dose. Weaned down to 3.75 with the odd full 7.5 but just not doing the job tonight.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 07:40:54	Why?! WHY?! Wide awake after double zopiclone, it's not normal! *has frustrated tantrum*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 07:38:48	I will never understand my body chemistry. Double dosed my zopi as I've not been sleeping great and I'm still awake! Usually knocks me out.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 05:18:00	More GP gold. "I'll just do 3 months of this again, that way you have to come in for a catch up" She's BRILLIANT!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 02:48:38	Really feels like Friday to me. Not in a woohoo it's the weekend way but it just feels like tomorrow is not a week day!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-04-01 01:28:35	If you say Costa is great coffee then I'm afraid I can't take anything else you say seriously #sorrynotsorry
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 23:19:31	Bean burgers and sweet potato (oven) fries for tea. Yum!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 23:14:13	@debecca @Hopingforhope1 Q did add to my weight gain but I was already overweight and have food issues. Pros/cons thing again.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 19:57:19	@debecca When it did work for me briefly I was too tired to actually do anything with my improved mood!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 19:56:55	@debecca The pros/cons thing is a bitch. I don't understand how anyone functions "normally" on it, let alone actually live.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 18:38:54	@debecca I think low doses can be more sedating? I think? I came off it but that's not for everyone of course! Less mental off than on.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 18:36:38	An iPad mini for a 1 year old "to stop arguments". I've heard it all now! #modernparenting
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 18:23:11	A good GP makes all the difference when you're no longer under the care of any other services and mine is absolutely brilliant.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 18:22:19	Good GP appointment. She's happy with everything I'm doing and as I left said "You're doing okay" (in a non-patronising way).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 05:06:19	@inmywindow Oh damn yes, I forgot about the gluten! Argh!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 03:47:36	@Smitchalot They are so much smaller than I remember! Can easily eat it one sitting without noticing. Not that I've done that.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 03:43:23	@inmywindow If the fat used is butter then yes. Carrot cake usually made with vegetable oil, sans buttercream obvs, a safer option.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-31 01:22:23	Grotty weather means not feeling the full benefit of the clock change. Pesky mother nature.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-30 22:36:59	Gave my lovely now of no use pink kitchen bin away on local FB group. Got tulips in return. Fair trade to me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-30 19:48:15	My new kitchen bin has arrived and is in situ. I'm inordinately happy about this.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-30 03:47:16	@BipolarBlogger @donnaladybirdxx I'll get 52 weeks once top of the waiting list. Then bye bye, have fun!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-30 03:46:18	But I am squeaky clean and in my nice squeaky clean bed sheets so being played for a fool in order to obtain treats by the cats is just fine
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-30 03:45:35	I think my cats just played me for treats. Wouldn't eat dinner, I panicked due to Dave's past so whipped out the treats to "test" him. Mug.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-30 00:29:39	@rabbitsoup_zola Fuck it, do an online order to be delivered tomorrow. Job done. No going outside.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-30 00:13:00	@rabbitsoup_zola Thanks! I also have Christmas pin ups :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-30 00:05:42	Proof, bedding changed! Also proof I need to tidy my bedside table. pic.twitter.com/FkPL2S9C8A
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 23:42:40	@rabbitsoup_zola Don't get too excited, I haven't actually done it yet!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 23:39:57	I'm all showered and shaven legged. And you know, I might just change the bedding today too. Clean me AND clean sheets, heaven!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 19:27:21	@rabbitsoup_zola AND I went to a museum and supermarket too. Wow, that's quite a week for me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 19:26:06	Right, getting in the shower. I'm doing it. Right now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 19:25:34	@rabbitsoup_zola rearranging. So changing the bedding too would be big accomplishment!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 19:25:03	@rabbitsoup_zola I've done a lot of housey things this week to be fair to myself! Vacuum, a load of washing, cat fountain cleaning, lounge
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 19:23:26	Must also change the bedding but both showering bedding change may be a bit ambitious for one day.......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 19:22:52	Must shower. When you don't remember when you last showered it's time to force yourself.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 05:21:15	It occurs to me I miss my first pdoc, he's a very good doctor. Stupid NHS and their stupid budgets meaning they didn't keep him.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 04:35:42	Holding out as long as possible to feed the cats in the vain hope I won't be harassed early tomorrow morning. I know this is futile.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 04:28:38	Friend who voted Tory at the last election now won't be. Training to be a midwife and supporting me has shown her the light, woop!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-29 04:27:51	Post election, I'm happy to drive Katie Hopkins to the airport and hang around to make she she does actually leave as promised!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-28 23:49:38	Really struggling with mid afternoon major lethargy at the moment. Otherwise I feel like I'm doing well? Will never understand this illness!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 23:09:06	Jambalaya type thing. Only two portions allegedly, there's mountains of it and it's only 600 calories a portion. Total food win.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 17:50:40	Cat insurance renewal through, from £35 per month to £56 and I'm stuck with them due to claiming for Dave last year. Ridiculous.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 17:34:49	Really love when this greets me in the morning. Said by someone with a mental illness. So far to go with stigma. pic.twitter.com/cJeh8UhUUv

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 17:24:23	It's a sad day she someone with s mental illness joins in with harmful stigma. Not getting involved in the discussion but apparently nobody
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 07:48:22	I am so angry with the Daily Mail right now. I mostly eye roll at them but their reporting on that pilot is irresponsible and damaging.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 07:39:22	Not stirring up too much stigma there are you Daily Mail. Unfit to fly because of depression!? Give me a break. Tragic yes but shut up.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 06:34:05	It's 10.30pm and I want to re-arrange my lounge NOW.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 05:46:52	Um not watching the #BatleForNumber10 so here's a picture of my Dave being more useful than that Dave. pic.twitter.com/TiieAd9n1i
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 04:23:30	@donnaladybirdxx I know! Check out ma big lights, not even on the ceiling blinding us all.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 04:20:40	@donnaladybirdxx I've always called it that too. But currently my lounge has wall lights for big lights which confuddles my mind.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 04:18:13	Got a £75 Amazon voucher for switching internet provider. Buying a kitchen bin with part of it #glamour
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 03:07:38	@donnaladybirdxx Ah the big light. I have had many friends look at me like I'm barking when referring to the big light!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 03:04:11	Um, may be a bit hypo/mixed. Telling people with shitty attitudes all about themselves the last couple of days. Usually more laid back!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-27 01:17:13	Dave the cat dribbled directly onto my eyeball earlier. Not ideal given I'm actually allergic. Eye now feels like an alien imposter.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 05:23:26	Oh geez, tweet about a British product with a French name and get French spammers.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 05:20:27	This just in in Clarkson sympathiserland. He was sacked because of political correctness because the producer he assaulted is Irish.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 04:22:46	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola I like both. Mine was pan fried with tarragon sauce though. Not as fun!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 04:14:57	@rabbitsoup_zola @BipolarBlogger Mmmmm chips. I had fish for tea. Without chips. Chips. Yum.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 02:23:58	I have to laugh at people sharing "no carb" recipes that are basically heart attacks waiting to happen but gleeful because they're "allowed"
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 02:18:00	I'm so popular today, aside from ranting, friends are all talky (via social media, I don't do phones). Lighter nights cheering everyone up!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 02:17:10	@LalaBrownie @TomChivers @GeorgeMonbiot Haha! Quite.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 01:57:33	@LalaBrownie LOL, if only!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 01:44:11	Quite ranty today but people will insist on being idiots. So I will insist on sometimes needing to point this out.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 01:04:27	@annedraya Not ridiculous at all. Being confronted with our limitations is bloody hard to deal with.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 00:40:42	@hardfemme So I assume the same principal is being applied here. In my borough the referrals are separate for pdoc and therapy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 00:40:08	@hardfemme I'm sure this came up in the media regarding cancer patients and not being able to be part private. All NHS or nothing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-26 00:38:00	I've heard it all now, fisticuffs at work are "normal" up north where they're made of "tougher stuff". Okay then. But I'm Scottish. Headdesk

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-25 18:21:14	First time alone in a supermarket that isn't my local in nearly two years. TWO YEARS! Nice change of scenery :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-25 06:40:37	@rabbitsoup_zola Yeah, I made an emergency Boots pit stop but I was in agony until I got home and took them off! Must break in new shoes!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-25 06:35:22	@rabbitsoup_zola I made this error with brand new brogues, fooled by them being Clarks. Worst heel blisters ever far from home. Bitches.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-25 06:33:10	@rabbitsoup_zola Why can't they invent a decent shoe liner that actually does what it's supposed to!? I like a sockless brogue look but ow.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-24 23:26:43	@Smitchalot It perpetuates the myth that mental wellness is equal to positive thinking. It's bollocks is what it is!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-24 23:24:08	@Smitchalot His entire timeline is twee "inspirational quotes" from other people. I find it shaming, not advocating.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-24 05:30:31	I find remembering to order cat supplies on time enough to deal with, let alone a little person growing inside me and then looking after it!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-24 01:42:09	@BipolarBlogger Rosehip oil by itself actually smells, well, not great. Not like roses at all!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-24 01:41:43	@BipolarBlogger I totally get it, I haven't bought them ages due to the cost but I always recommend, too good not to.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-24 01:40:32	@BipolarBlogger But rosehip oil is very hydrating and anti-ageing, something I did notice a difference with when I started using it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-24 01:39:50	@BipolarBlogger Yeah, they're a big a splash out but are the most amazing thing I have ever used, ever and I get through a lot of products!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-24 01:24:18	@BipolarBlogger Dr Dennis Gross skin peel pads, rosehip oil at night and Liz Earke cleanse & polish. My skin savers!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 23:09:54	Car at traffic lights outside my flat just now blaring Mysterious Girl. I'm not sure whether to cringe or commend them!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 20:56:57	@Smitchalot Pretty sure you can get them in Iceland.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 20:49:25	Went to the supermarket. On a Saturday. Didn't have a meltdown. Win.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 07:49:37	Finally watching The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive. We'll see how this goes.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 06:51:47	Oh go on then #3GoodThings 1. I showered! 2. Confirmation of something good (sorry vague) 3. Epic fuss times with Betty the former feral.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 03:22:44	@donnaladybirdxx This is my fear. My psychotherapy, when I get it, will be time limited. Assessor admitted I could be worse off at the end.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 02:54:57	I had a shower! Totally pooped now but feel so much better and my face is happy for some rosehip oil.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 02:42:35	@daisychain124 He is. He is also a massive asshole but the cats are my therapists really and motivation to keep going.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 02:05:24	I mean, of course I'll have separation anxiety but we've been through a lot the last couple of years with me and him being very ill.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 02:04:16	You know, if I go back to uni, big if, but if I do, I wonder if Dave the cat will suffer separation anxiety. Never leaves my side.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 02:01:40	The tickly nose has returned a little. I am less dissociated. May have a sore throat forming. I know, these tweets are riveting aren't they?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 02:00:37	@daisychain124 If anyone had the misfortune to live with me they may quietly do away with me before I was well again. "I'm SO ILL" 24/7
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 01:59:34	@crimefish I wasn't so much into colouring as a kid, more interested in swinging off trees. I wonder where they'd be stocked in a book shop.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 01:56:26	@crimefish I think it's more that they're more intricate and detailed than kids colouring books. I have some and love them!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 01:53:10	I just ate more pizza than any one person ever should in a single sitting. Feel sick. And still poorly. Send more tea.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-21 01:52:28	@daisychain124 I'm really the worst when I'm physically ill. Even I get fed up with my constant moaning!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-20 23:55:51	I switched my router today. That's enough achievement with a cold right?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-20 20:43:05	Thought I was feeling much better today. I was wrong. The cold is still running rampant and I feel dissociated, which is weird.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-20 17:50:49	Last solar eclipse was brilliant in a very sunny Edinburgh. This one, just like any other grey day in London town. Well done toxic smog.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-20 06:21:17	@AtSeSu Spleen?! See, that's where I am with the aforementioned drugs. I shall be sleeping, internal organs intact.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-20 06:19:52	I have taken so many (legal) drugs I almost feel human. But they'd also bring a horse down so I'm going to spleen soon for my own safety!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-20 03:46:38	Okay, the constant sneezing is beyond tedious now. I want to rip my face off.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-20 00:04:27	I'm terrible at physical illness but I'd forgotten just how much a simple cold wipes me out. Is it bed time yet?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-19 23:38:48	@Rethink_ Er, this seems very fence sitty to me and doesn't really tell me where Rethink stands on what could be mandated or coercive.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-19 22:23:42	This IAPTS in Jobcentres thing feels like a slippery slope to mandating treatment. Last place I want to go for therapy is the Joncentre.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-19 22:08:47	@rightsnet @DramaLlama85 IAPTS in Jobcentres!? FFS.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-19 22:07:52	I still have a cold. The worst bit is my allergies are uncontrollable, sneezing constantly! Urgh. Oh and I feel like shit. Yay for me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-19 05:16:28	Gross observations of a (sort of) new glasses wearer. Blowing of nose requires extra care due to risk of snotty glasses #TMI #sorrynotsorry
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-19 03:28:13	@fuzz_walk Ah lovely, ta.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-19 03:27:58	@WitchBrain That would be the best. I didn't really want take away but wasn't able to cook. Home made broth would be the one!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-19 03:14:08	@WitchBrain I had take away, am currently stuffed. Pre-emptive broth for tomorrow would be good though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-19 03:11:35	12 hour update. I still have a cold. Send tea.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-18 20:20:53	@hardfemme always encourage adoption of those, particularly ones with perhaps health issues. Either way, cats are ace!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-18 20:20:23	@hardfemme lap to sit on and the odd play session. Much more mellow for the most part. Older cats can find it harder to find a home so I
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-18 20:19:53	@hardfemme Kittens are hard work, lovely hard work but it is like having a baby, sleepless nights, naugtiness etc. Older cats often want a
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-18 19:07:44	I have a cold. One trip to the pub and I have someone else's germs. Bastards. Not happy. Excuse me while I wallow in self pity.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-18 05:36:40	How long does the cold virus incubate for? Think I may be getting sick after rare outing to the pub on Saturday, that'll teach me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-17 05:19:45	I'm on a fast day, which is fine generally but I suddenly got hungry. So if someone brings me a pizza I can't guarantee I won;t inhale it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-17 03:39:19	@LLouQuiet @DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger From a layman point of view of course!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-17 03:38:58	@LLouQuiet @DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger I think this is what she's banking on, scaring you silent. I haven't seen anything defamatory.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-17 02:46:10	@drinksinthedark @annedraya This is my fear about going back to uni, even when well the type of course means full on. Can but try though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-17 02:19:21	@drinksinthedark No not at all! Not about you at all, don't worry. This was significantly more than 5 tweets!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-17 01:41:18	Bunch of teenagers and their teachers in running gear being enthusiastic and noisy outside my flat. Stop enjoying cold physical activity!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-17 01:35:27	Why send one tweet when you can send 3000 saying the same thing, reworded, in quick succession! My, Twitter is lively today.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 22:31:12	@Harryshelper I guess I don't know if I should even tell her my concerns, just unfriend and forget about it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 22:28:26	@Harryshelper with my mother and we've had none since those initial ones. I just don't want to be unfair to her.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 22:27:50	@Harryshelper I don't think it's dishonesty, just a natural progression of events. I obviously have no idea what conversations she's had
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:21:15	@bo_novak @UKstandalone Which is why I eventually took enough and walked away. I wasn't going to be blamed so outwardly any more.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:20:44	@UKstandalone @bo_novak Yes, I know you guys are there if needed. I have a strong support network so mostly do okay.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:20:11	rights to make decisions for herself and her family that she's comfortable with.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:19:51	but can't see that happening whilst she has contact with my mother and the paedo. Thoughts? Is that unfair to cousin who is within her
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:19:09	a bit too much of a mind fuck to deal with. Should I tell my cousin the reasons for removal? I would have liked to rekindle the friendship
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:18:31	so I don't see any comments but the tell tale replies to nothing show it's happening. I'm considering removing cousin because I just find it
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:17:47	mother/daughter way (for both of them I suspect, cousin doesn't have a great relationship with her mum). Now my mother has blocked me on FB
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:17:09	Since though it has become apparent that she is actively fostering a relationship with my mother and my mother her. Clearly in a replacment
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:16:23	expressing her horror and saying she fully supported me. Said she felt sick that she had her children round both my mother and the paedo.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:15:47	Okay, need neutral points of view on something. When I started my blog, a cousin who was a good friend when we were teens sent me messages
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:12:48	@bo_novak @UKstandalone Knowing they all think I'm the one who has a warped perception of events. Better alone than in all that though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:12:15	@bo_novak @UKstandalone It's hard being the one left alone while they all carry on, believing their own lies. That's the hardest part for me
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 21:07:26	@bo_novak @UKstandalone It did take me 20 years, I'd lived a lie and felt a liar the whole time. I have mostly been supported, it's not easy
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 20:56:18	@UKstandalone My whole immediate family are toxic, I had to walk away for my own mental, and at times, physical, safety.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 18:48:56	Exciting day of email watching, postie waiting, meal box delivery waiting ahead. Will the fun never stop!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 17:50:04	@BipolarBlogger LOVE Empire Records. Definitely one of the films and soundtracks to my youth. Must re-buy now lost soundtrack in fact!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 16:46:35	@inmywindow my whole damn life! It was so natural and all made sense to me. Desperate to be well enough to get my degree.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 16:46:05	@inmywindow Yeah I did home economics in high school (not GCSE) then did a City & Guilds and discovered it's what I should have been doing
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 16:44:41	Morning! Nothing like your cold cats paw on your forehead feeling like a persons hand to panic wake you!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 16:43:33	@inmywindow a Bernina, their "workhorse" machine goes forever but they're about £800 and also weigh about 800lbs!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 16:43:03	@inmywindow I didn't sew until my 20s, my mother wasn't interested. Digital ones are nice, it's good just pressing a button. I'd really love
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 16:39:09	@inmywindow If I go back to uni I'd like to invest in an overlocker too. Well, I'd like one full stop but will be useful for uni.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 16:38:05	@inmywindow This. I'm a mechanical machine girl, too much to go wrong on a digital one! pic.twitter.com/nh48XJvg4M
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 16:28:38	@inmywindow It's a great machine, the tension crapped out on mine and a service would be as much as the machine so I just got new.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 06:24:24	@drinksinthedark Yes, I make real efforts to keep mental note of little bits of good hopefully to help through the not so good and terrible.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 05:49:39	@inmywindow I have this machine, it was my first! I have a fancier one now :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 05:38:34	What's mother's day all about when you're estranged from she who birthed you?Happy Mother's Day - to me! http:// wp.me/p3OsRg-3x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 05:35:40	@drinksinthedark Thank you. I've been doing really well moods and anxiety wise. It's nice to see its impact elsewhere too.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 05:33:28	Don't worry, I won't get too giddy. I am, after all, still mental, so who knows what tomorrow or next week or month or year will bring.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 05:32:42	happened. A glimpse of hope for something more than dashing to the supermarket once a week perhaps? Uni even?! The possibilities!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 05:31:58	definitely tired today and can feel I'll be ready for sleep soon but I could function on a basic level today. I don't know when that last
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 05:31:07	I just realised something! I went out for a few hours yesterday, with PEOPLE and it didn't floor me with exhaustion today! I mean, I'm
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 05:27:17	@Smitchalot Euphemism?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 05:26:32	@BipolarBlogger Yay to feeling okay! I cling to those moments as hard as they are to remember at times.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 05:20:49	@weeissa I can still double dose and my sleeping is okay at the moment, they do help. I'm very careful as sleep aids are tricky long term.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-16 03:33:18	@debecca I think this is called keeping their options open. They're not really interested but want to keep you as a back up. Tell him to FO.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 20:44:38	The cats have just treated me to Chinese take away for lunch........Okay, I ordered and paid for it, I'm pretending to be appreciated!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 18:10:16	@DramaLlama85 If you look at one of my vlogs you can hear it! As I said yesterday, my hair is infinitely cooler than I ever hope to be!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 18:02:05	@DramaLlama85 lovely accent! I quite like it as it is too now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 18:01:46	@DramaLlama85 Yep, working with people, moving around the world and making myself understood have all softened mine. Apparently I have a
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 17:59:38	@DramaLlama85 Although it's not as posh now, it's a very neutral Scottish accent.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 17:59:07	@DramaLlama85 Private school scholarship. Hated the damn place!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 17:57:13	@DramaLlama85 I think it's fine! My brother has a much broader accent than these guys. I have a posh Edinburgh accent so I'm mostly okay.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 17:41:07	New post, reflecting on what today means to someone without their mother through choice. Happy Mother’s Day – to me! http:// wp.me/p3OsRg-3x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 17:38:48	Happy Mother’s Day – to me! http:// wp.me/p3OsRg-3x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 06:40:03	@weeissa They don't do that to me any more unfortunately. I remember when they did though, the good old days!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 06:31:18	People who reply to a tweet they don't like with "well what about this irrelevant to the tweet thing" are annoying douches.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 06:12:38	@rabbitsoup_zola Way to one-up me, thought I was hard done by not eating since breakfast! Also starving.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 05:46:55	So hungry. But have taken zopiclone so no going back. Plan to eat like a demon tomorrow. One meal all day, what was I thinking!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 05:15:56	@WitchBrain When I was a "professional" I still did the mad hair, clients were sad when I changed it briefly.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 05:14:58	@WitchBrain No-one has ever dismissed me on appearance, quite the opposite in fact. The few people who judge me aren't worth my time.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 05:13:47	@WitchBrain I fully plan to age disgracefully, if I have to be mentally afflicted I'll be happy in other ways to make life bareable.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 05:12:32	@WitchBrain People annoy me. That's their insecurities being manifested and used against others, it's a human trait that sucks big ones.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 05:11:14	@WitchBrain Again, who cares. There are loads of older ladies on the "rocking" scene and other niche styles who rock it regardless.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 05:08:47	@WitchBrain Helpful Lady not so helpful then. Ugh. Wish I could give everyone confidence to just do whatever the fuck pleases themselves.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 05:07:33	@WitchBrain Ah that's just an "of their time" thing. Some photos of me in the 90s would be horrific now! I still don't care, I liked it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 05:03:54	@WitchBrain I firmly believe it's mostly attitude, I don't give a fig who stares (ironic for socialphobe) and so pull off most things.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-15 04:57:13	I went to the pub today, with new glasses and was sociable and everything! I look a bit nakey in this pic, I'm not! pic.twitter.com/Bx9v5kfzQ2
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 20:21:24	@BipolarBlogger @drinksinthedark Jesus. Some people are so inexplicably vile.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 19:44:44	My view this morning. Snoozy Dave the cat. pic.twitter.com/EnWlJLufJM
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 19:38:01	After talking about first messages online dating recently, just been asked if I'm interested in a cuckold relationship. Wrong site buddy!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 18:28:25	Wearing glasses for the first time in years is weird, I feel like I've constantly forgotten to take my sunglasses off!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 18:06:59	I'm often sad I'm not more involved but then I wonder how I'd cope if I was close to all these people. So much tragedy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 18:06:10	Third death on paternal side this year, all in same family (mum, daughter, son). I'm not close to them but really feel for those that are.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 04:30:02	There's a lot of cheese talk by the local cheese monger on my local FB group tonight. So now I really want to eat a lot of cheese #hungry
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 03:29:34	@BipolarBlogger thing is treated. I'm mostly depressed but ADs also do nothing for me, then Q stopped working so fucked if I really know!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 03:29:03	@BipolarBlogger She's been on ADs for years with little effect. I'm not saying it's wrong, just interesting the different ways the same
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 03:26:11	@BipolarBlogger of treatment, which again I find interesting as my pdoc had it as a sort of only if nothing else works thing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 03:25:32	@BipolarBlogger Yes, it was the ADs without a mood stabiliser due to that very fact that puzzles me. Her pdoc wants lithium as second line
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 03:22:33	I stand corrected, they suspect BPII. Still interesting med combo.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-14 03:17:20	Someone I know just been dx with BPII, being put on an SSRI/tricyclic combo, is this usual? Currently on venlafaxine. Just nosy!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-13 03:56:02	@Smitchalot Just you wait for the defiant "teenage" years. Oh boy!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-13 03:24:03	Bought is to buy, brought is to bring. When did the two become so interchangeable
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-13 02:08:57	What's happening Twitter? I'm doing the watched pot thing with emails currently. It's terribly exciting.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-13 02:07:53	So.............
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-12 20:47:45	Ordered new glasses from Glasses Direct on Wednesday afternoon, they are already in the post on their way to me! Very impressed!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-12 01:04:03	That view may change very soon, depending on how long I stay feeling this well for! Hopefully not too soon!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-12 01:03:21	Given that I'm feeling well, I'm having a moment of positive self reflection and have concluded I'm a tough old bird when it gets down to it
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-11 19:15:16	And AND, I just made a phone call without fretting about it for 3 hours! Can I stay like this forever and ever please?!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-11 19:11:52	Dare I say, I'm almost feeling like a regular human being at the moment. I mean, mood wise. Amazing what sunshine does for me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-11 18:48:36	London you are really spoiling us with these glorious sunny mornings!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-11 03:51:22	@AtSeSu There was a photo to go with that last tweet, here it is! pic.twitter.com/5ODzcmhCiX
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-11 03:50:14	I will never understand why a perfume needs 12 fragrances. Unnecessary and too heavy for my taste. KISS applies when it comes to smells.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-11 02:54:02	@Smitchalot Dave, all 7.5kg of him, still tries to curl up under my chin! My being able to breath is optional when it comes to cuddles.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-11 00:05:27	Anyone needing new specs, Glasses Direct have buy one get one free but also 50% off this month. Made me happy anyway.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 23:30:34	@lizearle goodies have arrived, thanks to the lovely greengrocer downstairs for taking the parcel! pic.twitter.com/Py15IL5hqi
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 19:38:28	@BipolarBlogger Haha! I'm sure my boobs also enjoyed the spring clean!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 19:28:13	Plus, I've already showered, that's a mid-morning win in my books.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 19:27:46	Eye test day. Time to find out how blind I'm getting!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 08:21:31	"Oh I'm so sleepy" *Turns off lights, gets comfy* BING! "Hi, this is your brain here, care to go over that relationship from 2004?"
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 07:49:00	@rabbitsoup_zola @mindofabipolar @houndontherun And they actually use it as an appetite stimulant in cats, I later found out.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 07:48:40	@rabbitsoup_zola @mindofabipolar @houndontherun Lord, mirtazapine turned me into the yumyum monster. Worse than Q!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 04:09:57	@WitchBrain specific to old uni. I guess I don't know until I try and actually go and meet them.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 04:09:30	@WitchBrain It's all moot until I hear back from admissions anyway! Need to see if I can submit a new personal statement, current one is
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 04:08:50	@WitchBrain I'm confusing myself, old uni was a drama school, new uni would be UAL. In Wimbledon College of Art.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 04:08:12	@WitchBrain Old uni had lots of collab, new one won't have so much, slightly different basis to the courses. (University of the Arts)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 04:06:07	@WitchBrain But I don't think there's any getting round the workload or needing to be on site lots, due to nature of course.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 04:05:23	@WitchBrain On the website they have said they are currently overhauling their dis services, which soundS promising. (It's UAL).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 04:03:16	@WitchBrain with most of the rest of the uni in collaborative work. I'm restricted uni choice wise due to what I study.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 04:02:38	@WitchBrain about DSA etc. I just worry the same will happen. I think though, this course will be more suitable, less forced interaction
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 04:01:59	@WitchBrain I tried to return last year having dropped out the year before but managed 3 days. I was at my worst then though. Know all
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 03:48:35	putting up some sort of fight at least. Someone tell me what to do!!!!! (I know that's not realistic but I'm demanding it anyway).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 03:47:48	Honestly no idea. Really scared of a fool's errand but on the other hand don;t want to "allow" myself to waste away at 33 years old without
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 03:47:03	@AtSeSu manage full-time which is the only option. Setting myself up for another failure or bold and giving it another crack could be good?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 03:46:15	So reapplying to old uni didn't work out. Emailed different one about applying late. Am I madder than usual!? Don't even know if I could
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 03:45:05	@Smitchalot It's comforting and blocks out unfamiliar noises, especially for more nervous kitties. TV would work too.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-10 00:56:44	@Smitchalot Kittens are hard work! Re your later Tweet, he'll be fine alone in a room where no mischief can happen and leave a radio on.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 23:44:00	Some 13/14 year foreign students tried to chat to me as I walked pas them outside a hotel on my way back. LOL. Old enough to be their mother
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 23:43:06	They were nice and quick dispensing, thank goodness! Back home safe and sound now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 23:34:31	Waiting for my prescription to filled. Want to run away, really weird not felt like that once I've actually got out the flat for a while.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 22:09:34	My daily vlog is out! Have a looky look! Lucienne Day dreams 09/03/15: http:// youtu.be/m8xj6rNtQbs #dailyvlog
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 21:27:57	I am organised today, vlog uploading as I type *feels smug with self*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 18:14:44	@annedraya Good grief! You poor thing, hope you start to feel better now you know!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 18:06:29	4 hours out of flat = 12 hours sleep (with usual middle of the night one hour toss and turn and again in the morning). Geez. #spoonie
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 06:11:48	@Sectioned_ @BipolarBlogger *Squirms uncomfortably*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 06:10:59	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ are a bit more rubbish than some others. I don't know how else to behave.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 06:10:29	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ I get brave and amazing. I just think I'm a human being a human dealing with human things. Just my human things
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 05:58:42	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola I am very interested to see what I wake up feeling like tomorrow. I was out for a good 4 hours today.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 05:47:23	@rabbitsoup_zola Right!? I used to be full time dance student. How!? How did I do that!? The uni and part-time work. Who was that person!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 05:23:11	I think I overbooked myself. John Lewis trip today. Prescription pick up tomorrow. Eye test Tuesday. More tired already thinking about it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 05:07:46	So tired, doing the "normal" Sunday thing of nipping into town for a quick shop is flipping exhausting for the #spoonie
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 03:12:04	This is how Dave "shares" the bed. Good job I'm pretty bendy the contortions I have to pull to sleep in my own bed! pic.twitter.com/ec3PPhGSib

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-09 01:37:01	Half price vintage repro fabric purchased, yay for me. More to add to my ever growing unused hoard. Not even sorry.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-08 18:07:44	Now I've had a little rant, yay for International Women's Day. We rock.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-08 17:59:15	People who ring my doorbell when not getting an answer from a neighbour. Don't do it. I won't answer and it makes angry. Ta.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-07 20:13:55	I did though, finally book an eye test, only taken me about three years to get round to it! Squinting an awful lot more these days though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-07 20:13:10	What a glorious day in London town again! I'm not doing anything with but are you?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-07 04:16:25	And yes, I am an amazingly youthful looking 80 year old..........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-07 04:16:05	I am far too excited about sleeping with ear plugs tonight. No roadworks, no drunks and no live music keeping me awake or waking me up!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-07 02:13:19	Revving your hair dryer on wheels moped at the lights? Really? Oh this Yodel debacle has made me ranty!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-07 01:30:07	Sweary. I don't swear often. But fucking Yodel are fucking incompetent cockwombles of the highest order.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 23:12:37	@donnaladybirdxx I am okay today, had a donut for breakfast so can't be too bad! Hope you've been doing okay? x

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 20:52:43	The weather is rather lovely again today, almost feeling spring like! Roll on longer days.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 20:40:13	Every year I forget this is the price to pay for lighter mornings. Earlier waking cats. Chilli sat on my boob by about 7.30am. Sleepy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 20:39:31	Come on courier, get here so I can nap. Dave felt 7am was once again, ample late enough to wake me up. Then the postie chipped in. Tired.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 20:09:53	@donnaladybirdxx Something for me to aspire to. Mine should be ready on Monday. When I run out. I'm so organised. PS. Good to have you back!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 19:26:15	Oh and I had a donut for breakfast. A jammy one. With a coffee. Living. The. Life.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 19:25:41	New electric toothbrush also arrived and tested. Where has it been all my life!? And half price. Little things.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 19:24:08	Finally bought earplugs for sensory overload days. Currently testing insertion technique (oo er). I like so far, will need more definitely!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 07:15:15	@rabbitsoup_zola *Takes bow*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 07:14:27	@rabbitsoup_zola Oooh, do I get a crown?! Funny looking at these though. The purple was my only true stable period in my whole life.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 07:13:00	@rabbitsoup_zola Thanks! I've also spent large periods white blonde but that's not as exciting! Was still good though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 07:10:07	A few of my hair incarnations! pic.twitter.com/k8IbGPNN0S
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 07:02:11	@rabbitsoup_zola @debecca I think my epitaph will read "Always had good hair". I've achieved that in my life at least!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 07:00:28	@debecca It was an awesome asymmetric cut and I did the colour myself (as I always have).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 06:52:09	@debecca Purple pixie, moons ago! pic.twitter.com/r8e0gsCfur
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 06:14:03	@debecca Purple is another colour my hair has been, loved my purple hair.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 06:08:29	I showered, I walked, I napped (with a very cute cat), I cooked, I litter tray scooped, I USED TOO MANY SPOONS! May have also eaten a donut.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-06 06:05:28	@BipolarBlogger @drinksinthedark THIS, all day this. Even the "affordable" private options for therapy I was given were too much.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 21:49:07	Used all of today's spoons showering and going for a little walk but I'm so pleased I did both! Might need a nap now..........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 19:44:52	Look Twitter, I'm in a park! And I'm back in my jeans, yippee. Today is a better day. pic.twitter.com/LJxvQBr30M
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 07:50:37	@BipolarBlogger I'm on the waiting list! 18 months and counting. Don't even know if I want to do it as time limited.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 07:06:30	@WitchBrain It should say "before" but yeah. Oh they said on that C4 documentary psychotherapy will fix it #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 07:02:11	So now I need to make ranty FB post enforce unsolicited #BeingBipolar advice comes flying my way.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:59:39	Well that was pretty terrible. Well done to the contributors fit being open about living with this condition, the rest, bilge #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:56:36	Ah, the lonely only child theory #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:53:01	All he needed was to form a band! Praise be he's healed! #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:48:07	"Trying psychotherapy" Good luck getting an appt on NHS under 2 years and then time limited #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:41:18	She's all about the environmental factors and that explains family patterns of MI. I like she's being rebuffed #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:33:34	@realta1977 Yes, had that clarified now. Still shocked she hasn't done some self educating.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:32:17	Well of course the meds don't cure you, it's a long term chronic illness you muppet! #BeingBipolar Turning pill shame-y
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:30:46	@mummynevasleeps Ah ha, thanks for clarifying. Even so, you'd think she might do some self education? #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:29:08	Here we go, psychologist unconvinced by psychiatry #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:27:41	A psychologist who doesn't have a clue about medication? Whut?! #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:25:44	@WitchBrain It was brief, he was very manic and delusional. We seem to be just seeing symptoms at the moment #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:18:11	Type 2, here we go #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:14:27	Okay, so far so okay. Aside from the "institution" blunder. #BeingBipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:08:27	@SageSilk @rabbitsoup_zola @g3reth @mindofabipolar I'm watching online.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:06:04	I also wonder if they'll cover bipolar type 2? #beingbipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 06:05:18	Here we go #beingbipolar Please don't be shit.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 05:55:05	@rabbitsoup_zola Sounds like a UTI to me. Only had one once and this was one of my symptoms. Along with back pain (kidneys). Ring 111.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 05:04:11	@WitchBrain :D
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 04:34:11	@WitchBrain And with Chilli it's taken me nearly 9 years to master the art of catching her in digital form!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 04:33:46	@WitchBrain Mine have been well trained from kittenhood. Dave is too lazy to move (and a poser), Betty is just a love.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 04:30:13	@WitchBrain If you look at my pics, you will see the very epitome of crazy cat lady chic heading my way ;) My FB is just cat pictures.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 04:28:34	@WitchBrain I knew I was one of those women a long time ago and I have no shame!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 04:19:59	@WitchBrain She HATES having her picture taken. I can just about get away with it on the iPhone if I'm quick.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 03:48:46	In the meantime, here is Betty, snuggling the radiator for warmth. A bit of cute for your day. pic.twitter.com/p6AZhoV1HQ
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 03:46:40	Daily vlog is uploading, I'm wading through treacle a bit at the moment so taking me time to get things done! I'm sure you're all waiting!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-05 01:45:08	Depression definitely setting in. I want to stuff my face with cakes and donuts and chocolate. None in right now but the cravings are bad.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 23:14:09	What is up with this tiredness!? Was I this tired before I was on the special Q because it feels like I'm still on meds! Sleepy sleepy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 22:17:16	@AtSeSu And then I ate said food. And probably a cat's worth of hair. Living the life.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 22:11:22	Just threw my lunch/dinner all over the bed. Mentalist win. Emergency laundry on, have to wash duvet too. Hope the grease washes out!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 19:40:07	@AtSeSu I mean, there's been more times but that one was clear and undeniable. Someone else's tweet reminded of it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 19:39:13	Just had a light bulb moment about a small event a couple of years ago. I guess we can definitely add dissociation to the list!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 19:13:06	@WitchBrain a landlord, no idea who theirs is so can't complain to them. Passive aggressive note coming up.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 19:12:44	@WitchBrain I think someone moved out and lift a bunch of stuff behind, remaining tenants appear to have abandoned it. We don't share
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 19:04:26	This is pissing me off. I'm allowed to leave a passive aggressive note for neighbours now right? In communal hall. pic.twitter.com/Z3CrDTP0Ti
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 05:22:55	@BipolarBlogger @inmywindow I was ribbed mercilessly for my pop socks at 17 though. I am partial to twin set also but that's a vintage thing
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 05:21:44	@BipolarBlogger @inmywindow Me too!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 05:17:05	Had a word with the cats. There's to be no waking me at 7am tomorrow! 6 hours sleep makes a very grumpy meowmy. Yes, I said meowmy, what?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 02:31:45	Tired. Tired tired tired.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 01:29:28	Did you see? Back in the, er, saddle....Better late than never? 02/03/15: http:// youtu.be/UPEaEmbWyLw?a #dailyvlog
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-04 01:28:52	I hung the washing! *Waits for prize*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 22:18:10	@Depressed_spark I fear no trade would be tempting at this point. Welded to the bed with cats for the foreseeable.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 22:11:51	@Depressed_spark Umm, no. I don't iron. Unless sewing. And I rarely sew these days! Everything about laundry is tedious.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 21:34:59	I think the wash I put on in unusual enthusiasm has now finished. Can someone come hang it up please?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 20:52:44	Better late than never? 02/03/15: http:// youtu.be/UPEaEmbWyLw?a via @YouTube
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 20:50:17	New daily vlog! A day late, oops. Better late than never? 02/03/15: http:// youtu.be/UPEaEmbWyLw #dailyvlog
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 20:07:21	I didn't vlog or edit the day before's vlog yesterday, oops! Will get onto that today though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 18:20:29	And that's how exciting my life is, tweeting about toothbrushes. Aren't you pleased you follow me......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 18:19:55	I might be the last person to finally buy an electric toothbrush. Just never got round to upgrading!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 15:42:35	I mean, I try to be gracious but cashews ain't going to cure bipolar depression, no matter what Arbonne tell you!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 15:41:28	Talks on FB status about unsolicited advice and that's not what I want. Someone pipes up saying I know unsolicited but cashews are anti-ds.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 07:43:09	@WitchBrain @Sectioned_ Oh hidden things are fine, Betty hides toys in my shoes. And steals EVERTHING, earrings, bobbles, hair flowers.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 07:40:01	@WitchBrain @Sectioned_ *Strikes chipmunks off future pets list*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 07:37:29	Ooh fun game #undateablebecause *mental *cat lady *hate meeting new people *can't use public transport to get to date
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 07:15:54	@WitchBrain @Sectioned_ Dave had a 24 hour thing, spend the entire night waking up once the heaving/gagging started to move him!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 07:13:39	@Sectioned_ That was after I'd chased him off the bed when he started gagging!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 07:13:18	@Sectioned_ Man, jealous. Mine make a beeline for rugs when they puke. Dave was ill over the weekend, puked up brown all over a white rug.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 07:09:28	@drinksinthedark Thanks. Only just got rid of another Gaga tune that was stuck for about a week.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 07:08:51	@Sectioned_ Been here. Liquid feed is especially yummy to clean up from rugs and sofas and shower mats.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 07:05:42	@annabel_cleo @WillBlackWriter Literally just had the same thought. And he's still blaming the child too.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 06:09:09	Chilli becoming increasingly clingy. Usually a sure fire indicator all is not well with me. Great. I hope she's wrong (she never is).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 05:41:58	This is an outfit that will be happening very soon! #crazycatlady pic.twitter.com/qXLDU3J6Rt
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 03:32:01	I don't use the Boots website often, man is it terrible! So user unfriendly.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 03:19:43	@mindofabipolar @rabbitsoup_zola a calculated risk on my part. I rapid cycle but self care is really my issue, not risk per se.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 03:19:00	@mindofabipolar @rabbitsoup_zola I now know I've been BPII since my teens. Only on meds for 6 months and nominal difference. So was
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 02:55:06	@mindofabipolar @rabbitsoup_zola When I feel I'm not coping again I'll ask to go back on something else. Different for everyone though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 02:54:24	@mindofabipolar @rabbitsoup_zola I did self monitor during the process very carefully though. I just want to see where my neutral point is.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 02:53:57	@mindofabipolar @rabbitsoup_zola I chose to come off, did it slowly. The first week of no Q was HELL, mostly due to insomnia. Doing okay now
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 01:49:31	@rabbitsoup_zola @BipolarBlogger Cake. I think we call it bread because it's usually baked in a loaf tin. And it's that onomato thingy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 01:10:07	@RichardLonsdal4 @debecca Neither do I. Just brief moments of thinking it might be fun then realising it is the exact opposite of fun.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 01:05:48	@RichardLonsdal4 @debecca Online dating is in large parts horrifying. Like most of the internet, people stop censoring.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 01:02:13	@banishedcougar @BipolarBlogger Clotted cream and strawberry jam my favourite. Growing up just jam and butter though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 01:00:27	@NickFryeLCPC @BipolarBlogger Bearing in mind Wkipedia isn't reliable and "is in some sense" sounds like the author is iffy too. NOT PASTRY.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 00:58:03	@ResearchAtCRI @BipolarBlogger What!? Breakfast pastry!? Nothing of the sort. They aren't a breakfast item nor are they pastry!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 00:54:34	@NickFryeLCPC @BipolarBlogger It's not pastry at all! Totally different things. I'd put it in the cake classification.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 00:13:04	@debecca @lsherrington1 I just ignore them to be honest. Fine if you have a kink, just don't tell me in a first message on OkCupid!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 00:11:25	@debecca @lsherrington1 Haven't yet dated as an official crazy person.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 00:11:11	@debecca @lsherrington1 I think it's more they think I'll be more open minded about their weird fetishes because my style is not the norm.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-03 00:09:00	@lsherrington1 @debecca This is pretty tame compared to many messages I've received online dating. I guess looking "alternative" an issue!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:54:50	@rabbitsoup_zola Ooh, yeah, you can keep your curly!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:54:23	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola I don't wake up with it like my profile picture sadly, that's effort. Well practised so quick but still effort.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:49:20	@rabbitsoup_zola Yes! Easier since I lopped it off, when it was long, ugh. Hated having long hair, so much effort with rinsing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:48:03	@rabbitsoup_zola Yes I always make sure I have lovely products too! I always feel good once I've showered, just getting in there is effort.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:34:36	@rabbitsoup_zola There's always tomorrow.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:31:44	@rabbitsoup_zola You've done amazing today! A shower is a whole day's activity for me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:17:01	@rabbitsoup_zola @debecca Yeah, been told it will be at least 2 years before I get an appointment. Past caring now!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:09:45	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola Luckily so far haven't needed them. Waiting lists are epic though, 18 months and counting for psychotherapy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:09:20	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola I was looking Nottingham way, I do have couple of friends up there. No idea what crisis team here are like.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:07:36	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola I was seriously considering heading north but got cold feet for the first time ever!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:07:15	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola Where are you again Bex? I'm not averse to moving, it's moving too far from friends. At the start of the year
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:04:03	@rabbitsoup_zola @debecca And due to capping, LHA/HB just won't keep up. No idea what I'll do if I ever have to move again.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:03:13	@rabbitsoup_zola When I first moved to London I lived in Finchley but it was always expensive being north. SE is all creeping up now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:02:22	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola Not that it really matters, given I never go anywhere. Would be nice to be closer to friends though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 04:01:44	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola I looked at Enfield, my closest friend lives in Barnet but it's just as expensive out there! At least I'm zone 3!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 03:57:13	@rabbitsoup_zola @debecca Oh God yes! Islington happened forever ago but Hackney is in the midst. Don't think anywhere is "cheaper" now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 03:54:01	@rabbitsoup_zola @debecca Where are you? A certain amount of gentrification is good but can go too far.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 03:52:35	@rabbitsoup_zola @debecca Costa is moving in, people are LIVID.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 03:52:04	@rabbitsoup_zola @debecca Yup! I moved here 18 months ago, rent would now be £2-300 more per month, just crazy. Nice community though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 03:50:25	@rabbitsoup_zola @debecca Crystal Palace way.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 03:43:19	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola Yes location is pretty good for me too! But London, so bigger a pipe dream.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 03:42:07	@debecca @rabbitsoup_zola If only we could split the difference. I'd like an extra bedroom (currently good size one bed flat).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 01:40:55	Ooooh thunder and lightening!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 01:32:06	@rabbitsoup_zola Well, they came before I turned into a total skank. Nightmare housework self care wise though. But I loves them.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 01:30:11	@rabbitsoup_zola I live with 3 cats, always needs doing! Far side of bedroom might spawn a 4th cat............
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 01:28:59	@rabbitsoup_zola I really need to vacuum, especially bedroom, which is awkward so I put it off all the time. Changing bedlinen though, ugh.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 01:26:53	@rabbitsoup_zola Mine is half clean, about as good as it gets mostly. Trouble with cleaning, makes me sweaty thus smell even more!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 01:25:01	@rabbitsoup_zola Oh lord, been there!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 01:15:48	Totally napped. No willpower. Was a nice nap though, with Dave the cat.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-02 01:14:31	Daily vlog is out! So much reality TLC 01/03/15: http:// youtu.be/H6udmr-_eeY #dailyvlog
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 22:00:27	The tiredness is knocking me sideways today. To allow myself to nap or not is the question (if I can exercise self control that is!).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 21:09:20	Oh and I have rinsed and showered. So hair is pink and body is clean.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 21:08:49	Pulled pork leftovers and kitty cuddles is the order of the day! And no more TLC shows. For now........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 21:00:27	Me again! New daily vlog. So much reality TLC 01/03/15: http:// youtu.be/H6udmr-_eeY #dailyvlog
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 20:59:14	So much reality TLC 01/03/15: http:// youtu.be/H6udmr-_eeY?a via @YouTube
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 20:34:29	Tiredness aside, must go rinse pink dye out of hair before I fall asleep and dye my bed pink instead.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 20:31:21	I feel like I'm okay but getting more tired every day, which probably means I'm actually sliding into depression. Fun!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 20:30:47	@BipolarBlogger I'm just going to not allow the term attention seeking to be negative. Well, in theory! Sorry you're struggling.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 19:17:32	Current mood as illustrated by Betty. pic.twitter.com/WUeTSHjGDe
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 18:33:13	@BipolarBlogger If you did I'd have to unfollow you.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 18:27:17	@BipolarBlogger Yes true. And what is social media for if not for expressing yourself in any way you choose?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 18:22:29	@BipolarBlogger I had this directed at me last week too. What if this is the only place some people have to seek reassurance?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 05:33:08	@annedraya I feel this all the time. So much passes me by, it's very frustrating.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 03:31:34	Me again, still vlogging daily! Quesadilla days are good days 28/02/15: http:// youtu.be/29IoxIineqw #dailyvlog
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 03:21:42	@mindofabipolar @rabbitsoup_zola @debecca @BipolarBlogger It really suited you too, pesky siblings!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 03:20:11	@mindofabipolar @BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola @debecca I totally am. Forewarned now too to keep a lid on it better (in theory).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 03:19:23	@mindofabipolar @rabbitsoup_zola @debecca @BipolarBlogger Oh dear!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 03:06:05	@mindofabipolar @BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola @debecca I will need to go back on, coping for now so just trying to lose while I can!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 03:05:20	@rabbitsoup_zola @debecca @mindofabipolar @BipolarBlogger Ha! Think I lasted a year without the pink. Inherently me these days.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 02:56:30	@debecca @BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola @mindofabipolar Thank you *blushes* I've never been skinny as an adult. about a 14 I'd be fine!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 02:55:32	@mindofabipolar @BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola @debecca Losing weight has always been a bitch for me, terrible metabolsim.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 02:54:58	@mindofabipolar @BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola @debecca I am off at the moment. Only managed 4lbs loss while on. Now down nearly 1st.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 02:51:57	Pulled pork rolls with 'slaw for dinner. So hungry right now, hurry up and cook!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 02:51:21	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola @debecca @mindofabipolar Yup, only just losing the extra 3st put on. 5'5 and large 16.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-03-01 01:53:27	Quesadilla days are good days 28/02/15: http:// youtu.be/29IoxIineqw?a via @YouTube
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 21:46:58	The coldness that comes from being constantly tired really sucks. *Reaches for another blanket*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 17:53:46	@BipolarBlogger Hard to explain! I'd like to not have it at all of course. Now there is a dream!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 17:53:28	@BipolarBlogger at all with being that emotionally overwhelmed when awake. If I'm asleep I just wake with the memory of the distress.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 17:53:01	@BipolarBlogger sort of distress. I hate that I have no control because it's my subconscious and I am asleep but I don't know that I'd cope
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 17:52:12	@BipolarBlogger Oh for sure. The linked dream was actually not a flashback or manifestation as they usually are. It was an emotional loss
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 17:49:22	@BipolarBlogger I'm sort of grateful I don't get so distressed when awake for the most part but it's still a horrible experience.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 17:43:41	Cried in my sleep last night. From the gut, body shaking crying :( I love how my PTSD manifests. No really.......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 05:11:49	If your exhaust sets off car alarms, you're not cool, you're a twat.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 04:56:35	@BipolarBlogger Yes! I'll also be aspirational about actually making some, as I recall, I make a mean pancake.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 04:55:20	@BipolarBlogger @DoIKnowMyself For me, a diagnosis, any diagnosis, has made it all easier to deal with and hold onto a little self esteem.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 04:54:32	@BipolarBlogger What time do you want me round?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 04:51:58	@BipolarBlogger I'm not either really. All about maple syrup or banana and Nutella. For starters.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 04:49:43	@BipolarBlogger @DoIKnowMyself More than understand. Boot on other foot I'd be the same!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 04:48:18	@BipolarBlogger @DoIKnowMyself I read it! Just in case you thought I hadn't. It sort of confirmed what I thought AND confirmed my confusion
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 04:44:27	@BipolarBlogger @DoIKnowMyself I wonder how it's clearly distinguished or possible for a dual diagnosis. I'm no expert though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 04:43:43	@BipolarBlogger @DoIKnowMyself I find it interesting because if I hadn't ticked enough bipolar boxes I would be dx as BPD. So much overlap.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 03:37:21	@BipolarBlogger I'd actually be really interested in a psychiatrists point of view, one who does dual diagnose those conditions.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 03:30:15	Another day when I lack the capacity to keep up with Twitter. Catch me up everyone? Generally though, I'm okay, I think. Just can't adult.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 03:25:04	@BipolarBlogger I am seeing more people being diagnosed with both (more a USA thing I think) which somewhat baffles me?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-28 02:39:51	Have you seen my daily vlog? Short and sweet (cat) 27/02/15: http:// youtu.be/ghJzBCakHlc?a #dailyvlog
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-27 23:15:38	@Smitchalot @Debenhams You could always "borrow" beads from an unseen area but restitching should be pretty easy in theory!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-27 23:12:56	@BipolarBlogger Red onion, chilli and lime roast chicken and cheeeeeeese. Am I helping? ;)

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-27 20:25:33	Well hello sudden headache, where did you come from!? Bugger off!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-27 19:17:19	@BipolarBlogger Good goals.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-27 18:27:35	@BipolarBlogger I defrosted a pack of three piadas yesterday, had a wrap for lunch so just using up the other two today!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-27 18:22:16	I'm looking forward to lunch already, going to do a quesadilla type affair. Mmmmm, melty cheese.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-27 18:21:00	Morning! I've actually been up hours but only just checking on good old Twitterland. Sunshiney days make me feel more positive, yay!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-27 06:17:06	@Sectioned_ @rabbitsoup_zola Ostrich is ridiculously good. Had South African friends who had some at a barbecue. So good.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-27 06:15:43	@annedraya All last week my allergy eyes were dreadful. I put it down to stress in the end wiping out some tolerance of the cats.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-27 06:14:43	@Smitchalot @debenhams What's wring with it? (I'm a sewing type so may be able to offer advice)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-27 00:03:51	@rabbitsoup_zola Sort of used to the inevitability of it now! x

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 23:51:35	@rabbitsoup_zola Sorry you're so down though, I'm sort of teetering on the edge of a proper depressive episode at the moment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 23:50:55	@rabbitsoup_zola And as long as I'm not a risk to myself I think this will be my approach going forward when switching.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 23:50:12	@rabbitsoup_zola I guess I'm going back to ground zero, I was on so many things quickly I couldn't really assess clearly what was working.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 23:47:26	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm as stable now as I have ever been on meds. And a little more awake. Finding the right thing is so damn hard.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 23:46:44	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm med free at the moment, I was rapid cycling my butt off on special Q. Will no doubt need to go back on something but
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 23:44:10	@rabbitsoup_zola I tried 5 or 6, none worked, one made me hypo. However, people have success when used with a mood stabiliser I believe.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 22:05:18	Orphaned bats are the cutest. RT @OwenJones84 : Bat eating a banana. Trust me. It'll change your life. https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=ZSUVXA sQe4I …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 21:11:06	After some clever questioning on my part to call centre, I now know PIP has been extended until 2018. Relieved doesn't cover it.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 17:45:00	Oh. Savile report today, just seen first few mentions. May need to avoid Twitter today #trigger
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 16:27:14	And he's gone, yay! *Puts PJs back on*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 16:16:02	Gas man is here to do yearly check. Anxiety through the roof having him in my flat. Urgh. At least I know he won't be long.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 02:41:10	@BipolarBlogger In my case my hair grows at a ridiculous pace. This is only a little over a months roots and bleach is a bitch on your own.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 02:37:39	@BipolarBlogger Don't be too envious. Being mental and maintaining Exciting Coloured Hair is an epic chore. Epic.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-26 02:35:11	@BipolarBlogger Ah thank you and thank you for watching! It looks better today I think.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 22:50:52	Much more on it with the vlog today, aside from a minor hiccup. Just processing on the PC and then it will be uploading! #dailyvlog
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 22:26:15	Casual use of mental illness diagnoses as every day vernacular perpetuates stereotypes and stigma. Stop it. Eg. "She's so psycho/OCD" etc.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 20:55:18	@BipolarBlogger I have to claim, I have no other support means. I dread what this will mean for me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 20:54:23	@BipolarBlogger regs is partly a motivation. Too many using them now and they're trying to stem the tide. It's how I got into the SG in part
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 20:53:36	@BipolarBlogger group with an MI without using regs 29/35, they've now changed the goal posts for women, I guess raised awareness of those
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 20:52:53	@BipolarBlogger I think that's always been a problem with the WCA, this exacerbates it. It's always been hard to be placed in the support
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 20:49:43	@BipolarBlogger Maximus carrying on where Atos left off, only worse. This strikes fear into me and I'm sure many others.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 20:43:21	@BipolarBlogger placed in the support group, like divorce or homelessness. Apparently due to lower suicide rates in women. Outrageous.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 20:42:48	@BipolarBlogger Can't currently find an online link, it was in the Benefits and work newsletter today. Extra risk factors needed to be
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 20:37:55	Wait, the new ESA assessment will treat women with mental illness differently to men?! How is that even legal!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 16:27:34	Dave the cat has taken to waking me at 2am for a cuddle. He's cute but 2am is not the time Dave!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 07:02:11	Especially when that neighbour or prone to insomnia. Not that they know that but still!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 07:01:27	Ah yes, vacuuming at 11pm night when you live in a flat above someone is a very considerate, neighbourly thing to do #sarcasm

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-25 01:24:03	Totally forgot to edit and upload the vlog earlier. Happily it didn't need editing (a new favourite thing) will be online soon! #dailyvlog
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-24 22:36:51	Porn spambots out I see, not had a follow from one of those is some time!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-24 22:29:59	Eyebrows done, all happy again. Apparently they grow out very tidily!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-24 18:01:44	Actually, task two, eyebrow appointment also made for this afternoon. Good start to this sunny day!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-24 18:00:52	Ah, online chat customer service that works. All companies should have it, task one for the day done!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-23 18:39:00	Happy to report Dave is fine and made a full recovery yesterday evening. I, however, am flipping knackered from the worry. Silly cat.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-23 05:14:38	New vlog! I'm getting good at this daily thing! Gousto box update and an apology! 22/02/15: http:// youtu.be/yZKwc4LWo4A
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-23 04:16:35	@LalaBrownie He has just eaten and had a wash, much better in himself generally. Now he just needs to keep it down. Yay for positivity!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-23 00:29:16	@LalaBrownie I'm concerned it's the return of pancreatitis, one of the thing that made him ill last year. Very worried.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-23 00:01:20	Dave still very poorly, off to the vets tomorrow. But I have edited and am uploading today's vlog, trying to distract myself!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 23:43:55	@LalaBrownie @trutherbot I don't watch much TV, certainly not series, no attention span for it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 23:28:55	@LalaBrownie @trutherbot Called Neurons to Nirvana. Narco Cultura is also good.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 23:21:52	@LalaBrownie @trutherbot I watched a brilliant documentary about psychedellics on Netflix recently.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 22:12:46	@debecca @natalie6691 You look lovely! Glad you had a great time.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 22:10:36	Comments on the vlog are making me happy. It's one thing to make them, another to engage anyone to watch and then comment!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 20:02:04	Dave still poorly, scared it's one of the conditions I nearly lost him to last year :( Vet tomorrow I think.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 06:50:59	Guess I'll be up all night clearing up kitty puke and comforting said kitty. Hope it's just a bug, please please let it just be a bug.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 05:03:34	Dave the cat is poorly tonight. Hoping it's just a tummy bug after the hell we went through last year, I worry so much now!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 02:50:04	@rabbitsoup_zola You carry on, he doesn't exist so this isn't too harmful, just a bit odd. Nothing wrong with odd though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 02:14:29	@rabbitsoup_zola No you're not! You're human. And a lovely human at that x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 02:03:25	Love Bette Midler.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-22 01:01:08	So tired again but feeling accomplished today. I even cleaned up after (an early) dinner! Tea and cookies now.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-21 21:47:15	My hair finally offended someone! Mission accomplished! Ahe.m
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-21 21:09:42	@fuzz_walk @debecca @DramaLlama85 @alicemeat I didn't realise either, we'd had some lovely chats, so sad. Sleep tight Alice.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-21 20:46:14	Okay, done with the Karen Danczuk thing now, it's proven quite a point to me though about attitudes to #csa allegations. Doesn't encourage
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-21 20:44:08	RT @laura_murrayxo : " @AKittyBitCrafty you do seem attention seeking." So this is fun. Way to engage in intelligent debate.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-21 20:09:05	@BankersDidIt Or how about I just say displaying complete lack of understanding if the abused and their behaviour? Better?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-21 20:08:31	@BankersDidIt Wow. Following me about now? Stay classy Twitter.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-21 19:54:02	Being attacked by on my other account by Karen Danczuk's brother. Nice.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-21 17:38:32	Re: Karen Danczuk. If you contacted my family, they'd also tell you I was a fantasist making up my past. It's called victim blaming.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-21 17:33:06	Sleeping should never be underrated. Feeling a bit perky this morning! On to vlog editing!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-21 00:08:56	@LalaBrownie I got on an FB group, it's an eBay seller that makes them new so it was nice to try for cheaper! Want more now!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-20 21:34:33	Gosh, just got whacked with a wave of tiredness! Cup of tea and an Oreo in order I think!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-20 05:14:48	@rabbitsoup_zola In a fruity or non fruity way? Just to clarify.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-20 04:34:48	@rabbitsoup_zola Ian Beale's offspring. I only know this due to FB, haven't watched any soaps in years!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-20 04:33:41	Feeling naturally tired again tonight (as in, without any medication helping), I likes it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-20 04:32:32	So apparently everyone is watching Eastenders. Apart from me. Twitter will tell me what happened anyway.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-20 02:45:00	Just ordered Chinese food. Subversive marketing probably really works on me....Happy New Year!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-19 21:49:35	I've lost 11lbs since mid January, I'm not one to go mouthing off about it but I can see it in my face which is satisfying.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-19 21:48:14	@inmywindow Thank you! DIY hair cut wasn't a disaster!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-19 20:08:23	I got some actual proper sleep last night, so much waking up was a bit of an issue! Bliss! Let's hope it's a while before insomnia returns.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-19 06:29:48	Feeling naturally tired tonight, it's a rare and lovely feeling for me these days!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-19 06:25:47	@LalaBrownie Bahahaha! Mind you, had I been in a shop that had Candaian maple syrup on offer I'd have bought it. It's yummy and expensive!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-19 05:45:13	@LalaBrownie I had pancakes about a month ago. None yesterday. It's all so stupid. Knobs.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-19 03:26:07	@LalaBrownie It's so good! Dr Gross better but Glam Glow close second. And thanks, I do my best when not in PJs.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-19 03:25:15	@LalaBrownie Yep. It's a bit band wagony "Look at me making a sacrifice for nothing!". Give over. Social media has so much to answer for.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-19 02:05:02	And for my next trick, I'm going to make lots of cheese disappear.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-18 23:47:23	New vlog! GlamGlow and pink hair cuts! 18/02/15: http:// youtu.be/dRKoPBzI8ug #vlog #vlogger #vlogging #beauty #glamglow

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-18 22:40:39	I'm giving up nothing for lent because I'm not Christian. So there. All of the chocolate and carbs for me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-18 21:29:46	New vlog coming, uploading as I type, health has been giving me gip so it was filmed last week. Sorry!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-18 20:29:09	I would like the cats to move so I can strip the bed. All three have never looked comfier or happier #catladyproblems
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-18 19:49:35	Hopefully I can get a bit more essential housework done today, just as soon as the cats deign to move off the bed so I can change linen!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-18 19:48:55	Feeling tired today but think that's more regular bipolar tiredness and less lack of sleep tiredness because at last that's improving.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-17 21:09:19	But at least I achieved something with my day. May this improved sleep continue.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-17 21:08:40	I actually got a little sleep last night. Have cleaned the kitchen and put a wash on, feel almost human today! Well, I did. Tired again now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-16 02:37:23	Life is so very cruel sometimes. Sad news today.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 19:20:33	I have no regrets about walking away from my family but I often wonder if and how they think of me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 17:36:34	Oh lord this insomnia is kicking my ass. Another night of dreadful, fitful 'sleep'. Plus side, sleep hypnosis app did send me off initially!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 07:29:39	Restaurant downstairs is really cranking out the "romantic" tunes. Really helpful to my insomnia.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 07:19:08	@WitchBrain Nuance? That's a word you just made up right? No idea what that means. I'm just crazy, all day every day.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 07:12:44	@WitchBrain That's my Ive had no proper sleep for 3 days don't mess with me look. Managed not to stab anyone today, good mentalist.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 07:08:40	My #MHmask Look at how obviously loony I am! pic.twitter.com/EfoOK4fjh6
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 07:07:26	@rabbitsoup_zola Me too today! Been holed up a lot lately so yay us!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 07:06:03	@bdogrunner @rabbitsoup_zola Yeah, this is exactly what I look like! #fuckoff
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 05:36:09	Sometimes people come into your life and become unexpected quiet cheerleaders. It's rather lovely and seems to happen more now than ever.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 01:22:57	@katybops @BipolarBlogger Even a quick look at some of the bigger disability forums will show how many bad experiences people have.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 00:48:54	@rabbitsoup_zola ((Hugs)) Let it all out. I can lend you a cat to snuggle with?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 00:43:35	@katybops @BipolarBlogger It's sorted now and like I said, I now know how to deal with it all better. Others not so lucky or able.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 00:40:03	@katybops @BipolarBlogger contacted as a matter of course. MI is still dealt with dreadfully on the whole.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 00:39:39	@katybops @BipolarBlogger who said I was fine because I dressed nicely. At no point either was I told health professionals wouldn't be
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 00:39:07	@katybops @BipolarBlogger Who tells you to do this? I am better at the form filling now but first time was awful I was assessed by a physio
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 00:37:11	@katybops @BipolarBlogger It only works if they contact them, which they mostly don't. My experience of the benefits system is dreadful
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-15 00:25:58	Huggles with the only boy I need #davethecat pic.twitter.com/NiQcJaFpSq
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 21:58:56	@rabbitsoup_zola Thank you. I never feel more me than when I have pink hair! xx
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 21:51:24	I can just hide the amateur lopping job because of the way I style it. Nice to be rid of about 10 inches too much though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 21:50:29	The result of my DIY hair cut. Lost about 10 inches, yay! Do not do as I do, everyone else should go to a hairdresser pic.twitter.com/Ggp16V3lBR
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 21:42:46	Okay, terrible med resistant insomnia again last night with little restless sleep. But I finally feel tired today, so maybe tonight is on!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 06:36:08	Meds not touching the sides again tonight, wide awake. All I want is some blissful sleep, please gods of sleep!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 06:32:17	@LalaBrownie I'm at a point where I khave it down. I can neglect my skin for weeks and it still look okay. Praise be Liz Earle and Dr Gross!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 05:32:36	@LalaBrownie She'd ask me why her skin was doing x, I'd ask if she was doing y like I told her. We got there in the end!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 05:31:22	@LalaBrownie It's okay, I reformed Maylee, it's taken about two years but she does as she's told in the girly vanity department now!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 04:23:20	@LalaBrownie I'm bad too but washing at night is better than in the morning, not sleeping in the day's grime while skin tries to repair.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 03:09:52	@LalaBrownie Oh and add rosehip oil to your night routine (unless its in their night cream), skin transformed.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 03:09:08	@LalaBrownie Something else to look at is the Dr Dennis Gross skin peel pads. Amazing for just getting skin back to zero, hero product.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 02:56:40	@LalaBrownie I feel so much better for it, I highly recommend. Especially after such a shitty sleep last night. Self care is important.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-14 02:39:54	Cats are having their Friday night Waitrose tuna cat food. You know it's good when they don't play musical dishes!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-13 20:47:50	Facemasking, hair dyeing, DIY hair cutting sort of day. About time I did a bit of self pampering.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-13 18:26:28	Dreadful sleep. I think worst I've had recently. Hoping I get better sleep tonight!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-13 07:08:21	"high on valium". Isn't that an oxymoron?

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-13 03:28:27	@DramaLlama85 There's a lot of Chinese migrants in NZ and everyone assumes all Asians are "foreign". Bit like here really!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-13 03:27:34	@DramaLlama85 I had a Cambodian friend who grew up in NZ be talked to like she was stupid in a coffee shop in NZ. Was awful.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-13 03:25:07	A change is as good as a rest. New profile pics. Showing my face, ee gads!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-13 03:11:27	@inmywindow Abel and Cole but trying a Gousto one next week. There's a code on my timeline to get one for £9.99, worth it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-13 03:07:19	@inmywindow I've been getting meal boxes and it's made cooking so much easier. Taking a break from them though to do housework!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-13 03:05:06	@bdogrunner @rabbitsoup_zola @DramaLlama85 I have a Ninja and it's AMAZING. Frozen banana no probs. Small batches, easy. I recommend!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-13 03:03:32	122 minutes to upload a 10 minute video to Youtube. That's the price of HD folks!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-12 23:47:42	@rabbitsoup_zola This is only the second time I've been out of bed this week. It's so tiring! I may also take to my bed, for warmth obvs.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-12 23:46:26	It's a lot colder than it looks today! Brrrrr. Being tired doesn't really help wither I suppose. Is it bed time yet?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-12 20:50:43	I love @FollowGousto! Try for yourself with £25 off using my promo code (box for £9.99, BARGAIN!) SHONA41056 at http://www. gousto.co.uk
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 23:58:11	Today has been an exhausted day. All that housework yesterday instantly catching up with me. Time for a cuppa I think, anyone want one?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 07:47:48	@LalaBrownie Ah thank you. I feel a bit daft but realised I watch some daily vloggers and find their regular lives interesting so why not.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 07:39:40	@LalaBrownie We all sound weird to ourselves. Editing the vlogs is horrific, looking and listening to myself? All of the nightmares!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 06:54:00	@LalaBrownie Ha, that private education did me some good!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 06:47:36	@LalaBrownie a bit of slap on. Can't do anything about the fatter than I'd like face, working on that though, damn meds.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 06:47:03	@LalaBrownie get a miss, everyone is so good at knowing what they're selling. I look so rough! I think my vanity will make me start putting
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 06:46:08	@LalaBrownie I pretty much buy exclusively online, mostly via one or two FB groups just for mid century vintage. Buy by measurements, rarely
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 05:33:59	@LalaBrownie It can be found, girls bigger than me manage it but it is harder. Lots of good repro too now though, Pinupgirl Clothing is ace.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 05:26:47	@LalaBrownie I actually prefer dresses because finding vintage separates, let alone in my size is a nightmare. That said, I have many skirts
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 05:21:43	@LalaBrownie Google explains it better in pictures. https://www. google.co.uk/search?q=novel ty+print&biw=1366&bih=667&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=QXbaVM-aFJTvaN21gZgC&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg#tbm=isch&q=vintage+novelty+print …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 05:20:54	@LalaBrownie I have a modern repro that's like a beautiful summer meadow painting. And a bonkers cats and jack in the boxes. All sorts.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 05:20:15	@LalaBrownie It's a vintage thing, they loved novelty in the 50s. So one is like a stylised seaside type print. The other is kitties!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 05:15:25	Trying to save, which I'm really terrible at. An example of this is the two novelty skirts I have bought this month, one just 10 minutes ago

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-11 01:34:11	Ok, metformin, really does wipe out my appetite, can't finish my not big dinner. Shame the quetiapine makes it impossible to lose weight!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-10 23:36:20	super fast dealings with them and I'm still here, weeks later, phoning every day, making myself ill. Urgh.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-10 23:35:46	The amount of time the DWP take to make any decisions about me is one my biggest anxieties. Especially when others seem to have super fast
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-10 19:27:13	Feeling accomplished, vacuuming done, lounge rug rolled and out until I arrange disposal, litter trays done. Yay!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-09 20:59:32	@johnghughes3 Thank you! This was literally a tester for the camera (going to need to upgrade), will vlog about the hair, needs redoing!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-08 20:50:20	@amyelle11 Thank you. Door answered, back into hibernation!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-08 18:49:15	Oh dear, agoraphobia back in full swing. Got grocery delivery today, really don't want to have to answer the door. Fun.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-06 03:59:42	Want to run away with the circus for a few weeks. Just a change of scenery to reset me a bit, fed up with being me at the moment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-05 00:03:49	Is the @DWPgovuk IT system back up and running? Don't want to put my self through the anxiety of a phone call if it's not!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-04 11:13:47	@NyxyNyx I can only dream! Only been offered zopiclone (and previously promethazine).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-04 11:09:57	@NyxyNyx I think I cling on to the fact I was a great sleeper for 31 years. I miss good sleep full stop, meds don't give that.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-04 11:00:58	@NyxyNyx Maybe this is the attitude I should take!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-04 10:58:02	@NyxyNyx I guess. My psych certainly was never fussed that I always take them. Dosing up max bothers me though, tolerance and all that.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-04 10:55:23	@NyxyNyx Very. I'd forgotten just how shit for a while. We need better, not addictive sleep meds.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-04 10:53:57	@NyxyNyx I'm hoping mine is due to DWP decision time stress and easily medicated to sleep me returns because this blows.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-04 10:50:40	@NyxyNyx I usually have medicated sleep. Meds not working, reluctant to go up to full dose. Urgh.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-04 10:47:19	Wide awake. Second time this week. Not happy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-04 07:13:35	@rabbitsoup_zola FFS. It had better be functional tomorrow or I'll, well, I'll probably be too anxious to do anything but FUCKERS.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-04 00:49:24	DWP/PIP entire computer system down all day. Hacked? I don't care really, just give me my decision so I can sleep better!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-03 02:09:28	Hypo. Last had one only a few weeks ago. Over it. Med increase has done jack. I need a break!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-02 23:57:25	Losing weight whilst on quetiapine combined with usual food issues and already slow metabolism is hard work. Getting there but man.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-02 21:23:13	Dave is so gross, he's got a mucky cat litter crusted foot. Not a fuck he gives about stomping all over me with that foot. Gross.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-02 19:57:58	The free cheese is taking my mind off the four hours of shit sleep I got last night/this morning.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-02 19:55:38	FREE CHEESE! @AbelandCole you cheeky devils, you read my craving mind. Cheddar, crackers and a cheeky bit of onion chutney for lunch it is!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-02 08:41:19	It's also fun when you wake every half hour if you do sleep. In between nightmares. I'm not exhausted at all after a couple weeks of this.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-02-02 08:40:06	*Twiddles thumbs* It's great fun when you're so worried about something it stops the sleep meds working. #sarcasm

1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-13 05:40:51	@Lala_Brownie Three words. UK Drag Race.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-12 04:57:24	So now I need to hope the increase in quetiapine takes the edge back off the depression so I can maintain current status quo or better.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-12 04:56:44	Also, operation eat better is in full swing. Now getting those meal boxes, so no thinking required, no waste, portion control. Also good.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-12 04:55:31	Week 1 on metformin. Appetite dramatically reduced, sugar cravings barely register, 2lbs off, no side effects of note. So far so working!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-12 04:48:45	FB support group. Person 1: "I'm newly diagnosed, very depressed and scared". Person 2: "Do you have any hobbies?" *Head desk*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-11 23:15:31	Thanks The Voice for reminding me how good Republica were. I think it may be the only good thing to come from the show........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-11 04:44:18	@BipolarBlogger @annedraya I just sort of feel like it doesn't apply to me, I'll never attain it whatever it is!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-11 04:15:20	@annedraya @BipolarBlogger Haven't the foggiest what it means in an MH context. It's not like a broken leg that is eventually healed.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-11 03:19:08	May have just "accidentally purchased some Hello Kitty Vans. They were half price though, how could I not?! #sorrynotsorry
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-11 00:40:23	@AbelandCole offering, curried meatballs! Liking the meal boxes, find it manageable, not using too many spoons. pic.twitter.com/NwFioRfuys
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-10 07:58:22	Things I've learned tonight. Promethazine is not a substitute for zopiclone. At all. Not really even drowsy. Have now taken zopiclone!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-10 05:00:08	Of course this may not last but so far so good. Hunger much diminished in general too. Will I get my waist back!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-10 04:59:32	@AtSeSu It seems my psyche makes peace with "you can have that tomorrow" much more than "you can only have a little forever".
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-10 04:58:42	Okay, so with my GP being good enough to prescribe metformin off license I am upholding my end and doing the 5:2. Actually easy so far!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-10 04:53:08	@FhionaAlsop Mine are indoor now but back when they were outdoor, just opening the door and the wind blowing in would change their minds!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-09 18:45:56	Well, the metformin appears to be working for me at this early stage. Definitely less hungry and eating less. 2lbs lost since Monday. Yay!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-08 22:13:49	this crap. It certainly does nothing to help my health.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-08 22:13:26	be a problem. So now apparently I just have to wait for another letter or a phone call or something. Really wish I didn't have to deal with
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-08 22:12:32	Today is not a good day. Compliance Office Interview letter. Blind panic. Called them, she was a bit vague when I said getting there would
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-08 18:24:00	But I don't really care, just not feeling so all over the place works for me regardless how I get there!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-08 18:23:09	Also, I seem to be levelling out a bit, my mind has quietened down A LOT. Whether that's med increase related or not I don't know.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-08 18:22:07	Morning! It's a bit grim innit? But I'm a bit pleased. I am 3lbs down already after starting metformin and the 5:2 on Monday. Go me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-07 05:48:42	@BipolarBlogger @theWriteRach @NicsVoice I actually did a couple of Youtibe tutorials on tying head scarves a la vintage stylee!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-07 05:47:55	@NicsVoice @BipolarBlogger @theWriteRach This current phase of bleach blonde might the longest it's been a "normal" colour in ages!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-07 05:47:30	@NicsVoice @BipolarBlogger @theWriteRach I go "unnatural" colours all the time, have since my teens and it's common o the rockabilly scene.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-07 05:43:41	I haven't been on Twitter today, all space cadet from med increase! How are you all, did I miss anything?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 06:46:58	@FhionaAlsop There's lots from the US, I'm getting quite a drug education. Well, if I bothered to Google I would but I know lots of names!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 06:39:26	Phantom smells. I think. That's new. And it's bacon. Which is making me hungry!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 06:26:34	@FhionaAlsop Haha! This one is just so bleak. Some chick got fake Paypal scammed yesterday. The group is the miserable face of bipolar.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 06:17:33	if I can really stay in the group. I fear either it'll break me or desensitise me, neither is good.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 06:16:37	I know that could describe a lot of us here but this group is another level. Incident after incident of ground down women. I don't know if
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 06:15:31	Joined a bipolar support group on FB, for a bit of variety. Wow. So many people in so many bad relationships with partners and families.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 05:35:35	Student and her had a little chuckle. I'm here all week folks.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 05:35:16	was when talking about my weight and the pill and she thought I didn't look like I'd gained but we'll weigh you. I said I'm definitely fat!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 05:34:31	I keep remembering things I said in my GP appointment today. I clearly use humour to deflect the seriousness of a situation! Another gem
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 04:47:11	Sandy Hook conspiracy theories eh? Who knew!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 04:13:09	@inmywindow Twitter doesn't want to let me DM you, message me first if you can?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 04:11:10	@inmywindow Ummm. In for a penny!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 04:02:55	@inmywindow PS. I never have lots of cards. Think I'll get one, maybe two if the wind blows in the right direction.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 04:02:24	@inmywindow I'm the 19th! Go us!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 03:58:21	Made the student observing giggle too. GP did join in after establishing that's all I did, not out of control or anything.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 03:57:37	Is it wrong I enjoyed the not impressed expression on my GPs face when I gleefully told her of hypo flat redecorating episode? Priceless!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 03:23:21	Oooh, feeling a bit apprehensive about increased dose tonight. Wondering how bad the sedation is going to be. Soon find out!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 03:03:52	Not happening, Dave is taking it out on Chilli. This is why I call him an asshole. I love him but he can be a total brat a lot of the time!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 03:02:59	My getting up earlier than usual has left the cats all discombobulated. Even though I fed them at normal time, still want their dinner early
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 02:58:55	He has also not asked supporters to stop terrorising his victim forcing her to constantly move. Nor has he shown any remorse. Scum.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 02:58:20	Ched Evans apologists make my skin crawl. He was found guilty. He's a rapist. End of. He's on license so hasn't yet served his sentence.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 01:47:06	@drinksinthedark @DramaLlama85 I cooked today and it was an epic success. You can do it too!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 01:07:38	@learningtofloat through that every 6 months any regular work pattern will be impossible!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 01:07:13	@learningtofloat a certain time. Just had my stabiliser dose increased so will now have heavier side effects for a period. If I have to go
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 01:06:33	@learningtofloat sedation effect for that purpose is all but gone for me now, hence the other med which is a sleep aid so has to be taken at
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 01:06:05	@learningtofloat I'm restricted because it's a mood stabiliser and sleep aid, I can't take it too early or the sleep help is gone. But the
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 01:02:06	@learningtofloat some on that front but I do battle tiredness a lot. Even when doing well it's a massive problem.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 01:01:41	@learningtofloat Both of the meds I am on are sedating and both leave hangovers, you only tolerate to a degree. I seem to do better than
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 00:57:18	@learningtofloat meds. I have plans for some work (I've been offered piece work as a seamstress) but I don't know that full time is possible
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 00:56:26	@learningtofloat I spend 5 out of 7 days a week mostly too tired to function. That hasn't improved in the 7 or 8 months I've been on current
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 00:51:32	And that's if I could stay stable longer than the 5-6 months I had before depression and worse than usual functioning crept back in.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 00:50:51	It demonstrated that my hopes of having a "normal" job are pretty much pie in the sky because I'd be too tired by Tuesday to function.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 00:49:55	Took meds and went to bed early because I was getting up with the alarm today. Wiped out all day from the interrupted sleep. Ball ache.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-06 00:03:13	@Sectioned_ Saw my GP for first time since dx and discharge. None of the several blood tests done by pdoc last year, asked me about meds.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-05 23:18:35	Trying to force myself to cook more with @AbelandCole meal boxes. This was super delicious. pic.twitter.com/YBBsCCWDyl
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-05 20:37:40	@johnghughes3 Exactly! Good job I have nowhere to be. I just merrily guzzled that spirulina smoothie down whilst reading that packet, d'oh!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-05 20:34:34	@Ladybird_Donna I had the same! Well, not to the MiL, I don't have one but I had to go to the GP and sit with real people. Blurgh.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-05 20:30:02	So maybe starting spirulina and metformin at the same time isn't a good idea........ #gurglytummy
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-05 18:35:25	a very good appointment. There was an observing student too, wonder if she learned anything.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-05 18:34:46	BMI nad BP on the high side will do a 24 hour BP test then decide whether I can stay on the pill. Forgot to ask for my zopiclone but
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-05 18:33:39	LOVE MY GP! Quetiapine dose increased from 3-400 to see if we catch the depression. Agreed to give me metformin to see if it helps my weight
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-05 05:03:32	I impulse bought spirulina. Guess we'll see how that goes then..........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-05 01:19:05	Phone just tried to autcorrect Seroquel to seriously. Even my phone is pill shaming me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 22:56:54	@rabbitsoup_zola There really is a fetish for everyone isn't there? *mind boggles*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 22:25:29	I have absolutely no idea what to expect from GP tomorrow. I do know I'll cry, I always cry when I see her, it's like a learned response!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 22:24:11	I have jumped on the @ilumiworld band wagon. Not able to cook at all really at the moment so hopefully these are tasty!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 22:06:05	@suzypuss @Sectioned_ A person who is depressed may APPEAR to be remarkably cheerful full stop. No death planning needed for the facade.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 08:07:18	In any other context it would probably be super fun!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 08:06:55	It's largely depressive, so I sit around in my pants staring at the cats because they're cute until I'm starving and eat all of the food.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 08:04:42	@rabbitsoup_zola They sort of quietly rumble for me which is why I didn't ever notice before diagnosis and was like BINGO!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 08:03:50	And I'm discharged so seeing my GP for the first time since diagnosis on Monday, might be interesting. Good thing she's lovely!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 08:03:07	"Episodes" are still such a new concept to me I find it hard to identify when and if they might be happening.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 08:02:20	Properly getting a bit mental again I think, cat barometers are certainly indicating such. Mixed episode I think. Wonderful.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 06:00:52	I am STARVING. I suspect it is mostly psychological and medication fed but all I want to do is eat. Good job I've not much food in!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-04 00:52:41	I'm having such indecision issues, wish my brain would quiet down with all the whirring of thoughts and be clearer!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-02 19:20:23	@hardfemme @tillyjean_ Bourjois, MUAs really rate it. Revlon is also recommended.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-02 06:22:19	I am so tired of life today, I hope tomorrow is better, being an adult and mental and mostly alone is exhausting.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-02 06:18:38	You know, @taylorswift13 isn't my thing but the whole #swiftmas thing and other stories I hear about her, she seems a tip top person.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-02 02:05:08	People being nice to me makes me cry, a lot, apparently. Dammit!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-02 01:07:19	I really hate the way life likes shitting on me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-02 01:01:06	An aunt on the non-estranged but never really met side of the family passed away today. Another link to my Dad gone. 2015 sucks so far.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 19:37:33	Upsetting someone I really don't want to upset is really not the best start to the year. Rubbish.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 19:08:31	Ho hum what to do what to do. Big life decisions are a pain in the bum, I wish my brain would stop conjuring things up for me to decide on.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 18:33:13	Happy Thursday!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 08:03:45	And of course Happy New Year, even if I find it increasingly odd a celebration!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 08:03:15	Fireworks are crazy loud, don't know what display they're from, quite possibly Boris'. Hope all furries are coping, mine do okay with noise.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 05:59:47	Seven Year Itch, Chinese and red wine all consumed in bed. Happy new year! #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 05:59:01	@marywood59 *Chink* Cheers!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 05:44:43	Drop of French red anyone? #joinin pic.twitter.com/dL47DsgsKe
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 03:56:24	I'm alone, well, with the cats but very happy about it! #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:54:48	@Lala_Brownie See, if I have to be cold I want snow. Love the heat! I'm not really meant for Scottish weather.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:46:30	@Lala_Brownie It sure is a bonny, friendly place. If only we could float it closer to the warm bit of the globe :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:40:17	@Lala_Brownie quite a cold shock to the system when you've become a southern softy!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:40:02	@Lala_Brownie Having bounced back there it's too claustrophobic for me now, too easy to bump into family. They are great places to live, if
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:35:38	@Lala_Brownie I have slowly been upgrading, my flat is a great size, especially for London but this is definitely the limit of affordable.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:32:34	@Lala_Brownie everything as well as I'd like. I don't sew much now because it's such a palaver!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:32:09	@Lala_Brownie I need the practicality of enough room to do it in without major tidy up operations if I'm, as usual, not keeping on top of
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:31:29	@Lala_Brownie There is little to no hope of me ever affording even half a bedroom more here, if I want to consider an income from sewing...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:30:58	@Lala_Brownie I like where I live for the most part but I'd love some space. I know some people Derbyshire way and it's cheap, bonus.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:24:47	My neighbours making ALL OF THE NOISE upstairs is certainly making moving to a quieter spot of the country VERY appealing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:19:19	Further to tweets of this morning. I'm still itchy footed and longing for extra space to stretch out in. Would moving be foolhardy?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:18:34	Going to ask about being put on metformin, will see what she says/thinks.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2015-01-01 00:18:03	I guess one positive of being discharged from pdoc is that it is easy to get appointments quickly with my GP, who is lovely.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-31 22:24:23	@Ladybird_Donna DO IT!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-31 19:35:43	So would it be terrible or terribly foolish. I really wish I didn't get so itchy footed. I just painted for heavens sake!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-31 19:35:07	Of course this would mean leaving London and two of my best friends but we don't see each other much anyway due to life.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-31 19:34:18	I'm having one of my regular should I move out of London crises. The lure of more space cheaply is once again pulling at me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-31 00:02:56	@Ladybird_Donna @DramaLlama85 I find comfort in seeing babble other than my own :) x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 23:59:50	Watching series 2 of Derek, @rickygervais what are you doing to me, weeping wreck!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 22:03:36	I mean, I'm okay, I'm not thinking I don't want to be here, I just can't really see what there might be for me in the future.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 22:02:49	I'd say I have one day a week where I'm not chronically "hungover" from meds. Trying to see a way that's conducive to any sort of life.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 21:39:53	Today I shall consume the final pigs in blankets of the season. A moment of silence please.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 08:50:11	Right on cue, velcro cat number one has arrived, Miss Chilli the matriarch.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 08:47:49	Forgot to turn the heating off. It's now cooling. I expect velcro cats to make an appearance shortly.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 07:49:59	To call my psychiatrist and actually speak to someone useful despite being dishcarged is another #mentalwish Easy access to services.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 07:23:24	@FhionaAlsop @BipolarBlogger @rlpeacocke @Sectioned_ I am FAR from constantly upbeat on my blog!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 07:22:53	@BipolarBlogger @rlpeacocke @FhionaAlsop @Sectioned_ followers on this account yet to get unsolicited clap trap directed at me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 07:22:22	@BipolarBlogger @rlpeacocke @FhionaAlsop @Sectioned_ I actually publish them, to show them up, I rarely reply though. I don't have enough
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 07:13:27	@rlpeacocke @BipolarBlogger @FhionaAlsop @Sectioned_ In the last year I have learned just how ignorant people can be,
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 06:53:49	I was about to tweet the life changing tweet to end all life changing tweets. Then I got distracted and forgot what I was going to tweet.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 06:50:33	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ @FhionaAlsop Where has this "acceptance" trend come from!? Like that does anything to prevent, shorten or stop.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 06:21:02	Saw someone else tweet about waiting times. I am 15 months in to my psychodynamic referral. No sign it will be happening any time soon.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 04:47:30	I think I might have to crack open the cheese this evening, even if it means eating it when it's too cold. A nice gorgonzola if interested!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 00:51:49	He's some boy #Dave the cat pic.twitter.com/nqvchDBhd9
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 00:51:22	Must stop posting pictures without the picture....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 00:25:01	@bdogrunner YOGA! It's a miracle! Don't even worry about your agoraphobia and social anxiety stopping you going, it's a MIRACLE! *Barf*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 00:16:06	@learningtofloat @bdogrunner Psychiatrist.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 00:14:58	@learningtofloat @bdogrunner It's my pdoc, stuck somewhere in the 80s with technology it seems.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 00:14:36	@learningtofloat @bdogrunner Oh my GP is brilliant, although no online/email repeats there either. They can do electronic.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 00:09:12	@learningtofloat @bdogrunner not got the resolve to call and even ask for a call back yet. It's all such hard work.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-30 00:08:48	@learningtofloat @bdogrunner If I never had to make another phone call in my life I'd be very happy about it. Also want to discuss meds but
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 23:59:11	@learningtofloat @bdogrunner I HATE the phone. My pdoc office is also not up with the times, everything hand written, no electronic scripts.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 23:53:19	@bdogrunner And prescription requests!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 23:11:41	@DramaLlama85 Someoen has read a lot of my blog today, I hope it's them and they got an education! #brightside
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 23:09:59	Someone has come to my blog via searching "pip illness fakers". Nice one society.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 23:00:47	@rabbitsoup_zola If it's what you need, do it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 23:00:08	@Hollz2012 @BipolarBlogger Not a fan either. Have had some good ones, NYE and Hogmanay (Scot in England!) but it's mostly a let down.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 21:54:06	@learningtofloat I'm very lucky, I have a really good sized one bed and most stuff hidden but I long for a designated space.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 21:31:21	I'd really love a "spare" room, aka sewing room. On benefits and in London, this is quite the pipe dream! Not that I sew much at the moment!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 18:06:28	Forgot to get tin foil yesterday, which means I'll have to get it today if I want to eat. I want to eat but don't want to leave the flat.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 05:52:29	@happyandbashful In my experience boys are much softer when neutered than girls. Dave misbehaves a lot, other cat friends think it hilarious
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 05:51:19	@happyandbashful We also had £10k in vets bills (paid for by insurance) because he got very ill, I love him very very much.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 05:50:08	@happyandbashful He smashed a new bottle of sherry all over my kitchen floor because he wasn't getting attention when a friend was over.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 05:49:27	@happyandbashful My girls are not assholes, they're just cats. Dave takes it next level. A term of affection and a very accurate descriptor.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 05:04:55	@rabbitsoup_zola Now I feel bad my Oleg is shoved in a cupboard.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 04:57:31	@suzypuss @BipolarBlogger @MarkOneinFour I don't get it here but on FB, where my friends are very selective, I get LOADS. FUCK OFF!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 04:54:28	@rabbitsoup_zola Is now the time to admit I own an Oleg? Not the safari one though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 04:46:01	Dave the cat may be an asshole but he's a very lovely, cuddly, cute asshole and I love him. He gives all of the snuggles.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 02:55:25	Wait, Oleg is staying in Africa?! Is he legal or are we illegal immigrants now too?! #comparethemeerkat
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 01:11:41	@happyandbashful He was a rescue, just lucky he's stripy, I also have a stripy girl and black girl, also rescues :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 01:11:01	@rabbitsoup_zola Don't worry, he was not held, just miffed. He moved once I took the pic though so no second go!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 00:20:32	@rabbitsoup_zola Dave is actually a camera hog, I don't think he wanted to share the picture!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 00:18:55	@rabbitsoup_zola *Blushes* Thank you! Or did you mean Dave? Because Dave is pretty.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-29 00:14:49	Tried to get a selfie with the boy, I don't think he was feeling it..... pic.twitter.com/wUe7xESH5W
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-28 23:02:32	@happyandbashful I don't think any modern machines start with an open door. Leaky door though, nightmare!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-28 22:16:01	Re: last tweet. Maybe I would always have gotten ill, always have developed bipolar but I'd like to have known prevention was attempted.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-28 22:14:55	#mentalwish is that no other 15 year old waits 17 years for treatment and therapy for known life events, leading to chronic mental illness.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-28 22:13:25	When you put a wash on it does help if you also close the washing machine door. I heard a friend of a friend did this, not me, honest......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-28 22:00:49	My #mentalwish is that when people express concerns to their GP they are listened to every time, no matter the age.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-28 20:23:58	@happyandbashful Er no, there is no such thing as ironing unless it is within a sewing context.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-28 20:03:09	Kitchen is essentially back to normal after Christmas chaos. Satisfying. We'll just ignore the mountains of other housework #spoonie
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-28 04:57:01	Blow dried my hair so I don't go to sleep with it wet. It's all blonde bombshell-like, straight and long and flowy. Needs chopped.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-28 01:22:54	Keep losing Eeyore's tail off my onesie. Can't help but feel this is a metaphor for my life.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-27 20:52:04	Dave the cat and I have taken an executive decision to not get out of bed today. And we'll have take away for dinner. So there.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-27 20:31:20	Why so tired still!? I swear my eyes have lead weights attached, just want to sleep and sleep and sleep. Hate feeling like this.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-27 08:05:10	Can't think of anything I want to view less than my year in review. 2014 can well and truly do one, don't let the door hit you..........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-27 06:46:51	Praying to the God's of vintage an Etsy seller will let me do instalments on my Holy Grail item. Please say yes, please say yes, please.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-27 04:08:28	I love how Dave the cat is as enthusiastic about going to bed as I am. Always takes the edge off the guilt if I don't even get up some days!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-26 21:31:35	Thanks BBC2 for the Gene Kelly fest.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-26 20:43:15	Only been up for half an hour. I guess I overspent on spoons majorly yesterday just by cooking. Imagine if I'd seen people too!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-26 07:21:35	I hope you all got through unscathed today, I had such a different experience this year, almost positive in my aloneness. New and nice.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-26 07:20:06	The only time I sleep naturally is during the day, when I'm out of spoons and Dave the cat comes and purrs me to sleep. It's blissful.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-26 05:52:03	Took all of my meds late but ah well, it's Christmas!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-26 04:21:43	@SarahMillican75 Last year's judgy cat is this year's content cat, Dave at the bottom, Betty at the top #joinin pic.twitter.com/q2Z4ltqGo1
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-26 02:49:32	@happyandbashful Oh I am nowhere near being able to eat the cheese!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-26 02:46:53	Still full to the brim yet I am thinking about the leftovers, of which there is a mountain. Could I squeeze in another tatty? #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-26 01:47:37	Had a lovely nap with Dave the cat. He's the best sort of snooze time enabler, he loves a nap with me #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 23:41:56	I'm in bed, out of spoons after all the cooking and eating, going to attempt a nap I think #spoonie #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 22:50:34	Nom! #joinin pic.twitter.com/zdQbXZeMe5
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 22:30:40	@inmywindow Glad you're still getting a decent feed, If I could send some of mine I would, plenty of it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 22:28:58	@bdogrunner @Ladybird_Donna Sometimes it's the only thing for it. Thinking of you xx
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 22:26:05	Watching Christmas in a Day. I hope one day to cry tears of joy #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 21:36:46	@itskathuria It's smelling delicious too!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 18:58:31	@happyandbashful Yes!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 18:58:11	Last year I was supported, this year I hope I'm supporting #joinin And we're trending, top job @SarahMillican75

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 18:50:23	Buck's fizz time, who's in? #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 18:49:50	@KeyHo I'm about to crack on with the buck's fizz! Merry Christmas #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 18:43:37	Is everyone up now then? Dreamies have been dispensed to the kitties here #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 18:39:47	@rabbitsoup_zola @SageSilk Another lone wolf here too. Merry Christmas to you both! #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 17:35:07	Right, croissant and coffee downed. Time for the buck's fizz? #joinin

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 16:58:31	Morning! Croissant in the oven, cats fed, coffee about to be made. Merry Christmas! #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 06:37:22	#joinin was wonderful last year when I was in a very dark place. Not so dark and less emotional about flying solo, see you all tomorrow!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 06:31:28	In bed with Dave the cat, waiting for sleepy time pills to take effect. Far too excited about my one woman eating contest tomorrow! #joinin
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 05:43:28	@Ladybird_Donna Here's to getting through next year too x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 04:47:53	Finding Neverland. Bawling. Great film.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 04:10:43	@imillnotcrazy @bdogrunner Lots of us! Using #joinin to find each other, join us!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 03:14:44	@Life_On_Pause_ @bdogrunner Jesus. I don't iron unless required for sewing, it would make me worse! Hate ironing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 03:14:06	@paul8ar Everyone's got an opinion, often ill informed and wrong.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 03:13:44	@paul8ar I try not to offer advice unless explicitly asked for it but with mental illness it seems it's always open season.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 03:12:38	@FredMounts Yeah, we just need to THINK our way out of mental illness. Was told to take fish oils too. Yawn. Stop making me feel guilty!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 02:14:29	@SageSilk If you feel up to it, use the #joinin hashtag, lots of lonely and alone or just those wanting a bit of support in one place.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-25 02:04:29	Seeing my face alert! Christmas onesie, Eeyore complete with removable tail! #joinin pic.twitter.com/2ocQY5KgvZ
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 23:49:16	Veg prep: Done! Feeling smug, now I can just chill and no other people to deal with too, just me and the mogs, bliss.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 22:42:05	@rabbitsoup_zola @BipolarBlogger I'm about to hit the cake. And mulled cider. I WILL get veg prep done this evening, I WILL.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 22:40:48	Period cramp doesn't feel very festive. Thanks Mother Nature!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 20:47:12	Christmas Eve food! This is usually Christmas Day breakfast but I learned last year it is too much! Nom! pic.twitter.com/TJ8FItQ18X
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 19:58:06	Dave the cat is obsessed with his new water fountain and very restless. Think he knows it's roast duck tomorrow!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 18:48:12	#MentalWish is for people to stop offering unsolicited advice, like yoga will suddenly stop my mood changing, it's essentially shaming.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 18:42:16	I'm really tired today, may have a cheeky nap once the courier has been to pick up my coffee machine for repair. Then on with food prep!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 16:37:53	@learningtofloat @TillyButtons I already have a fair bit of training, really want to cement those skills!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 05:42:26	It's changed! "Once in Royal David's City". Do I know classic carols through a ceiling too well?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 05:41:49	I'm not enjoying it through their ceiling/my floor. They should compensate me in daal and garlic nan.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 05:40:58	It's "Away in a Manger"! Tinkly. Loud. I'm not sure those eating their (delicious) Indian food can really be enjoying the music.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 05:37:53	My wish in general is that the restaurant downstairs would stop playing dreadful tinkly music at full bore all evening. Never used to.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 05:37:11	My #MentalWish for myself is to be stable enough long enough to continue building my dressmaking skills, eventually making for others!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 05:36:09	#MentalWish for 2015 is we don't only value those who working a "normal" job, others can make valuable societal contributions.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 04:29:34	We are hoping a bigger fountain with larger capacity will put paid to his need to break shit. We live in hope!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 04:29:07	Plus she got the cats a snazzy new water fountain after Dave the cat broke the one we had just being a big clumsy asshole. Spoiled.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 04:28:17	My best friend's partner chose my Christmas gift, pointed it out saying he thought I'd like it. Sweetest thing, they're so lovely.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 01:54:00	Chestnuts roasting, rare good memories of childhood getting them from the man on Princes St in Edinburgh on way home from shopping.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 01:46:17	Very much looking forward to being part of #joinin with @SarahMillican75 again this year. Lovely way to lighten a Christmas Day alone.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-24 00:25:07	This #spoonie is all out of spoons but a lovely day with the best friend eating burgers and talking cats.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-23 19:45:25	Erm, bank robbery one street from my flat in Crystal Palace. Bit out of the ordinary that's for sure!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-23 04:47:24	@waitrose I can't call due to phobia, I emailed but don't expect a reply any time soon. Really disappointed with the service overall.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-23 04:12:56	Thanks @waitrose for showing up 4 hours later than earliest time of slot with completely defrosted food needing binned. Merry Christmas!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-23 01:06:35	Spanner in the works slightly, got a message to say groceries will be up to two hours late. TWO HOURS! That's past med time people!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-23 01:05:48	Gosh I've been a busy bee today! Kitchen immaculate, dining table cleared of stuff and coffee machine booked for repair. Phew!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-22 04:24:59	Christmas food arrives tomorrow! Never been happier I was vaguely organised and booked a slot weeks ago! Yummy yummy yummy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-22 03:24:25	In this digital age, why do so many companies still insist on phone calls? Not very accessible really.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-22 03:13:49	@rabbitsoup_zola I aim for once a fortnight, I live alone so only one body. I think most do once a week.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-22 01:49:05	@inmywindow I haven't seen any of my "rockabilly" friends in over a year, I just can't get to events or weekenders. Missing so much.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-22 01:16:13	@inmywindow And in general I feel left out of everything, friendships dying and yet I still can't force myself out of the flat.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-22 01:15:34	@inmywindow I am finding I am getting frustrated that a particularly busy friend doesn't see me more. It's not her fault.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-22 01:07:10	@inmywindow This is my experience too. Major mission to leave my local area, so rarely see anyone or do anything.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 20:44:08	Cats are on nursing shifts. Dave just took over from Chilli. They're good little MH nurses, no judging, just quietly keeping me company.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 07:02:38	Well, pub over the road is certainly lively with festive cheer. I don't wish they would STFU at all! Nope! Not me! Carry on being noisy!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 06:57:40	@Depressed_spark Oh gosh, I think even that's too far for me. Would get my tits out first.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 05:50:32	Ambulance outside my building. Not for me. #phew
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 05:46:24	Okay, Twitter, I need to be serious a moment. How can we get me Dlist famous enough to be asked to do Strictly? #seriousface
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 04:45:31	@annedraya I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous. Okay. I'm jealous.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 04:39:42	@serpentgrr @DramaLlama85 :) I'm not sure whether he was always a Dave or if calling him that was my undoing. He's quite a cat either way!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 04:36:48	@serpentgrr @DramaLlama85 Dave proudly gives it a good lick once he's had his moment with aforementioned blanket/cardigan.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 04:34:26	I just can't take Bono seriously, he looks like that man with the funny voice in Police Academy. What was his name?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 04:17:14	@bdogrunner @insanity_art I never got round to part two but happy to answer questions.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 04:16:48	@bdogrunner @insanity_art I did an MR, was assessed by a physiotherapist. Check my blog post to start! https:// attentionseekingsurvivor.wordpress.com/2014/03/14/goi ng-on-the-sick-is-easy-pip-part-one/ …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 04:14:00	@serpentgrr @DramaLlama85 Erm, the pink lipstick comes out with Dave the cat. And yes, he is neutered. He brings such shame on my family.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 04:13:05	@DramaLlama85 Boy cat gets very enamoured with anything fleecy or woollen. All cardigans, onesies, blankets and dressing gowns are at risk!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 03:43:24	Pasha is my favourite. #StrictlyFinal
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 02:27:27	@hardfemme @inmywindow Conversely it makes no difference whatsoever to me. In fact, I suspect they cancel each other out for me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 00:49:43	@rabbitsoup_zola Yep, I regretted accepting pretty quickly! We can have our own little Twitter Christmas :) I always do a good spread!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 00:33:25	@BipolarBlogger @PaulJThinks I thought I wanted babies, then I got a cat and realised that cat babies are just dandy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 00:32:46	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm staying home, I have three cats, taking with not an option, especially for nervous Betty.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 00:25:36	@BipolarBlogger @PaulJThinks Erm, this happened in my mid 20s. No babies for me, they're cute but for other people. I'll stick with cats.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 00:19:18	@Ladybird_Donna Hang in there, I'm reading and urging you on x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 00:13:52	@Sectioned_ So glad I'm not the only one who can just about muster a call but when it clicks to leave a message, freak out!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 00:12:23	My friend was really looking forward to it and we had bought some yummy food.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 00:11:52	Suddenly I feel lighter. Clearly I should never have accepted Christmas invitation, too pressured a day. I feel bad though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-21 00:07:23	Is it wrong that I'm sort of relieved my cat sitter for Christmas day has had an emergency and can no longer do it? No false cheer for me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-20 07:21:28	Suspected new flatmate upstairs, the stomping and banging and thumping has increased exponentially the last few weeks. STFU!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-20 06:26:02	So I left a message with the duty officer, although the machine said assessment team. Nobody called me back. Thanks for that. #bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-20 02:18:44	Oh and yoga! Get out of the house and sweat, you'll be right as rain then!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-20 02:12:11	Added someone new on FB. Fish oils, light boxes and hormone balancing will cure me. Thanks for that..............
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-20 00:14:16	@rabbitsoup_zola You know, this season, combined with shit services has an awful lot of unwanted misery to answer for. Big hugs x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-20 00:05:29	@inmywindow I happen to have the same views and made Christmas yummies donation to the food bank. Some folks don't mind them though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-20 00:04:40	Shit. Wish I could cancel on my friend, should never have accepted her Christmas invite. I just want to hibernate.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-20 00:03:14	@inmywindow Do you have a Sally Army? I know my local one is doing food, gift and toy collections.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 23:49:07	@rabbitsoup_zola Having been discharged and calling to ask to be seen again. Or even if they will call me back!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 23:48:41	@rabbitsoup_zola I have generally had a good experience once accessing services from epic waiting lists. Don't know how it works from here.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 23:47:50	So is this it? A few euthymic months followed by depression? I am so annoyed right now. It's all a bit of a bastard.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 23:46:30	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm okay-ish. Not back where I was when it was really bad but heading that way. Have called MH team and left a message.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 23:22:50	@rabbitsoup_zola Clean sheets, an elixir of life.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 23:13:40	Fuck fuck fuck it all. Fuck you bipolar, fuck you depression, just fuck it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 23:13:15	I don't know that I can even call, which means asking my friends to do it, which means worrying her and I hate adding to her stress.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 23:12:47	So I guess I have to call the clinic and ask be seen again, undischarged if you will. I have no idea, I've never been here before.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 23:06:55	Tired, cold, fed up. Hello depression, not so nice to see you again. Balls. Don't really know what to do about it either.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 05:04:01	Dave the cat is snoring his head off, flat on his back, on my side of the bed. Typical male really..........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 04:59:33	@debecca @DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger These bad boys. http://www. marksandspencer.com/lace-high-rise -midi/p/p22237172 …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 04:56:02	@debecca @DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger I have a large stock of not unattractive M&S big number with lacy legs. Always buy the same ones!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 04:24:24	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger Due to my style, I have to wear big pants, high waisted anything with a tiny thong and stomach fat is not good
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 03:49:48	The worst thing about depression for me is that it feels like it should be something I can control but it's not, I am at its mercy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 02:36:17	@alicemeat And other people feel very awkward when you say you're getting nothing and doing nothing!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 02:35:45	@alicemeat I'm getting better at doing it alone, it's the questions before and after that get me. I don't get many gifts or do big events.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 02:18:17	I don't really see how this comfy, Dave..... pic.twitter.com/1GRn2JGqh7
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 02:15:04	@alicemeat I'm supposed to be going to a friend (estranged from my family) but I really want to just hide with my cats. Can't let her down.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 02:13:15	@alicemeat Hate feeling so crap you can't cry, no emotional release is worse than crying at times.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 02:12:41	@alicemeat If I'm honest, I think I've been on the down for a few weeks now but was in denial. It really hit me hard today though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 02:09:35	@alicemeat I'm hoping this is a minor blip because depressive episodes suck big hairy ones.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 02:05:21	Please don't let me be falling down the hole again.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 02:05:03	Yeah, super negative Shona appears to be making a resurgence :( I so enjoyed the euthymia, I want it back.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 02:00:23	"Christmas is just a day" Is it? Is it really? So it hasn't been rammed down our throats since November then?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 00:08:20	Oh dear, such a Debbie downer today. I'd forgotten how miserable it feels to be this miserable.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 00:05:26	@thetwofairies Super easy not to peek when you have no gifts!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-19 00:04:07	Feeling very very shit and nobody seems to give a shit, which makes me feel shitter. Fuck fuck fuck.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 22:04:47	Christmas blues just smacked right in the middle of the face. I'm not impressed. Wish I could hibernate.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 20:42:25	@thetwofairies I gave my old kettle to someone in need, am sending unique bedding across the pond to 5 people and donated to the food bank!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 20:37:29	I have received exactly 0 Christmas cards. Not sure if this is a comment about how little I'm thought of, or cards aren't sent much any more
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 18:00:53	Ankle update. Twisted it proper, I'm hobbling about today and it's very sore. Feeling sorry for my clumsy self.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 17:59:35	My box of happy, vintage and vintage re-issue pattern collection. Building up nicely! pic.twitter.com/9Ub5U2stem
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 05:15:47	Throbby ankle. I am such a doofus. (And a moaner, expect more of this).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 04:36:23	Finally put the winter duvet on yesterday and Chilli matriarch cat is loving the extra snuggliness, been in bed all day!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 03:44:07	This isn't even the first time I've done this, it's the second time! I think it may be a worse twist this time though, I'm a liability.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 03:43:28	I was just pondering how much I hate Wednesdays as it's rubbish day. Just twisted my ankle falling down the stairs with said rubbish.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 03:12:25	Trying Joico shampoo and conditioner for blonde hair, it's so good I have inadvertently gone silver. Must not leave on so long next time!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 01:11:45	Just made coffee instead of tea, d'oh! Just when I think my brain is behaving itself..........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-18 00:53:57	Someone just bitched about their husband's anxiety to me not knowing my deal. Wee bit awkward. At least it was online!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-17 19:01:30	So I got this festive bedding and posted it in vintage group on FB. 400 likes later I am now a bedding dealer! pic.twitter.com/bLplyM8xVy
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-17 02:48:53	Just casually rolling all over my bed because it's new bedding and former feral Betty likes to piss on things that don't smell of us!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-16 21:29:26	Seriously so giddy about my secret santa, I don't get many gifts as a general life rule so this has made my week! 8 patterns, 8 PATTERNS!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-16 21:12:00	I think I just got the best #vintagesecretsanta EVER! 8 vintage re-issue patterns, so amazing! pic.twitter.com/3Gey6qk1Od
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-16 01:51:47	Pressies all wrapped. Just two more to arrive. Post Office tomorrow to send some off! pic.twitter.com/JBwb4e8mRz
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-16 01:46:09	Erm, feeling a bit Christmassy with wrapping presents and ordering very cool Christmas bedding. Very odd, I'll enjoy it while it lasts!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-15 05:34:30	So this asshole broke a new bottle of sherry all over the kitchen floor because he wasn't getting all the attention. pic.twitter.com/whidoWAVui
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-14 01:25:10	I have finished my Christmas shopping, hurrah! Mostly online, some local as I live near some great little shops. Chinese for tea as reward.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-13 02:08:44	I'm so tired I'm all emotional, hit me from nowhere, I don't like it at all. Roll on bed time and a new day.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-13 01:08:03	Really tired today. Just had a shower and am now completely wiped out, didn't realise I was THAT tired. But hey, yay for showering right?!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 07:35:12	@MsJadeRebecca What the hell is going on there!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 05:34:18	With no casualties, obvs.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 05:34:09	Scaffolding that is back up being an eyesore because the developers didn't stick to their planning permission. Hope it takes out the lot.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 05:33:20	Haven't taken my zop yet, half an hour late so far. Mostly because I'm kind of interested to see if the scaffolding over the road takes off.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 05:30:45	My little blog has passed the 10'000 individual page views mark. Never thought it would pass 1000 to be honest!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 05:05:24	@BipolarBlogger @inmywindow So I have a little LED tree from Poundstretcher to put on a shelf and a "Noel" sign and that's it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 05:04:52	@BipolarBlogger @inmywindow Poundland which both look lovely when done. Just can't be bothered with fixing it every morning this year!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 05:04:16	@BipolarBlogger @inmywindow No tree in my house because I live with savages (cats). I have a cheap pink one from eBay and a small one from
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 04:49:18	I mean seriously, someone thinks my work is good enough, my health irrelevant enough to offer me work. Mind. Blown.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 04:45:33	It's surprisingly validating and gives me something else to aim for.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 04:45:07	offered me work when I'm ready. It's floored me a bit, I still don't feel "qualified" enough let alone with everything else.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 04:44:19	I know a lot of small businesses and I made a joke about working for one of them as a seamstress. She knows all about me and has seriously
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 04:43:26	Sometimes, a kindness comes from somewhere unexpected and it's rather lovely and gives me hope.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 04:00:17	Out with the girly old, in with the blue new! pic.twitter.com/3H6oKB6avo
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 03:06:39	Granted, he had to share the leftovers with the girls but he's cat a FFS, not the world's fattest man.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 03:05:54	Also, Dave the cat is being a complete asshole. Thinks he's hungry when I just gave him the chicken leftovers I was going to have tomorrow!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 03:04:59	@rabbitsoup_zola I am a bit! Good old @myhermes service at its best!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 03:01:48	Still no sign of my kettle, still out for delivery (allegedly). Still no cup of tea. Might have to give in and use the old kettle.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 01:20:26	Twitter "retires" #cameronmustgo so Twitterland regroups and today #cameonout is trending. Top job!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 01:17:16	A first world moment I grant you but still, NEW KETTLE! I am also aware how tragic it is to be excited about a kettle. I don't care.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-12 01:16:42	My new kettle is out for delivery. I'm refusing to make a cup of tea until it arrives. Had my old kettle for 10 years so a bit of a moment!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-11 23:21:23	Although it's a pointless task today asUCAS is down for maintenance. Doesn't stop the butterflies with every email notification!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-11 23:20:34	I've not been checking in much, Twitter. I think it's because I'm in this weird limbo waiting to hear from uni. Just email watching.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-11 02:18:53	I bought selection boxes today. I can't guarantee I won't eat them and have to buy more.....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-10 04:50:30	This means I shall have to try and shower first thing, always tricky. I wish it wasn't so hard, I wish I knew why it is hard!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-10 04:49:39	Scheduled myself to shower today, totally forgot. Damn it! I need to leave the flat tomorrow and there's not enough dry shampoo in the world
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-09 18:26:27	Just joyous, enjoy folks! Flash Mob: The U.S. Air Force Band at the Smithsonian: http:// youtu.be/-cKE8pyfcZc via @YouTube
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-09 04:18:44	Can I just not buy any presents this year and buy myself pretty things instead? I am so out of ideas this year!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-09 04:11:44	@annedraya @DramaLlama85 *Blushes* Thanks!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-09 04:10:27	@DramaLlama85 @annedraya I will! I won't shut up about it as I've been keeping it quite quiet from friends just in case they say no.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-09 04:09:57	@annedraya @DramaLlama85 Thanks! Can I gloat a bit? This is what I made before my health forced me to quit. pic.twitter.com/vwdzXJMFdP
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-09 04:07:11	@DramaLlama85 @annedraya Had my interview day last Thursday, just waiting for UCAS to end me the email of joy or doom.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-09 04:06:09	@DramaLlama85 @annedraya I enjoy faffing about with fabric!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-09 04:05:54	@DramaLlama85 @annedraya Well, I've done a bit of costume construction study and hope to return to uni next year to try again!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-09 04:03:37	@DramaLlama85 @annedraya Ha! I actually make things now and again. Got quite the collection of vintage patterns accumulating.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-09 04:01:02	TW: Facebook, for all its faults, saved a friends life tonight after she OD'd.Mental illness and families are a total bitch.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-08 18:45:45	@SkyHelpTeam for a few minutes and comes back. Sometimes every couple of minutes, sometimes I can go hours but persistent for several days
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-08 18:45:00	@SkyHelpTeam no odds in that situation. By the time I dig out a cable, go to the router and plug it in likely to be back again as it drops
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-08 18:44:08	@SkyHelpTeam Not as yet because I do get the exclamation over my wireless icon on the laptop when it happens, assumed being wired would make
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-08 18:34:02	@SkyHelpTeam Speed isn't the issue, it's the constant complete dropping of a connection altogether. It's not dropped yet this morning.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-08 18:27:41	@SkyHelpTeam Wireless.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-08 18:19:17	@SkyHelpTeam Worse in peak evening time, can drop every few minutes, comes back of its own accord.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-08 18:18:43	@SkyHelpTeam Dialling tone fine, changed over cable that goes to modem, turned off and on countless times, connection just keeps dropping.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-08 02:59:14	@skyhd It's just not offering an inclusive service. What if I'm never able to call, just stuck with shit service forever. Ugh.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-08 02:57:23	My internet is so bad at the moment and @skyhd don't let you email report so I'm going to have to call. I miss @plusnet and their emails.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-06 03:56:55	Also #firstworldproblems but still. Make it in a 2 slice, I ight be a pig but I don't need 4 slices of toast at any time!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-06 03:56:16	Just ordered a new kettle, want a matching toaster but they only do 4 slice, what does a single person need a 4 slice toaster for!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-06 01:30:00	Yesterday I discovered I talk so much when I'm nervous, that when I do shut up, people who barely know me feel they need to check I'm okay!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-05 03:53:54	My Internet is so cheap lately, it's making the curl up with a hot water bottle and good docu aspect of my day a lot harder than I'd like!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-05 03:49:54	Today's exertions are hitting hard now. Is it bedtime yet? Don't think I can keep my eyes open too much longer!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-05 01:51:49	Dave the cat seems to have missed me immeasurably today. He's smooshed up beside me purring away, happy to have me home!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-05 00:52:00	Just home from uni interview. SO TIRED but I think it went well, it was nice to be back there and see some old tutors. Yay me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-04 05:32:31	be rendering meds useless. Oh well, caffeine by drip in the morning it is!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-04 05:31:59	Uni interview tomorrow. Attempting to get an early night as I'll be up earlier than usual and want to be awake. However nerves appear to...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-04 05:31:01	@rabbitsoup_zola I have bed socks but I usually get too hot unless it's very cold. I don't care if they're sexy!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-04 05:24:37	@rabbitsoup_zola LOL, as if I didn't feel ancient enough :) Maybe I'll get the hot water bottle for tonight :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-04 05:22:45	It's a bit cold tonight isn't it! Cold toes even though I'm in bed. Time to change from the summer duvet?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-04 04:09:51	@rabbitsoup_zola I think this year may be the year I go to the doctor, it's seriously beginning to threaten my ability to walk.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-04 02:33:54	Pretty sure I have arthritis in my big toe joints. Gets worse every winter, today it's just the right foot but it makes walking very sore!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 23:27:05	@DramaLlama85 I'm a Branston beans girl, been converted!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 22:44:27	Turned by my faux fur jacket into a high neck warmer item with the use of a cute pin is my win for the day! pic.twitter.com/yNykmz45jy
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 22:36:40	@alicemeat So pretty, love it in the blues.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 21:51:04	@dearjanit @debecca @robmhan Wait, what? MY WHOLE LIFE IS A LIE!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 21:50:33	Had to have passport photos done today (not for a passport) and I definitely have the air of a serial killer about me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 20:21:25	That "100 years of make-up" video doing the rounds? It's terrible, completely inaccurate and badly executed. There. I said it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 19:48:41	@TescoLiving Not really. Small kitchen electricals maybe but no more painting or building furniture!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 19:47:43	@alicemeat ah yes, one my favourite vintage purchases this year!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 19:14:10	I also did a but if bedroom sorting this year, with a lovely new bed and wardrobe. pic.twitter.com/kghc1TCw75
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 19:12:31	@alicemeat Done!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 19:10:46	And a spare b cause you're only allowed 4 at once. pic.twitter.com/rt3K5q2WJ7
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 19:10:12	By popular demand! Ish. Lounge photos. pic.twitter.com/RfYobz2K9L
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 19:07:14	@alicemeat You actually made me look to see what I'd uploaded. Haven't added the pics of just about complete lounge make-over. Might add.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 19:04:42	@alicemeat Haha! Thank you, not stalkery at all. Well, not too much ;)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 18:49:45	@alicemeat Rocketing rents and good threader two minutes from my flat mean I'm never moving again. Ever.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 18:45:11	@alicemeat She also said "I love your eyebrows" which made me love her even more!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 18:44:55	@alicemeat I am familiar with the horror. Finding someone good is a lot harder than it should be. I shall spend the day admiring my brows.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 18:34:02	Love my eyebrow threader, no longer do I need to grow my eyebrows back every time someone does a botched job. Little things.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 05:40:30	I did two loads of washing today because I ran out of clean pants. Seems I still have some standards to motivate me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-03 05:38:41	@drinksinthedark I'm rubbish at physical illness. First sign of a sniffle and I'm bitching profusely! I don't get physically ill much though
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 22:27:15	@debecca No consumption!? It just gets more ridiculous! I'd like to meet the person who drew the list up, they seem a hoot!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 22:13:32	@ClaraUnravelled Have a particularly messy orgasm and are female? Witch! Burn her!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 21:00:01	Re: my llast tweet. A long list of sex acts just got banned in UK porn http://www. independent.co.uk/news/uk/a-long -list-of-sex-acts-just-got-banned-in-uk-porn-9897174.html …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 20:59:12	Female orgasms are dangerous now?! Good lord. Women of Britain, beware the dangerous female ejaculation! Did we stumble back to the 50s?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 05:34:13	@inmywindow Pretty sure I had that same dress....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 05:07:03	@annedraya Thank you! Thankfully it's my old uni (illness drop out) so it will be lots of familiar faces alongside wide eyed kids!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 04:59:46	@BipolarBlogger Luckily all of those people weeded themselves out ages ago. Those really do grind my gears.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 04:59:03	Actually the uni thing is terrifying but I'm trying to pretend it's just exciting.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 04:58:45	Uni interview in 3 DAYS!! 3 DAYS!! Then Edward Scissorhands ballet later this month. All of the yayness.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 04:57:28	@BipolarBlogger You know the types. "Ah but my best mate is disabled and she thought it was hilarious so you're wrong and PC gone mad"
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 04:56:29	@BipolarBlogger Upon pointing out I had remained pleasant and reasonable vs barrage of come backs told to bog off. Just made me chuckle.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 04:55:45	@BipolarBlogger In this instance I was ready for it. They've all dug themselves rather large, bitter holes while I remained pleasant.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-12-02 04:44:05	Oh Facebook. Just got called the PC brigade for objecting to a picture. One picture. Methinks I'm not the one that need to "chill".
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-30 08:16:16	@debecca Not wrong but I think you have to be realistic that she may be noting like Annie. Depends how well you'd deal with that.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-30 08:15:21	@drinksinthedark Wait, only 10% of mental illnesses are NOT learned behaviour?! Any truth in that at all!? This is a terrible article.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-30 07:39:19	@rabbitsoup_zola It's horrific. Her suicide wasn't enough for them, let's drag her through the mud some more. Her poor family.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-30 07:38:11	@katabaticesque The "real" story about the girl who committed suicide pending a private court case against a rape accusation. Online now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-30 07:36:03	@rabbitsoup_zola Massive hugs xx
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-30 07:29:27	Daily Mail, you are fucking disgusting. Stooped to new lows with your headline "story".
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-29 06:29:39	The Guardian and Observer Christmas appeal 2014: mental health http:// gu.com/p/43yzc/stw
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-29 00:25:11	#CameronMustGo because he told me and other abuse survivors we're conspiracy theorists whilst cutting mental health budgets that support us.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-29 00:15:02	@rabbitsoup_zola Haha, someone on FB said the same thing! It's polka dots on the other side, I love it too :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-28 23:44:39	Look Teitter, getting my (rare) cook on. Chicken and tarragon pie, cheating the pastry, can't get too carried away! pic.twitter.com/hHsURLOlPg
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-28 00:36:33	#CameronMustGo because no part of the NHS should be run for profit, never mind by a flipping arms dealer!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 23:55:36	Oh that's right, we're all hard lefty loonies aren't we? Can't possibly have valid reasons for why #CameronMustGo
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 23:54:28	Can't believe #cameronmustgo is subject to a complete media blackout. Has anything been in the top three trends for so long before?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 05:31:56	@2BipolarChicks Been SAD lamping for a week now! So far not too miserable!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 05:18:46	@debecca I'd be very tempted to dial 999, asthma attacks are no joke.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 05:09:47	@Ladybird_Donna I get this. Sometimes the relived trauma that comes with the memories just feels like too much weight to carry. ((hugs))
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 05:01:49	Uni interview a week tomorrow, eczema underarm stress itch is kicking it into overdrive. Argh! *Applies more hydrocortisone cream*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 04:57:35	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola Ah god, *you're! The shame. That's worse than not getting my joke.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 04:56:21	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola Haha, hoping your playing dumb and getting my lame Friends reference........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 04:36:42	@BipolarBlogger @Projectlibero @rabbitsoup_zola Show him your bra, he's afraid of bras, can't work 'em!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 04:34:51	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola different to when I didn't take meds! I do have a strong constitution though and I'm Scottish ;)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 04:34:24	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola for me to drink, just to be careful the first few times while I monitored the effect. It's honestly no
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 04:33:53	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola I was abstaining and made a joke about hitting the pub to my psych. That's when he said it was totally fine
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 03:32:08	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola I have absolutely no issues with alcohol on it and my psych has no problem with me having the odd drink.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 00:44:13	Just a friend and her son. She moved a while ago so it will also be a big catch up. Quite looking forward to it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-27 00:43:45	Well, I have had a Christmas day invitation I'm going to accept as it's not someone elses big family shindig where I'll feel awkward.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-26 01:41:46	I never thought showering would become a noteworthy event but here we are! I showered! Woo!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 20:59:51	@hardfemme You can mix these safely. As for fade, blues last longer than reds but all "unnatural" colours fade fast and are high maintenance
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 19:49:15	as I did last night and funnily enough I do want to start yoga, not because I think it will help my bipolar (although it would be a bonus).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 19:48:16	It's hard isn't it? Not offending each other with what is kindness, just sort of misdirected. Anyway, the good news is I don't feel as blue
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 19:46:47	is rather trickier than just telling me to do it and move on. But genuinely thank you for caring enough to even take the time to type it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 19:45:50	I mean, I appreciate people care enough to want to help but I'm afraid yoga probably isn't going stabilise my mood and forgetting the past
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 19:44:58	I'm really bad at finding ways to be polite when offered well meaning advice from people who don't understand bipolar.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 07:18:16	That bit of road gets more action than Russell Brand, it's been dug up so many times!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 07:17:39	Digging up the road right outside my window right now. Thanks Croydon Council, it's a delightful noise at this time of night!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 06:33:16	@rabbitsoup_zola There is definitely comfort in the shared experience, as awful as those experiences were. x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 06:22:36	@rabbitsoup_zola Thank you. I have great friends and now Twitter but it doesn't stop an attack of feeling blue about it does it?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 06:21:51	@rabbitsoup_zola @UKstandalone Yes I do xx
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 05:58:27	I'm able to feel the effects years of all forms of abuse had on me, after burying them for so long. It's a long old battle I face.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 05:57:43	much bad it can be devastating. I mostly cope now but have to remember protecting myself also lead to my breakdown.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 05:56:48	When you lose your family in one fell swoop you lose so much. And when you can't even have the good memories without the tarnish of so...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 05:56:02	There will be no more family get togethers. My nieces and nephews don't know me. My Christmas' are alone. Birthdays not worth mentioning.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 05:54:59	It's all a very logical response, don't stay where you're not believed and re-abused. But it doesn't stop it hurting. I have no family now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 05:53:15	Easier, I suppose, to uphold the lies than face the terrible, dark, unpalatable truth. Rather lose me than lose anything themselves.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 05:52:28	So sad to see fellow Tweeps who have been let down by their family. Reminds me how sad it is to walk away. Nobody stopped me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 05:37:30	@Ladybird_Donna I don't like it, I don't know how she does it, but I understand.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 05:36:51	@Ladybird_Donna In my mother's case, I think her fear of being alone overrides everything. Always protects her men (my brother included).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 03:16:41	@Ladybird_Donna ((hugs))
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 01:55:36	@DramaLlama85 Thank you, one thing my Mum got right was my name, I've always liked it too!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 01:48:34	Put my name on here, well, first name. Time to give myself my name dear Twitter. Not as anonymous!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 01:26:17	Because of the Daily Mail's "scrounger" rhetoric that has contributed to a dramatic increase in disabled hate crimes #CameronMustGo
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 01:22:52	Because of scrapping the ILF and cutting back DSA #cameronmustgo
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 01:20:02	Because he has borrowed more in 4 years than Labour did in 13 #cameronmustgo
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-25 01:18:34	Because of thousands ill and disabled harassed to death by the DWP #cameronmustgo and he can IDS with him!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-24 22:35:58	@hardfemme If I was asked I'd do it, I'd also ask you to remind me if I slipped to the name I was used to out of habit.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-24 17:56:05	@OwenJones84 Get a rescue moggy, we are in an over-population crisis and need all the homes we can get. Not paying a breeder also a win.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-24 03:59:17	My flat gets to steal so much heat from others that my heating is on lowest setting and I still have summer duvet on! #smugtweet
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-24 03:48:02	@Ladybird_Donna Such a good point. My mum has terrible health and I wonder what will happen when her time comes, how I'll feel.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 18:39:13	Just went and made a coffe but now light headed and dizzy. What's that about then, I don't like it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 07:23:08	@annedraya @rabbitsoup_zola @Sectioned_ @BipolarBlogger Both it will be when I get them!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 07:06:59	@rabbitsoup_zola @Sectioned_ @BipolarBlogger @annedraya Pens or pencils? I have both on my wish list, wonder what works best.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 07:04:35	@BipolarBlogger @Sectioned_ I saw a VERY rudey one on Amazon yesterday. I'm scarred.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 05:40:03	Ah euthymia, you're pretty friggin' cool when you decide to visit aren't you? Stick around please!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 04:09:51	@amyelle11 My friend uses it all the time for Facebook messenger so some people clearly don't feel silly.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 04:04:53	@amyelle11 I switched her off! Never used her, feel a twat talking to my phone.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 04:03:47	Argh, think my old lady hips are really starting to suffer with inactivity. Must force myself to stretch and walk more I suppose.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 04:00:34	@Harryshelper Oh yes, nightmare! I've always lived in hilly places (Edinburgh, Glasgow). I imagine there will be a time I won't like it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 03:58:55	@Harryshelper Blimey! Yes I can imagine "There's no snow here!".
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 03:56:54	@Harryshelper I'm in London so weather is actually okay, I'd actually love to live in the countryside or coast, middle of nowhere.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 03:56:06	@Harryshelper Oh and my friends and I call the hill from the station "The Hill of Doom". It's a killer hill.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 03:54:31	@Harryshelper I only moved to a hill last year, never lived on a flood plain though, must be awful to have that fear every year.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 03:47:44	Flood warnings. Once again I live at the top of a hill, on the first floor. No floods for us!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 02:19:56	@Ladybird_Donna I'm not an angry person, apparently it's something I should feel better about expressing. Thanks Psychologist!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 01:29:18	Not been on Twitter much today because I have been busy being productive! How are you all?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-23 01:00:52	@Ladybird_Donna Anger is a natural part of grief and you are grieving for your family and for Little Donna. You won't feel this way forever.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 23:18:49	I have finished something well before deadline. This is unprecedented, I am the queen of procrastination. A week and a half early!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 19:33:59	Must. Do. Housework. Stuck. To. Bed. Send. Help. Or a cleaner, you know, I'm not fussed.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 04:46:11	Looking at pictures of me from earlier this year. I really need a haircut. It's cuter and easier to set. Come on money!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 04:38:11	@rabbitsoup_zola I buy loads from the US, so much my sorting office postie was confused today when I wasn't collecting clothing shaped mail!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 04:36:49	@rabbitsoup_zola If you dare try to palm off 80s shit or 70s polyester I will give you "the look". I probably need to chill out a bit! Haha.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 04:35:53	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm VERY serious about it, probably too serious. Bad vintage is my nemesis. Tourists have taken my photo, lots.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 04:31:23	@rabbitsoup_zola Dry shampoo and bobbles are the greatest. And in my case with the vintage thing, head scarves.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 04:28:30	Briefly considered having my Bettie bangs chopped back in. Then realised I would need to be much more on top of the hair washing situation.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 03:33:21	@Ladybird_Donna I will! Will be a few weeks, overspent last month so broke until I even out again. Oops.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 03:32:38	And yes I am allergic to cats. Yes I share my home with three of them. And no I don't care about it because. Cats. Cats are awesome.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 03:31:54	I know I need to vacuum and change bedding urgently when I get really sneezy. Why do I have to be allergic to EVERYTHING!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 00:42:59	@Ladybird_Donna You've inspired me, added colouring books and pens and pencils to my Amazon wish list today!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-22 00:35:54	*Puts oven on to cook dinner. Immediately orders take away* #oops #sorrynotsorry

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-21 22:48:23	@mindofabipolar @rabbitsoup_zola @debecca @NyxyNyx @BipolarBlogger @drinksinthedark @fuzz_walk Think I was at 14 when I first checked today!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-21 05:38:26	as much as possible. It might be a disaster but at least I'll know I tried and to work round that.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-21 05:38:02	I tried this a couple of weeks ago but it was too soon after reducing Z. Hoping tonight is the night. I really want to reclaim natural sleep
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-21 05:37:05	I'm going off piste! I have been doing sort of well on the lower dose of Z combined with Phenergan. Tonight, feel sleepy, so trying just P!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-21 05:26:38	I'm totally having an "I fucking love my cats" moment. My cats are the best and cutest, so there!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-21 05:04:42	eyes out I said I didn't know and she's the Dr! Refused home visit, well, refused anything. First time I had ever been close to real crisis.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-21 05:03:39	Not quite #crisisteamfail but called GP when couldn't leave house for meds. Junior called back and asked what I wanted her to do. Bawling my
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-20 20:54:54	And now I'm going to have scampi and chips for lunch and not feel guilty that it comes from the freezer instead of me attempting to cook.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-20 20:54:10	be a bit more compassionate and forgiving of myself. Which is also an amazing feeling.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-20 20:53:32	This mostly being euthymic thing is quite good! I still function terribly but not being chronically depressed makes it so much easier to
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-20 04:28:11	@Ladybird_Donna I'm so pleased you're finding some hope to cling to, it's really lovely to see x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-20 03:19:03	I am completely wiped out now too. Had time to digest today's outing and have dinner. Now clock watching for sleepy time!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-20 03:18:12	Wedding dresses exhibition, not as amazing as I think it could have been. Horst exhibition bloody brilliant, great use of mixed media.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-19 23:29:40	I shall now hibernate for several days in smug triumph. So proud, didn't rush myself or anything, just a lovely wee day out.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-19 23:28:33	What a lovely day I've had Twitter! Got myself to the V&A and back in one piece! Saw two exhibitions and had lunch, all on my own!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-18 21:59:26	It's here! It's here! SAD lamp has arrived! Maybe I'm a bit sad for being so excited............
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-18 21:53:47	I will of course have my "fuck off and leave me alone" kit of headphones and tablet, even if I can't concentrate enough to read!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-18 21:52:20	Today is a moaning with a friend and root doing day. Tomorrow, V&A goodness! Central London, by myself! Look at me go!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-18 21:46:09	@Cat_Cassels @Ladybird_Donna I was born a cat lady, my dad was a cat man, it's inherited. Welcome to the club!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-18 06:38:35	I had a nap earlier. I am now seeing the folly of my ways given I am wide awake with all meds downed. But there was a cat and a bed and.....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-18 04:39:44	@Ladybird_Donna My iPhone 6 came preloaded with about a million emoticons, I really should use them more! And yes, it has a ladybug.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-18 03:42:24	My SAD lamp has been dispatched! *Does excited little jig
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-17 22:14:13	I have come back to bed. Dave and Betty immediately joined me. I think a nap may be in the offing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-17 19:28:48	Someone on my FB posted about Broadmoor, thinking it was a good docu and makes a case for bringing back asylums. Yes really. Lock us all up.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-17 19:03:40	Leaving a phone message and forgetting your own number. Mortified.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-17 05:53:15	I'm also seeing to the eyebrows but that's not so scary, just down the road and the lady is lovely.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-17 05:52:28	This week is a big week. I have booked tickets for two exhibitions on Wednesday (in same museum). This involves the tube and people!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-17 05:48:42	I tell a lie, the dream where I bought a mansion was pretty fun. If not exacerbating the sleep issues.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-17 05:48:07	Feeling all woozy just from the Q tonight, so here's hoping I get significantly better sleep tonight, last night was not fun.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-17 04:26:41	Victim blamers are twats. Fuck you Guardian commenter.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-17 00:20:31	I love Dave the cat cuddles, cradled on my chest, head under my chin, purring his head off while we just quietly enjoy the moment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 22:42:55	Hmm, hello unexpected new followers. Might you be here because I support Ched Evans not getting a new contract? Just a theory!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 21:41:05	@Ladybird_Donna Lots of hugs to you xx
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 21:37:31	@Ladybird_Donna So hard :(
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 20:44:56	@Ladybird_Donna Showering remains one of my biggest internal fights. Why is it so difficult!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 19:58:51	@shinybluedress I'm only 32! Mind you, if it is early menopause, yay for no more periods, not like I need them as I don't want offspring.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 19:42:45	Am I going through "the change" really early or something!? Hot flush, then freezing still continuing, don't like it much.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 17:34:21	Worst sleep. Constantly woke up sweating or freezing. I think today could be a long old day.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 07:38:05	@bdogrunner my writing style and how I explain things in a way she feels she's down the pub with me. Remind me I still have a skill to offer
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 07:37:21	@bdogrunner Becuase a lot of mine are on FB I don't think I could find them again. I also have an old friend who is very complimentary about
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 07:32:22	@bdogrunner I've had a couple of similar comments, one in particular from a young girl on FB. Made me beam that my blog could possibly help.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:37:58	@rabbitsoup_zola @BipolarBlogger @bdogrunner See food diet here. I was never skinny but I'd like my ass to be a bit smaller again please.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:36:19	@rabbitsoup_zola @bdogrunner @BipolarBlogger I like those! Order them when I get a Japanese.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:34:47	I just realised I spend most of my weekends feeling bitter about all the fun everyone else is having. *Pouty lip
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:28:29	@FingerLicknGod @rabbitsoup_zola @BipolarBlogger Mirtazapine started the fat layering, Q took it to the next level. Fun.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:26:20	@rabbitsoup_zola @BipolarBlogger @FingerLicknGod I've never been on anything else effective so I'd likely barrel in. I tolerate fast though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:23:55	@rabbitsoup_zola @BipolarBlogger @FingerLicknGod I'm sure my psych mentioned 1200mg or did I imagine that?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:23:13	@BipolarBlogger @BPDFFS Mmm, cheese. I live near a cheese and booze shop. One of my favourite places!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:16:32	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola @FingerLicknGod It's like the meds only really kick in once I'm asleep. My body chemistry is a mystery.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:16:07	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola @FingerLicknGod Oh I do the drunken stumble to the bathroom at night. Always made it back out though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:04:19	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola it once was. I really hate how hard it is to sleep these days.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:04:01	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola Take mine at 7.30pm and still wide awake. Also taken 3.74 zopiclone and some wine. Sleep is not the friend
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:02:31	@rabbitsoup_zola Apparently it's the minimum therapeutic as a stabiliser.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:01:45	@rabbitsoup_zola ml? Clearly I mean mg!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:01:11	@rabbitsoup_zola Just 300ml. I have lots of way to go as my body tolerates it on the mood stabilising front.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 06:00:31	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm on XL as well. I really liked how sleepy it made me but all that's worn off and sleep continues to be a medicated bitch
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 05:57:50	@rabbitsoup_zola Does yours still knock you out? So bummed mine stopped doing that after a couple of weeks. Damn tolerances.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 05:54:40	Telling Dave the cat "You're not the boss!". He might be the boss. I'm certainly not.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 05:44:41	If only I could just switch off the abuse related dreams, that would be good. They turned up suddenly without invitation, they can leave now
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 05:43:48	You know, thinking about last night's dream and others, I'm really sick of my subconscious futilely screaming at my mum. Does no good.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 04:58:18	I have bought one persons Christmas present! So not into it this year, although excited for my vintage secret Santa! Christmas still sucks.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 04:11:50	I don't care what the haters say, Judy is a legend, what a great attitude she has #stri ctly
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 04:07:05	@rabbitsoup_zola @BipolarBlogger I know that one, lost a bit of my naturally much smaller waist but I love a corset.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 04:05:49	@rabbitsoup_zola It's my core skincare, turned loads of others onto it too!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 04:04:17	@rabbitsoup_zola @BipolarBlogger I'm all about shapewear. I'm bigger but the sleek silhouette shapewear gives is flattering for anyone.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 04:02:29	@rabbitsoup_zola If you love jasmine you will adore this range as much as I do. http:// uk.lizearle.com/bath-and-body- tiare-and-jasmine?menu-bath-and-body-promo3 …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 03:56:20	@rabbitsoup_zola I washed my hair in shampoo and conditioner I don't especially like but it smells of jasmine which I really love!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 01:03:15	@BipolarBlogger @DramaLlama85 For me it was rockabilly nights and weekenders, always something going on to get dressed up for.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 01:01:50	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger I'd love a chance to dress up properly, used to do it quite a lot, not much call when a recluse!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 01:00:00	Must be some sort of party happening in the restaurant downstairs, it's like I have music on up here! Too loud!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 00:33:34	@Solutionprovida @shinybluedress @IWTT_Ringo @rights_victims @SouthmeadProj Good idea, poss wouldn't have helped me, I "had no issues".
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 00:27:13	@shinybluedress @IWTT_Ringo @rights_victims @SouthmeadProj wait for CBT (not suitable for me).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 00:26:59	@shinybluedress @IWTT_Ringo @rights_victims @SouthmeadProj I assume so, waiting lists are pretty large all round. Thinks it's 3-6 months
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 00:25:46	@shinybluedress @rights_victims @SouthmeadProj a year into a 2.5 year ish wait to be seen!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 00:25:27	@shinybluedress @rights_victims @SouthmeadProj It's actually a year of psychodynamic but my needs complex, unlikely to be enough. I am also
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 00:21:20	@shinybluedress @rights_victims @SouthmeadProj To add insult, NHS therapy I eventually get will be time limited.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-16 00:15:45	@shinybluedress @rights_victims I've been signposted to subsidised but it's still too expensive.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 21:54:14	@rabbitsoup_zola I often have random celebrities pop up, no idea what that's about but I think they take the edge off!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 21:39:33	@rabbitsoup_zola I was angry shouting at my mum in my dreams last night, trying to get her to believe me. Stanley Tucci was there too :/

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 20:47:30	@NicsVoice @BipolarBlogger The thing I also love about old fashioned cans is they double up as winter ear warmers :D
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 20:42:29	@BipolarBlogger @NicsVoice I got some super pretty headphones as earbuds just fall out my tiny ears. LOVE blocking out the world!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 20:25:11	@rabbitsoup_zola Good point, thanks for the heads up. Will be strict with the timer!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 19:29:58	Booked two exhibitions for next week at the V&A. Uni interview prep is coming along nicely! Maybe I can do this better than I thought. Go me
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 19:18:38	I am far too excited about my lamp. Wanted one for YEARS. Hope my expectations aren't too high. Come at me 10'000 lux!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 18:49:47	SAD lamp ordered, I feel better just knowing it's on its way now! VAT free and not hideously expensive too, morning win.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 18:44:26	@Smitchalot A pro MUA will tell you it generally looks terrrible in real life where you can't control the lighting. Also drag queens do it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 18:43:31	@Smitchalot It's mostly a fad, it's a technique developed for professional settings (print and film), in real life it's a bit alarming!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 05:58:45	@alicemeat @Ladybird_Donna Food is my alcohol. I don't know how to control that either, not like I can stop eating! Alcohol is fun too.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 05:55:59	Emotions make me want to eat until I feel sick. Resisting the urge to cook the entire contents of my kitchen right now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 05:30:09	Who knew Children in Need would be triggering. So many potential points of intervention in my childhood missed by so many adults around me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 05:11:08	@MumMental It's such an empty, hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach. I hate it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 05:10:27	I don't have weeks like anyone else either but it's felt more keenly at the weekend, outside looking in to a life I might have had.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 05:09:29	I do okay being alone most of the time but sometimes I get a rush of feeling inadequate because I don't have weekends like everyone else.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 05:08:35	Feeling lonely today. The world goes on around me and I rarely get to take part, even when I try. Takes me back to my lonely teens.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 04:57:38	@Ladybird_Donna You and me both. 2013 and 2014 were rough.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 04:38:31	Reading cooking tweets reminds me just how long it is since I properly cooked. Used to be one of my favourite things.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-15 04:31:09	But of w crappy bed hangover day. Saved it a bit by doing my nails - first time in ages. pic.twitter.com/QDJfRfIAIn
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 21:12:08	No really, where has all of this tired come from? Can barely keep my eyes open.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 20:00:27	My word I'm tired today. Who nicked all my spoons!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 07:04:42	Why am I awake? The zopiclone weaning was going so well. I blame winter.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 05:45:54	@rabbitsoup_zola Good boss. Hopefully I can get one in December, maybe not the super flash ones but one sufficient. Must read up.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 05:42:16	@rabbitsoup_zola Yep, I'd forgotten too. Here's to long periods of relative stability!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 05:41:44	@rabbitsoup_zola as bad as it has been in the past, I just get knackered by mid afternoon. Improvement really!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 05:41:09	@rabbitsoup_zola It was unexpected, forgot about winter, haha. I don't have a lamp, so expensive but I'll get one at some point. It's not
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 05:38:03	@rabbitsoup_zola Amazing! I was for a while before SAD started wiggling in a few days ago. It's a lovely feeling though isn't it?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 05:31:41	@Ladybird_Donna @DramaLlama85 we regress back. I definitely feel that way. If depression hits I feel the pain of the past is my present.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 05:31:01	@Ladybird_Donna @DramaLlama85 periods in our lives. If we feel vulnerable in any way I think there is an automatic mental association
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 05:30:35	@Ladybird_Donna @DramaLlama85 When I first admitted I was very ill, the abuse was all consuming, I think it's to be expected at certain
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-14 00:41:29	Anyone had any success with SAD lamps? They're a big investment, don't want to buy one if it's not going to help these daily winter crashes.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 23:58:47	Oh I see. This is the time of day during winter when my brain decides it would like to shut down and hibernate immediately. Urgh. So tired.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 23:37:39	Now excuse me while I lose 3 years to Etsy......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 23:37:19	Just signed up for a vintage secret Santa, great idea! I don't get many gifts let alone vintage ones so very excited about it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 18:45:42	Right, coffee, I need coffee.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 18:27:57	So I guess I'm best getting up and getting out first thing if I want to be productive. Repeat prescription request dropped into the GP, done
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 06:08:33	Stocking up the freezer has alerted my med enabled appetite to ALL OF THE FOOD. I just want to eat and eat and eat. Then eat some more.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 03:47:03	Got up to do the litter trays and put rubbish out. Then also vacuumed. Very pleased with myself!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 03:05:17	@Ladybird_Donna Wonderful! Here, have a cuppa as reward.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 02:59:22	@rabbitsoup_zola How about a cuddle instead? We all feel sorry for ourselves at times, often with good reason!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 02:57:33	Could someone be a love and run the vacuum round? Ta.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 02:49:32	And now I've tweeted too much about a very silly thing. I'll shut up now..............
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 02:48:58	I like surprises though and winning a competition would be as big a surprise as my mother admitting she's wrong.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 02:47:51	That last tweet isn't intended as woe is me though, after 3 or so years with no family I'm used to sparse Christmas' and birthdays!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 02:46:57	Been entering so many competitions this week. Think I'm trying to pretend that if I win it'll be like getting a gift, given I don't get many
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 02:41:16	@inmywindow Maybe not completely waterproof but Clarks brogues are a winter staple for me. Used to work retail too so definitely comfy!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 02:40:07	I definitely think the Hello Kitty head cat bed (yes really) is the best thing I bought this year. Makes me grin every time I look at it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 02:01:04	So, who do I have to bribe around here to get a lovely visit from @thetwofairies ? Lovely acts of kindness!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 01:24:15	Child having an epic meltdown outside. This is one of the many reasons I don't have children.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 01:21:30	@DramaLlama85 Assertive/asshole, usually the latter at 6am. The girls however are not as insistent, they're lovely ladies.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 01:19:24	@DramaLlama85 Cats aren't always all they've cracked up to be!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 01:19:14	@DramaLlama85 One of them, Dave the cat, ensures I at least get up to feed them. Insistently. Several times a day. By stomping on my head.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 01:15:25	@DramaLlama85 This is also me right now. And I have a dishwasher so little excuse. *crawls back into bed with cats*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-13 01:09:43	@DramaLlama85 Tweet it all out if it helps, your Twitter your choice xx
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 23:14:20	The magnetism of my bed is increasing daily. Sod off SAD, I can do without you thanks very much!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 20:54:20	I inexplicably bought tinned creamed rice. Blast from the childhood. Expect to find me eating straight from the tin later this evening......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 19:09:53	@DramaLlama85 I mostly only buy vintage or good reproduction so Etsy is my high street. Totally addicted.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 19:05:00	@DramaLlama85 I do this with Etsy. All of the things.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 18:49:54	Getting the freezer component of your online shop just right, it all fits! #triumphant
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 18:07:14	Ooooh, 99 followers, will I ever tip over to a round number? Iremember getting stuck at this number on my other account for ages.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 03:35:13	@rabbitsoup_zola @DramaLlama85 @star_curl @bdogrunner Badly, by all accounts.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 03:33:57	@rabbitsoup_zola @DramaLlama85 @star_curl @bdogrunner This is reminding me I must go get mine threaded now I've found the best threader ever
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 03:30:55	@rabbitsoup_zola @DramaLlama85 @star_curl @bdogrunner Although new trend for "airbrushed" brows is bloody weird.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 03:30:16	@rabbitsoup_zola @DramaLlama85 @star_curl @bdogrunner I personally hadn't discovered tweezers back then, wild and free caterpillars!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 03:28:26	@rabbitsoup_zola @DramaLlama85 @star_curl @bdogrunner Do we mean not plucking them to nothing? YES! I'm a vintage gal so all about brows!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 03:16:01	@rabbitsoup_zola <3
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-12 03:04:02	Housework is running away with me again. So frustrating that I can't just keep on top of it. #spoonie
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-11 23:31:51	Got my diagnosis in black and white today following my last appointment with consultant psychiatrist. Kind of weird reading it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-11 19:51:27	managing to always go back to sleep. I think it's my body relearning how to keep itself asleep so will persevere as long as I feel okay.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-11 19:50:30	So I'm trying to wean myself down to the lower dose of zopiclone so I still have somewhere to go with it when bad. I'm waking a lot but...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-11 02:19:28	Evening Twitter! I have mostly been sewing today, vintage pattern and vintage fabric. Take that SAD! Not finished yet so not showing you!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-10 20:58:01	Doing some sewing today and thoroughly enjoying it! Just done a toile of the bodice and it's perfect, yay for being vintage pattern shaped.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-10 00:49:15	So that answers my curiosity as to whether I am able to keep myself asleep yet!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-10 00:48:44	Well, my experiment last night was a total disaster. Used Phenergan instead of zopiclone as my sleep aid. No dice, woke constantly, awful.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 06:53:08	Re: last RT. If they do a Scottish enquiry I am all over that shizzle. GIVE ME A VOICE!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 06:51:33	Trying to reduce my reliance on zopiclone so tonight I'm trying Phenergan again. It's going well #notreally #stillawake
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 05:59:44	Upstairs washing machine mustn't be levelled properly because I can hear and feel it in my flat. Rattles the sofa!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 05:28:55	@Lala_Brownie Och, it is what it is, roll on January! Likewise to you x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 04:43:10	If only life fixes were as easy as @thetwofairies make it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 04:35:44	@Lala_Brownie I spend it alone and without any gifts really. The pressure for it to be the opposite sucks the life from me for two months.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 04:32:52	@ClaraUnravelled Whoever rented it last didn't rewind it, so annoying!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 04:19:29	The whole "perfect Christmas" premise being shoved down my throat all day is already cheesing me off. Just fuck off. Yes, I swore.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 04:03:03	This Betty, former feral, teeny, gorgeous and a sweetheart. She jumped onto the arm of the sofa for fusses tonight. pic.twitter.com/SW1GjqOuMg
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 03:09:43	@BipolarBlogger I cannot wait to know if it's a hit or miss. At least there's the cognac whatever!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 02:32:25	When you move to the other end of the sofa in winter and have to warm it up! Got that happening right now.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-09 01:26:33	@BipolarBlogger As you do.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 23:11:03	@ms_molly_vog Go to a Scottish chip shop, they batter literally everything, including pizza.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 22:45:03	Oh Judy Garland, what a talent you were.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 22:18:03	Obviously I meant BBC2 was making me happy. Ahem. And now Easter Parade. Well done Saturday.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 21:11:44	ITV1 is making me so happy right now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 18:53:37	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola I go round with the biggest grin on my face. I've always been quite adventurous though, was a gymnast.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 18:52:12	It helps, when grilling mushrooms and tomatoes, if you actually have the oven set to grill not bake...........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 18:47:28	@rabbitsoup_zola @BipolarBlogger Just me on the scary rides then? Story of my life!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 18:40:25	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola I love actual roller coasters, menatl ones, not so much.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 18:38:33	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola I hope it's just levelling out and isn't on the plummet :( I'm just getting sorted after some late nights.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 18:34:41	@rabbitsoup_zola Do it! (I bought a tabletop dishwasher as washing up is now a thing I can't do, best investment ever).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 18:33:55	Now could someone bring me a cinnamon latte and almond croissant and fill me in on Twitter doings? Didn't really check in yesterday!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 18:32:55	I have also been to the sorting office already and picked up my totally amazing vintage ballet novelty print fabric. So productive already.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 18:32:03	Dave cat can be the best snuggler when he's not being an asshole. He's a substantial cat so you get a really good cuddle.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-08 18:30:53	Morning! Had a lovely sleep, boy cat snuggled on my pillow, reassuringly purring if I stirred. He did also wake me up but I'll forgive him!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-07 23:49:28	Reply within hours of application processed by UCAS, invitation to interview. Which requires actual preparation, dammit!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 21:36:53	Feeling all smug, did vacuuming, put laundry away, another load in and yummy lunch cooking away. AND I'm out of bed. But it's cold. Brr.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 20:13:15	Right, I cannot spend another day in bed, no matter how tired. Laundry to be folded, floors to vacuum, wash to put on. Let's do this!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 18:03:27	What a glorious morning. I don't feel so glorious after 6.30am hairball incident but the sun is taking the edge off!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 05:30:06	@Harryshelper @bdogrunner Just sent PIP form back, still a year to run on current award, not expecting to hear any time soon!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 05:29:35	@Harryshelper @bdogrunner I told them my last assessment/process made me suicidal (true), we'll see what they do with that.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 05:26:41	@Harryshelper @bdogrunner I'm all mental illness, you can't "see" any of the effects of my condition unless you know me well. Nightmare.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 05:24:09	@Harryshelper @bdogrunner the legwork. Much better prepared this time!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 05:23:49	@Harryshelper @bdogrunner I happened to get an additional letter from GP for my MR, was so green to the process didn't know I had to do all
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 05:18:37	@Harryshelper @bdogrunner This is PIP, ESA only just got support group no assessment, no idea when they'll reassess as award period ending.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 05:05:11	@Harryshelper @bdogrunner so here we go again! But at least I have a more severe diagnosis and lots of reports this time to back me up.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 05:04:41	@Harryshelper @bdogrunner My assessment was ok, report a total nonsense. Went for MR and was successful. Just had my renewal through....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 04:46:31	@bdogrunner @Harryshelper This. Physio who assessed me said I was well dressed and presented. I only own fucking vintage!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 03:39:01	@inmywindow @BipolarBlogger I don't even recognise the person who used to do their own bread, cakes, all meals from scratch, any more!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 03:38:32	@inmywindow @BipolarBlogger Have you cracked the overcooking it to sludge issue? I'm all about Waitrose ready meals, 5 minutes, ping!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 01:44:13	@BipolarBlogger Uh, if you run out of things to do my place could really do with a vacuum and three days ago laundry folding..........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 01:19:05	Now I once again commence "Inbox watch". Similar to watched pots and boiling kettles.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 00:41:17	@alicemeat I'm hoping it's great!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 00:40:02	@inmywindow Mizz! Teenage flashback!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 00:38:15	But also amazed that I can actually think of a future, 6 months ago there was no way I would have considered going back. Well done doctors!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-06 00:37:18	Well, I did it, sent off my UCAS to reapply to former uni. Terrified and excited and terrified and scared of failing again and terrified!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-05 23:09:08	@rabbitsoup_zola I quite enjoyed last year. Loads of yummy food, crap TV and others on Twitter in the same boat!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-05 20:15:05	@rabbitsoup_zola Indeed. Sarah Millican (comedian) does a Twitter hashtag #joinin every year, I took part last year and it was pretty fun.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-05 20:14:09	@rabbitsoup_zola Probably down to my weird body chemistry that it doesn't knock me out!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-05 20:13:48	@rabbitsoup_zola My pdoc was very good and told me I could have a drink as long as I went carefully at first. Doesn't interact with my meds.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-05 20:10:29	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm over here with my one present from my best friend and a bath full of wine.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-05 20:10:02	@rabbitsoup_zola It's more the run up and after that's a bitch, seeing everyone else super excited about gifts and family time.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-05 20:09:31	@rabbitsoup_zola Most probably. I've done a few so sort of getting used to it. The day itself is actually fine after a little self pity cry!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-05 20:04:24	If I go to the supermarket I'm going to be bombarded with Christmas "cheer" aren't I?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-05 05:35:21	Found it! Stand down!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-05 05:34:13	The @ucas_online is so user unfriendly, I just want to log back in, going round in sodding circles of "how to" guides. LET ME LOG IN!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-04 01:28:47	@ClaraUnravelled I also entertain myself when I sometimes need to pee in the middle of the night and I fall about like I'm drunk!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-04 01:28:15	@ClaraUnravelled It's all I'm on other than Zopiclone for sleep. I don't know how it interacts with Lamotrigine but it's been fine for me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-04 01:09:01	@ClaraUnravelled function at all the following day but as I said, the positives outweigh the negatives for me, it has stabilised me nicely.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-04 01:08:08	@ClaraUnravelled By all accounts, from and others, it's mostly the sedation that's an issue. I need to sleep a lot (10 hours a night) to
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-04 00:52:05	@ClaraUnravelled @DramaLlama85 Yup, on XL, has saved me.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 20:19:16	Woke up feeling pretty rested and perky. A few hours later and I'm knackered again. Screw you medication!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 06:25:20	Oreo ice cream sandwich is calling my name even though I should be sleeping imminently..........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 05:33:34	And now that I have committed that to the internet it won't go like that at all will it? Shitballs. Oh well, wait and see!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 05:33:03	scare me as much because I got through the last one, all on my own and I didn't crash out the other side, just a few days of a mixed episode
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 05:32:27	If it happens it happens, if it doesn't then even better (although it might butt kick me to write my personal statement). But it doesn't
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 05:31:44	Do you know, I think there's a possibility I'm teetering on the edge of a hypo. Unlike last time though, it doesn't scare me nearly as much.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 05:25:02	Bit deep for a Sunday night innit!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 05:24:49	Actually, on that point. Who indeed am I? Is this medicated me really me? Or is the depressed me the real me? Will I ever know?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 05:24:11	It's a miracle, night time med and cat feeding schedule done right on time. Never happens. Who am I!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 03:17:39	@Ladybird_Donna response would be very polite!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 03:17:27	@Ladybird_Donna Or do those deep in crisis really need to be told the flaming obvious? If I was told to have a cup of tea I don't think my
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 03:16:36	@Ladybird_Donna person. Surely you phone crisis when trying to distract yourself isn't working? Natural reaction of humans to is it not?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 03:15:51	@Ladybird_Donna As someone who has as yet not needed crisis care, I don't see how it is ever a helpful response to an otherwise intelligent
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 02:38:05	How do people live without pets? Seriously, the quiet comfort of my cats gets me through most days, always a purr to end the day #catlady
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 01:17:16	@alicemeat Use them as long as you need, some of us are meant to be a voice for the voiceless. It helps us all feel less alone.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 01:10:27	@alicemeat Thank you. It just strikes me sometimes and writing is the one thing I still have!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 01:01:19	Changed bedding, today's victory. Have immediately gone to bed to savour the yummy cleanness.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 00:14:57	Leaving only the broken promises of what might have been. I'm trying to write a happy ending but it's not an easy thing to achieve.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 00:14:02	How this often times brilliant, bright, talented child was let down by everyone who was supposed to protect and nurture her.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-03 00:12:51	Sometimes, I have a moment where I feel deeply sad for the neglected, physical, psychological and sexual abuse the child me suffered.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 23:33:53	Sometimes trolling stupid trolls is FUN!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 19:58:55	So sad today. My cat nephew Dexter passed to the bridge this week, hit by a car. He was a lovely boy and I hurt for my friends who lost him.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 06:42:07	Wait. What? Phantom? Why do I watch this nonsense!? #xfactor
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 06:33:04	If nothing else, I need the energy to change my bedding before it turns into a science experiment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 06:32:23	Here's hoping for an uninterrupted by random 4.30am doorbell ringing night's sleep. I really want to feel more awake tomorrow!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 06:23:18	They've got their money's worth out of that prop cauldron on #xfactor tonight.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 05:36:07	@rabbitsoup_zola Nothing is the answer to all and any questions.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 05:35:54	@rabbitsoup_zola The day itself the easiest bit, it's the run up and aftermath that's hardest I think. "What you doing?" "What did you get?"
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 05:23:30	Used to love Christmas, now it's just a couple of months of awkward questions, super fun times.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 05:22:41	1st November, hello to all of the Christmas adverts. Great fun seeing happy families when you'll be spending it alone. Urgh.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 05:08:21	Holding hands with Dave the cat. pic.twitter.com/v5VmG1sRaq
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 04:57:13	I love how my cats love hanging out with me. Nearly always all in the same room, yes, even when I pee! #crazycatlady
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 04:41:00	@ExposingBF @MrsVB As an abuse survivor, white, British, excuse my language, but Britain First can go fuck themselves.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 03:33:12	I have to concede, the med reminder app is working out pretty well. Being much more consistent this week #routine
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 03:26:37	Judy Murray looks incredible! #strictly
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 03:06:58	@BipolarBlogger Controversial!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-02 02:41:45	LOVE Strictly on Halloween week, the costume team are amazing but it's this week they pull out all the stops, makes me excited for uni!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 20:35:40	Living with three cats means it looks like I never vacuum. Chilli in particular seems to shed her entire coat onto the lounge rug every day.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 19:40:45	@inmywindow @drinksinthedark Lovely to see you doing better! You'll get there L, you will xx
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 19:37:33	Just had a piece of delicious cake with my coffee for a second breakfast. Not even sorry.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 18:12:36	Whoever it was, you're an inconsiderate knob because I know it wasn't anyone I know. No chance of me going to main door to answer it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 18:11:39	So unexpectedly having my doorbell rung at 4.30am until I unplugged the receiver now means I am exhausted. Just can't get going.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 06:04:14	@alicemeat Touch of the Anne Hathaway about you!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 05:54:26	so very lucky in many ways. And long may it continue, we did, after all, acknowledge relapse likely at some point.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 05:53:37	being completely inclusive during the whole process. It could have been much much worse and I could still be in a dreadful place now. I am..
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 05:52:45	down to pdoc recognising more was going on than depression and quickly getting me a diagnosis and on meds that worked for me, whilst....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 05:52:07	moving to my current GP. She started the proper ball rolling and aside from ridiculous waiting times, everyone has been top notch. Right...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 05:51:21	When I see the experiences others have at the hands of those supposed to help I feel incredibly lucky with how I've been dealt with since...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 05:50:32	I was impressed though that he actually took time to read all my notes before calling me in, I didn't have to correct anything really.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 05:50:00	I did have a "no shit Sherlock" moment with the (very nice) pdoc today when he said I'd probably gone undiagnosed for years #bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 05:47:49	@Ladybird_Donna I felt overwhelming relief for the most part. No more secrets, whether you believe me or not. I finally vocalised my truth.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 05:36:28	It's quite hard seeing so many struggling at the moment. Almost guilty for being stable myself. You're all amazing to me to keep going.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 04:53:55	Yearly booze stock up done. I expect it will run out quicker next year, given I wasn't allowed to drink for half of this year.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 04:23:45	Dave cat is unimpressed with my shaking the food dish and pointing out there is still food there. He'd like me to give him supper early.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 03:50:01	@SteveReedMP It's an absolute eyesore and can't be good for business for the restaurant next to it (not their rubbish).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 03:49:14	@SteveReedMP Who can I contact about the nearly always missed bin collection resulting in a mini landfill appearing on the street every week
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 01:38:24	the cyclical nature of my life to this point. I'm "well-er" (his word) but have what are now partly habitual approaches to just turning up.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 01:37:07	He was also impressed with my approach and philosophical view of my situation. He also thinks uni could be great and a chance to break.....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 01:35:44	Which is kind of weird. I'm happy not to have to go to the pdoc every month but it did sort of anchor me a bit. So we'll see how that goes.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 01:34:43	Other good news, maybe. I no longer need regular appointments and am allowed to run free and do what I want with life.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 01:34:06	Good news proper. Pdoc is completely supportive of benefits applications and will send me all clinical correspondence thus far.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 01:33:16	Erm, good or bad news depending on your view. If I want kids, these are the meds to do it on. I don't want sprogs but, ah yay?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-11-01 01:32:32	Bad news of today (which wasn't really news), meds for life. Yay me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-31 22:48:43	New pdoc very lovely. Essentially discharged as I am doing so well. Just to get in touch as and when I or friends think I need to.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-31 04:42:08	pretended there wasn't a thing wrong with me and therefore had no need to see any doctors regularly. Oh how fast times change.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-31 04:41:29	Promising myself something tasty from M&S as reward for going to my new pdoc appointment tomorrow. I long for the simple days when I...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-31 02:27:05	Tomorrow, first appointment with new pdoc, dreading it. I don't think there's anything to dread but I am anyway, want my old pdoc back!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-31 02:26:25	Trying to have a very chill day. Went out locally with a friend last night, not terribly late but it's left me wiped today.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-29 02:04:16	I don't always keep the worktops as clean as I should but I always have clean plates and cutlery so can have a ready meal.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-29 02:03:32	Tabletop dishwasher is by far the best #selfcare item I have bought since becoming very ill. Keeping kitchen clean massive issue before.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-28 22:43:23	Helps if I include the picture. Look Twitter, I've done some sewing with this mad vintage fabric. Cats! pic.twitter.com/xed4f6C5uy

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-28 01:27:51	I still have 12 months to go on my #PIP award, got the reassessment form today. Well done DWP, doing well cutting claim waiting times there.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 22:51:38	I am chief procrastinator. Opened Word to write my personal statement. Decided I would sew for the first time in months instead!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 19:59:26	@inmywindow That is a handful! Lots of loving self care for you needed at the moment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 19:29:44	Excuse the swearing but I fucking hate the Daily Mail. I rarely use the word hate but I do, I hate them. Shysters.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 19:15:59	@DramaLlama85 assumption that because she's one dimensional, it's insulting to everyone, not just women. We are more than our careers.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 19:14:47	@DramaLlama85 It's this sort of nonsense that makes feminism look bad. She makes money from make-up, her choice! They're making an

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 19:07:30	This week's goal is to pull finger and write my personal statement. I'm serious this time. Look, I'm opening Word!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 06:32:50	@Sectioned_ You've reminded me I want to check it's all sorted. Called a few months ago. Yay! Another phone call! *sarcasm
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 06:26:58	@Sectioned_ I had to call, SSE/M&S don't have an online system. They should all be online, took me ages to work up to calling them!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 06:08:32	Twitter has been rather lovely today, well done you warm welcoming little lot. To those struggling, squishy hugs from me and the cats.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 06:06:21	Must move to bedroom from sofa imminently. Before I'm too med drunk and inevitably throw my laptop at a wall trying to walk straight.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 06:03:53	@IamscaredInfo Lots and lots of good luck! So much admiration for you going back!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 05:54:36	@alicemeat Clothes are what started me off, now I'm all in for everything!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 04:59:35	@alicemeat Yes it is!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 04:59:21	@alicemeat I spend too much money but I figure they'll at least hold value, especially my clothing!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 04:50:51	@alicemeat Thank you, that's all I ever wanted to achieve, one person feeling solidarity.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 04:41:21	@alicemeat The kitty cats? I have a few vintage cats, a new favourite arrived last week. And thank you!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 04:35:27	@drinksinthedark Vent away, I don't give a shit, I do it too! NEVER apologise for being honest.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 04:30:36	@alicemeat @DramaLlama85 @zzzedkat Ooh a pool, yes! Can I also have an epic sewing room? I won't make anything but sitting in it will do.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-27 03:45:05	Offering hypnotherapy to someone who possibly has depression but you've never met? Irresponsibly touting for business. Go away.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 21:08:18	@IamscaredInfo Make sure to get lots of rest for the first few weeks, try not to make many plans, time to be very selfish!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 19:59:49	I did though, have to mop myself into my bedroom, so have to wait for floors to dry before I get my reward coffee and Soreen.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 19:59:12	I mopped! Me, mopping! Amazing! It was so long since I last mustered the energy the bucket was dusty! I also vacuumed of course. Proud.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 07:08:00	@rabbitsoup_zola @Ladybird_Donna 300mg See pdoc Friday so things may change to try and help more with sleeping, don't know.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 07:06:58	@Ladybird_Donna @rabbitsoup_zola the quality of sleep I get more than anything else.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 07:06:44	@Ladybird_Donna @rabbitsoup_zola On reflection, I eat quite early so probably do have a gap most of the time. Med hangover depends on
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 07:01:21	@Ladybird_Donna @rabbitsoup_zola I don't notice a difference but perhaps that's more to do with my tolerance now and my worsened sleeping.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 06:57:19	@rabbitsoup_zola Oh look at that, right on my prescription box. Oops.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 06:55:39	@rabbitsoup_zola Totally didn't know it was supposed to be on an empty stomach, so I'll guess not essential.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 06:35:51	feeling needier herself? It's freaking me out a bit in case I'm heading for some sort of episode. Wait and see is all there is to do.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 06:35:07	Chilli, super intuitive cat, has been sleeping much closer to me the last few days. Usually means I'm poorly but feel ok. Maybe she's just
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 04:10:36	@BipolarBlogger "This too shall pass" Really? They've found a cure for bipolar? Fuck off, more patronising guff.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 03:37:16	Going to grossly overfeed the cats at supper in the vain hope of not being woken too early. My boy is an asshole though so probably doomed.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 00:27:32	I haven't been out today but hasn't the weather been glorious in old London town? Sometimes autumn is okay.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-26 00:11:34	I have had to download and use a med reminder app. Doing better makes me forgetful. Best friend thinks it's genius, haha!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 23:44:23	@jmcefalas @BipolarBlogger I generally get nothing but support and love now. Bar the odd blog troll of course!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 23:43:36	@jmcefalas @BipolarBlogger Don't worry, I do. This all happened a year ago when I first got very ill. These sorts weed themselves out.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 23:42:01	@inmywindow @BipolarBlogger I don't think I will ever set foot in a Westfield again so well done you!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 23:39:12	@jmcefalas @BipolarBlogger I was no longer worthy of her sympathy/empathy when I didn't go back to work quickly enough.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 23:38:01	@jmcefalas @BipolarBlogger Nope, she's on meds. Blocked me on Facebook when I didn't get well in a couple of weeks.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 23:37:17	@BipolarBlogger I also hate the "I'm the mental/crazy friend" with a comic picture. I appreciate they're not meant to harm but urgh.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 23:29:32	@BipolarBlogger ANY of those "positive thinking" memes on Facebook. Shove your suck it up and think your way out posts, they're shaming.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 23:24:56	@BipolarBlogger "Have you tried XYZ drug? You need to ask for it next time, it worked for me"
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 23:23:58	@BipolarBlogger "I have depression too but you just have to get on with it because we all have to work"
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 23:20:18	Full on roast dinner tonight, with red wine and trashy TV. Deserved after a week of really pushing myself.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 06:28:19	Old lady hip still kills. I can take the wrinkles of ageing but my body falling apart is the real bitch.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 05:49:47	Must try to push for a change/additional help with sleeping as it's not really as effective as it was. Otherwise I hope it's a good appt.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 05:48:53	Shit! Just realised it's a week today I see new psychiatrist. 3 months since I saw my last. Urgh. A week of anxiety it is then!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 05:39:52	@ms_molly_vog @MarkOneinFour Our early morning edition: Is my cat trying to kill me by smothering me with my own pillow at 6am?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 03:15:54	How are we feeling about Patrick and his moustache? #sewingbee
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 03:14:02	I watch #sewingbee and get all inspired and tell myself tomorrow is the day I get my sew on. Yeah right.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 03:10:01	Argh, he's pinning the wrong way! Plus, overlockers are terrifying to the uninitiated, at least they're domestic ones #sewingbee
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 03:07:20	Anyone who has bought a t-shirt from Primark knows they're not easy to make, wonky seams everywhere #sewingbee
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 01:03:51	Forgive my ignorance but if the EU do this every year and we know how we stand within the EU, how can that bill be a surprise!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 00:19:19	I am so tired but otherwise doing quite well. Relatively speaking. Managed a bit of a walk and wander today, some conversations *proud face*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 00:16:58	@inmywindow @DramaLlama85 Took 9 months and I went to hell and back but I'm glad I fought for it, it has really helped.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-25 00:16:24	@inmywindow @DramaLlama85 I was turned down after assessment by physio. Mandatory reconsidered and was awarded standard care.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-24 05:21:47	Google: removing the dilemma of disclosure.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-24 05:21:15	So earlier this week I was chatted up. Need to casually bump into him again to see if he Googled me and is now running the other way!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-23 05:12:19	Okay, can I trade in my right hip now? Serious case of the old lady today and I am not impressed, so painful!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-23 02:22:12	I'm enjoying Alex's faces as three men waffle on about tools, Snap-on and engines #theoneshow
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-23 02:13:03	@shinybluedress Thank you, always lovely to have support.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-23 01:37:09	@Sectioned_ *Cats. I have three.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-23 01:33:14	@Sectioned_ I cannot move without my cat. It's not always easy finding places but they're my emotional crutch.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-23 01:32:28	Spend on private ambulances through the roof. Another well done to the coalition, ahem.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-23 00:47:52	Oh Russia.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-22 23:42:24	Can I go to bed yet? Horrible sleep last night and I'm feeling it now. Need a good sleep tonight.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-22 23:29:43	@greenknight100 @rights_victims Well that makes me feel validated as a West Lothian survivor. #notreally
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-22 23:13:34	I'm having such a vanity day. Today was getting my eyebrows threaded, at last finding someone who does them just how I want them, hallelujah
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-22 23:04:53	Sent a friends little girl a ballet book and some Hello Kitty stickers, they made me a thank you video and it's the cutest thing ever!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-22 22:03:08	I was described as a cross between Jessica Rabbit and Marilyn Monroe today. I suppose I'll take that!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-22 18:51:24	@rabbitsoup_zola @bdogrunner @BipolarBlogger She does vintage and modern cuts and styling, based in Hula Nails, gorgeous place!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-22 18:51:01	@rabbitsoup_zola @bdogrunner @BipolarBlogger I have a friend, well two but one isn't in London. Cut around the £60 mark, called Lucie Luella
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-22 00:39:58	Am I over thinking it? He may not even ask and this becomes totally pointless but I just don't know how to approach it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-22 00:39:03	Anyone with a long term mental illness do the dating thing? I may be asked on a date but not sure if I should, what level of disclosure etc?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 22:35:03	@rabbitsoup_zola I think the shoes are magic. Wore them for a brief outing today and got chatted up!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 21:31:45	I just got proper chatted up which doesn't happen all that often without an air of the sleaze about it, was quite nice actually!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 18:03:05	Dave the cat is thoroughly enjoying watching all the autumn leaves swirl around outside the flat window.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 17:59:55	It's a wee bit windy today! #obvioustweet
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 04:23:12	@rabbitsoup_zola @LokisFool I am Queen of the enablers. And also super stylish clearly. Ahem.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 04:14:10	@rabbitsoup_zola My friend will laugh, I'm such a good enabler I sell shoes to strangers on Twitter :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 04:13:15	@rabbitsoup_zola YAY! I mostly wear vintage so they're a perfect winter staple for me and my pencil skirts.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 04:12:09	@rabbitsoup_zola As far as a pair of heels can be comfy. They have that lovely Hush Puppies cushioning.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 04:11:27	@rabbitsoup_zola I can show them off!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 04:11:19	@rabbitsoup_zola Yeah, not cheap. I added and removed them from my basket several times then just thought fuck it. Might make me go out so
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 04:04:57	@rabbitsoup_zola Very. They also went out of stock for a couple of weeks. Popular shoesies!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:56:19	@rabbitsoup_zola The flats are Clarks, heels Hush Puppies and I LOVE THEM. ALL OF THE SHOES!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:46:25	Shiny heeled brogues, uh huh. Gone a but shoe crazy this month but I'd resisted new shoes for while! pic.twitter.com/XPD8zcGSxf
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:43:36	@rabbitsoup_zola Me too! The patent were out of stock for a couple of weeks, briefly considered regular leather, who was I kidding! SHINY!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:42:30	@rabbitsoup_zola Exactly the ones I got!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:40:24	You know you're post 30 when you get excited about Clarks and Hush Puppies!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:40:01	My new winter shoes arrived today though. Patent brogues, every year. I also got some heeled patent brogues, snazzy. Clarks and Hush Puppy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:39:00	@rabbitsoup_zola Tinned mandarins! Who still buys those? Peoples nans?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:38:17	I need a kick up the bum to write this personal statement now I'm over the crisis of confidence. Sort of. Mental illness and its lies eh!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:36:43	@rabbitsoup_zola Don't get hurricanes in the UK so he's wrong. Could have some hefty hurricane-like winds though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:13:26	@IamscaredInfo I think. Meeting new people, making sure you can actually do the job, getting out of the house etc.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:13:02	@IamscaredInfo I'm hoping to give uni another bash (third time lucky?) but given myself a whole year to prepare! First few days the worse
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:09:42	@IamscaredInfo The very thought of being responsible for turning up for every shift still completely terrifies me so you have my respect.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-21 03:09:10	@IamscaredInfo Because you are being financially rewarded for work done by an employer. Makes total sense to be anxious about that!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-20 18:12:56	@inmywindow Yep. I can't go in there without buying more! In fact, it's the only reason I go to Primark. Currently sporting fleecy Bambi.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-20 18:06:08	@inmywindow Amazing. Love me some novelty pyjamas.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-20 18:05:31	giving me a real boost at the moment! I think it could be time to get that personal statement written. Strike while the positivity is hot!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-20 18:04:50	I still struggle with looking after myself, cooking, personal hygiene, leaving the flat, decision making etc. But these little things are
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-20 18:04:10	I'm just getting on with things like "normal" people do. It's a very weird feeling after so long.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-20 18:03:41	Normal levels of procrastination of course but not the monumental persuading myself just to move a cup from lounge to kitchen.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-20 18:02:55	That on top of sorting my hall cupboard out last night, a job I've put off for months. Seriously, it feels weird to just do this stuff.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-20 18:02:16	Niceties done. The unheard of happened this morning. I've got the Oven Pride on the go! Proper cleaning! Who is this woman with purpose!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-20 18:01:27	My followers are creeping up, hullo to you all! Nice to meet you.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-20 03:53:49	@inmywindow @BipolarBlogger I have something of a Primark PJ addiction. Cheap, childish and comfy! Win all round!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-19 07:30:32	My view right now. He's a silly sod. pic.twitter.com/b5zeufHuNN
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-19 07:18:33	I really need to not forget to take my meds. Wide awake. Oops.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-19 06:33:18	Curious. Thoughts on this "What is you mental disorder?" quiz. Harmless fun? Fuelling ignorance and stigma? http:// ijustquizzed.com/Surveys/what-i s-your-mental-disorder/1307 …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-19 06:10:34	I actually like the 500 Miles as a ballad #controversial #xfactor
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-19 05:40:28	Balls. Forgot to take my Q until 5 minutes ago. Only about 2 hours late. Maybe it's time for a phone reminder......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-19 04:46:13	Today's fun new revelation is that my Q appears to give me hot flushes in the evening. Menopausal? You have my sympathy!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-19 04:44:27	@Ladybird_Donna this isn't always going to be a sunshine and rainbows account and I won't edit what I type for anyone.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-19 04:43:29	@Ladybird_Donna It's because it's so uncomfortable we SHOULD talk about it. I don't put TW on my posts, my profile description tells you
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-19 04:20:55	I have moved more than 30 times in my life so far. Unusual by any standards. Determined to stay where I am longer than since childhood.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-19 03:28:59	But seriously, a pink Lilli Ann winter coat for a steal?! The pink flash in my hair is coming back just so I can match my insane coat.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-19 03:18:42	This Tweet will be meaningless unless you're vintage bonkers but I JUST BOUGHT MY FIRST LILLI ANN! STOP PRESS! Get here fast beautiful coat.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 21:59:37	@inmywindow I just sit here fantasising about all the things I used to whip up no problem.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 21:59:18	@inmywindow Urgh, food cravings. I lost my cooking ability last year, still not come back even though I'm doing so much better.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 19:35:14	Heating bill saving tip? Live sandwiched on all sides by other flats and live above a popular restaurant. #youarewelcome
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 19:28:38	I need to write a personal statement. I'm paralysed by my own past failures. This is frustrating.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 05:35:31	Okay, I'd pay good money to Noel Gallagher do a paso doble!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 04:24:06	Naomi Campbell doesn't age does she?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 03:34:31	Strained my left middle finger today. No idea how but it hurts like a bitch!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 01:39:39	I don't want to fail and let them down a third time but I am doing well and craving some normality so much. Dilemma.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 01:39:02	So uni signed off me reapplying to my course but I keep going back and forth over if I could do it. Don't know what to do!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 01:18:33	Amazing how massive and impact the quality of my sleep has on the following day. Med hangovers are the absolute worst.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 01:10:07	Finally getting all these hung has made today worthwhile, particularly the vintage ballet plaques #happyspace pic.twitter.com/i1CwqR8Xm0
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 00:12:30	@SteveReedMP The area outside my flat looks like a mini landfill site every week for at least two days after collection day.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-18 00:11:50	@SteveReedMP Can the council redirect resources from a mostly pointless email newsletter to having rubbish collected when it's supposed to?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-17 02:17:18	Had to get my prescription today which I hate. Rewarded myself with Bambi pyjamas and 6 new nail polishes. I needed the, honestly.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-16 03:00:47	@AfternoonTory @BipolarBlogger @HootayMcBoob Maybe you need to go and actually read what falls under disabled. MH can be debilitating.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-16 02:10:15	@inmywindow It can be hard to find the right thing, I'm just lucky I guess that I have been a Friends geek since it started!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-16 01:56:06	@inmywindow A sort of comfort blanket to take the edge off the silence when it is too much.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-16 01:55:41	@inmywindow I can find evenings tricky. It's when I fall back on my trusty Friends box set. No choice to make and I know I like it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-16 00:19:17	Lord Freud. What a horrible little man. I don't even know what mentally damaged is supposed to mean other than lower class citizen.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-16 00:08:48	All I want to do is hide more than usual, instead I'm going to have to "man up" in order to go get my prescription. Why is my clinic so far!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-16 00:08:08	Things not going to plan seem to throw me for a loop these days. Repeat prescription nonsense has left me feeling very blue.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 19:56:59	Pharmacy will no longer dispense faxed prescription. Wonderful, how exactly do you think I can get it then!? Go cold turkey? Cheesed off.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 06:40:38	Along with everything else I feel guilty for. Now I'm waffling. GOT SLEEP BRAIN!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 06:40:07	I really don't like sleeping in so late for some reason. The former able to work albeit dysfunctionally me probably feels guilty.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 06:39:08	Still awake. This is silly now. Getting to sleep late means I have to sleep later in the morning. I know I have nothing to get up for but
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 06:05:10	Who needs some cute? My former feral baby who is far too cute. I squee at her every day. pic.twitter.com/805mu8zkzp
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 05:53:40	Why! Why do my meds suddenly take so long to blooming work! I should be asleep!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 05:36:32	@BipolarBlogger *Pretty medal duly awarded*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 05:07:05	I'm not watching The Apprentice. The show and tweets are terminally boring. They don't seem very nice people either.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 04:54:48	@rabbitsoup_zola @UKstandalone don't deserve to actually be families.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 04:54:36	@rabbitsoup_zola @UKstandalone I don't, do now! "Blood is thicker than water" bullcrap still smarts a bit. Some of us have families that
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 04:51:53	@rabbitsoup_zola So yeah, fuck them and their ignorance and head burying and mind games.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 04:51:32	@rabbitsoup_zola I'm sort of dealing with it. Ish. About 3 years into estrangement because they made me ill. Walking away also made me ill.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 04:44:53	@rabbitsoup_zola You and me both! My family are all welcome to each other.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 04:42:28	MDF dust is evil. Thankfully all work finished today but that dust makes my skin feel horrible, yuck.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 04:30:37	@NicsVoice @BipolarBlogger This sounds terrifying, no matter the circumstances, can't they do it a bit less scarily? Hope you're safe x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 04:28:41	So @sainsburys I don't drive and re-use my bags. Basically punishing me for both and reducing the Nectar points I earn shopping. #geethanks
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-15 02:14:44	Just wanted to say a big thank you and kudos to all who tweet about their #mentalhealth It's educational and mostly a supportive community.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 06:06:38	When this former feral casually drapes her little leg over my arm it always makes my day, she's so cute. pic.twitter.com/EPXm4heYe4
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 06:01:40	@DramaLlama85 Probably, it wasn't put in the formal report and I wasn't insulted by it. It was a mutual understanding thing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 06:00:50	@DramaLlama85 My current meds help, so I keep taking them. I'm also a terrible liar and would confess immediately if I didn't take them.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 06:00:04	@DramaLlama85 Made me laugh. Having self-perspective and insight has thrown up all sorts of issues.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:59:19	@DramaLlama85 I knew CBT/DBT et al would be pointless, psychologist agreed and that I may even be manipulative to satisfy therapist.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:58:27	@DramaLlama85 I really hate having to go to the pdoc but if I didn't my friends would stage an intervention for sure.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:57:07	@Lala_Brownie @Flashgordonette @wefail Hag-fish? *Trots off to Google* Yeah, those aren't cute either.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:55:45	@DramaLlama85 We settled on that at assessment as I admitted I'd likely not properly engage with other stuff offered. Too self analytical.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:54:50	@DramaLlama85 I play "am I really ill/as ill" games with myself at least once a day. Great fun.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:54:08	@DramaLlama85 I could be hanging on to false hope, it's anyone's guess really if psychodynamic will help. But I'll take that hope for now!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:52:20	Waves of nausea now. I'm essentially a recluse, how can I be physically ill!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:51:46	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger @sailor_jerry I am so far from not needing services. Plus I'm on a massive waiting list, don't want bumped.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:46:20	@Lala_Brownie @Flashgordonette @wefail I'm afraid the maggots aren't doing it for me and I can see beauty in most things!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:45:08	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger @sailor_jerry There is also the terror of changing my care team, from GP to pdoc, if I moved. No thank you.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:44:28	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger @sailor_jerry Thanks, I really like it here, nice community, great flat. I think I'm good for a while.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:42:56	And now I might need some more help to get to sleep? Urgh. I don't know why I have an issue with sleeping meds, I just do.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:42:11	Taken all meds a while ago, still wide awake. This could be turning into an unwelcome problem. Already hate taking sleeping tablets.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:37:48	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger @sailor_jerry I have moved A LOT. Attempting to stay in this flat longer than 18 months, so far on track!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:35:14	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger @sailor_jerry estranged brother! Was not healthy for me. So I ran rather far away, joys of being an adult.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:34:41	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger @sailor_jerry I actually left when I was living in Edinburgh but I ended up living on the same street as my
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:32:56	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger @sailor_jerry It sure is and this reminds me why I left due to feeling a bit too claustrophobic.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:25:04	@DramaLlama85 @BipolarBlogger @sailor_jerry Small world! I lived in Deans in Livingston then we moved to Broxburn.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:20:57	@BipolarBlogger @sailor_jerry @DramaLlama85 Apologies for the DM link but this is it, hadn't seen this article! http://www. dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2 637580/Inside-abandoned-asylum-housed-patients-100-years.html …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:18:34	@DramaLlama85 @sailor_jerry A&E which I visited for a split lip caused by falling off a wall when I was about 7!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:18:04	@DramaLlama85 @sailor_jerry I can't be sure it was still a psychiatric facility at that point, it was mostly closed. It even had a small
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:16:32	@sailor_jerry @DramaLlama85 As it's in Scotland you can explore without worry of trespass laws, it's actually a very beautiful place!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:16:01	@sailor_jerry @DramaLlama85 all sorts. I attended a few before it was entirely closed down. That's where my interest comes from.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:15:27	@sailor_jerry @DramaLlama85 I actually grew up near one of these asylums, slowly decommissioned through my childhood. They held fetes and
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 05:07:33	@DramaLlama85 @sailor_jerry I think it's also some of the barbaric practices that took place, albeit sensationalised.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-14 00:44:35	I still feel sick at the glee with which the media are reporting on Amanda Bynes.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 21:56:50	@Ladybird_Donna Thank you! Little triumphs :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 21:50:45	Managed to call for my own repeat prescription, leave a message and answer the call back. *Smug face*. Never managed all that before!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 06:30:31	@DramaLlama85 If only it was as easy as the pill which I just drop a repeat request in for another six month supply!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 06:30:05	@DramaLlama85 so will have to see what he says I suppose. It's been a ballache for the 3 months I only had a psych nurse appointment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 06:29:06	@DramaLlama85 I have the form but don't know if they'll do it for my psych meds. I get about a month at a time. New pdoc this month
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 06:18:58	Are small prescription amounts the usual on psych meds? Fed up requesting repeats with my phone issues.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 04:54:59	@BipolarBlogger I understand that. Things I brush off come back to haunt me when I'm having a hard time. Not so easy to switch it off.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 04:51:26	@BipolarBlogger A side of human behaviour I very much dislike and despair of.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 04:51:09	@BipolarBlogger Troll/bully types do like a spot of know it all latching on, they don't actually care if they're right, it's sport.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 04:49:36	Kind of struggling with needing sleeping tablets every night now. Insomnia deep rooted now it seems. Great.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 04:47:56	@BipolarBlogger Some people are complete twats, I seem to be reminded of this daily!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-13 04:47:34	@BipolarBlogger I'm doing more sporadic lurking than active participation in Twitter at the moment, hate to see you being targeted.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-12 07:01:29	Dear Press, leave Amanda Bynes alone, she's unwell, not cheap sensational news fodder, poor girl.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-11 04:18:18	Autumn. Treading the fine line between freezer and sauna in the flat. Currently on sauna setting #sweaty
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-08 23:51:46	Once again, I'm being neglectful of Twitter. The work in my flat is nearly finished and then I'll be more focused. Exhausted for now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 18:08:29	@Ladybird_Donna It really is shit but it happened and I try not to let it drag me under. Sun is out and seeing a friend today so yay!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 05:30:07	*Downs zopiclone*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 05:29:43	Huh, quetiapine and red wine apparently have no impact on each other. Disappointed, thought I'd be nice and sleepy! Nope, still awake!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 05:28:23	My cats are being creepy..... pic.twitter.com/R3uxdrhdz0
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 04:23:00	Oh my lord, in the name of challenging myself I am going to the community choir this week! Eek!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 03:53:34	@GoodmotherM Oh and I plumbed in my tabletop dishwasher myself, went to Plumbase and everything! *faints*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 03:50:49	Clearly the experiment is going well when you manage to repeat yourself in a tweet.......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 03:50:14	@GoodmotherM woman strength. Le sigh. Equality eh?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 03:50:00	@GoodmotherM shelving too had I the tools (no storage space) and experience. I also regularly surprise male couriers with my freakish
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 03:49:17	@GoodmotherM I grew up in a house of boys so well used to pulling my weight. Just decorated my lounge single handedly. I'd have built the
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 03:44:57	Tonight is the great red wine and quetiapine XL and red wine experiment. So far still conscious! #bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 03:43:49	@GoodmotherM I have a woman putting my alcove shelving up. Good DIYer. I know this would come as a shock to many, ridiculous!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 02:16:39	I want to be on Strictly. Quick, who needs some altruistic help!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 02:12:36	Ooft, that's a week two salsa!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 02:01:54	I think I'm done ranting. Probably need to blog about it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 02:01:38	It just makes me feel so massively let down.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 02:01:12	with him was her only concern. She could never, ever imagine being alone and so I was the sacrificial lamb to save herself.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 02:00:38	and I couldn't because he was so bolstered by my mother's indifference to his actions towards me. Her own preservation of her relationship
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 01:59:23	I TRIED to stop him abusing me further, even though it was on a lesser scale. It's still violation and abuse. Exertion of power over a minor
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 01:58:39	inconsequential. Makes me so mad now. That nobody cared I was continually violated, even when I spoke up. Makes me sick as an adult.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 01:57:52	What does that behaviour from my abuser and my mother say to me as a 13/14 year old? My body and emotions about it being touched are..
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 01:57:07	Abuser: Puts hand on my buttock as we're walking with my mum. Me: Can you stop touching me! Mum: *Indifferent glance*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 01:56:00	@Ladybird_Donna This has jogged my memory of the behaviour of my abuser post allegations and my mum having him back.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 01:47:38	@drinksinthedark @rabbitsoup_zola @alicemeat @debecca I think my pdoc keeping it as simple as possible helped, not immediately on a cocktail
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 01:47:03	@drinksinthedark @rabbitsoup_zola @alicemeat @debecca I just struck lucky and it won't work forever but I'll take what I can!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 01:42:03	@bdogrunner My very favourite thing is to hide from everyone and everything. Glad you're less anxious.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 01:27:46	I'm not sure about the posturing judges intros on Strictly now. Sit down and stop chaine turning!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 01:19:53	Wait. Right Said Fred is still a thing?! I'm not sure if I'm thrilled or horrified!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 01:15:27	Red wine and Strictly. In my happy place.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 00:46:56	@drinksinthedark @rabbitsoup_zola @alicemeat @debecca been on though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 00:46:49	@drinksinthedark @rabbitsoup_zola @alicemeat @debecca to the crippling depression, agoraphobia and anxiety of before. Only bipolar med I've
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-05 00:46:20	@drinksinthedark @rabbitsoup_zola @alicemeat @debecca I do okay on Q XL. Some days wiped but others more productive than ever. I prefer this
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-04 22:35:40	Heating is on! (Very low). Autumn has definitely arrived and brought rain with it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-04 03:19:58	@drinksinthedark My friend says I'm my own OT, I do lots to try and challenge myself when I'm well enough.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-04 03:16:18	As lovely as she is it's exhausting putting on my "normal" face 5 hours a day. She knows I'm ill it's just natural reflex to hide it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-04 03:15:27	I ma being so Twitter neglectful. All my energy is going into having someone in my flat every day doing shelves. She's lovely thankfully!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-03 00:58:05	Cannot tell you how tired I am after spending a good chunk of my day with another human being in the house. I hate how exhausted it makes me
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-02 05:45:12	seeming rude. Will be lovely when it's done though. Mission: Lounge, will be accomplished!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-02 05:44:38	Just having shelves put up but the noise and dust will no doubt upset me and the cats. It's a friend doing it so at least I can hide without
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-02 05:43:57	Twitter! I've neglected you today! Are you all doing okay? Muddling through? I've been having a chill day before work starts in my lounge.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-01 21:24:30	Now if I could just get a positive response to an email I sent just before the weekend I'll be all set!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-01 21:23:37	But I have what I need and I can get my flat back to normal mostly by the weekend. Whoop!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-01 21:23:01	I'm not sure I've ever had worse service. To the point where the stress of it was at risk of making me a bit unwell. Just dreadful.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-01 21:22:25	I also got refunded most of the materials cost and delivery because are a useless shower of idiots who had to deliver by TAXI in the end.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-01 21:20:16	The cats and I are having an extra lazy day in bed. They're too cute all sprawled out! Preparing for shelf building madness tomorrow!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-10-01 17:11:19	Day three of waiting for a reply to an important email. The suspense is killing me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-30 21:04:53	I can hear one of my cats licking an empty food dish like they never get fed. If they weren't such piggies they'd leave some to nibble on!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-30 19:46:14	Possibly the cutest picture you'll see all day. Dave the cat and Betty the cat having a snuggle #cute pic.twitter.com/WwtHWTBe5K
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-30 00:54:11	I don't think so! IDS is a pretty horrific human being it must be said and he only gets worse, despite being nothing but a failure.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-30 00:53:33	Pre-paid benefits cards so people don't mis-spend? So will therr be increased MH resources then to tackle root causes of substance abuse etc
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-29 21:53:54	Litter trays, change of bedding, vacuuming, DONE. Now have a headache but happy to have gotten so much done!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-29 05:47:43	Must try to remember to buy ear plugs this week. No-one likes a party pooper! But after a year, fed up being kept awake on "school" nights.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-29 05:46:50	I know this is boring old lady talk but on live music nights I'd be grateful if @WhiteHartSE19 had better soundproofing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-29 03:43:20	@DramaLlama85 Try Craftsy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-29 02:44:52	@drinksinthedark Thanks. Trying not to make rash decisions just in case!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-29 02:20:04	I don't remember what I feel like when not depressed, therefore I have no idea if I'm just doing well or borderline hypo #bipolarproblems
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 19:44:34	@inmywindow Ok, what council are you with and how old are you? Feel free to PM. I hate to see you suffer trying to get this stuff sorted.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 19:43:27	@inmywindow Your mental health team will also have welfare advocates who can help. Ask friends to help maybe? Will help take pressure off.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 19:41:35	@inmywindow Have you looked into benefits yet? I think for certain you can get rent help, apply through local council.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 06:58:56	Experiment of sleeping without zopiclone fail. Worth a try as am really tired! Now taken tablets so waiting for sleep to take over.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:38:10	@Lala_Brownie I went complete girl in my 20s, now I'm the beauty encyclopaedia for friends!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:27:17	@Lala_Brownie Dr Dennis Gross peel is uhmazing to really clear the skin out. Again I think cruelty free.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:26:13	@Lala_Brownie I get the monthly beauty box from them, organic and cruelty free products.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:25:52	@Lala_Brownie All of Liz Earle, it's all beautiful. Korres does nice body products as does Weleda. You need to check Love Lula, beauty site.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:21:59	@Lala_Brownie Yes, totally captivating, house was amazing. So interesting with the Kennedy connection, such an odd family really.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:20:25	@Lala_Brownie It's been hard work and I do have light acne scarring but I've never been happier with my skin. Best investment ever made.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:18:51	@Lala_Brownie I'm super picky about products that go directly on my skin. Oh and if you do get some, I get a gift for recommending! Haha!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:18:13	@Lala_Brownie Liz Earle is for sure vegan. The only issue is the Avon thing but it was a condition of sale nothing changed.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:12:29	@Lala_Brownie I have tried so many brands and products, Liz Earle completely changed my skin and it's not silly expensive.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:11:54	@Lala_Brownie I recommend Liz Earle to everyone, I think I have 5 converts now. I won't change from it as my core which is big talk!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:10:23	@Lala_Brownie A little vanity ain't no bad thing!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:10:10	@Lala_Brownie Oh geez, I'm passionate about skin care, my face is showing the benefits now I'm getting old. Also helps with confidence.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:06:18	@Lala_Brownie My skin is certainly happy about it, been very neglected of late.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:05:12	@Lala_Brownie Ad rosehip oil to your evening routine, after toning, before moisturising, it's amazing stuff!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:00:45	@Lala_Brownie by Avon though so depends on your feelings about that as to whether you'd by it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 02:00:25	@Lala_Brownie I really like all of Liz Earle, their brightening mask is especially good and I use the skincare as my daily routine. Bought
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 01:59:33	@Lala_Brownie Really loved it. They were taken advantage of by the film makers as clearly mentally ill but totally fascinating.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 01:58:45	@Lala_Brownie Looks like it's fine! See last line on description (this isn't the one I have, I have the super mud) http://www. glamglowmud.co.uk/glamglow/produ cts/glamglow_face_mud_mask50/ …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 01:56:29	@Lala_Brownie Crap, I think I've chucked the main packaging, let me check the pot. PS. REALLY weird, I was just thinking I must tweet you!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 01:26:22	Gosh Gloria Swanson was ridiculously beautiful.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-28 01:21:20	Glamglow Mud Mask time! Doing much better with spoiling myself with skincare again, something that slips often these days.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-27 20:54:32	Aside from being really tired I'm actually feeling okay. Threatened low seemed to slope back off again, massive relief.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-27 20:52:01	I'm so tired today after two days of appearing "normal". Need a nap but waiting for now late Wickes delivery. Third attempt. Not happy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-27 02:26:55	Just sent a very important email. Won't even be read until Monday. Clock watching already......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-27 00:24:35	I'd be really interested to hear from anyone who has initially failed but subsequently successfully completed a degree with #bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-27 00:16:41	@drinksinthedark You and me both.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-27 00:02:34	might just be possible. Which is beyond exciting for me. I had nearly given up on life for a while there.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-27 00:02:07	I had my first identifiable hypo recently and it showed me I can mostly cope with that okay. If we can stave off depressions, uni...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-27 00:01:19	But this is all about testing myself. I am now pretty determined to try and return to uni this time next year if I'm stable enough.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-27 00:00:34	I even stopped and had lunch while there and treated myself to the new Horst book. Rather smug with myself.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-27 00:00:03	Small milestone today. I made it to the V&A all on my ownsome. A trip I've been planning for months as it's one of my favourite places.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-26 06:40:15	I'm not convinced I entirely deserve either accolade but it's nice for them to want to make me feel nice. Topping up my hope jar.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-26 06:39:03	Today I was sent a random appreciation message from a friend and called remarkable by another. Not a bad day really!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-26 03:27:53	Have had a lovely day actually. Spent afternoon and evening with best friend before she starts midwifery at uni. Always nice to catch up!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-25 18:53:19	Never wished I had a crystal ball more!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-25 18:53:05	Thing is, I've NEVER been stable, so it could be a fumble in the dark thinking I am capable. It's a full on course.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-25 18:52:18	Today, I desperately want to make plans to return to uni but am so scared, failed twice already. But if stable next year I want to go.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-25 16:51:28	"Think positive" A well meaning platitude that won't actually do anything to mitigate the impact of my bipolar. But, uh, thanks.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-25 04:19:42	It's that time of year when you have to laundry plan two days ahead because it no longer dries overnight #autumn #cleanpants
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-25 02:46:30	Feeling less deep in my bones miserable tonight, thank goodness. Quite possibly because it's meds routine now which means sleep soon.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 21:03:45	I'm back in bed. It's somehow safer than the sofa when I'm feeling so crap.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 18:41:09	Oh shit, I've crashed hard today. Felt the clouds descending yesterday evening. Bollocks. Don't know what to do about it really.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 05:09:12	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola @LokisFool Had mine since I was 17, so to give it up would be a bit of a big deal. Been thinking about it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 05:07:31	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola @LokisFool Despite the fact I don't have a car so rarely drive. Such a dilemma.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 05:07:06	@BipolarBlogger @rabbitsoup_zola @LokisFool As much as I would like a Freedom Pass, I'm really rather attached to having a license!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 05:01:55	@Ladybird_Donna Always x
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 04:58:27	@Ladybird_Donna through each tomorrow. That's all anyone can ask, especially of yourself.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 04:58:07	@Ladybird_Donna Sending kitty headbutts back. We are so not alone but loneliness and depression likes to lie about that. Just keep getting
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 04:56:55	given the medication was doing its job for a few months there. Still on the rollercoaster I suppose.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 04:56:03	So I guess I may just be heading for the dreaded depressive episode. Those are always fun. Had hoped it would be a while before it happened
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 04:55:08	Feeling a bit lonely and ignored today. Guess that's the hypo exiting stage right. Also actually feeling my Q kicking in.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 04:51:48	@Ladybird_Donna you've just got to protect yourself as hard as that can be in the short term.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 04:51:09	@Ladybird_Donna have them in my life any more. I was continually redamaging myself, being reabused, literally and figuratively. Sometimes
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 04:50:09	@Ladybird_Donna I keep reminding myself that much of my psychological damage was done by my family and that alone is a good reason not to
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 04:49:23	@Ladybird_Donna It gets easier. It's grieving so takes time. It will rear its head unexpectedly, all that good stuff. But it gets easier.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 03:43:10	I'm not bi but stand in solidarity with my fellow human beings, however they identify #BiVisibilityDay Love all round.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 02:52:17	@Smitchalot I strongly suspect I'd lose weight without changing anything is it weren't for meds. But not gaining, so got to find the +ve
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 02:49:14	Earlier this week I was wondering how people forgot to take their meds. Every day since I've been late with mine #instantkarma
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 02:46:07	@Smitchalot But people want the miracle. There isn't one folks.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 02:45:52	@Smitchalot Agreed. Preach all day long. I'm overweight because I overeat (and meds mess a bit with my appetite and metabolism), simples.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 02:41:52	@Smitchalot I'm not a massive carb eater in general (proof carb free does not mean slim, ha!) but before I was ill I cooked and baked a lot.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 02:27:18	@Smitchalot PS. Yes, I'm a food geek :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 02:27:06	@Smitchalot It's why GF free baking is such a minefield and so much of it is awful. Gluten is an essential bit of baking chemistry.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 01:48:50	@Smitchalot Yup. Like rice, 10 seconds too short, crunchy, 10 seconds too long, mush. I don't do GF but know people who do!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 01:45:41	@Smitchalot It's easy to overcook, gluten is the thing that makes it stable, without, one false move and mush.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-24 01:18:07	@SamCandour I love some of the search terms purely for the fact my blog is most definitely not what they were after!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 23:07:31	@DramaLlama85 The memory that I once did just about manage makes this new reality so much harder. The cliched bitter pill.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 22:17:39	@inmywindow Got to the Turn2us calculator, you may be able to claim something to help.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 21:53:50	I confess, I have just put the heating on, it's freezing!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 19:46:09	Massive sleep last night. I think I'm on the come down. I also look absolutely knackered. Fun.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 05:34:12	Former feral Betty. Ain't she cute! pic.twitter.com/NEhbbCBv5F
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 05:21:10	@DramaLlama85 @sailor_jerry I'm not really understanding what's bad about either of those things. Unless you're David Cameron.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 04:59:41	@Sheridansmith1 Are there plans to release a Cilla soundtrack with your recordings? Because I want it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 03:42:28	@BipolarBlogger So called "inspirational" memes about overcoming adversity with happy thoughts make me want to stab my eyes out.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 02:52:49	Definitely calmer today, phew. Although suddenly very sneezy, I better not be getting a post hypo cold (is that a thing?!).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 01:23:40	Eeee, you can right feel the temperature drop when the sun starts to go down now can't you? PS. I am not northern.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 00:30:53	AND I made two phone calls. Unprecedented. But I need to know where my undelivered MDF is. Be here Thursday apparently.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 00:30:16	Haven't cooked for weeks. Just done another ready meal-tastic online grocery shop. Oh well, at least I rehung the curtains.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 00:27:36	Had a nap, a sort of restless one. Still tired. Am I on the comedown now? Still not functioning at all really.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-23 00:02:06	@joythestore Is that it?! What about the dreadful card? Will that still be sold? Any MH awareness training to be implemented? Disappointed.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 20:56:08	I appear to be in a mixed state today. Agitated but EXHAUSTED. And pissed off but that could be entirely Wickes' fault for non delivery.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 18:00:26	I have now done a wash so the pants crisis is over, for now. Can only cope with so many things at once, decorating AND pant washing too much
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 17:59:31	Had to put the heating on for an hour this morning just to dry a pair of pants as I had no practical ones clean. Rubbish.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 06:04:24	Sleeping when hypo would be a lot easier if the local pub didn't do quite loud open mic nights. Close the windows, turn the amp down, ta!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 03:39:48	@inmywindow @LLouQuiet I take both. I'm on Q XL for sleep and mood, zopiclone when needed (which is always right now).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 03:22:52	@BipolarBlogger @inmywindow I have an odd body chemistry though when it comes to all sorts of meds.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 03:22:34	@BipolarBlogger @inmywindow We obviously have a similar constitution. When I started it knocked me out quickly but I adjust fast.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 03:20:18	@inmywindow @BipolarBlogger Yeah, it's very much trial and error. I'm still working it out myself at times, like now when hypo, it's changed
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 03:16:05	@inmywindow @BipolarBlogger Then I take zopiclone at 10pm to be asleep for 10.30pm ish. I wake about 8.30am. It makes sleep A LOT.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 03:15:24	@inmywindow @BipolarBlogger I take 300mg. Non-hypo I take it about 8.30pm, sleep two hours later ish. Now I'm hypo, take it 7.30pm.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 03:04:56	Mel B is gorgeous, this makes her look a bit tacky. I'm such a critic.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 03:04:29	Mel B needs a new make-up artist, lashes are wrong, eye make-up weird and foundation clearly not suitable for the lighting conditions.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 02:58:06	Operation alcove shelving and cupboards commences Tuesday. I am justifiably excited about this.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 02:49:45	Somewhere in the middle would suit me just fine. At least I have zopliclone so I'm sleeping, that's something I suppose.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 02:48:47	If this continues I'm going to have to phone care team and ask for help. I do NOT like the high. Nope. Not me. I don't like the low either.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 02:21:26	I hate this feeling, out of control of myself. Argh.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 02:21:08	Tried to sit down for half an hour. Nope. Hypo having none of it, off sorting stuff out in the bedroom, pointless until lounge finished.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 00:32:46	My back is not so happy with all the exertion though, bending over is now painful painful. Oh well.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-22 00:26:41	I think I deserve a medal for using my hypo to do something good! My lounge is all done being painted. Roll on shelving stage! Now, pizza.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 22:42:16	So have @joythestore deleted their half arsed apology but left the ignorant bigoted tweets up? The mind boggles.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 22:41:04	I have finished the painting! This marks the end of the exciting series of "I'm still painting my lounge" series!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 21:00:18	Dave's hair is finally growing back properly after three months, might not need woolly jumpers for cold days! pic.twitter.com/qMVR3u6IiQ
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 20:53:21	@_Charl_Parker @joythestore Jesus, maybe the office junior has been left in charge then?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 20:46:28	My hypo has been quite well directed this time round!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 20:46:06	You finally get it finished. Pizza for tea tonight as a reward. Next week hopefully the alcove shelving goes in to finish the job!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 20:45:07	I have nearly finished lounge wall painting, one coat on one wall to go! The sort of job you regret starting half way through but love when
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 20:42:28	@joythestore I think a new social media /PR manager is needed. Irreverence and discriminatory language are two very different things.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 16:41:39	I don't know what time the hardware shop opens and it's stressing me out. Hello hypo.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 05:08:11	@MindCharity @Rethink_ @MarkOneinFour @joythestore PR response to this card looking a bit car crash like.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 05:05:32	So Joy think this is an acceptable card and when called on it respond with horrific http:// pic-collage.com/_jDsYvONy pic.twitter.com/MOn9LBupJg
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 04:56:59	@joythestore @poeticfeminist Actually gob smacked at this response, mental illness should not be made fun of on a card.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 03:50:04	Actually, it reminds of chemically induced highs experienced during my misspent youth. You know, an unnatural high.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 03:49:14	I have this feeling I'm going to be even higher tomorrow than I am today. Grinning for no actual reason, it's such a weird feeling.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 02:49:22	@inmywindow on them though but it's choosing the lesser of the evils.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 02:49:01	@inmywindow while dosing up the Q and absolutely did not feel worse before better at any point and I was deep in the pit. I do sleep a lot
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 02:48:07	@inmywindow I was on an anti-d at the time but that had triggered a hypo anyway and then levelled back out to doing nothing. Dosed off that
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 02:42:30	@inmywindow making me feel worse at first at all. Just sedated and then I started to feel better. I think I need an increase now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 02:41:38	@inmywindow I stopped taking it, far too sedating. Then was put on Q, which did the job too and is my mood stabiliser. I don't remember it
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 02:38:10	@suey2y Try BHS, I got a lovely summer dressing gown from there.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 02:17:29	tape. I am wide awake and starting to feel a bit buzzy. I have one wall left and then who knows where I'll direct this energy!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-21 02:16:41	Definitely hypo again. Have.Not.Stopped. All day. Just did second coat of 3rd wall because the shops were shut and I've run out of masking
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-20 23:23:11	It was nice to have a little boogie to the radio though, it's rare I even have it on, prefer silence.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-20 23:22:13	Decorated for about 6 hours today with hardly a break. Yup, still hypo, not sure if it's still mixed though. Knackered with a headache now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-20 21:23:33	Magic radio, easing the pain of decorating for all 30 something's. Dancing whilst up a ladder may be a bit unwise though....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-20 18:20:59	I'm a broken record. More hypo than mixed today so cracking on with more lounge painting. Can it be finished now?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-20 02:50:47	My evening, Little Edie, popcorn and bed. Oh and meds. Might fall asleep before the end of the DVD, I hope! #tired pic.twitter.com/kfWJPeKtPu
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-20 01:22:39	But I'll take it for now whilst I'm trying to get the lounge all done. Depressive episode can stay away as long as it likes!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-20 01:21:54	Totally still having a mixed episode though. I so tired and keep stopping but then when I start something I just go and go. It's really odd.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-20 01:21:08	So tired today but lots achieved despite sleep deprivation. Friend measured up for alcove shelves, bits ordered and more painting, woo!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-19 03:26:39	I showered! Thank goodness, it was much needed.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-19 02:07:17	I shouldn't be as sucked in as I am but weeeeeee, delivery text for my iPhone 6 just received! Shiny new gadget, waited 3 years to upgrade!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-19 01:58:15	Still the wrong side of hypo, a little over-productive but put it to good use with the painting and now treating myself to a posh face mask.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 21:53:54	Literally watching paint dry. Hurry up, I want to put the second coat on!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 20:09:45	Let's face, if you spend 99.9% of your time stuck at home, may as well try and make it a place you really love being.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 20:09:19	Coat one of pain onto the chimney breast and alcoves. Totally right colour. Still waiting for the contrast paint to arrive. Love it though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 06:19:56	Honestly, Blackpool, why would you.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:44:18	Scott Hatings, you were privately educated at a top Edinburgh school. From a privileged elite that doesn't get it #greatbritishbreakup
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:38:25	I've got news for you England, you don't own Scotland, they are allowed to decide if they want to stay in the Union #greatbritishbreakup
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:31:31	@NicsVoice I did have really vitriolic responses but I've had more surprising support than surprising hate.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:26:28	@NicsVoice I have some incredible friends who rallied and still rally round. That combined with my now growing Twitter folks is crucial.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:16:47	@NicsVoice about 3 or 4 years ago. That's when it all slowly started to unravel. But at least I only beat myself up these days!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:15:58	@NicsVoice I just ended up the immediate family's scapegoat and mental and physical punchbag. Blamed for all their ills. So I walked away
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:14:41	@NicsVoice I was going through this without the internet and Twitter! I know it can have the opposite effect though I know.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:14:17	@NicsVoice Seeing other experiences, although they appear terrifying, also offer me comfort and insight. I feel better equipped than if
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:11:08	@NicsVoice as far as I know. We all have issues though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:10:50	@NicsVoice I'll never really know though. I can clearly see now though MH issues definitely run through although I'm the only bipolar one
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:10:11	@NicsVoice We were just a bit of a crap family emotionally. Parents were split, dad lost his partner and was probably already depressed
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:06:20	@NicsVoice the sand. Only got taken seriously last year and thanks to a wonderful GP and then pdoc I at least have help now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:05:32	@NicsVoice I was never suicidal seriously, my dad took his own life so it wasn't an option. My mum was a contributor and buried her head in
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:04:42	@NicsVoice through but I think the stress of that triggered my hypo.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:04:24	@NicsVoice didn't know what I'd do without him. He's my right hand man, mummy's boy, much more needy than the girls. Thankfully he pulled
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:03:49	@NicsVoice I have no desire to have children of my own so they are very much my children. Nearly lost Dave the last couple of months, I
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:03:02	The easyJet rabbit is somewhat unnerving. Doesn't encourage me to fly with them.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:02:20	@NicsVoice Much the same for me, on a lower level, only no-one would treat me, kept blaming environmental factors. My credit rating is shot!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 05:01:18	Tomorrow, Yes or No, everything changes #indyref I know how I'd vote if I was still in Scotland, good luck all and be nice!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:59:54	@NicsVoice They're my furry therapists. Always know when I need extra attention and they give me daily purpose. They're a very good thing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:57:12	@NicsVoice Funnily, the thing that worries me about crisis is who will look after my cats! I think that's my fear, nothing about me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:55:37	@NicsVoice cope. It worked, albeit causing my life to be quite chaotic but nothing dangerous. The wheels just had to fall off at some point.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:55:01	@NicsVoice I've had issues about the same amount of time but mine have been a much slower burn and I've just been a bit clever at trying to
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:54:13	@NicsVoice Yeah, it's telling my rational brain not to stress about something I can't control! Trying to deal with the here and now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:48:15	@NicsVoice I did wonder if I was developing full mania as I hear it's not unusual for us BPII apparently. Will happily stay as II though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:46:17	@NicsVoice entails as I've never been through it. Fear of the unknown and lesser of two evils and all that.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:45:49	@NicsVoice My team are so hard to see. Although you can rock up and they'll see you in two hours I think. I worry what needing crisis help
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:44:48	Put up girly nets in my bedroom today, so much better than the grey curtains I inherited. Lovely bright room now! Perfect finishing touch.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:43:35	@NicsVoice There was a point though, as you say, where it's enjoyable and you think why curb it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:43:10	@NicsVoice I don't currently have any PRN, that's how fresh I am! Hypo was scary though, felt out of control. Suck it and see for now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:32:04	@NicsVoice Are you still confident you'll get back to uni?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:31:46	@NicsVoice I have a crisis. Nice to delay anxiety causing appointment but disappointed to be left to get on with it for so long.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:31:07	@NicsVoice second week of mixed (I think, all too new!). But I have to wait until Halloween to see pdoc. Sow ill just have to cope unless
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:30:35	@NicsVoice new to identifying what's happening with my moods. Had a hypo, slightly tempered by sedation of meds, for about a week. Now into
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:29:59	@NicsVoice I thought I was seeing new pdoc this month (2 months since saw my old one, had his contract ended, budgets), I'm new to bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 04:08:35	@NicsVoice Especially amplified today as I slept really badly last night and not nearly enough. Will see what tomorrow brings!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 03:58:48	Mixed episodes are so confusing. I want to paint my lounge. From my bed. Whilst cleaning my hall cupboard. While napping. #bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 02:57:13	Jon Snow is wearing an especially natty tie this evening.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 02:00:47	Another moan. It's bin day. My weekly opportunity to have a completely nonsensical mild panic attack whilst putting the rubbish out.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 01:59:43	Because quite frankly, my attention span is essentially nil when trying to work out which one I should be buying.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 01:59:11	I broke my laptop adaptor so I can now only use it in one socket in the lounge. Bought a new one, wrong sort. Why aren't they just universal
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-18 01:58:20	@LLouQuiet I'm down with this on both counts.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-17 22:45:32	that's not an issue. Makes it three months between old pdoc and new. Fabulous continuity of care.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-17 22:44:48	Best friend got through to clinic first go, typical. Thought my appointment was this month but nope, not until end of October. Let's hope
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-17 20:32:19	and/or system the operate under is not lovely. At all. About as service user unfriendly as is possible.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-17 20:31:40	"phone tokens" I can use. Too anxious to try again. Just a joke that I can't get through to them. The people I see are nice, the department
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-17 20:30:20	because they don't understand my (not strong) accent and/or just don't pick up the phone. I can't make any more calls now, I'm done with
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-17 20:29:20	It's impossible to get through to my mental health team, made worse by my phone issues. I could easily miss appointments and run out of meds
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-17 20:12:57	@Ladybird_Donna Baptiste dry shampoo is my best friend, I struggle so much with showering.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-17 16:43:00	Took meds too late last night then my sleep was really crap. Arms like unco-ordinated lead weights this morning and far too sleepy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-17 05:01:48	I guess I'll be having a lie in tomorrow then!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-17 05:01:24	For the first time since I've been taking them I forgot to take my meds until now, which is 1-2 hours later than ideal for me. Oops.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 23:43:38	When you order a tin of completely the wrong paint. Dingbat. Also, what's with the gargantuan box for one tine B&Q?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 22:35:56	Received a beautiful piece of vintage Pyrex from eBay all smashed up today. Got a full refund so yay for a good seller but gutted!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 22:06:16	Trying to resist napping after 11 hours of sleep last night but I am feeling exhausted. Sick of the tiredness.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 20:53:58	@CentreforMH I'm having to wait two years. That it could be as quick as 28 boggles my mind a bit! The dream!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 05:32:14	#pavementexplosions Another very good reason not to leave home too often........... #anyexcuse #anxiety
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 03:58:17	Plus I'm trying to still maintain some sort of routine so need to go to bed and take tablets. Too late to shower. I really annoy myself!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 03:57:10	Been trying to convince myself to shower all day (oh how times change) and now Cilla is starting and I love Sheridan.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 03:21:16	We all seem to be having some sort of episode Twitter. Is it the time of year?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:49:50	@NicsVoice Totally asking the wrong person! ;)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:48:39	@ms_molly_vog Family! Immediate and step from there, spent a lot of time in Belfast as a youngster.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:21:26	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark as a result of a neglected and traumatic childhood through to adulthood.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:21:06	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark scary but I guess it is what it is now, see what each day brings is all I can do. Most of my MH issues are
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:20:39	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark This is so scary. My last two hypos have been my most recognisable and "worse" I'd say. Them getting worse is
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:10:08	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark You'll hopefully have more empathy, as long as their issues aren't triggering for you.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:09:30	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark It was enough for my reconsideration to be successful. Thank heavens I avoided the ESA assessment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:08:49	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark I foolishly went alone. I dressed too well too apparently. Had a meltdown on phone to decision maker (PIP)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:07:57	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark So to stop has been quite weird but I know I'm not in any state to work or study. Epic breakdown last year.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:07:30	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark That has been my lifetime cycle with work and study. Last at most 6 months, get ill and quit. Ad hominem.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:06:22	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark pdoc and now still under their care. 18 months to wait for time limited therapy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:05:56	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark moved house and got a new, amazing GP who finally asked about my history and referred me. 8 months before I saw
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:05:19	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark I presented to a GP for first time when I was 15. Then numerous times. Always sent away. Last year put on anti-d
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:04:03	@drinksinthedark @NicsVoice Having knowledge is key I think or a knowledgeable advocate. It can be very stressful but if prepared not so bad
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:02:59	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark avoided another assessment. The PIP one and the wait for a decision made me very ill. Much better equipped now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:02:23	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark I was assessed by a physio, it was before I really knew what I was doing. Look into regs 29 & 35, it's how
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:01:18	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark Now I feel I could be a benefits advocate I read up so much!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 02:00:51	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark I researched like a crazy woman before applying. Had a hairy month when I was signed off in limbo.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:58:41	@drinksinthedark @NicsVoice I know! I was being sarcastic about some peoples thoughts on being off work. Like I took the easy, lazy choice.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:57:09	@drinksinthedark @NicsVoice I have monthly pdoc appointments and even that feels like a monumental effort.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:56:35	@drinksinthedark @NicsVoice friends. I'd rather be able to just get on with life and stop being judged. It's no jolly that's for sure!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:56:03	@drinksinthedark @NicsVoice process of applying for and getting each of them hellish. Then there were all the attacks from now former
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:55:36	@drinksinthedark @NicsVoice I stopped uni at first, even though I loved it most. Then working became impossible. Now on ESA nd PIP, the
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:45:59	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark I'm hoping I can get to a place where I can finally finish something, anything! My hope would be uni.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:45:34	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark I got diagnosed a few months ago, 32 now. No MH care until last year despite asking a few times over the years.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:36:42	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark have such different ways of trying to deal with what is essentially such an unknown thing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:36:07	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark anything these days. Nothing completed, can't even look after myself properly. It's interesting how we all...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:35:27	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark I think I just got too exhausted trying and everything, mind, body, soul, shut down. Can't get going with....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:33:50	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark Hypos are such new territory for me, at least recognising them as that is. I'm more your depressed type.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:32:49	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark with myself most of the time. Next pdoc appointment is going to be very interesting!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:32:29	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark sit on my sofa and cuddle my cats mode. When not cleaning like a demon due to hypo. Don't even know what to do..
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:31:41	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark You've been through it. Trying to pick up the pieces is scary so well done for trying! I'm very much in the...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:27:54	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark This is why sometimes I'm relieved I got too ill to continue uni or working. My self care is my focus for now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-16 01:21:48	@NicsVoice @drinksinthedark Jumping ont he wagon, mixed/hypo episode for a good couple of weeks now, waiting for the crash :-/

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 18:13:27	@BipolarBlogger @drinksinthedark This is my MH account, I also have another (older) once which is mostly just for happy stuff.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 18:10:32	it is you're looking at. Otherwise you're just over thinking every damn thing without any answers. FUN.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 18:09:51	Sleeping so much at the moment. Really wish I knew what was going on with my brain. Insight is all very well and good if you know what......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 03:53:38	Oh well, 14 days until next pdoc appointment. Just keep it together enough to get there I suppose.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 03:51:16	I'm going to hazard a guess that it's due to me having a mixed/hypo episode as before that kicked off I had a predictable routine.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 03:50:36	My med mix seems to invoke a slightly different reaction every day. No idea when to take what for the "best" effect.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 03:24:27	@GoodmotherM Oh now he's better he's back to trying everyone's patience. He's a good cuddler though, so he gets away with it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 03:07:33	@GoodmotherM This is with a at least a months regrowth, his whole belly is naked. I promise I don't regularly snigger at him..........

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 02:26:08	I have done three loads of washing and finally loaded the dishwasher for the first time in days. Still feel a mixture of exhausted and hypo
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 02:10:53	Dave the cat is now eating like a pig. I think we can say he's probably pretty well recovered!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 00:09:05	Oh but Vodafone finally managed to process my pre-order properly, 3rd order and 4th "online chat". Painful experience #firstworldproblems
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-15 00:08:03	Excitement never ends. Got a new flavour of fabric softener and it's gorgeous.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 23:53:27	Quickly coming to the conclusion most fellow bipolar types and abuse survivors are crazy cat people. I'm okay with this.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 23:52:19	@rabbitsoup_zola This horrifies me beyond words. I hope you can keep yourself safe even though you're (allegedly) in a safe place.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 23:48:28	You know you're a grown up when you purchase step ladders. But I also ordered paint which means redecorating! Yay for rare cool landlords!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:49:28	I should be asleep. Meds haven't worked. Great.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:15:31	Dave is on spider watch. Sort of. Well, he's sleeping on the pink sheepskin rug near the last place spider was sighted. Useless really.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:14:21	@Ladybird_Donna Messed me up good and proper but I'm happy to note not everyone is affected like I have been. Always hope too.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:13:41	@Ladybird_Donna Yeah. Psychologist noted my insight and perspective was a very good masking tool. Until the breakdown!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:12:31	@Ladybird_Donna It's exactly what I use this account for, I have another one for when I'm perkier!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:11:07	@Ladybird_Donna It's okay, I'm sort of past looking for sympathy. Sort of resigned to being the family punch bag, not much surprises me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:08:56	So this being bipolar thing and being aware of it, bit of a mind fuck in itself isn't it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:08:10	@Ladybird_Donna We'll see how I go once I've had some therapy, in about 2 years, ha!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:07:46	@Ladybird_Donna Mum marrying him a year after I cut contact was a bit of a kick in the lady bits right enough.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:07:23	@Ladybird_Donna Jury still out on that one! At least I don't have to pretend to like the bastard any more or see any of them.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:01:43	@Ladybird_Donna It was terrifying, I just wanted the whole thing to go away. My brother brought the police to the door, not me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:01:11	@Ladybird_Donna I don't know how it's done now but my mother should not have been present during it and I should have been eased into it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 06:00:21	@Ladybird_Donna I came home from school and there in the lounge were the police waiting to interview me, no warning.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:58:06	@Ladybird_Donna From that point on, my life, which was already bleak, just became the thing that made me a very ill adult.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:57:17	@Ladybird_Donna It wasn't my choice. I disclosed to a friend when I was 11, she told her mum and it snowballed. I was nothing but mortified.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:55:48	@Ladybird_Donna I try to be fairly philosophical about it, jury's are in a horrible, difficult position in these cases.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:55:10	@Ladybird_Donna Which is exactly what prolific abusers are banking on, your word against there's. It's bloody hard.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:54:35	@Ladybird_Donna I blogged about it when one of the big cases was a not guilty verdict. It means nothing apart from not enough evidence.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:53:52	@Ladybird_Donna Yeah, been there, done that, all I got for my trouble was villified and mentally ill for life. Cheers justice system!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:52:30	@Ladybird_Donna It's classic abuser manipulation. To make sure if accusations are made people would think it ludicrous.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:51:45	@Ladybird_Donna I'd also enjoy it if it made the papers and they got just a tiny taste how fucked my life is because of them.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:51:07	@Ladybird_Donna So yeah, I'd like to get to a place where I can essentially say "fuck you, you dirty scum".
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:49:55	@Ladybird_Donna Honestly, I'd love to have my day in court, a father and two sons used me, on top of all the other trauma.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:48:23	@Ladybird_Donna Oh but he's so nice and does XYZ for XYZ. Or similar. My abuser is a sleazy bastard, only my family don't seem to notice.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:46:30	I tried to shoo it out my front door but instead it ran directly into my BEDROOM. Never sleeping now, meds or no meds.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:45:44	Giant fucking spider alert! A perk of my flat is that it NEVER gets spiders. Until now. AND IT'S huge and my cats are hopeless.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:22:53	So #WhyIDidntReport yet is to save myself until I am strong enough to report. It rips you apart.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:21:47	@Ladybird_Donna Have to wait until I can cope with the process. I don't want to be another victim who commits suicide during proceedings.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:21:07	@Ladybird_Donna I have more to report and want to re-report but as you say, not even mental health support for me to do it now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 05:20:42	@Ladybird_Donna It's the culture of victim blaming and shaming, it's just too much for people to wrap their head around.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 04:56:24	You know what puzzles me? How did I NEVER notice just hoe mental I am!? I mean, these last few weeks especially, I am BONKERS. #bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 04:50:03	So I guess I'm still having a mixed episode then! Easily irritable that I am! Marvellous.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 04:47:27	Facebook distress call was summarily ignored. I'm not blaming anyone but clearly that option isn't a viable one, I need another plan.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 04:46:51	it isn't an option either. I have to at least have a vague idea what I'd do if I was in crisis. I was on the brink recently and my......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 04:46:12	and out of hours help being a major one. I don't have a bloody panic button even if I was aware enough to press it! Not thinking about....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 04:45:29	It's narked me off that. You're making comment on the basis of mental health services years ago. A lot has changed, access to services....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 04:25:55	That's great but it doesn't make me feel any better that I have the potential to be so ill I'd need out of hours A&E care.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 04:25:17	Oh my mum, brother, dog were admitted to hospital several times for depression, they just got their GP to find them a bed within 6 hours.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-14 04:24:03	When I express anxiety about my illness and potential A&E submissions, don't diminish that fear by saying it hardly happens.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-13 23:50:12	Having such paint choice dilemmas. It's so long since I lived somewhere I could decorate I'm doubting myself! Paint patches everywhere!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-13 17:26:10	But my lounge walls resemble a patchwork quilt because I'm going to be redecorating! Yay! Introducing some yummy, muted but vibrant colour.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-13 17:25:28	Morning! Bloody knackered, still haven't woken up even though I've been up for a couple of hours. Hate that feeling.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-13 04:14:58	Starting to stress about seeing a new pdoc. Absolutely no idea what to expect and I won't have my usual supportive friend with me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-13 04:13:23	@Ladybird_Donna @rabbitsoup_zola Whoop whoop!!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-13 04:13:07	@rabbitsoup_zola @Ladybird_Donna And then, at least in my case, after opening those wounds, after a year, kicked out to fend for yourself!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-13 04:10:57	Excuse the swearing but back hurts like a bitch today. Don't be a gymnast in the 80s kids and be hypermobile = world of pain in 2014.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-13 03:59:03	I honestly don't know how to monitor my MH right now. No idea what is me and what is illness and if the medication is doing anything!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-13 01:22:56	I think both myself and friend deserve a medal for leaving Ikea sans Daim in any shape or form #willpower We both lingered by the bags!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-13 00:58:48	I am so ready for bed today. Ikea trip, being a bit sociable, multiple communications with Vodafone, pooped. Is it bedtime yet? #spoonie
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 23:17:43	Nice balls up there this morning @VodafoneUK Placed my order but not really, ordered again this afternoon, still no email #notimpressed
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 16:29:41	I MAY have done a cheeky pre-order. Because I'm a sheep and love a fruity gadget. 3 years since my last upgrade though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 06:07:56	#TBThursday to my blog post about my #PIP experience. My safety never seemed a consideration. I won in the end though http:// attentionseekingsurvivor.wordpress.com/2014/03/14/goi ng-on-the-sick-is-easy-pip-part-one/ …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 05:08:39	So today was quite productive again. So I've no idea what's going on. Mood stable? Bit hypo? Mixed? Who feckin' knows!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 02:25:31	@LouiseMensch @IanMcFadyen1966 Politicising abuse abuse? Really? Is that what survivors are worth to you? Tacky and disgusting.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:58:24	Just saw new Eastenders trailer (I don't watch it). Cheerful as ever eh!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:55:52	@sherbetlemon1 @johnghughes3 @DrBellyButton @Ladybird_Donna I tried to keep going for 20 years. Look where that got me! Barely functioning.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:54:36	@sherbetlemon1 @johnghughes3 @DrBellyButton @Ladybird_Donna I'm with Croydon MAP East, so far so good but I'm still quite new.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:53:31	@sherbetlemon1 @johnghughes3 @DrBellyButton @Ladybird_Donna Perhaps I'd be able to live better now had I been treated first time I asked.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:52:56	@sherbetlemon1 @johnghughes3 @DrBellyButton @Ladybird_Donna I was let down for a long time though, fobbed off by GPs when mentioning MH.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:52:01	@sherbetlemon1 @johnghughes3 @DrBellyButton @Ladybird_Donna You don't sound unreasonable. We don't stop treating cancer!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:48:53	@sherbetlemon1 @johnghughes3 @DrBellyButton @Ladybird_Donna Again, good GP kept me afloat whilst waiting 6 months to see pdoc.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:48:03	@sherbetlemon1 @johnghughes3 @DrBellyButton @Ladybird_Donna I'm seeing pdoc but will wait 2 years total for time limited psychotherapy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:28:27	@johnghughes3 @DrBellyButton @Ladybird_Donna @sherbetlemon1 I never want to move, have heard those with MH issues get physical ignored.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:09:52	@Ladybird_Donna @sherbetlemon1 @DrBellyButton @johnghughes3 It would be nice. More lateral thinking needed in sensitive case.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:09:10	@johnghughes3 @Ladybird_Donna @sherbetlemon1 @DrBellyButton That's MH services all over. No joined up thinking.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:07:10	Finally vacuumed! That brings this exciting series of tweets to a climactic end!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:04:53	@Ladybird_Donna @sherbetlemon1 @DrBellyButton @johnghughes3 If they don't already (I have only seen one once).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 01:04:39	@Ladybird_Donna @sherbetlemon1 @DrBellyButton @johnghughes3 Could it be integrated with MH care in some cases? Perhaps CPNs could do it?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 00:15:51	Follow up on exciting vacuuming tweet earlier. Still haven't done it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 00:11:24	@Ladybird_Donna I think, if you have a good relationship with your GP, you should be able to request they do the smear. Lower anxiety.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 00:09:37	@sherbetlemon1 @Ladybird_Donna @DrBellyButton @johnghughes3 Sensitive and never pushes me on any issue. ALL GPs should have a standard.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-12 00:08:57	@sherbetlemon1 @Ladybird_Donna @DrBellyButton @johnghughes3 This makes me so relieved I have a brilliant, understanding female GP.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 23:12:00	I'm also trying to resist buying new (to me) clothes until I have lost a certain target amount, medication weight be gone!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 23:11:10	I have managed to lose 8lbs in about a month. A good start, particularly when on quetiapine by all accounts. Trick is keeping it up!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 20:01:10	I've gotten up to vacuum several times now. Still haven't even got the vacuum out. Today, not so productive.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 18:52:39	Morning! Actually feeling a bit chipper today. Lovely beauty products in the post, blogging on my other neglected blog, lovely stuff!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 04:19:36	I have three cats. By the amount of hair that appears between vacuuming you'd think I have twenty. #catladyproblems
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 04:16:22	@sherbetlemon1 @Ladybird_Donna For some of us, families will never be what we need. And that's okay and we're not alone in that.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 04:13:27	@sherbetlemon1 @Ladybird_Donna So true. When you're feeling more on top of things, have a gander at my blog, you'll see how alike we are.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 04:11:04	@Ladybird_Donna Have hope, it's the most powerful thing to keep you picking yourself up again.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 04:10:48	@Ladybird_Donna Have stuck with me being a complete failure at life and keep encouraging me on. We'll all get somewhere some day,
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 04:10:13	@Ladybird_Donna I still spend Christmas alone, it's just easier than being with other happy families but my friends are amazing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 04:09:43	@Ladybird_Donna I've come to terms with it enough to not think about it all the time. You'll find friends. I only have a few very close.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 04:08:34	Mild anxiety attack putting the rubbish out (just goes on street), every time. It's infuriating, no need for it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 03:38:12	@sherbetlemon1 @Ladybird_Donna Brother was physically abusive to me and mum. I was abused by her partner and his sons. Perfect family!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 03:37:48	@sherbetlemon1 @Ladybird_Donna I've never completed anything due to lifelong mental health problems. Dad committed suicide when I was 12.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 03:37:11	@sherbetlemon1 @Ladybird_Donna My mum likes to wax lyrical about other peoples parenting. Brother, been a drug addict and in prison.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 03:02:13	@sherbetlemon1 @Ladybird_Donna Not big on confronting the truth my family. I had a marvellous childhood. Ha!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 03:01:46	@sherbetlemon1 @Ladybird_Donna I did have some spies in my camp, possibly still do so they may know how ill I am, or they may dismiss it too
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 02:46:56	Seeing someone who has been let down by their family the same way I was makes me incredibly sad. So many survivors let down.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 02:45:08	@Ladybird_Donna Me too! I was about 28 when I cut contact. 4 years ago now. Spent all of my teens and most of my 20s acting.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 02:43:30	@Ladybird_Donna My friends are now my family but I still need a lot of help to deal with a family that doesn't care and brands me a liar.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 02:43:01	@Ladybird_Donna It was my choice but it still hurts. I haven't dealt with it. A year after I walked she married my abuser.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 02:42:26	@Ladybird_Donna You just keep going. I tried to talk to my mum a few times over the years, never with the result I wanted. So I walked away.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 02:33:38	Or have I just ignored all the symptoms before because I didn't know I was having "symptoms". Gee mental illness is FUN!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 02:32:53	Either way it was an absolute scary bitch. I don't remember anything else like it before. Which is odd. Like a diagnosis triggered it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 02:31:34	I now think what I had last week was a mixed episode, not purely hypo. I was miserable, over slept but also really antsy and productive.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 02:07:06	You know when you were going to go to a website or Google but completely forget what it was? All the damn time!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 01:38:02	@BipolarBlogger If you work it out, let me know.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 00:21:26	Excuse me while I use that as an excuse to do some online browsing........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 00:21:01	We'll just skim over the part where I bought myself three things and didn't get what I actually went out for.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 00:20:19	Meter readings taken and entered online, bedlinen changed, tidy round the lounge a bit and trip to local shops. Productive day for me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-11 00:05:25	@VodafoneUK I'd like to pre-order the iPhone6 (when available). Am currently on a sim only contract with you, how can I go about it please!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-10 20:54:28	@TattooedTeaLady Ha, just done the opposite with a pro brand splurge! All the fancy make-up and brushes!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-10 18:57:27	Went out to buy a gift for someone. Came home with a vintage coffee set and pin dish for myself. Oops.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-09 22:44:09	In better news. I think my hypo has passed for the most part, thank goodness. Felt scarily out of control the other night #bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-09 22:40:46	Was thinking about saving for a cheap run around. Did some test car insurance quotes, when did it get so expensive!?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-09 06:44:16	This is what said feral thinks of the whole situation. Betty the very cute and not so feral anymore feral. pic.twitter.com/aBTkmd3VhG
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-09 06:42:11	I did not install detressing plug-ins before getting a new, not get underable bed. Betty not happy. Peed on my duvet. I love her but argh!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-09 06:40:57	If you share your home with a feral, be prepared for lots of washing when you forget how stressed change makes them. Sort of like me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-09 06:36:24	*Tentative* I think the hypo may be passing. Last night was a bit scary and I felt awful. I'm a rapid cycler so more soon no doubt! #bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-09 04:40:05	A lifestyle like so many on #copsandrobbers is a bullet I somehow dodged. Got hit with different, less criminal ones instead.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-09 04:10:01	The thought of it though makes me feel sick. The emotional exposure and the fear of rejection again is terrifying.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-09 04:09:22	Been thinking about when I'll go to the police. I know I have to, to try to push for what was already reported and to report what I didn't.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-09 01:15:51	SO perplexed. Sometimes Twitter throws you an unexplained curve ball!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 23:59:56	I'd really like to take a break from myself. Fed up today.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 21:15:13	Attempts at weight loss when on quetiapine are pretty easily scuppered. Food issues plus appetite stimulant = uphill struggle.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 16:28:03	@Ladybird_Donna @BipolarBlogger I think there's a lot of us out there, I hope most get the help they need eventually.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 07:39:11	All three cats in the bedroom right now. Adjustment to new bedroom furniture and layout complete and I feel loved. Just not sleepy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 07:02:49	Dum de dum *twiddles thumbs* Seriously, never been this awake after sleep meds, bit scary.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 06:33:18	Sleeping tablets not having the desired effect. STOP! Can I get off the merry-go-round now!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 06:26:22	So my over active hypo brain is now wondering what will happen with my meds at next pdoc appointment, new pdoc too, so another anxiety.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 05:48:06	What happened to my abuser? My mother married him a year after I cut all ties with my family. Abuser nit victim protected to this day.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 05:46:35	@Ladybird_Donna @BipolarBlogger Bingo! Exactly my experience.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 05:30:30	Some days I really miss having family, even though they epically fucked me up and don't deserve me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 05:05:22	Usually the noise from my local pub on live music nights us annoying. Tonight I wish was there! Hello hypo! #bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 03:58:14	@Smitchalot I completely allow myself to be sucked in. I also aspire to get just famous enough to go on! #StrictlyComeDancing
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 03:27:46	@jessieannen @AnxietyUK Yep, my first major anxiety attack I mistook for an asthma attack. Even paramedics didn't identify it as anxiety.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 03:22:28	@jessieannen @AnxietyUK It's basically my main anxiety symptoms. So frustrating and I've had to learn to know when it's anxiety vs asthma.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 01:34:29	Such a blah sort of a day. Don't know what to do with myself at the moment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 00:36:07	Chilli now trying out the new bed. Pretty successful given cats are prone to ignoring things for them. pic.twitter.com/VMzoGoK5Jb
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 00:02:50	My thoughts are all over the show today. Wondering if my abuser abused anyone else being one predominant thought. Makes me feel sick.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-08 00:01:12	Smells of the posh candle shop (Milkhouse Candles) wafting through my window, must nip in and get more, they're divine!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 23:19:40	What a difference a non-saggy bed frame makes. Sciatica and back ache in general feeling much better after a few days in the new bed.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 22:00:48	Finding it increasingly hard not to just spend all my time in bed again. Is the black dog creeping up now after the hypo? Still learning.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 20:27:44	I also do not see how the #CSAinquiry can truly be thorough without survivor guidance within the panel.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 20:25:54	#CSAinquiry omnishambles is just another failure carried out by the Tory government. They'd all be sacked by now in private sector!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 19:34:15	The lurgy seems to be buggering off rather swiftly, good stuff! Sleep wasn't so great last night though. Can't ever have it all!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 18:44:43	Dace enjoying the new Hello Kitty cat bed. It was intended for Betty but that's cats for you! pic.twitter.com/6a6ROUOQoD
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 09:42:46	Oh and now I have the hiccups. For heavens sake! Throw in the infuriating inner ear itch and I'm having myself a partay!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 09:38:40	So frustrating, I really really like sleeping and used to be a tip top sleeper. Now I can't do it without medication.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 09:37:18	Managed a whole hour of sleep without sleeping pills. Suddenly sleep is the enemy again. Even when medicated it's no longer quality sleep.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 09:36:10	Is it really so difficult to run a few Google searches before appointing head of #CSAinquiry Theresa May? Just a little due diligence?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 06:48:03	Living life on the edge, haven't taken my "as needed" sleeping tablets tonight. Wide awake. Sleeping fail.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 06:35:45	There won't be an enquiry for me and who knows how many more, let's make those that do happen count #CSAInquiry
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 05:58:00	Have been intending to request my social services records for a few years. Don't know if I'm equipped to deal with what they might contain.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 05:44:23	@shazzers14 @glassyhalffull @RandolphTrent @SimonDanczuk @timloughton All on my blog. I walked away from my family, believed me a liar.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 05:42:53	My childish view of the #indyref is the excitement of potentially having dual nationality. The frivolity of not having a vote.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 05:39:54	@shazzers14 @glassyhalffull @RandolphTrent @SimonDanczuk @timloughton Depends on your view of my history really!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 05:26:10	@shazzers14 @glassyhalffull @RandolphTrent @SimonDanczuk @timloughton Dear old Tim would get on well with my family I suspect......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 05:24:45	You know, if Scotland says yes I could be tempted back, particularly if next UK government doesn't buck up their ideas #indyref
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 04:20:53	I also still have the novelty of having a new bed which I'm totally in love with too. Any excuse to go and lie in it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 04:20:23	Being conventionally poorly allows me to slope off to bed as early as I like with no judgement, not even from myself. Woohoo!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 03:21:44	Back in the blogging saddle - Mental Illness and Physical Symptoms http:// wp.me/p3OsRg-3b #blogger #mentalillness
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 03:17:24	I swear, if this cold is turning into a chest infection I will have a tantrum. Like a 3 year old told no to a bar of chocolate at the shops.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-07 00:35:27	@BipolarBlogger Thanks for posting this, it explains why I have been having a hypo despite being on mood stabilising medication. Makes sense
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-06 23:42:08	Mental Illness and Physical Symptoms http:// wp.me/p3OsRg-3b
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-06 23:32:44	@Inspired_Lives Ooh lovely, thanks! I have had some awesome snuggles with the boy cat today. He's a grade A cuddler.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-06 23:29:29	Even at the depths of my depressive episodes I'm not as much of a martyred woe is me as when I have a cold.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-06 23:28:31	I am terrible at being virally sick. Well, terrible at being sick full stop but I'm particularly pathetic with sore throat and head.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-06 06:17:13	Throw in the sciatica triggered by all the stuff I've done while hypo and I'm having a great time with myself and my bipolar! #sarcasm
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-06 06:16:30	So I'm still a bit on the hypo side but it's tempered by having the lurgy, which is quite an odd experience. I'm exhausted but agitated.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-06 05:37:53	There will never be an enquiry into my abuse, the very least I expect for others who are subject to one for it to be fairly overseen.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-06 05:34:18	@timloughton @IanMcFadyen1966 Perhaps what we want is to know the truth will actually out and not a carefully edited version thereof.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-06 05:08:52	Carrie Fisher on @TheLastLeg Best thing ever.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-04 03:49:16	Rotherham must be the tip of the iceberg. I too had horrific experiences with dismissive police and social services and I was in Scotland!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-04 03:48:09	Just restarted my modem because Facebook is down and didn't realise. Damn you Facebook, lost precious internet seconds!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-03 05:53:16	Oh! But I did get my first #pinkparcel today. Was a bit sceptical but I think it's the best monthly box available at such a good price!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-03 05:51:17	Downside to my #hypomania is ignoring my sciatica so now walking is painful. Love my old dancers' injuries, they're a hoot!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-03 05:30:47	On the plus, my bedroom is looking lovely! #bipolar #hypomania
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-03 05:30:05	Now I know sudden productivity is a hypo I realise all kinds of things. One being getting to sleep is a pain in the arse, even with tablets.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-02 23:25:13	Having my first self identifiable hypo. Interesting, sort of. Guess I'm not so stable after all! #bipolar Still, bedroom is nice and clean.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-02 19:16:57	@Sectioned_ Could you fire the link over to me please?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-02 19:16:45	@Sectioned_ Ah the old memory functions sometimes! I have a friend teaching in a residential youth unit, wants to broaden her knowledge.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-09-02 19:12:19	Someone posted recently about mental health courses available and a link. Can't remember who it was! @Sectioned_ was it you?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-30 04:05:17	That Glyn on GBBO Extra Slice looks like my previous psychiatrist #weirdclaimtofame
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-29 04:54:35	Psycho nurse appointment tomorrow in lieu of a psychiatrist. Well done Croydon council, great continuity of care for newly diagnosed bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-28 22:14:57	I also have a larger wardrobe coming. Which means I need to clear out and get rid of the old one. Freecycle has failed me thus far.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-28 22:13:53	Cats will be miffed though, it's an ottoman affair (not faux leather, ew, upholstered) which means they can't hide underneath.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-28 22:12:56	Finally had my ESA decision and all is good. So I have been able to order a new bed! Long overdue.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-28 04:00:24	Honestly miffed at #GBBO Poor bloke was screwed over and he gets the boot whilst being a complete gentleman. Oh the controversy!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-26 18:06:31	Where has all the tired come from?! Doing nothing but sleep or fight tiredness at the moment. Yaawwwnnn.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-26 02:02:39	Just brought myself back from the edge of an asthma attack. Thankfully no evening in A&E after all, phew!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-25 03:03:30	It was the first time I had ever taken time off any job due to stress, I didn't even get a doctors appointment before they let me go.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-25 03:02:49	I was sacked two years before any diagnosis because I was under too much stress and couldn't cop. Don't tell me there's no stigma!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-24 04:44:24	Dave is doing better which means he wants cuddles again but he's still snotty. So I end up getting covered in cat snot far too much!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-24 04:16:59	Doctor Who? Nope, all about the beautiful Bitter Harvest on #GotToDance The maturity and technique were just dreamy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-23 06:06:52	Drugs and a cheeky wee sherry are kicking in, off to sleep I medically induced go! See you in the morning!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-23 05:35:22	The joy of mental health services in the UK. Everyone agrees I'm fucked but sorry, no help for you for two years! Here, have some drugs.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-23 05:34:36	Hmm, feeling angry. I know the psychologist would like me to find my anger but perhaps not with no way to deal with it or direct it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-23 05:31:43	Insomnia back with a vengeance, having to take my sleepers every night rather than every few days. Urgh. Reminder this is forever #Bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-23 02:18:22	You know Croydon Council, I'd rather you managed to collect my rubbish on the right day than get your newsletters!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-23 01:32:14	I also got my copy of psychologists assessment. Not sure how I feel about it. Not that anything will be happening for 18 months anyway!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-23 01:28:42	But only seeing nurse because my pdoc's position was done away with and I have to wait to be moved to someone else. Limbo.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-23 01:27:50	I haven't admitted this outside of this account so far, I don't know what to do with it being newly diagnosed. Seeing psych nurse next week.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-23 01:26:59	I think I'm teetering on the edge of a depressive episode. Two months of focus elsewhere is taking its toll, crashing and burning #Bipolar
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-23 01:24:57	@drinksinthedark I have faced similar, I only own vintage/reproduction clothing so I ALWAYS look put together. So many assumptions made.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-22 18:50:21	Two months of constant worry, nearly losing him, concurrent illnesses and guilt that it was my fault (it wasn't but, you know).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-22 18:49:03	Dave cat is coming out the other side of his flu type bug, hopefully that's it on the illness front for a very long time.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-21 21:38:14	Meanwhile, my #anxiety is off the charts, breathing is terrible. Mostly trying to ignore it for vet visits and supermarket trips.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-21 21:37:22	Dave cat is still sick. We had a few days respite then he came down with some sort of flu type thing. Poor boy, miserable again!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-17 04:13:19	I didn't enjoy dating before I admitted I was unwell. Now it just seems like an awful nightmare for all involved!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-17 04:12:01	Now I'm sort of middling I do wonder about disclosure when dating. "Hi, I'm bipolar II and I don't want children, how goes it?" #daunting
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-16 23:23:05	Dave is my cuddly shadow and as much as I don't appreciate the 6am wake up calls it's beyond lovely to have him back.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-16 23:22:08	Two months, two hospital stays, about 8 insurance claims, liver disease, pancreatitis, feeding tube and the rest we are finally winning!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-16 23:20:58	Neglecting everything more than usual, Twitter, blog, housework but all for a good reason. Dave the cat is finally doing brilliantly.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-15 00:04:50	So, Dance Moms is hideous television..........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-12 20:34:16	In happier news today, my Dave the cat is coming home tonight, too excited, he leaves such a naughty, snuggly gap when not at home.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-12 18:57:50	Nanu nanu Robin. Thank you for all you gave us.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-12 17:04:20	I had a horrific suicidal dream last night, then I woke up to the news about Robin Williams. Today is a little less bright than yesterday.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-11 20:25:09	@Smitchalot I've met a few. I don't understand them. Cheese is a major tasty food group!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-11 20:14:31	Monthly call to Atos to see if they've shuffled my application about a bit yet. Nope. 8.5 months since I applied. Magnificently efficient!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-11 20:12:46	@Smitchalot It's not because it's off, it smells like that naturally, good cheese is smelly cheese!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-11 20:07:48	@Smitchalot Presently my fridge is full of cheese that makes it smell like something dies in there. Wonder what that says about me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-10 05:49:27	Yep, fed up with being me today. Let's hope tomorrow is better.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-10 04:36:32	I feel shit. Cat has been readmitted to hospital and I feel like it's my fault. He was so sad when I left him, I hope he's okay.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-08 22:19:57	Happy #WorldCatDay Please send healing thoughts to my boy who is having a rough time trying to recover from Hepatic Lipidosis. #DavetheCat
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-06 05:10:09	@drinksinthedark I don't know what I think about it all really!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-06 05:09:52	@drinksinthedark My best friend helped with diagnosis, identifying behaviour patterns with my pdoc. It's still quite fresh..
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-06 05:08:41	@drinksinthedark A good friend said I can't have it because she knows a girl with it who is really annoying and I'm not annoying. We laughed
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-06 04:15:49	@drinksinthedark I had the opposite. My friends were in bigger denial than me, I've covered it so well for so long!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-06 04:11:32	And forget the myths there's no plus size, there is. Harder to find but I have a lot of vintage at good prices that I feel great in.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-06 04:10:29	Bagging awesome vintage will never get old. So much better than mass produced high street shopping! Good for my soul.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-05 20:28:00	Really not in the mood to be leaving the flat. I will because it's for my boy but urgh. Let me be a hermit for a few days, I need it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-05 20:27:10	I felt completely awake all day yesterday, it was lovely. Back to sleepy today and I have to go back to the vet as a test failed yesterday.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-05 01:53:30	I have to say, I think I do a better job of dressing Dave's neck tube than the vet nurse did this morning!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-03 02:39:14	Dishwasher on its second load, no leaking and shiny clean dishes! I don't feel like such a lazy dirty pig already. Good investment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-03 01:53:19	Finding images of celeb child abusers more and more distressing to me. Is this a manifestation of #PTSD ? Do I need to now avoid all press?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 21:36:02	Dave ate proper food! Amazing what a sprinkle of Thrive treats can do, no lunch time tube feed required today! #smug
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 20:17:37	Okay, I think I have succeeded with the plumbing, now to wait for the dishwasher arrive and see if I flood place on first use!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 20:16:54	@Lala_Brownie He's still being tube fed though as not interested one bit in food. So I'm doubly knackered but he's worth it :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 20:16:09	@Lala_Brownie A website called Project Free TV or some such, I just consulted Google. Maybe. Or maybe not depending who's watching my Tweets
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 18:58:37	Just fitted a valve under my kitchen sink for the new dishwasher. No idea if I've done it correctly! #DIY #plumbing
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 03:18:54	I'll no longer have to decide whether I can be bothered to clean the kitchen then enough energy left to cook. Amazing difference.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 03:17:55	It seems a frivolous luxury to most but to me it will be an immense stress reliever and improve my eating habits a bit.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 03:16:55	Ordered my first "disability aid" today. A tabletop dishwasher. Really struggle keeping on top of the kitchen since I became ill.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 01:56:13	I'm going crazy and going to have a second Crabbies. Wheels have come off since drinking has been sanctioned by pdoc!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 01:47:49	My sick notes over the last year or so show the evolution of my illness and diagnosis. From depression to bipolar 2 #mentalillness
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 01:41:51	@strongest_smile I ay have indulged in a nana nap yesterday AND today. Nursing a cat is apparently exhausting!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 00:17:59	@Lala_Brownie I may have already watched it online...........I'll give you no spoilers! Dave is getting there and is at home at least :)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-02 00:07:50	Ok, I'm no nurse when it comes to changing dressings but not a dreadful effort. Sorry Dave! You behaved impeccably while I did it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-01 18:47:09	I thought I couldn't be more tired yesterday. I was wrong, today trumps yesterday in spectacular style!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-08-01 01:33:27	That's it, left to run free while I wait to make it onto a new pdoc's list because they ended my current ones contract. Could be interesting
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-31 01:26:37	New respect for anyone who tube feeds any human or animal. Constant rounds of prep, feed, wash, repeat!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-30 21:37:30	Tutor approval for one day a week costume course, yay! Slowly slowly trying to rebuild some sort of life within my new limitations.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-30 20:32:32	Yep, ridiculously tired today after a full on day yesterday. Being mental is exhausting! #spoonie
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-30 19:21:33	Tomorrow is my last appointment with current pdoc, then I have to wait however long to be transferred to new one. Great continuity of care.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-30 19:20:49	Oreo ice cream cookies? Yes.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-30 01:56:11	Well done that ladieswear buyer, I shared with novelty print loving friends who will be hunting it down too! High praise indeed #vintagesnob
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-30 01:55:11	As well as getting my cat home today, I found a stonker of a dress in a very good rip off of a vintage novetly print from Sainsburys!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-30 01:37:18	I am absolutely knackered but for the best reasons. Today my boy cat Dave came home from hospital, treatment to continue at home. #sohappy
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-28 19:04:21	So excited, my boy is coming home this week! Lovely vet as excited as I am, well done Dave for being such a little fighter.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-28 03:01:06	Good Dave cat related news. He ate a little today independently, big progress. And he's generally being the happy chappy he was! #goodnews
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-28 02:43:54	Subscribed to two monthly boxes recently and been trying other goodies, should start the other blog back up. Been saying that for weeks.....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-27 23:13:39	This makes me marvel at how I even kept going for 6 months of full on full-time uni and part-time job whilst ill. No wonder I got so sick!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-27 23:12:35	But the sleep made me feel a bit perky. So supermarket trip, cleaned kitchen and cooked all day breakfast. Exhausted again. Yaaawwwnnn.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-27 23:11:31	Massive sleep, as I seem to need every few days now due to meds and general mental exhaustion I permanently have now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-26 23:33:51	Considering a one day a week costume course. Worried it's too soon but also want to capitalise on positive place I'm in right now #decisions
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-26 21:51:10	Dave cat continues to be the favourite in hospital as every vet and student vet makes a point of having cuddles with him. Such a tart.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-26 21:47:37	Judge allegedly falls asleep during child rape trial http:// gu.com/p/4v9ey/tw via @guardian This beyond dreadful. Duty of care?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-26 03:19:40	Argh, medication munchies, trying to resist ordering some dirty food. Willpower is not one of my virtues.........

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-26 00:27:27	@Hollz2012 Technically she wasn't last, she was 16th in the top 16, there were more gymnasts who didn't qualify for the final. She did well!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-25 23:52:25	Second weekend without my boy, miss him like crazy, hope he's home from hospital soon. pic.twitter.com/DxiIwdPoHy
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-25 23:30:17	@TwerkLikeABitch Dreadfully juvenile unimaginative and repetitive insults in a pathetic attempt to upset. You have been reported.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-25 23:21:05	When the artistic gymnastics start I'll bitch about how it's lost so much of the grace of its heyday (myday).
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-25 23:20:19	I really dislike the pirouette prep in rhythmic gym, makes the ex-dancer and (artistic) gymnastic in me twitch.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-25 03:23:01	Psychiatry/psychology dynamic is interesting. I did feel in my assessments with psychologist she ignored pdoc diagnosis.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-25 03:20:19	I won't lie though, it will be nice not to have to go an appointment for a couple of months and concentrate on doing some "normal" things.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-25 03:19:32	Then I'm abandoned for an indefinite amount of time again as my pdoc's contract has ended, need to wait for transfer appointment.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-25 03:18:46	However, I'm generally tolerating it better as long as I can sleep enough to alleviate sedation. Final dose increase next week.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-25 03:17:50	Appointment time meant I had to get up with an alarm. My medicated body hasn't enjoyed that, extra tired all day #quetipiane
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-25 03:16:48	Final psychotherapy assessment session today. I got there on my own, massive achievement. Now the 18 month wait begins. #bipolar #therapy
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-25 03:15:29	I've been quiet Twitter. I'm actually doing really well but am totally distracted by boy cat being in hospital. He seems on the mend.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-23 18:40:01	Good news about boy cat, lovely weather, medication apparently working......I'm feeling rather chipper today!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-21 04:55:42	Some #selfcare for this evening, a little Hello Kitty manicure. pic.twitter.com/kEDztE5ugW
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-21 02:55:23	@drinksinthedark Always. Just started doing mine again after quite a depression break. Think leopard print is next!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-20 01:49:54	Boy cat is in Royal Vet School. Has hepatic lipidosis. Nasal feeding tube in today, seems to finally be improving. Missing him too much.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-20 01:36:27	@lauramaywritten @FionaArt @mentalparent @nvrbnormlagn @TimetoChange @BipolarBlogger @littlejohn83 What great company I'm in, thanks!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-17 16:43:39	@Lala_Brownie Liver disease of some sort, more investigations today. He's so poorly and miserable and I miss him so much.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-17 03:48:20	My baby boy is so sick he went to the Royal Vet School as an emergency today. I'm heartbroken beyond words.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-15 18:34:39	Would you look at that, inflation up. Not like they're burying that news under the cabinet reshuffle hooha. Nope, Tories never do that......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-15 01:38:47	Boy cat has been admitted. I'm inconsolable. Could be his liver which is bad news. Honestly don't know how I'd cope if I lost him.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 22:43:25	I have to get a bus to the vets, I hate public transport, especially buses, last time was horrible. Good job I love that furry boy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 21:49:35	Two weeks since boy cat spent a chunk of my rent at the vet and he's still unwell. Back we go to try and solve the mystery. So worried.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 04:44:06	@BipolarBlogger I'm managing it so far but only a couple of weeks in. Mirtazapine made me proper fat, I need no more!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 04:30:33	@BipolarBlogger see it as similar. Can live without any munchies from either though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 04:30:02	@BipolarBlogger Interesting. I do have weird body chemistry though. I have heavy limbs and eyelids, slowed motor function. That's where
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 04:25:29	@BipolarBlogger I find when I take it in the evening some of it feels like that. I take XR so may be different for staggered dose.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 04:21:08	28 month wait for therapy, when I get to top, time limited to one year. Psychotherapist admitted it won't be enough #AreWeWellYet
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 04:09:47	In case you're wondering, quetiapine is a bit like being a bit stoned. So I've heard......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 04:05:04	You have one banana with one brown spot and suddenly you're besieged by a million fruit flies overnight.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 03:44:25	Abuse and neglect robbed me of my family, mental illness of myself and friends, all of it of uni and work and a "normal" life #AreWeWellYet
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 03:36:14	Just because I managed to go on holiday, doesn't mean I didn't spend 70% of time in hotel room and weeks recovering #AreWeWellYet
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 03:35:10	@w00shie @SamCandour Oh man, this all day long. Had several of these messages and lost friendships because of this. #AreWeWellYet
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 03:30:43	I am attacked almost monthly for being a scrounger, policy of welfare being linked to treatment would exacerbate the hate #AreWeWellYet
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 03:23:32	Psychotherapist admitted I am probably too clever and self-aware for DBT, I'd manipulate therapist. So same would go for CBT #AreWeWellYet
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 00:49:19	Each day at the moment is just a fight to stay awake all day. Then 10-12 hours sleep, 2 hours to wake up, fight sleep ad infinitum.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 00:01:22	@Smitchalot @MarkOneinFour @zzzedkat Once I've reached the 12 months talking therapy limit, discharged, whether ready or not. I'm bipolar II
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-14 00:00:40	@Smitchalot @MarkOneinFour @zzzedkat Psychotherapist has said what I will wait 18 months for (plus 10 mths) won't be enough, time limited.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-13 23:26:48	All day long this. pic.twitter.com/9DWOQJpsRV
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-13 21:10:34	I fancy running away to the countryside. Anyone got a cottage to rent me and a car to give me (so I can get out for essentials)? A dream.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-13 19:15:53	As if I don't get attacked enough for not working, now people have extra ammunition if I refuse "treatment" #backtowork Makes me so angry!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-13 19:08:57	Even if CBT did work for everyone, there's a long way to go before employers readily employ those with #mentalillness #backtowork
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-13 19:06:58	I'd love to get better, NHS hoop jumping make it an arduous task at best and then it's time limited. CBT won't work for me #backtowork
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-13 19:06:02	We'll just ignore the 18 months I'm going to wait for other therapies and my #bipolar2 diagnosis. CBT is a modern day miracle! #backtowork
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-13 19:05:11	Ah yes, what I need to get back to work is being forced into CBT under the terror of losing my income. That'll work. #backtowork
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-13 03:49:37	@Lala_Brownie So far as I can tell, she's been fed lies and exagerrations until she's so wound up she'll do a cowards dirty work.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-13 03:47:51	@Lala_Brownie Which one? Thus is someone who unblocked me on FB after two years just to wait for a chance to have a pop.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-13 00:43:09	@Lala_Brownie I'd say every month or so I face an attack somewhere for being a lazy scrounger, this week I'm also a scumbag.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-12 22:41:07	I might be slobbing about in my PJs but sometimes, nothing but a squirt of a favourite perfume will suffice #selfcare
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-12 02:30:43	Some of the people who have judged me most harshly are those who have also had a #mentalillness It's the wrong way round! #stigma
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-12 01:35:01	I think I've got the new med routine down now. So if Pdoc changes them on me next week I might have a little strop.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-11 04:10:39	@Lucylovesrain And everyone is an expert on #mh in a way no-one would be if I had a physical illness.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-11 04:09:39	@Lucylovesrain appear to hate me! Horrible existence.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-11 04:09:19	@Lucylovesrain It must be exhausting to carry so much hate for another human being around. I don't hate my mum and abusers as much as they..
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-11 04:08:22	@Lucylovesrain My mind boggles at middle aged women spreading lies and hate for what? Satisfaction of belittling someone. I couldn't do it.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-11 04:00:03	@Lucylovesrain They don't want their minds changed, if they did they'd read my blog and draw their own conclusions. Bitchy gossip is easier.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-11 03:50:55	There are some days when Dave would gleefully have me kiss his head all day while he purrs away, now HE is the attention seeker!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-11 03:42:05	@Lucylovesrain They are ignorant and sad in their own lives but it's still disgusting to direct such abuse at someone who is vulnerable.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-11 03:28:34	I'm not supposed to nap but I had to give in to the tiredness today. Med and emotional hangover just too much.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-11 03:26:29	@Lucylovesrain Because really I'm faking this whole thing just so I can scrounge off the state.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-10 19:46:06	Anyone else put off eating on grocery delivery day so you can pig out on what you've ordered as soon as it arrives?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-10 17:16:12	So "hungover" this morning from the quetiapine. Still stinging from being called a scrounging scumbag. But looking forward to food delivery!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-10 07:38:23	Strike that, I'm actually a scumbag. From someone who only knows what someone else has misinformed her with. #stigma #mentalhealth
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-10 04:52:43	Just got called a scrounger by someone who unblocked on Facebook just to wait for an opportunity to attack me. Aren't people lovely?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-10 03:47:30	Damn it! Forgot to add bleach to my online shop, too late to change now I think. Can't even remember everything shopping online!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-10 03:02:56	@Lala_Brownie Haha. My cats proffer lots of love thankfully, attention whores that they are. Given I was in denial for 20 years I'm only...

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-10 01:22:25	It's all just making me feel really fragile, like it's my life being directly reported. I feel very exposed for some reason.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-10 01:21:15	So emotional today, I think it's the massive escalation of abuse articles in the press. I don't read many, just the headlines are enough.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-10 01:12:24	@ZedTrafficker I certainly don't want to be on it but it's not like I've any other options. We certainly need whistleblowers!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-10 00:50:04	@ZedTrafficker @IanMcFadyen1966 @hackneybird I was responding to a tweet which said it wasn't abuse but rape. I know the correct term.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-10 00:45:25	@ZedTrafficker @IanMcFadyen1966 @hackneybird But some of us were never raped, however we were most definitely abused. Abuse is not only rape
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-09 21:54:30	The level of press child sex abuse is getting is emotionally exhausting. Obviously happy it's finally being confronted but it's very hard.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-09 21:38:20	@GuardianJessica @MarkOneinFour Sounds like an average day inside my head! This is why I read from a variety of news sources, broader view.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-09 17:38:45	Yep, still tired. Dose increase again clearly means increased sedation. Going to be a struggle to stay awake today.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-09 03:17:27	Great response to @IanMcFadyen1966 on @Channel4News All of us let down by the authorities, for me in the 90s, need brave voices.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-09 03:14:21	@Hayley_Barlow @RobertLustigMD @krishgm Well that's not in the least bit patronising.........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-09 02:26:47	Damn, I'm hungry but in eating no mans land because of way I need to time my meds for sleeping and eating.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 21:59:55	Today, I made it to the sofa. Go me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 20:59:06	Vacuumed. Knackered. Still got a bit of a headache too #sideeffects #spoonie
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 19:48:50	Must vacuum today. Must. But urgh. Housework and I have never been the greatest of friends I must admit.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 19:38:28	@Sectioned_ "Happy" is so subjective and vague. Surely the desired outcome should be dictated by the patient? I'd take "functioning" for now
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 19:33:46	Calls from "Unknown" are infuriating. I don't answer them so if they don't leave a message my anxiety kicks in to imagine the worst! Bah!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 04:39:25	@BipolarBlogger hasn't been renewed past August. So I have to see a new doctor and don't know if they will have the same approach.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 04:38:48	@BipolarBlogger In fairness to my doctor, he is very good and inclusive, knows I educate myself and final decision is mine but his contract
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 04:28:28	Being medicated is super fun times awesome! *I may have typed that with a sarcastic tone*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 04:27:50	side effect I am feeling. Much hungrier than usual and my efforts at self monitoring aren't great, given I have food issues too.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 04:26:49	tomorrow when I dose increase again. Think I'll switch to the other option offered anyway. I cannot put on any more weight and that's one...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 04:25:57	This does not bode well for good old "treatment resistant" me. Like I'm choosing to resist the medication helping me. See what happens....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 04:24:45	knocked me out beautifully and I had a long, much needed sleep. I am already on double that dose and it's hard to get to and stay asleep.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 04:23:52	My body's processing of medication is annoying. Only 6 days in to quetiapine and I'm already tolerating them very well. First night they....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 04:22:30	@BipolarBlogger Referred to myself as a lab rat at my last Pdoc appointment. "Here, try this, I don't know what else to do with you".
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 01:57:57	@Lala_Brownie Oh and every time I see Moomins on Achica I think of you!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 01:56:32	@Lala_Brownie Sounds like a plan to me. And yes, Japan is obviously somewhere I want to go, all the history, all the kitschy goodness.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 01:40:37	@Lala_Brownie I have a friend doing loads of Europe this summer, I'm very jealous. So much I'd like to see all the way to Scandinavia.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 01:36:57	@Lala_Brownie Oh and it can be hot and very humid if you go in their summer or cold and wintery in winter.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 01:35:53	@Lala_Brownie ..hit a Pacific Island too if it takes your fancy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 01:35:30	@Lala_Brownie Totally fine for a veggie but they do like their meat too. Lots to see and do even if not outdoorsy. Can always....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 01:34:33	@OwenJones84 I have spent two days and one blog entry livid and disheartened by the response. What hope for mere mortals who are abused?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 01:31:12	@Lala_Brownie Well, I lived in NZ, twice, so clearly biased but it's a lovely place. Lots of places I want to go though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 01:28:11	Yep, used all my spoons just staying awake today. What a difference a day makes huh? #spoonies
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 00:53:04	Bloat, tummy cramps and headache. Can today be over now please? It's hard enough keeping it together without anything wrong physically!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-08 00:32:09	@crimefish I was told off for generalising yesterday but it was, for once, a valid generalisation to make a good point in face of ignorance.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-07 23:42:43	Low level headache all day. Is it the tiredness from two good days and sedation from quetiapine? Either way, annoying!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-07 20:00:16	"Even pedophiles have standards" to quote many attacking Vanessa Feltz. How the fuck can that even be vaguely acceptable to say?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-07 19:29:26	I am so tired today, it's always surprising to me how my #mentalhealth impacts on me physically too. The trade off to having a "good" day.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-07 19:13:05	Feeling really tired today, my two days of relative perkiness over the weekend catching up with me I think.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-07 03:24:17	Still completely disgusted and disappointed at the shaming going on towards Vanessa Feltz. She reported and testified, there is no doubt.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-07 00:25:55	When lovely intelligent people blame victims of abuse who don't report it for the abuser continuing to abuse I despair. #victimblaming
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-06 22:16:23	Twitter is a bleak old place to be today. Misogyny and victim shaming running rampant.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-06 21:55:15	Disgusted by the reaction today. Sexual Abuse and Sexual Attraction #vanessafeltz #rolfharris #victimshaming http:// wp.me/p3OsRg-33

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-06 19:59:02	If this is the response she gets after he's been convicted of disgusting crimes, you can see why she never spoke up before #victimshaming
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-06 19:57:20	As for those using the Vanessa Feltz story to fat shame her? Shame on you, you're part of the problem in enabling such abuse #disgusted .
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-06 19:52:56	If people bothered to read beyond the headline, they'll know Vanessa Feltz reported to the police and was duly ignored. So much ignorance.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-06 18:13:44	There are worse ways to spend a Sunday morning than lying in bed surrounded by cats #crazycatlady
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-06 01:36:14	...the hundreds of bad days a lie. I can't just enjoy getting a few simple things done. I also now worry it's start of hypo. #bipolar2
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-06 01:34:36	Gosh #mentalillness is fun! Today I feel guilty because I'm not bone crushingly miserable and tired for once. Like one good day makes...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-06 01:19:31	Actually feel a little bit perky today, which is I guess one of two things. Either the meds are doing their job, or triggered a hypo!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-06 00:10:51	Well, you know a small tide is turning when Daily Fail comments slate current government! Let's hope it turns into a big tide!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-05 22:08:43	Managed to go to the supermarket and clean the kitchen. About to make something to eat. Pooped. Thanks new meds!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-05 19:50:25	I'd like to be able to assess whether I feel any different 3 days into anti-ps but I'm not sure what they're supposed to do!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-05 05:56:28	I should be well into my 12 hour new med induced sleep. Instead I'm fighting it with a Ru Paul marathon. Oops.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-05 02:49:59	@BipolarBlogger @Lababup @lady_abs @aweebithopeful @bdogrunner had a properly recognisable hypo. It's all a learning curve at the moment!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-05 02:49:31	@BipolarBlogger @Lababup @lady_abs @aweebithopeful @bdogrunner as you, elated hypos. Still think I get mixed states though more, now I've..

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-05 02:44:10	@BipolarBlogger @Lababup @lady_abs @aweebithopeful @bdogrunner I'm still miserable, just productively miserable!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-05 02:43:50	@BipolarBlogger @Lababup @lady_abs @aweebithopeful @bdogrunner I'm fresh and new to diagnosis but reflection tells me no true hypomania.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-05 02:43:14	@BipolarBlogger @Lababup @lady_abs @aweebithopeful @bdogrunner This is interesting. I'm bipolar 2 and I think I only get mixed states.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-04 21:26:34	Don't feel sorry for #RolfHarris because he's an old man. He wasn't always an old man but he was always an abuser ruining others' lives.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-04 21:04:39	For the record, "jokes" about sexual abuse and/or rape? Never funny. Not ever. Not even ones about Rolf Harris. Engage a brain cell.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-04 20:36:31	Really disappointed the @NSPCC feel sentencing was fair for #RolfHarris Not long enough if you ask me, he's a serial offender.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-04 18:05:41	@lauramaywritten I most certainly have one! http:// attentionseekingsurvivor.wordpress.com /
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-04 18:04:34	Really feeling the new meds today, so tired and light headed and not with it. Can I be "normal" now?

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-02 16:43:48	So in two to three years I'll be discharged and she admitted I could well be worse off than I am now. MH services are a joke.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-02 16:43:07	18 month wait for time limited therapy which psychotherapist doesn't think will be enough for me given my history #cheerful
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-02 15:35:27	Well, what a two days I've had! Sick cat. #Bipolartwo diagnosis, psychotherapy assessment and today I start a mood stabiliser.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-01 05:34:46	@alibali50 @stevewebb1 New claims going through MR get NOTHING. Have to apply for JSA. Would be impossible for me to even get to a Jobcentre
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-07-01 04:55:03	@stevewebb1 Fewer appeals due to new mandatory considerations before appeal. Tory ministers happy to ignore suffering caused by #DWPchaos
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-30 06:29:58	I think Tuesday will mostly consist of me quietly thinking "I'm not a fucking lab rat!" while psych wonders what drug to try me on next.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-30 02:27:27	@RachelReevesMP My blog post on the process up to requesting a reconsideration. #DWPchaos http:// attentionseekingsurvivor.wordpress.com/2014/03/14/goi ng-on-the-sick-is-easy-pip-part-one/ …
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-30 02:22:07	@RachelReevesMP Now 7 months since I applied for ESA and have heard absolutely nothing, adds to MH problems #DWPchaos
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-30 02:21:06	@RachelReevesMP 9 months to PIP decision, assessed by physio for MH, showed in inaccurate ATOS report, successful reconsideration #DWPchaos
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-29 23:45:36	Good food that is almost as easy as a microwave meal, as long as I put it on early enough but infinitely better in every way!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-29 23:43:37	I used to adore cooking, baking, everything food related. Now it's all an uphill struggle so the slow cooker is an attempt at good food.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-29 23:42:58	In good news though, the chilli I chucked in my new slow cooker earlier smells really yummy! It's all about easy but tasty now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-29 23:37:01	The permanent exhaustion that seems to have taken over the last couple of weeks is beyond tedious. Always tired before but now it's awful.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-28 07:29:07	@DavidSandum This also leads to undervaluing the skills of those who do similar work. Always asked to make stuff for free when I'm well.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-28 07:27:34	@UnusualFactPage @Gees_gang Ah so I'm not mad, I'm just super clever!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-28 07:26:12	Also commented on a Guardian article because sometimes, I feel it's my duty to do my small bit for #MentalHealthAwareness beyond my blog.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-28 07:25:22	So today I made it to my sofa for the first time in a week AND cleaned the kitchen. Need a week to sleep off the excitement now! #spoonie
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-26 22:37:26	I did have a funny dream though. Dreamt my new venture was going to be a Spice Girls blog! I was never a big fan so this is very random!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-26 22:36:44	Falling back into bad habits with napping but I'm just so tired all the time again. It's also an escape when in such a low place #depression
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-26 18:46:52	Okay, I've ticked the boxes. Try to put it to the back of my mind until next week. Bleak form though.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-26 17:37:52	I mean, how can I have such a strong reaction to a letter telling me what I already know!? #mentalillness sucks big hairy ones.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-26 17:36:45	Confirmation letter of long known about psych appointment and CORE-OM questionnaire has made me feel sick this morning. I feel ridiculous.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-24 03:55:14	I seem to have sustained some sort of ankle/foot injury by doing absolutely nothing!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-24 01:07:22	Gosh, the traumatic dreams are becoming scarier. Had a naughty nap and got repaid by crying in my sleep. Fun.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-23 20:46:29	Sticking to my pdocs no napping rule is easier said than done when back in the hole and I've only had 4 hours of broken sleep!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-23 15:04:59	It hurt when I was 11 and dismissed and part of me regresses back to that betrayed child when someone calls me a liar now.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-23 15:04:08	Had a bit of light bulb moment this morning about why recent events got to me so much. It's the "L" word, no not lesbian. Liar.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-23 13:07:05	Morning! Keep thinking it's Tuesday for some reason. Feels like Tuesday doesn't it?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-23 04:15:17	@oxymoronic82 This has suddenly made me want to make macaroni cheese............
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-23 03:00:26	Considering asking someone who knows me to do a guest post on my blog. Don't know who would want to though or what they's write. Hmm.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-06-01 01:25:41	So, first time going through an airport with prescription medication soon. Should be interesting...........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-29 04:15:11	So I'm totally wrestling with the potential I have a more complex diagnosis in my future with 2 year therapy waits. #bleak
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-29 00:17:15	Shit balls. So I might be bipolar. This isn't the best news I've ever heard. #depression #bipolar

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 05:24:34	@Lala_Brownie What have I just seen!? It's a worrying mind that came up with that!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 04:57:33	@Lala_Brownie @ShitTats Paid deposit for my next tat the other day, maybe I'll change the design now I've seen this..........
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 04:35:13	It's 2 years since I last got out of London and even that was just for a 4 day weekender in Hemsby. I NEED A HOLIDAY!. Shame I can't afford!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 03:12:51	@Lala_Brownie I'll be damn lucky to make it to 40! Of course, I'm just faking all these invisible afflictions ;-)
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 03:11:37	Nothing is ever simple these days. It's quite ridiculous, that I'm aware of. Doesn't make it go away though!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 03:10:58	Light evenings are great for the SAD aspect of my #depression Not so wonderful for my anxiety around putting my rubbish out for collection.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 03:04:07	@Lala_Brownie I also get very sore hips when I sit certain ways for too long. Hidden pain is awful. You have my full sympathy.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 02:46:13	@Lala_Brownie If I work at my stool it's much worse and vacuuming really set it off a few weeks ago.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 02:45:42	@Lala_Brownie Last one was only a couple of days and mine comes and goes but I have a high pain tolerance apparently! Falling to bits!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 02:34:30	@Lala_Brownie I strained my hip flexor really badly because of dancing through the injury, lesson learned after expense of physio!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 02:33:46	@Lala_Brownie Not someone who has done 3 day course. A deep tissue massage will help to release all the muscles that will be compensating.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 02:32:46	@Lala_Brownie Pilates for sure. Yoga better when you've got a grounding of relief. Just make sure it's a properly qualified instructor.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 02:31:17	@Lala_Brownie I have also been told there are some great relieving exercises available via Google! Not tried yet myself.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 02:30:31	@Lala_Brownie It strengthens every single core supporting muscle in the back, which in itself is essential for back care.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 02:29:43	@Lala_Brownie So far no. I used to dance through it and now it's my wheat bag. Pilates though is brilliant for backs with a good instructor.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-08 02:16:56	@Lala_Brownie I have rediscovered my dance related sciatica recently. My word is it ever painful. Payback for how much I abused my body.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-07 05:27:05	@otrbristol After trying several I didn't think they were for me. Latest round has been a remarkable success. They have their place for some
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-07 05:15:39	Missed out on the last minute assessment. Bumped back to the bottom then. Still not much the wiser. Aren't NHS mental health serviced GREAT!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-07 05:14:07	Only found out as was offered last minute assessment and called confused. I'm under the care of two separate services. Who knew?! Not me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-07 05:13:16	Good news? I'm on the list for talking therapies, thought I wasn't. Bad news, I've been on it since September last year, still not assessed.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-05 19:06:54	This illness is quite the bugger isn't it! Bit like pin the tail on the donkey as to how you feel on any given day #depression
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-05 19:06:05	Got to stay focused on the positives and how far I've come in such a short time. I guess the rest will just take time.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-05 19:05:24	But I think I'm evening out now and the depression is settling back in, albeit to a lower degree. So frustrating.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-05 19:04:03	I really thought this was my turning point, think I was being overly optimistic. I still feel a million times better than a month ago.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-05 19:03:26	Where's all that energy and motivation I had the other week gone? Feeling deflated that it was so short lived. So much I want to do.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-05 02:44:48	Two showers in a week? Unprecedented. Alert Thames Water, my vanity is coming back!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-04 04:03:14	Giving him my life CV wasn't so much fun but the unpicking has to start somewhere. I enjoyed him refusing to call "him" my step father.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-04 04:01:50	I never imagined a drug would be able to lift me so much on its own without other interventions. Glimpses of much needed hope.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-04 04:01:01	Even my pdoc on Thursday couldn't get over what a dramatic difference there has been since he first saw me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-04 04:00:00	I was also told by a young girl I looked a bit like Red Riding Hood which made my day! Grown ups don't always appreciate my style so much...
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-04 03:59:03	Had a ruddy good day today, mooch in the local market, actually interacting with people and getting some sunshine.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-03 05:12:38	Guilt when I'm not functioning at all and guilt when I'm functioning enough to feel guilty. Pain in the arse is #depression !
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-03 05:11:36	does not support that theory at all. Working has always made me ill to a degree, need to deal with issues first. Yet still the guilt.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-03 05:10:42	I suddenly feel guilty because if I can leave the house and cook a meal I should surely stop sponging off the state? Track record......
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-05-03 05:09:42	So this is interesting. New guilt associated with feeling much better and not yet looking to go back to work, even though I'm not ready.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-30 20:50:17	Good night Bob Hoskins, a great loss of great talent.

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-21 03:39:03	Completely rearranged my lunge today. I do not recommend it as a relaxing Sunday past time. Tired and aching. Still, I think I like it!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-19 02:30:37	I need enabled or disabled over buying a KILLER vintage dress I have no occasion for. But it's really one of the best. And purple. KILLER!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-18 22:13:16	Managed to finally get a grip and go into the posh candle shop under my flat. Glad I did, divine lilac candle purchased and burning!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-16 19:56:50	It's amazing how much better I feel not being driven by misery to eat crap. Eating proper food makes such a difference in so many ways!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-15 04:31:18	These last two weeks have been genuinely freeing. I have glimpses of who I am again and I want that to last, I'm more than #depression
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-15 04:30:17	I think this week is the test week. I had a temporary (placebo?) effect on first anti-ds I ever took this time last year. Hoping it's more.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-14 00:26:25	Meanwhile I'll be over here, dealing with actual important shit, like getting over being abused and let down for 20 years and a breakdown.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-14 00:25:43	Then they could all join my family in calling me a liar and a lazy faking one at that. Yawn. Go find someone who cares to pick on.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-14 00:25:03	So is today the day I let slip and say JOKE! Actually, I've been swanning about London town all this time no problem! Happy as larry!

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-13 23:05:21	@Lala_Brownie Oh more than okay, it's sad they don't have better ways to use their energy. Hating people is energy sapping.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-13 22:31:14	@Lala_Brownie Probably reporting to the Facebook coven or trying to catch me out. Either way, go right ahead, if that's what fulfills you!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-13 22:23:36	@Lala_Brownie Today this Twitter. If I am that offensive and a faker report me to the DWP, don't bloody stalk me!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-13 22:22:53	@Lala_Brownie friends page. I unfriended them a little while ago. They followed my vintage blog the week following. Last week Linkedin.....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-13 22:22:03	@Lala_Brownie Just an old forumite who I was friends with on Facebook. They piled into the "milking the system" rabble on former shared....
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-13 22:20:49	Is this where I admit to being a faker and not mentally ill at all. It was all a ruse! I actually really enjoy never leaving my flat!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-13 22:19:15	Oh and said person also viewed my never used Linkedin. Really. What's so fascinating?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-13 22:17:56	In other news, did pilates today, first time since I fell in the black hole after my birthday in January and it felt good! Yay for me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-13 22:17:05	And so it continues. Remove someone from Facebook, follows both blogs and now Twitter. Am I really that interesting? Reporting findings?
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-10 02:50:33	The sweet satisfaction of getting storage stains out of a 70 year old dead stock dress. Etsy bargain win #vintagegirlproblems
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-09 04:11:24	Who knew I had it in me to be so productive in one day!? And on this day in particular, think Dad sent some happy down to me.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-09 00:00:30	20 years today my Dad took his life. However, it turns out I'm having a reasonably good day, trying to make him proud #suicide #loss
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-08 02:40:48	@Lala_Brownie Ach *blushes*
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-08 01:49:27	I was indifferent to Peaches Geldof but no child should be without parents and no-one should die at 25. Tragic all round.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-07 16:59:39	@Lala_Brownie Haha. OR they were just some really awesome vintage sunnies I had to have but I do hope they get an airing.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-07 13:09:57	@Lala_Brownie I'm okay. Did some sewing yesterday, first in months and someone berated me for buying sunnies on eBay and being a scrounger
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-07 05:59:40	Shattered. Good day followed by shitty kicking on Facebook and I'm too exhausted to sleep even with my meds. Roll on Monday and a new week.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-07 05:58:18	@oxymoronic82 Amen to that!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-07 05:28:13	Sometimes coming to my Twitter feed makes me feel less worthless. I'm not the only one struggling to live with untreated mental illness.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-04-02 00:45:04	Feeling so abnormally chipper I'm actually a bit bored today! BORED! Maybe these new meds are working #depression

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-03-20 08:02:55	Grant Schapps #torybingo spectacular working class missjudgement has really tickled me. Once I got over the horror that it was real.
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-03-19 21:37:44	Can tell that was a pre-election budget. All very bland and aimed at core Tory voters, businesses and pensioners #Budget2014
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-03-19 21:03:16	This welfare cap business. Surely it should be on basis of need? Especially with an aging population. Good old Tories #Budget2014

1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-02-27 22:09:49	But a physio thinks because I put on nice clothes for my assessment I'm just fine and dandy so go away with your request for PIP #WOWdebate
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-02-27 22:06:47	I am also sick of the Conservative need to blame Labour for everything. That was then, deal with now for once, grow a pair #WOWdebate
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-02-27 22:04:17	We'll just ignore the lack of eating properly, leaving my flat, cleaning myself and home? #WOWdebate Just need to pull myself together!
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-02-27 22:02:32	No change in attitude from DWP and Atos re: mental health. Apparently I look after myself just fine #WOWdebate
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-02-27 21:51:12	I have no family, can't live with others due to mental health. If policies leave me homeless shall I just find a bench? #WOWdebate
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-02-27 21:42:58	I have to get report from GP and pay for on my pittance income and due to HB changes risk losing my home when vulnerable #WOWdebate
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-02-27 21:42:12	I applied for ESA in November, no word back yet. Declined PIP after assessment by physio, having to ask for reconsideration #WOWdebate
1662859214	AtSeSu	2014-02-27 21:40:58	Turn out for the #WOWdebate is disgustingly low. This is what our MPs think of us.
